            <p eId="para_5">One of the developments that occurred in the aftermath of the Sullivan report was the establishment of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children.  The committee, which was chaired by Deputy O'Rourke, reported in September 2008 and recommended that legislation to deal with so-called soft information should be introduced as a matter of urgency.  Why has such legislation not yet been published?  What is the Government's intention in respect of the legislation?</p>
            <p eId="para_6">At the beginning of this year, the committee recommended that there should be a constitutional referendum on the rights of children and it published an agreed wording to be put to the people in such a referendum.  What is the Government's position regarding the holding of a referendum on the rights of children?</p>

            <p eId="para_9">The recommendations in the Sullivan report relate to the internal workings of the office itself and were designed to ensure that matters of a sensitive nature would be brought to the urgent attention of the Attorney General.  All of those recommendations are being implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_10">On the other matters to which the Deputy refers, I have outlined to the House on a number of occasions the position with regard to the proposal for a referendum on children's rights.  Work in that regard is continuing.  I understand that legislation relating to soft information is being dealt with by the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews.</p>

            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_11">The Taoiseach is well aware of the Taoiseach that must be followed with regard to the preparatory work that must be done to facilitate the holding of a referendum.  The all-party Oireachtas committee did its work well and its members, on all sides, agreed on a wording, which was forwarded to the Minister of State with responsibility for children.  There is a process with must be undergone when information of this nature arrives on a Minister's or Minister of State's desk.</p>

            <p eId="para_13">It relates to the holding of a referendum on children's rights, which emanated directly from the Sullivan report.  If the Ceann Comhairle has a difficulty with that, I am sure I could probably be of assistance to him.</p>
            <p eId="para_14">What stage has the work of the Minister of State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews, reached?  Does the Taoiseach envisage that the process involving the Minister of State to which I refer will be concluded before the House rises for the summer recess?  The latter will have a bearing on whether it will be possible to hold a referendum on children's rights this year.  I hope it will be possible to hold such a referendum.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">What is the current position with regard to vetting people who work with children?  It appears the HSE has placed some children with certain foster parents who have not been vetted.  That is intolerable, particularly when one considers what could happen.  Will the Taoiseach comment on that matter?</p>

            <p eId="para_16">The recommendations in the Sullivan report make no reference whatever to a constitutional referendum on children's rights.  Instead, they relate to risk assessment procedures, the co-ordination and allocation role of the advisory counsel, management of the office and information technology.  There is no reference whatsoever to the referendum on children's rights in the Sullivan report.  I have outlined to the House the progress in regard to that matter.  Specific questions that are the line responsibility of the Office of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs can be addressed there; I do not have the information to answer those questions.</p>

All of the supplementary information I will have in regard to this matter relates to the Sullivan report.</p>

            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_23">The Taoiseach will recall that the Sullivan report arose from a situation that developed when the Government had not been advised that a constitutional challenge had been taken by somebody who was convicted of child rape and was then released from prison.  That is my recall of the context in which it arose — the Government had not been informed of the constitutional challenge to the statutory rape law and the self-confessed child rapist was released from prison.  In the context of the Sullivan report, which was published in 2006, can the Taoiseach give us any sense of certainty that we will not face a similar situation again?  Can he, in whatever response he may have had prepared for this sequence of questions, give the House any assurance that we are not likely to see a recurrence of the situation that pertained to the Sullivan report in 2006?</p>
            <p eId="para_24">In regard to the centrality of the Office of the Attorney General to the Sullivan report and all that maintained leading up to it, does the Taoiseach accept there would be greater confidence in that office if there were greater transparency and openness in regard to its role?  Excepting the confidentiality relationship between the Attorney General and the Cabinet, does the Taoiseach agree there are matters on which the Attorney General advises that would allow for greater openness and contribute to a greater understanding in the first place, as well as a better acceptance of decision-making on the part of the Attorney General and the Government where confidentiality is not required?  As an example, the Taoiseach was not overly pleased about my questions at the time but this might apply in regard to my queries on the advices the Attorney General had given <i>vis-à-vis</i> the HSE and the reports on the deaths of children in State care.  That is just one example.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_17">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_25">The review conducted by Mr. Eddie Sullivan, former Secretary General in the public service section of the Department Finance, arose in the context of an information and notification deficit that occurred in the Attorney General's office over the handling of a particular judicial review case known as the CC case.  The case was first notified to the Attorney General's office in November 2002 by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor by way of a minute referring to the case listed on 16 December 2002 and requesting the nomination of counsel.  A declaration was sought in the CC case by way of judicial review that the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act 1935, section 1(1), was repugnant to the Constitution.  The respondents in these cases were Ireland, the Attorney General and the DPP.  The report sets out the background, explains what happened and gives the overview of the office.  It goes on to make certain recommendations regarding governance arrangements and so on.  All of the recommendations arising from that review are being implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_26">Regarding the question of transparency in respect of the Office of the Attorney General, the Attorney General's functions derive from the Constitution.  His position is described in Article 30 of the Constitution as the adviser of Government in matters of law and legal opinion.  The functions, powers and duties of the Attorney General are to be found in the Constitution, in legislation, primarily section 6 of the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 and in judicial decisions delivered prior and subsequent to the founding of the State.  The Attorney General is assisted by advisory counsel in the discharge of this wide range of functions.  The four principal legal functions carried out by the office as a whole may be summarised as the provision of legal advice, legislative drafting, the processing of litigation and conveyancing and other transactional services through the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</p>
            <p eId="para_27">In regard to the policy that applies, I am answerable for this in the House.  The Attorney General, in terms of legal advice, has the confidentiality of Cabinet.  It is important we respect his independence and that his advice is given based on the merits of the case.  It is a matter for Cabinet or Ministers to decide what they wish to do thereafter.  I believe there is transparency consistent with the Attorney General being allowed to carry out that independent role effectively.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_18">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_28">I have not had an opportunity to ensure certainty in terms of my point in this regard.  I understand the individual at the centre of the CC case went on to commit a further heinous act some years later, with tragic consequences for people.  The Taoiseach and I may differ on this.  If it is the case that there is no precedence in regard to the release of advices by the Attorney General, it becomes ever more difficult to argue the case.  The Taoiseach may or may not accept there is an element of questionable uncertainty or lack of confidence in the role of the Office of the Attorney General in regard to this and other matters.  I suggest that confidence could be restored if in certain situations where clearly there is not a serious confidentiality issue involved the advices could be made known and offered to Opposition parties and spokespeople as appropriate.  This would perhaps provide for a greater understanding of decisions taken by Cabinet and in regard to advices given by the Attorney General.</p>
            <p eId="para_29">Would the Taoiseach consider such a proposition and will he explore any merit in this regard in due course?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_19">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_30">The issue arose when the importance and sensitive nature of the case was not brought in a timely fashion to the attention of the Attorney General.  Therefore, the question that arises is not in regard to the merits of the advices subsequently provided by the Attorney General or advisory counsel but in regard to the timeliness in this regard based on the fact that the system did not respond in the way one would have expected when this important and sensitive case arose.  Amidst all this confusion, the matter went to court and was dealt with independently by the courts.  There were lessons to be learned for the future to avoid a recurrence of the set of circumstances in which this issue arose from the Attorney General's knowledge of the stage the case was at and what was being done on an operational basis regarding it.  This would have been one of hundreds of cases that would have been ongoing at any given time.  Lessons must be learned from that and it is to the credit of the office that all the recommendations outlined in the report are being implemented.  That is what the House would expect and I am glad to report that is the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_31">On the wider issue of where there are often different points of views about the merits or otherwise of the advices of any particular legal officer, any government can only rely on, and is constitutionally required to deal with, advices based on the Attorney General's advice.  Otherwise, one would get advices, and possibly contrary advices, from a range of people which would not necessary add to the coherence or understanding of the legal aspects of a particular decision that needed to be incorporated by Cabinet on a particular subject.</p>
            <p eId="para_32">There are good reasons for that being the case.  The independence of the Attorney General must be respected.  His office is not a political office in that sense.  He is a member of the Government but he retains that independent legal function.  It serves Government well to have it that way.  The matter for resolution in respect of advices he gives are resolved in the courts, not here.  The advices he gives, for example, on the preparation of legislation are discussed here.  There is good reason he is not brought to the centre of political controversy or debate and in that way politicisation of the office is avoided.</p>

            <p eId="para_37">I am satisfied that there are satisfactory procedures and facilities in place in my Department for the preservation and archiving of all records, whether in electronic or paper form or otherwise.</p>
            <p eId="para_38">My Department complies with the requirements of the National Archives Act 1986 which stipulates that all official records, regardless of their format, which are received or created by the Department of the Taoiseach must be preserved.</p>
            <p eId="para_39">Specifically with regard to the preservation of records held in electronic form, all members of staff in my Department are provided with the appropriate ICT facilities to create and manage these records as part of the Department's work support system.</p>
            <p eId="para_40">All electronic records are stored on the Department's storage area network on which every individual staff member and every section is allocated space.  The storage area network is backed up nightly with incremental back-ups, weekly with full back-ups that are stored for one month, monthly with full back-ups that are stored for at least 12 months and annually with full back-ups that are stored indefinitely.</p>
            <p eId="para_41">Each staff member also has an additional e-mail file.   They are backed-up and stored as above.

            <p eId="para_42">The National Archives Act lays down regulations as to how the storing of records is governed and empowers the National Archives to instruct State bodies on the storing of archives.  I understand there are currently clear regulations governing the storage of paper records but it appears there are no regulations governing the storage of electronic records.  The Taoiseach said that all the staff in his Department are enabled to do this.  I understand, and the Taoiseach can correct me if am wrong, that systems on which storage takes place today use the term "2007 system" and that such systems may well be inaccessible in 20 or 30 years' time.  Does what the Taoiseach referred to in his reply cover the putting of electronic information in a system that can be accessed or that it will be possible to transfer to a system whereby historians in the future can look up information contained in his Department?  Is that the case?  Is the Taoiseach satisfied that whatever information is in his Department, both in paper and electronic form, can be stored properly?  Under the National Archives Act, there is an entitlement to instruct State agencies to transfer electronic information to a system that will enable it to be accessed.  Did the Taoiseach in his reply confirm this to be the case, namely, that no information, either paper or electronic, will be lost for future years?</p>

            <p eId="para_43">As I said in my primary reply, we are in compliance with the Act, which, as the Deputy knows, is about preserving records for storage and subsequent release within the provisions of the Act.  The Department is complying with that, according to my information.</p>
            <p eId="para_44">The Department uses standard well-documented formats, such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, PDF and Lotus Notes for electronic documents and records.  Whenever system or database upgrades are performed checks are carried out to ensure that existing electronic documents and records remain accessible.  It is also standard practice in my Department to convert data in older formats to more up to date formats on an ongoing basis to preserve accessibility into the future.  For example, older documents created in Lotus Word Pro are converted into Microsoft Word format and older spreadsheets created in Lotus 123 are converted into Microsoft Excel format.  These are updated according as upgrades come on stream.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">The National Archives Act empowers the National Archives to instruct Departments and agencies to migrate information to systems that can be stored for the future.  Does the Taoiseach have any information about that?  Some Departments are not under an obligation to do so.  Letters came to public notice recently from the Famine period, for example.  I do not say these kinds of letters are in the Taoiseach's Department but in future years that information will be of interest to certain people and one would not want to lose it from our history.  Does the Taoiseach's brief contain any information regarding the implementation of the National Archives Act being carried through by other agencies and Departments where they are concerned?</p>
            <p eId="para_46">The National Archives advisory council has been dormant since 2007, when the last appointments ended.  Is it intended to reappoint a National Archives council, abolish it or merge it with some other entity whereby some person can reflect on the situation that applies in the National Archives?  There are obviously problems of storage and so on.</p>

            <p eId="para_47">The issue regarding the council mentioned by the Deputy is that the Government has indicated that the National Archives, the Irish Manuscripts Commission and the National Library of Ireland shall be merged into a new national library and archives of Ireland.  That merger will require amendment of the National Archives Act 1986 and the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997.  The Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport, Deputy Mary Hanafin, proposes to update the relevant archival legislation as part of that process.  The new draft legislation will abolish three separate existing bodies and establish a new body.  The initial draft of the legislation has been completed and transmitted to the directors of the National Archives and National Library and to the chairman of the Irish Manuscripts Commission for their observations.  It is intended to bring the legislation before the Houses this year and it is the Minister's intention to reappoint the council in a new guise in order to advise on the amalgamation process as soon as she has the observations of the directors and the chairman of the Irish Manuscripts Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_48">The Deputy asked whether any electronic data has been archived away from the Department's storage area network.  No data has been archived to date as there is sufficient capacity in the storage area network to accommodate all electronic records in my Department.  Until such time as standards and guidelines are available my Department will continue to retain electronic documents and records indefinitely.</p>

            <p eId="para_49">I thank the Taoiseach for the update on the merging of the National Library with the Irish Manuscripts Commission and the National Archives.  Some careful reflection is needed on the composition of that proposed body.  My question is in the context of the Irish Manuscripts Commission.  I understand a significant number of important and valuable Irish manuscripts are held in monasteries and other locations abroad.  We know the number and locations of these documents but many are beginning to seriously disintegrate.  They are a fundamental and valuable part of this country's heritage and history, and some are very aged.  It would be important for the authorities and owners of the locations where the manuscripts are held to be contacted either by the Department of the Taoiseach or the reformed entity as a matter of some urgency.</p>
            <p eId="para_50">The Taoiseach will recall a number of years ago when an exact facsimile of the Book of Kells was introduced and sold to locations around the world.  In these cases, the manuscripts are starting to disintegrate and will be beyond reprieve over time.  It is an issue for the country and the manuscripts involved are of exceptional importance to the country and the make-up of our history.  It would not do for them to be irrevocably lost.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_53">The State and the National Archives have considerable experience of the storage and retention of paper records and it is a credit to the Civil Service over the years that very good files have been retained, maintained and transferred to the National Archives, which has been very important for historians.</p>
            <p eId="para_54">We have considerably less experience of the retention and storage of electronic records and I appreciate that the Taoiseach has set out the way in which records are kept electronically and backed up.  What assurance do we have that these records will survive in electronic format and future historians, when they come to consider documents under the 30-year rule, will still have the range of material available to them as they have had up to now?</p>
            <p eId="para_55">I heard the Taoiseach's reply to Deputy Kenny with regard to the National Archives advisory council, which has not been in place since November 2007.  This kind of body is required now to advise on what is a major transition from paper to electronic record keeping.  I would have thought that it is at this time a body like that, particularly if it included technical expertise, which would be exactly what is required.  Is it not the case that the proposed merger of the National Archives, the National Library and the Irish Manuscripts Commission will make this position worse?  I do not understand how the merging of the National Archives and the National Library will improve the keeping of records and their retention.</p>
            <p eId="para_56">Regarding contemporary records, an issue arose when the Ryan report was published, in that material was available to the commission but not included in the report.  The records of the interviews and accounts given by victims of abuse should be retained, so can we have an assurance to this effect and that they will be available in the National Archives?</p>
            <p eId="para_57">Will the Taoiseach assure the House that the records being created in respect of NAMA will be retained for future reference?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_29">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_58">Under the legislation, the normal reporting mechanisms have been put in place regarding NAMA.  Obviously, the statutory requirements there will be adhered to in the normal way.</p>
            <p eId="para_59">On the matter raised by the Deputy about the Ryan report, I will have to check on the situation.  As he knows, the non-adversarial nature of the way in which people were able to bring their claims meant that statutory proofs were not required and people were not being convicted in that sense.  People who could prove that abuse existed <i>de facto</i> and that they were in attendance at those institutions proceeded to obtain compensation on that basis to avoid the adversarial court system.  I do not know what impact that process has on the extent to which that information can become more widely available.  I will have to check and get the details as to what is to happen in respect of that documentation and inform the Deputy accordingly.</p>
            <p eId="para_60">Regarding the earlier matter that the Deputy mentioned, the talk is that the council, as I understand it, will be appointed on the basis of the present consultation that is taking place between the three organisations.  Once she has those observations, she can look to the establishment of such a council.  I cannot say why it has not gone ahead.  Perhaps a direct question to the Minister concerned would derive more information as to the circumstances behind that.</p>
            <p eId="para_61">As to the question of electronic records being preserved and provided in the same way as paper files in the past, as I have said the whole purpose of the archives Act has been to impose an obligation on Departments of State to preserve records created and-or received in the course of performing official functions, to seek authorisation from the director of the National Archives prior to the destruction of any of those records and, from among its record holdings, to transfer to the National Archives those records worthy of permanent preservation because of their ongoing value for administrative and historical research purposes when the records are 30 years old so that they can be made available for public inspection and research use.  The Act applies to all records of Departments of State regardless of the format, so it is an obligation.  As I outlined in the previous answers to the question, I can confirm that my Department, in discharging its responsibilities as a Department of State, is meeting those requirements, including on electronic data.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_30">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_62">Regarding my question on the NAMA records and with respect, the Taoiseach is making a great presumption to the effect they will be maintained in a format capable of being available under the National Archives Act 1986.  Has the Department of Finance or the Government given an instruction that the records relating to NAMA are to be preserved and made available in the course of time?  If that direction has not been given, can we have an assurance that it will be?</p>
            <p eId="para_63">Regarding the retention of records by Departments, the National Archives Act was introduced in 1986 at a time when information technology as we know it now was in its infancy.  That was a quarter of a century ago.  Has any audit been carried out on the adequacy of the way in which records are being retained to ensure that they will be available for the archive?  Records have traditionally been available in paper form, but much more material is stored today in electronic format, and the kind of note that might be written on the margin of a paper by a civil servant is now more likely to be in an e-mail.  Such records are essential for future historians.  Has there been any auditing or any kind of check done by someone with competence in this area to assure us that the records are being maintained?  The Taoiseach has said it appears that it is largely at the discretion of individual Departments as to what records should be kept.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_31">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_64">I was making the general point that there is normal reporting mechanisms to the Houses of the Oireachtas in respect of the operations of NAMA.  The banking laws that apply in this case apply as they do in respect of any banking transactions.  Obviously, I cannot give any commitment that all this will come under the National Archives Act.  I do not think that was intended at the time.  The accountability arrangements for the National Asset Management Agency are in place under statute and we will abide by them.</p>
            <p eId="para_65">Given the increased use of information technology across Departments, it is anticipated that the volume of digital material eligible for transfer to the National Archives will increase substantially in the coming years.  This is one of the biggest challenges that national archives around the world will face in future.  Section 19(3) of the National Archives Act 1986 provides that the Minister for Finance may make regulations, after a consultation with the director of the National Archives, for the proper management and preservation of departmental records.  This power is similar but not identical to the power of the Minister for Finance under section 15(5) of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 to make regulations, after consultation with the Information Commissioner and the director of the National Archives, providing for the management and maintenance of records held by public bodies.  That is an area that could be examined profitably to deal with this changing trend.</p>

          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_32">
            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_66">Much of what I had wanted to ask on the archives advisory council has already been put to the Taoiseach.  He has told us about the review under way on how this will be presented in a new format with other areas of related interest.  He mentioned the National Library.  We are gone almost three years now without the council, and given the significant challenge to the safe storage and maintenance of archival material — both paper and electronic — is there not a reason to expedite a decision on the new arrangements that will apply?</p>
            <p eId="para_67">The last time we asked these questions, the Taoiseach indicated to me that a Bill would be brought forward following the determination of the type of advisory council that would emerge.  Does he have any idea when the current considerations will conclude?  When will we see that legislation so that we can look at the terms of references for a new archives advisory council, by whatever name or format?  I presume no legislation is under preparation because no decision on the future format of all of this has been taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_68">With regard to the various Departments, and high volume paper usage Departments in particular, are different regimes in place for the retention of files material?  Is there a period of time after which they are normally disposed of?  Is there a blanket retention?  Is the Taoiseach in a position to give any sense of whether different arrangements apply to high volume paper usage Departments, such as the Departments of Health and Children and Social Protection?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_71">The National Archives Act sets out the obligations on Departments to preserve records that are received or created in the course of performing official functions.  One can then seek authorisation from the director of the National Archives prior to the destruction of any of these records.  In other words, not all records <i>per se</i> must be archived and maintained, for obvious reasons.  One can transfer to the national archives those records worthy of permanent preservation because of their ongoing value for administrative and historical research purposes when the records are 30 years old so they can be made available for public inspection and research use.  There is an obligation to retain records and one has an opportunity to obtain the consent of the director of the archives to destroy records.  There is also a requirement to transfer after 30 years those records that are relevant for historical research or other administrative reasons.</p>
            <p eId="para_72">With respect to the management and preservation of electronic records, it is important to understand that while records in the past have been predominantly in hard copy format, time has not been as critical a factor in their preservation.  The advent of electronic records has meant that it is not possible to wait until 30 years from creation to take measures to ensure preservation.  By their nature, electronic records are more vulnerable to loss in the short term because of the nature of their composition.  This brings into sharp relief the question of procedures to manage and preserve electronic records, preferably from the point of creation.  Like all Departments, the Department has procedures in place to ensure the backing up and protection of electronic records created.  The point to be made is that the question of regulations, and whether the Minister for Finance should in consultation with the director of the national archives for the proper management and preservation of departmental records provide for such regulations, is a matter for consideration at any time.  The growing volume and trend of electronic storage of data may well require that something needs to be done.</p>

        <b>Deputy Simon Coveney</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources</b>
          the way he intends the facilitate the rollout of a commercial digital terrestrial television platform here in view of the break down of the tendering process in recent weeks.

          </question>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_36" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_74">Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides for the development of digital terrestrial television, DTT, in Ireland and for the closure of the national analogue TV network.  In addition, the 2009 Act requires the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, to provide for the development of commercial digital terrestrial television services.</p>
            <p eId="para_75">As the Deputy is aware a competition for a commercial DTT service provider was initiated by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland in 2008.  Three applicants were shortlisted.  In July 2008, the BCI announced its intention to enter into negotiations with Boxer DTT Limited, the highest placed consortium.  Boxer withdrew from the process in April 2009.  As a result, negotiations commenced with the next placed bidder, the OneVision consortium.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">In April 2010, BAI withdrew the contract offer from OneVision as that consortium was unable to reach agreement with the network operator, RTÉNL for the provision of transmission services.    Following this, the BAI offered the contract to the third place consortium, Easy TV in May but, as the Deputy is aware, that consortium declined the offer.</p>
            <p eId="para_77">I regret that the BAI process did not result in a commercial DTT operator as it would have delivered additional consumer choice.  As a result of the outcome of the BAI's commercial DTT process, I am in detailed discussions with the BAI, ComReg and RTE to consider the broadcasting, telecommunications and spectrum policy issues that arise.  Meanwhile, it is important to note that commercial DTT is not essential to provide for analogue switch-off.  It is the transition from free-to-air analogue to free-to-air digital that will yield the digital dividend.  RTE's plans for the national DTT service are advancing.</p>
            <p eId="para_78">In this regard, I signed an order, SI 85 of 2010, under section 129 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 requiring RTE to launch its DTT service to approximately 90% of the population by 31 October 2010.  RTE advises me that it is on target to meet this date.  The 2009 Act also requires RTE to provide the full national digital service by the end of 2011 or such date as I may specify.  I have informed RTE that the date for the provision of a full national digital terrestrial television service is 31 December 2011.  In conjunction with this, the memorandum of understanding I signed earlier this year with the United Kingdom will facilitate co-ordination around the roll-out of digital terrestrial television and analogue switch-off with Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_79">I would like to set out clearly today that we will be switching off our analogue system in the final quarter of 2012.  I look forward to that event and the ability it gives us to get other broadband services and other service up and running, in particular across rural Ireland.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_37">
            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
            <p eId="para_80">This is an issue we have been raising for about 15 months, ever since Boxer DTT Limited pulled out of the tendering process.  People have been warning the Minister that this fiasco was likely to happen.  The proposition for DTT in Ireland was that a commercial operator would provide channels on four of six multiplexes and that RTE would provide free-to-air channels on two of the multiplexes, providing eight to ten channels.  The infrastructure to facilitate all of that was to be paid for by RTE and on the back of that it would get a revenue stream from a commercial DTT operator.  That process has now collapsed.</p>
            <p eId="para_81">I want to ask the Minister a number of specific questions.  First, I agree with him that the focus must now be to ensure that we meet our legal obligations under the targets which have been set for analogue switch-off.  If that means leaving a potential commercial operator for the current time then so be it.  What is the Minister's Department doing now to prepare the approximately 1 million people who receive their television service on an RTE analogue platform at the current time for the arrival of digital terrestrial television within 18 months?  Some 22% of households or 32% of televisions are affected.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_38" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_82">We are progressing.  We are starting the DTT service in October 2010, which is a crucial time.  It will take time to test it and get it right before it is fully launched in a public way, that is, where we are pushing and selling it to the public.  We are now on a tight time line.  That gives us two and a half years from now before we switch off.  It will be tight to get public awareness campaigns in place in order to inform people how it happens.  Crucially, we have to first get the DTT service up and running.  We had a series of meetings today and last week with RTE, the BAI and ComReg and we have set out a project management course, in terms of getting set top box regulations in place and clarity around which standards should be in place and what channels we will put on our public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_83">When they are up and running we will engage in the very serious job of letting the Irish public know how it will be able to switch over.  It is a two and a half year project.  I very much regret that we were not able to get a commercial operator up and running, but given that we have not done so it is incumbent on us now to get our digital terrestrial service up and running, to let the Irish public know that and to see a whole range of enhanced services on it, such as higher definition television.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_39">
            <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
            <p eId="para_84">It is important that the Minister recognises that even though he is talking about DTT being made available from October 2010 onwards, the reality is that nobody will be accessing it from October.  We do not even have set top boxes.  We do not know what they will look like, how much they will cost, who will make them, who will provide them or who will install them.  There is total uncertainty around how we can access digital television.  Even though RTE has to have the infrastructure and capacity to broadcast digital terrestrial television from October to, potentially, 90% of the population, none of the 1 million or so people who will need to have DTT installed in their homes, ready to go by the time analogue switch-off happens, will have it in October.  Let us not pretend that they will.  At best, they will potentially have it in the first quarter of next year.  Would the Minister agree with me on that?</p>
            <p eId="para_85">My final question concerns the cost of all of this.  Is the Minister satisfied that RTE has already spent €40 million putting in place an infrastructure which it thought it would get a revenue stream from?  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but I understand that it has a commitment to spend another €30 million.  How does the Minister propose that be funded?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_40" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_86">The Deputy is correct; we start in October and it will take a number of months to get it technically correct, have all the standards in place and make sure the set top boxes work before it is properly launched widely to the public, although it will be available from October.  I am told that set top boxes and other kit is ready to go.  We needed clarity on that, and it was unfortunate we could not have it as the commercial bidding process was in train.  As soon as that came to an end I brought in RTE, the BAI and ComReg.  I set up a working group for us to get the technical standards and other arrangements in place in order that we will have digital terrestrial television in the autumn and we will meet, with absolute certainty, our switch-off schedule which is the end of 2012.  We have until then to get the Irish public ready for the switch over.</p>
            <p eId="para_87">In terms of the €40 million cost, costs are incurred.  There are certain advantages if there is a not a full six mix solution; I would prefer if there was one but if there is not some of the transmission costs and technical arrangements are easier with just a public service offering.  Crucially, the economic benefit to the State from us switching off our analogue system is a multiple of that cost, in terms of the new transition system.  There is an initial cost to RTE but in the long run there is a real benefit for the country, in terms of switching on a digital system and switching off our analogue system, and RTE is aware of that.</p>

          the discussions he has had in relation to making the Six Nations and Heineken Cup rugby matches free to air for television viewers here; the outcome of these discussions; if he has met with the Irish Rugby Football Union; the way he will address their concerns; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_89">The audiovisual media services directive provides that member states of the European Union may designate sporting and cultural events of major importance to society as free-to-air.  Many member states have listed such events as free-to-air including Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Italy and the United Kingdom.  Ireland drew up the current list in 2003 under the Broadcasting Act 1999.  The Broadcasting Act 2009, having transposed the audiovisual media services directive, sets down the statutory process for designating events free-to-air.  Section 162 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides that I may, by order, designate events of major importance to society in order that a qualifying broadcaster has the right to provide coverage on free television services in the public interest and determine whether coverage of a designated event should be available on a live or deferred basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_90">The Broadcasting Act also requires that I conduct a review of designated events every three years.  This review was initiated with a preliminary public consultation in 2009, during which submissions were invited from members of the public, the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport and all other interested parties on the existing list of designated events and the possible designation of additional events.  During this stage submissions were received from a large number of members of the public, broadcasters, several sporting organisations, including the IRFU, and from the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">Following a review of the submissions received and an analysis of the criteria for listing events, I published a list of additional events which I considered suitable for designation.  The proposed events in Gaelic games are the provincial finals, the senior football and hurling championships and the all-Ireland championship senior football and hurling quarter-finals and semi-finals.  In rugby, it is proposed to move from deferred coverage to live coverage of Ireland's games in the Six Nations rugby football championship and live coverage of the European Rugby Cup qualifiers, that is, the pre-quarter final stages, the quarter finals, the semi-finals and final when an Irish team is participating.  In horse racing, the Cheltenham Festival would be included.</p>
            <p eId="para_92">My proposals were noted by the Government and, as set out in the Broadcasting Act, I have asked for submissions from a range of people.</p>
            <p eId="para_93">Additional information not given on floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_94">In particular, I must consult the organisers of the events that I intend to designate; consult with broadcasters; publish a notice of the events that I intend to designate and invite comments on the intended designation from members of the public; consult with the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport; and lay a draft of the order designating events before each House of the Oireachtas for approval.  This is the statutory process that is now under way and the public consultation period will end on 4 July 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_95">Since the publication of the list, I have had a number of meetings with interested parties to discuss their concerns, including the IRFU and representatives of the ERC and Six Nations.  I have met a number of Members of this House in recent weeks and representatives of Sky Ireland and BSkyB.  I am also due to meet representatives of the GAA shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_96">My final decision on the matter will also be informed by an independent analysis of the financial and other impacts of listing each event.  My Department is currently finalising a tender for an independent consultant to prepare such a report and I expect this to be published on the e-tenders website by the end of this week.  The terms of reference of this report will involve consideration of submissions received under the consultative process now under way.</p>

            <p eId="para_97">My question specifically referred to the Six Nations and the Heineken Cup, which the Minister intended to make free-to-air for Irish audiences.  It appears he has since rowed back from his position because he is now saying that he has an open mind.</p>
            <p eId="para_98">I would be grateful if he could set out the exact Government position because Ministers appear to hold conflicting views.  In my opinion, this is a good idea but it has been badly thought out, if it was thought out at all.  Is it the case, for example, that the former Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Martin Cullen, was strongly opposed to the proposal?  What is the position of the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport?  Sitting on the fence will not help anybody but I take it that she has made a submission on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_99">When the Taoiseach spoke about a common sense approach, he was interpreted as referring to the Six Nations but not the Heineken Cup.  Is that what is meant by "common sense approach"?</p>

            <p eId="para_100">I think we should take a common sense approach to everything we do.   I was interested to learn that Deputy McManus supports the proposal to make the Heineken Cup and the Six Nations free-to-air.</p>
            <p eId="para_101">This process allows people to set out their views and to take account of different arguments.  It is set out on a statutory basis.  We started one year ago by putting the matter out for public consultation and we received a range of submissions.  I, as Minister, then issued a list of suggestions regarding which events should be broadcast on a designated free-to-air basis and, having considered these suggestions, designated certain events.  These designated events are subject to a further period of consultation so that people can have their say before we go to Europe to get approval and give the decision a legal basis which will require broadcasters' compliance.  The process is based on consultation and I look forward to everyone's involvement.  The involvement of this House is particularly important and I welcome that Deputies on all sides hold differing views.</p>

            <p eId="para_102">We should not rewrite history.  The Minister had his period of consultation but it seems that he listened most closely to his son.  I do not argue with that but he did not work out his position.  When he announced his intention to designate at the end of what appeared to be a consultation period, all hell broke lose and he is now trying to dress up the process to make it seem as if he is beginning again.  He said that he intended to designate and I understand this comes after taking advice from the then Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, although he still has not addressed that question.  The then Minister was opposed to it.  What is the position of the current Minister?  Does she support the proposal?  If the Minister, Deputy Ryan, cannot persuade his colleagues in government, he is on a hiding to nothing.</p>
            <p eId="para_103">What efforts have been made to investigate the cost of this proposal to the IRFU?  I do not usually defend the IRFU, although I think rugby is a wonderful sport, but it is struggling at present.  In terms of commercial resources, it is down approximately €560,000 because of the recession and reduced advertising revenue.  However, when the Minister announced his proposal, he blithely claimed it would be able to make up the difference, whether it is €10 million or €12 million.  That is irresponsible policy development.</p>

            <p eId="para_147">We are committed to ensuring that microgeneration works and we have demonstrated his commitment by a series of delivered measures, including changes to planning regulations to make it easier for people to construct microgeneration facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_148">The grant scheme is being considered by Sustainable Energy Ireland to ensure we get the standards right and avoid an industry developing on poor standards which does not take off in the long run.  Between 12 and 18 months ago, the ESB, encouraged by me, agreed to introduce a price of up to 19 cent.  Previously, one could not even sell back into the system.</p>
            <p eId="para_149">When progress is not being made as fast as I would like, we will test the scheme and introduce a revised one.  I will do my best to get the scheme right before introducing it.  The scheme is not yet right because this is a technical and complex matter.  We are committed, however, to adding further measures to those we have consistently introduced over the past three years.</p>

This also occurred in the case of the so-called one stop shop for broadband which has been totally remodelled.  Those involved in the micro-generation industry are concerned that a new scheme will not be introduced before the summer.  The livelihoods of people who have invested in micro-generation industries, whether wind turbines, micro-CHP or other technologies, are on the line.  They made investments on the back of assurances provided by the Minister that he would establish a new support scheme, whether one modelled on the scheme implemented and working in Britain or the scheme implemented in Germany.  I ask the Minister to provide certainty as to when the new and necessary measures will be introduced.  We cannot keep an industry hanging on forever.  Its financial position precludes it.</p>

We stated we would start on a smaller scale of micro-generation, of up to 11 kW, before introducing a further scheme.  At each stage, I indicated we would take a phased approach which would take time and require a series of different measures to be introduced, rather than introducing a big bang change.</p>

The policy paper was developed in accordance with various key principles, which are crucial to the development of the market, including competition, at platform and service levels, which drives innovation and investment; investment certainty for service providers considering investing in network infrastructure; investment intervention by Government to bridge any digital divide in cases of market failure and to meet some of the State's own communication needs; and appropriate regulation.  The policy paper also sets out a number of specific actions to support these principles.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">It commits to providing access to State owned infrastructure where possible and appropriate.  An important step in delivering on this commitment is the Communications Regulation (Premium Rate Services and Electronic Communications Infrastructure) Act 2010, which provides that the National Roads Authority is the single point of contact for access to ducts on motorways and other national roads.  The NRA is exploring how best to develop this new business and I very much welcome this development as an example of what I set out to achieve in facilitating open access to State owned ducting.</p>
          <p eId="para_157">Our commitment to universal access will also be fulfilled this year.  The national broadband scheme will ensure that broadband services are available throughout Ireland by the end of this year.  However, even after the full roll-out of the national broadband scheme there will be a small percentage of premises outside these areas that will have persistent difficulty in obtaining a broadband service, primarily due to technical and locational reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">Having secured funding for rural broadband under the European economic recovery plan, my Department is developing a new measure under the rural development plan to address the issue of basic broadband availability in remaining unserved rural premises outside of the NBS areas.  State aid approval has been granted by the European Commission and it is intended to commence the scheme later this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_159">Project Kelvin is delivering continued high speed connectivity for Ireland.  This is a collaborative North-South project with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Belfast, which has brought a transatlantic submarine telecoms cable ashore in the north-west and which will improve the speed and capacity of communications links to North America.  The Kelvin project is expected to be completed by July 2010 and international connectivity in the locations with a Kelvin point of presence should be fully operational by then.</p>
          <p eId="para_160">In addition to these actions 78 schools will have 100 mbps broadband connectivity available to them for the beginning of the next academic year in September.  This project, sponsored by my Department and the Department of Education and Skills, will demonstrate how high speed broadband and advanced ICT equipment can greatly enhance the learning and teaching environment in schools.  This Government has also committed to rolling out this project to all second level schools by 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_161">Additional information not provided on the floor of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">Our policy approach has facilitated significant progress in broadband roll out and broadband speeds over recent years.  There is now a competitive market across a range of platforms offering ever increasing levels of broadband speeds.  For example, Ireland has over 1.443 million broadband subscribers and our broadband <i>per capita</i> penetration rate is 32.4%.  Internationally, Ireland ranks 11th of the EU 27 for <i>per capita</i> broadband penetration, fourth for mobile only penetration and 14th for fixed broadband penetration.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">Of the homes with broadband connections, 68.4% of them, and 72.8% of SMEs with broadband connections, are using broadband speeds of between 2 mbps and 10 mbps.  We must build on the progress made to date with a particular focus on facilitating investment in next generations networks.  In this context my Department and I liaise with industry participants and ComReg on an ongoing basis and these discussions encompass all matters relating to broadband infrastructure development including investment in next generations networks.  I have made it clear on a number of occasions that I favour a collaborative approach by the industry to broadband investment.</p>

          <p eId="para_164">The question relates specifically to fibre to homes and businesses.  While I welcome projects such as the Kelvin project, I am trying to ascertain what the Minister and his Department are doing to try to replace the copper into homes with fibre.  In the policy paper of June 2009, to which he referred, the Minister gave a commitment to move towards open access to all ducting, as has been done successfully in France, for example, not only State owned ducting owned by the National Roads Authority.  Where stands the Minister's commitment to regulate to ensure there is open access to ducting that can carry fibre optic cable?</p>

          <p eId="para_165">In the past year, significant improvements have been, particularly by Eircom, the incumbent provider, in moving towards a more open access network.  Eircom has fundamentally changed its business approach and is genuinely fighting to secure wholesale business.  The regulator has also set standards in terms of pricing and introduced regulations on wholesale access.  We have had a genuine change of approach towards a more open access system from the main fixed line telecoms operator.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">On the important question as to what one does to deliver fibre to business and homes, I did not mention the initiative to have 100 megabit connectivity to schools.  We are not technologically biased.  Provided high speed access is available, it could be done by fibre, fixed wireless or other means.</p>

The policy direction I have given, as set out in the paper to which the Deputy referred, is to support investment in next generation networks and provide for more open access and more wholesale markets.

A ComReg survey of businesses last year showed that approximately 92% of the businesses questioned had Internet access.  Some three quarters said they were satisfied with the speeds they had and half of them had speeds in excess of 10 megabit.  We should not be satisfied with that.

I compliment the Department on the work that has been done in rehabilitating the tailings ponds, which has been a wonderful job and a success story for the community in the locality.  However, there are five mining sites left: Shallee; Garryard; Gorteenadiha; Ballygowan; and Magcobar.  A recent report by the EPA and Geological Survey of Ireland found that the waste left in those is categorised as grade 1, which means it contains high concentrations of metals.  This matter needs to be dealt with urgently.  I am asking the Minister of State to provide the funding as initially outlined in order to allow that work to proceed next year and the year after.</p>

            <p eId="para_184">Clearly if there was not a recession I would be delighted to fund this.  However, obviously we need to work in the confines of the budgetary and Estimates process.  Therefore I cannot give the Deputy the commitment he seeks except to say that I will push hard in the context of those Estimates discussions to proceed with many of the mine remediation projects on our books at the moment.  The work done to date has been €9 million well spent.  I went to the area recently and met local interest groups.  We will try to continue with the good work that has been done to date.

The job is only half done and it is very important that the remaining half gets done.  The remainder needs to be done, namely the work on the Kilmastulla river and the Yellow river to allow sediment and the mine waste from the six sites I mentioned to be treated urgently, otherwise the €9 million that was spent, which as the Minister of State has said represented good value, will be wasted.  We need agricultural activity to be allowed to return to normal in those areas.  This is a forewarning that we will cajole, prod, push and do whatever we need to do to get the remaining funding to complete that job.</p>

There has been extensive consultation and there will continue to be.  I have met its representatives subsequently as part of this next phase and I look forward to talking to them further.  This is what one does in a consultation phase.  One listens, talks and makes one's case sharing one's views and arguments.  If Deputies opposite have those, I am very interested and willing to hear them.  We should be asking if these matches are of cultural significance.  Is there a special importance in watching the Irish team or one's province?  Is it better for sport in the long run to have a large fan base and audience or a smaller one?  That is an issue we should be debating.</p>
            <p eId="para_201">Let us get into the details of the broadcast rights and revenues.  As it is entitled to do the IRFU has stated it would lose €12 million.  However, is that on the basis that one could not see the Irish team except on a pay-per-view basis?  As I see it, that is the case because the vast majority of broadcasting rights currently come from watching the Irish team in the Six-Nations matches.  Do we agree with that?  Do we want Ireland's matches to be on free-to-air television or not?  Those are the detailed debates we should have here to aid the process.  The Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport will not engage in the process in writing to me.  We will engage in the way that is set out in the law as part of the process.

A formal letter was sent by the previous Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  This was not something at the Cabinet table; it was a formal letter sent to the Minister about an issue in which he was engaged.  In that letter, the former Minister, Mr. Martin Cullen, said that he was opposed to what the Minister was doing.  Unless there is an updated letter from the Department, one can only presume that is still the position of the Department responsible for sport.  If that is not the case, I ask the Minister to tell us what the position is.  Otherwise we must presume, as evidenced in the letter, that the Minister does not have the support of the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_203">I ask the Minister to deal with two other related issues.  On Newstalk the Minister stated on, I believe, 24 May, that he would appoint an independent expert.

We hope to issue an e-tender document by the end of this week to appoint a consultant who will take regard of the submissions that are made.  Sometimes these are complex issues on which we would like outside advice.  I hope to have the consultant appointed quickly and to move quickly towards the end of the consultation process and produce a report and presentation which I will bring to Government and Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_207">The UK Government is involved in a similar process to us and is considering bringing cricket back from being a pay-per-view sport to being a free-to-air broadcast.  It also proposes to do the same with the Six Nations tournament within Wales.  It is engaged in a process and has consultants examining the situation.  It is useful to have this comparison.  The David Davies report, to which the Deputy referred, provides interesting background material in terms of the implications for broadcasters and sports.  The French Government includes the Heineken Cup in its free-to-air broadcasts when the French team is playing in the final and it includes Six Nations rugby.  Therefore, what we are doing fits in with a common pattern across other European countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_215">Perhaps we should try to get some answers to our questions.  I would like confirmation with regard to the Minister's response to my previous question.  He said the last time he met the IRFU on this issue was last November.  Six months later he deemed it appropriate to announce that he was going to ensure free-to-air coverage for Heineken Cup and Six Nations rugby.  That is the ideal scenario, if he can make it happen and ensure the IRFU keeps its funding base.  Will he confirm it was last November when he met the IRFU?  If so, it is a disgrace.  It is a disgrace he would not meet the body responsible for developing rugby here before making his announcement.  It is extraordinary.</p>
            <p eId="para_216">Will the Minister acknowledge that the funding of international professional rugby in Ireland is very different from the funding of other international and domestic sports?  It is not legitimate to compare what happens in France to what is being done in Ireland because of the fact that Ireland gets most of its revenue from advertising in Britain and France.  That is how the deal works for Ireland.  We get a totally disproportionate amount of broadcasting rights money because of the way in which Six Nations and Heineken Cup rugby is negotiated collectively and the revenue is then split six-ways.  The Minister should accept this.  Finally, is the Minister's position the Government's position?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" eId="spk_129" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan</from>
            <p eId="para_217">I met the IRFU again about two weeks ago, after the announcement.  This is the proper process.  The process is that the Minister sets out and then consults.  That is what we set out to do in legislation.  I met the IRFU previously and will meet it again.  I have a particular regard for the sport and for the success the IRFU has had in developing rugby here.  It has done a professional job in developing professional rugby here.  I am committed to that and want to see the Irish team being successful.</p>
            <p eId="para_218">On the issue of rights, Deputy Coveney's position seems to be that he wants to keep the Six Nations team — we will discuss the Heineken Cup separately — on free-to-air.  The figures are public on this so I will not breach any commercial sensitivities by mentioning them.  Broadcasting the Six Nations free-to-air accounts for at least €10 million of the some €14 million or so revenue the IRFU gets from broadcasting rights.  The Deputy is correct in that much of that accrues from the English or other markets where we get back more than we might pay for the rights just for Ireland.  Nothing in what I am doing or suggesting would interfere in any way with rights in the UK or other countries or with the rights of Sky or Setanta or any other broadcaster to be able to provide coverage on a pay-to-view basis here.  My proposal merely states that we would make it available also on a free-to-air basis because the experience is when it is not free-to-air, we lose at least four fifths of our audience.  This is important on a public policy basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_219">It is for this reason that we would get consultants to consider all the arrangements and ensure our proposal is sound and will not distort the market.  I do not see how, when we have no intention of distorting anything that goes on in the UK or France, we are distorting the market.  All we are concerned about is the Irish public and viewers rights without in any way favouring one broadcaster over another, because I do not have any intention of not having it available on a pay-to-view basis, the broadcasters of which do an excellent job.</p>

With regard to the independent expert, would the Minister not have been better advised to get this advice before he made his announcement, which seems to have been poorly thought out and does not deal with the shortfall in funding for the IRFU?  The Minister seems to have ignored the issue of the shortfall and seems surprised this announcement has blown up in his face.  The Minister has met with the IRFU and is aware of the financial difficulties he has created and, as far as I can gather, suggests the shortfall can be made up in other ways.  If that is the case, would the Minister, for example, be willing to guarantee that shortfall on the basis that he is confident it can be made up in other ways?</p>

            <p eId="para_221">We have gone backwards and forwards on this in the Department over the past year.  We have consulted the Attorney General's office and have examined what happens internationally and here.  It is a multi-phased process where one starts off by listening to the general public and other submissions and then publishes the Department's view of what designated events should be included.  Then a final decision is made.  This has been noted by Government and I have gone through the Government on each stage.  I am a Minister setting out the Government's approach.</p>

The Deputy said I have created a shortfall in funding.  There was no intention to do that and that is not in any way the truth.  With regard to broadcasting rights, which is the only area where this decision has a possible effect, the bulk of the funding comes from rights for the coverage of Six Nations rugby.  I understand that funding is guaranteed for the next three years.  The contract already in place for revenues from the BBC and RTE provides the bulk of the revenue.  Therefore, no matter what we do, even in the next three years, it does not interfere in or change the majority of broadcasting funding.  There is no intention to do that.  As has been made clear on several occasions, the Government has provided significant support and huge resources to the sport.  In return, is it not right that we ensure that events and games that have an effect of pulling the country together should be on view for everybody?  That is the question we need to ask.</p>

It is not good to have uncertainty or for matters of this nature to be unduly delayed.  As well as being brought to Government, this matter will also have to be submitted to the European Commission for approval.  The latter will be obliged to ensure that what we intend meets the standards laid set down in the audio-visual media services directive.  I hope to obtain clarity on the matter by autumn.  It takes a certain period for issues of this nature to be dealt with at European level.</p>

However, will the Minister outline his views on the putting together of an effective new support scheme for microgeneration?  Will he indicate whether his Department intends to model any new scheme on what is being done in the UK, which essentially involves having a relatively low export tariff but a strong support system in order to encourage people to produce their own power, or in Germany, where a generous export tariff is supplied in respect of excess power that can be sold back to the grid but where fewer supports are provided in respect of producing one's own power?  From a Fine Gael perspective, the British approach would appear to be more appropriate to Ireland.  It would be useful if the Minister could indicate the direction in which his Department intends to move.</p>

            <p eId="para_243">In the first instance, we must move above the 11 KW range into higher scale categories.  In addition, we must broaden out the debate to consider whether geothermal or other technologies should be included under the scheme.  I am of the view that the price supports should be much higher for smaller producers than for their larger counterparts because the economies of scale that apply and the nature of this technology means that larger devices tend to be much more efficient and the economic case is, therefore, much stronger.  Some form of upward grading scale that would support smaller units to a much more significant degree than their larger counterparts is one option that would be suitable.</p>
            <p eId="para_244">The new scheme should also be simple in nature.  We must move away from a grant-based model towards one that is relatively cheap and easy to implement.  A REFIT price system that would build on what we have already done in this area would be acceptable.  The scheme must apply to all producers.  It cannot just relate to the ESB, which is the only producer to date to step up to the plate in the context of giving a higher price.</p>
            <p eId="para_245">Whether the British model or that which obtains in Germany will be adopted is one of the matters we intend to consider.  The Deputy's views in that regard will be taken into account.</p>

My preference would be not to have to seek such clearance.  However, there may not be an easy of avoiding such an eventuality.

          <p eId="para_253">The Government is extremely unhappy with regard to the situation that has developed.  I and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, have already made clear our condemnation of yesterday's attack by Israeli military personnel upon the humanitarian flotilla sailing towards Gaza.  These actions, which resulted in at least nine people being killed and approximately 30 being injured, were completely disproportionate and unacceptable.  It is clear that the incident took place in international waters.  The legal basis for the action of the Israelis is at the very least open to serious question.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">Ireland fully supports the many calls which have been made by the international community for the holding of a full, independent and impartial inquiry, preferably under UN auspices, into the events of yesterday and the circumstances surrounding them.  Earlier today, the UN Security Council added its voice to calls for a prompt, impartial, credible and transparent investigation conforming to international standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">The Government's immediate priority is to secure consular access to those Irish citizens unjustly detained by Israel and bring about their unconditional release.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs met the Israeli ambassador yesterday evening and impressed these points upon him.  This morning, Ireland's ambassador in Tel Aviv, met two of those detained, Shane Dillon and Isam Ben Ali.  Mr. Dillon is due to be deported back to Ireland today.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">The Government has also formally requested that the Israeli Government allow the Irish-owned ship, the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i>, currently sailing towards Gaza to be allowed to complete its journey unimpeded and to discharge its humanitarian cargo in Gaza.  Yesterday’s events can be directly attributed to the ongoing and completely unacceptable blockade of Gaza which has been in place for some three years.  It is imperative that Israel now takes immediate action to end this blockade and to open up the border crossings into Gaza to normal commercial and humanitarian traffic.  International opinion on Gaza is increasingly coming into line with Ireland’s long-standing position that the blockade is immoral and counterproductive and should be ended.  The European Union yesterday referred to the blockade as “unacceptable and politically counterproductive”, while the UN Security Council has stressed that the current situation in Gaza is simply not sustainable.  Israel must listen and respond to the clear concerns of the international community on this issue.  To do otherwise will only serve to reinforce the position of the extremists on both sides and jeopardise the hope of achieving urgently needed political progress in the region which the current proximity talks represent.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">The position is that our ambassador has made consular contact with two of those detained.  We call for the immediate and unconditional release of the remainder; we call for the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i> to be allowed to proceed unimpeded in order to bring its humanitarian cargo to Gaza; and we call on the Israeli Government to respond properly and appropriately to the UN Security Council’s statement on this matter.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_157">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_258">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply and I support his comments.  Last April I led a delegation of party members to the West Bank and Gaza where we saw for ourselves the destruction of buildings, streets and towns some five months after the invasion by Israel.  We saw the symbol of international investment in Gaza, the American International School, blown to pieces.  The school caretaker approached me to say he had found body parts of his son who was looking after the building on the night in question.  This is a matter of serious international politics and we do not have time to deal with all the detail here.  Suffice to say, I listened to the response from the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, but I have not yet heard any comment from the United States Secretary of State, Ms Clinton, the EU's special envoy to the Middle East, Mr. Tony Blair, or the United States special envoy, Mr. George Mitchell.  The fact that nine were killed and 30 injured and that Irish citizens could have been involved in a tragic incident places us in a central position in this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">It is important to understand that, as this happened in international waters, as the incident occurred after the commandos attacked and boarded the ship in question.  This has been deemed to be an act of outrageous aggression on the high seas and was completely unwarranted and uncalled for.  In many ways, it represents the first real test of the Lisbon treaty which the Irish people endorsed so strongly last year.  It means, for instance, that Europe is now challenged to offer a comprehensive, co-ordinated and definite response to an international incident within its remit.  The European Union recently agreed, without objection, to Israel's admission to the OECD; we now need a European response to the international illegal blockade of Gaza.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">I hope the Taoiseach, as the political leader of our country, will see to it that at the meeting of the Heads of Government in June there is a specific time set aside for a discussion on this matter and that there is a specific requirement for a decision by Europe in respect of its obligations and responsibilities under the Lisbon treaty to give a co-ordinated and comprehensive foreign policy response to an international incident that has occurred on our doorsteps.  I support that strongly.  For my part, I have written to all the Heads of Government of the European People's Party stressing the importance of this matter internationally as well as the sensitivity for us of a situation where Irish citizens have been kidnapped and abducted and whose whereabouts are uncertain.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_262">Are there are any actions the Government proposes to take here at home in so far as relations with Israel are concerned?  Is it the Taoiseach's intention actively to seek the support of his colleague Prime Ministers at the June meeting for a definite co-ordinated response from Europe, as is our entitlement and our responsibility in facing a very serious international incident that occurred on the high seas, which directly impacted upon a number of Irish citizens and could have had the most tragic consequences for families in this country?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_160">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_263">We do not have to wait for a European Council meeting to have this matter resolved.  We are calling for the immediate and unconditional release of our citizens who are being detained by Israel.  We call on Israel to respect its international obligations under the Vienna Convention.  We want to ensure full consular access by Irish Embassy officials to those detained — that is still not available to us and we are calling for it to be done immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Israel does not have a leg to stand on in terms of denying us access to our citizens or denying their immediate and unconditional release.  We have a situation where those citizens have been brought to Gaza by Israeli authorities who are asking them to sign papers agreeing to their deportation.  They are entitled to be released unconditionally and immediately.  We are also calling for absolute restraint to be shown in respect of the Irish-owned vessel, the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i>, so that it can complete its journey peacefully and discharge its humanitarian cargo in Gaza upon arrival.  We are also calling for the immediate establishment of a full independent and international inquiry into yesterday’s events, preferably under UN auspices.  That is our position, and international opinion must continue to impress upon Israel that these actions must be taken if justice is to be seen to be done in this case.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_161">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_265">As the Taoiseach has said, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs has set out, the Government has made a very strong statement on this matter, and the Labour Party supports that strong position.  We specifically support the demand for the safe passage of the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i>, the unconditional release of those detained and the establishment of a full independent and international inquiry into the killings that took place on the flotilla.  One of the issues that has become clear over the years is that the Government of Israel seems to be very often immune to strong international calls, demands by the United Nations and United Nations resolutions.  The blockade of Gaza itself is not legal but there seems to be an attitude on the part of the Government of Israel when issues like this arise that it will simply weather the storm and ignore international opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">What actions has the Government considered in the event of the Government of Israel ignoring the calls the Taoiseach has rightly made in respect of the safe passage of the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i>, the unconditional release of those who have been detained and the establishment of a full independent and international inquiry?  Has the Government given any thought to what action will need to be taken if the Government of Israel does not comply with those calls made by the Government and the governments of other countries?  Has the Taoiseach given any consideration, for example, to withdrawing of the Irish ambassador from Israel for consultation, a course of action I understand is being considered by other European countries?  Has the Government been in contact with any of the other members states, in particular the High Representative on Foreign Affairs of the European Union with regard to action being taken on a co-ordinated basis by the European Union in the event that the Government of Israel persists in the course of action it appears to be taking and of it ignoring the call made on it by the Irish Government, a call supported right across the political spectrum in this country and by the Governments of other countries and the EU?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_162">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_267">The first obligation of the Government is to ensure Irish citizens engaged in participating in the flotilla are released from detention and are not being subjected to deportation but are allowed unconditionally to return to this country.  We believe the presence of our diplomatic personnel in Israel provides us with better prospects of this happening sooner rather than later.  I make the point that any harm caused to any of our citizens will have the most serious consequences.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_163">
          <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_268">I am glad to hear that response from the Taoiseach.  The Labour Party will support the Government in communicating that to the Government of Israel in the strongest possible terms.  The Israeli ambassador was called in.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will inform the House of the message that was given to the Israeli ambassador, the response given by the ambassador and if any response has been given by the Israeli Government to the position taken by the Irish Government and other European Union states.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_164">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_269">Reportage on this matter accurately reflects the discussion which the Minister for Foreign Affairs had with the ambassador of Israel to Ireland.  We set out our position and the ambassador set out his position.  The Minister further made known our opposition in a subsequent briefing with the press.  I have indicated in previous replies the points amplified by the Minister to the ambassador in regard to the safety of our citizens, their immediate and unconditional release, the need for the Israeli Government to respect its international obligations under the Vienna convention in this respect, Ireland's support of the call for a full independent and international inquiry into yesterday's events, preferably under UN auspices and our condemnation of the actions by the military as completely unacceptable and disproportionate and stemming directly from the illegal Israeli blockade of Gaza, which the Minister and Government have repeatedly urged should be ended.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">The position is as I stated yesterday.  I state this on behalf of a Government that has been, in the wider context of trying to resolve this issue in the Middle East, acknowledging the right for peaceful co-existence for the State of Israel and for the establishment of a viable Palestinian state.  It is hugely important that international law is respected in this situation.  International law is not in this situation being respected.  The idea that one could board the vessel in international waters on the basis of being in compliance with international law owing to such being an act of self defence is not supported by the facts.</p>

          <p eId="para_272">It is important that the international legal requirements of the situation are respected.  What the Minister and I are concentrating on, and what the people of Ireland will expect us to concentrate on in this instance, is representing our citizens unambiguously and forcefully based on the situation in which they now find themselves.  I believe that Israel would be best advised, in the interests of standing and of resolving this aspect of the matter, to immediately arrange for their unconditional release and to accede to an international inquiry given the seriousness of the outcome of what has happened there.</p>

          <p eId="para_300">Obviously, I do not agree with the Deputy's suggestion.  We are giving statutory expression to a practice already in place in regard to the jobseeker's allowance, both in respect of the requirement to take up an offer of suitable employment and the payment of a reduced rate of jobseeker's allowance or supplementary welfare allowance for claimants who refuse to participate in an appropriate course of training and to participate in a programme under the national employment action plan.  Currently, there is a nine-week disqualification of a payment where a person refuses to participate in an appropriate course or training.  The Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill provides for the payment of a reduced rate should that take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">On the question of the one-parent family payment, I point out again to the Deputy that a paper on this matter produced in 2006 examined how to assist lone parents to re-engage with the labour market.  There will be a six-year tapered phasing out period of the payment for existing recipients.  New applicants for the payment will be the parents of new born babies and those people will not affected until 2024, when the child reaches his or her 13th birthday.  To suggest that this provision involves an imminent change is not correct.  It is about trying to work with those who represent lone parents in this area, assist them, reduce dependency and try to provide more options for people in this position to return to the labour market.</p>

The Government is putting an extra €2 billion into Anglo Irish Bank at a time when the Government is now turning to social welfare recipients and others to make contributions to the cuts.

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_317">To answer Deputy Burton's point, the report of the Governor of the Central Bank arrived last night.  The Minister for Finance has to read it, consider it and bring it to Government in the normal way.  I made the point that we should use the days ahead for the purposes of preparing draft terms of reference in order that we can make all that information available, including the publication of the reports, and the committee can consider all this, as was agreed in the motion when we set up the banking inquiry process.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">I also wish to assure the House it is the intention of the Government to set up that commission of investigation within the envisaged timeframe, arising out of the terms of reference and the discussions that will take place thereafter.  We set a timeframe of six months maximum in which that commission should conduct its inquiries and investigations arising from those terms of reference and will return to the House at that stage.  The Government's bona fides in this matter is the same as it has always been.  We will arrange for these things to be done.  The process by which we are going about this is probably the right way to do it.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">I refer to the matter of the €2 billion, the increase in the promissory note from €8.3 billion to €10.3 billion.  When the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, made his statement regarding recapitalisation of the banks he stated that of the order of a further €10 billion, based on estimates at that stage, was envisaged for the recapitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  If people are saying that the €2 billion should not be paid in, or that we should not meet the capital ratios set by the Financial Regulator, that would mean an immediate wind-down of the bank and providing a fire sale for that bank's assets with a probable loss of €40 billion and another €70 billion to cover deposits.  If people think that is a cheap option maybe they should add up the figures, with the guts of €70 billion — $90 billion on one side, and, on the other, what has to be done at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">The Government is dealing with the situation by trying to minimise, to the greatest extent possible, the exposure of the taxpayer.  This development was consistent with the statement the Minister, Deputy Lenihan, read out in March when he came to the House.  These are the facts of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">As things stand, the deficit is composed in the main of the gap — of the order of €18 billion — between expenditure and revenues while the cost in terms of the promissory note and the commitment we made regarding Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide is of the order of €1.1 billion.  That is until 2011.  As Deputies know, the promissory note is about instalments regarding the payment of these moneys so that we can try to manage the situation——</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_406">deplores the loss of life which occurred when the Free Gaza flotilla was intercepted at sea by Israeli military forces on 31 May;</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_411">calls upon the Israeli authorities to allow the Irish-owned vessel the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i> to continue unhindered its voyage to Gaza, and allow it to deliver its humanitarian cargo there;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_412">notes the Government's intention to take further diplomatic actions if such calls are ignored; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_413">supports the consistent demand of the Government for an end to the illegal Israeli blockade of Gaza, which has led directly to these tragic events.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">I thank all the Opposition spokespersons for their co-operation and work on this agreed motion.  The Government shares the widespread shock and horror at the outcome of the Israeli military storming of the Free Gaza movement flotilla yesterday, which has resulted in the death of a reported ten people and the injury of many more.  I share the sense of outrage that what was intended as a humanitarian act — and was itself a response to unacceptable policies on the part of Israel — should have ended up this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">I begin by expressing our condolences to the families of those who have been killed and our best wishes to all those who have been injured for a speedy recovery.  In the early hours of yesterday morning Israeli naval vessels intercepted the Free Gaza flotilla in international waters between Cyprus and Israel and informed the six vessels in the convoy that they would not be allowed to proceed further towards Gaza, ordering them to proceed to the Israeli port of Ashdod.  The exact details of what followed have yet to emerge, not least because only the Israeli account has really been heard.  Following the boarding by Israeli commandos of the largest vessel, the Turkish <i>MV Mavi Marmara, </i>firing by the commandos resulted in ten persons on board the boat being killed and a larger number wounded.  The vessels arrived in Ashdod yesterday afternoon and the injured were taken to various Israeli hospitals.  I again express my condemnation of the physical force methods used by the Israeli military in dealing with this situation, which I believe cannot be justified.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">The House would wish to be updated on the position of Irish citizens, which is our first concern in the immediate circumstances.  The vessel owned by the Irish Free Gaza movement, the <i>MV Rachel Corrie, </i>which sailed from Dundalk in mid-May, and on which a number of Irish citizens embarked, had not yet reached the eastern Mediterranean and was not part ofyesterday’s flotilla.  The <i>Rachel Corrie </i>is still at sea and understood to be continuing towards Gaza.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">Four Irish citizens were known to be on the <i>Challenger </i>/, which was intercepted and taken into Ashdod.  Three Irish citizens were aboard another vessel, and one further citizen, a dual national, was reported as having possibly joined the flotilla among the large Turkish contingent but this has not been confirmed and may not be correct.  Of the seven confirmed Irish involved, two were taken to Ben Gurion Airport, having signed declarations agreeing to immediate deportation and are awaiting deportation today.  They were visited this morning by Ambassador O’Reilly and their families have been informed.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">The other five were being processed for detention prior to later deportation and were taken to a detention centre in Beersheva, as part of some 600 or more persons detained on the ships.  As I came to the House, I received a report that representatives from the Irish Embassy had managed to make a consular visit to these citizens and my Department is now passing this information on to their families. I will receive a fuller report later.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">There was an early report on one Israeli television channel that the injured included one Irish person, and this was later repeated by various media; some Deputies may have seen this.  We do not have any information to confirm this and inquiries by the embassy to the hospitals treating the injured have been negative.  We do not have any reason to believe that there is an Irish person among the injured.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">On receipt of the emerging news of the tragic events of yesterday morning, I made a statement condemning what happened and I summoned the Israeli ambassador to a meeting at my Department yesterday evening.  When I met the ambassador I conveyed a number of very important points to him, which he has conveyed to his Government.  First, I conveyed the Irish Government's condemnation of the use of military force in this fashion against the flotilla, which was unacceptable and which had led to this tragedy.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">It will be some time before we have a clearer picture of what happened but I have made the strong point to the ambassador, similarly to what I said at the time of the assault on Gaza in January 2009, that when excessive military force is used among civilians we cannot expect to control all the outcomes, and we must accept responsibility for the results of the actions.  Who now could possibly argue that preventing this cargo from reaching Gaza was so important that an outcome such as this could be thought to be reasonable force?</p>
          <p eId="para_422">I further made clear that all of the Irish citizens involved should be immediately and unconditionally released.  At that time, I was also angry at reports that full consular access was not being allowed to our embassy, as provided for under the Vienna Convention, and I demanded such access immediately for those citizens in detention.  As I reported earlier, the embassy has now seen all those we are aware of and will maintain contact until they are released.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">I made clear to the ambassador my strong view that these citizens were constrained to enter Israel, which was not their intention, and that therefore questions of illegal entry should not arise.  I understand that under Israeli law a person cannot be deported without a three-day period in which to appeal, and that in order to leave immediately they have to sign a waiver of this right to appeal.  This may be a necessary technicality but there should be no question of having to admit guilt of illegal entry.  Irish citizens were effectively seized by the Israeli forces and forcefully brought into Israel against their will.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">I took issue with the description by the deputy foreign Minister of Israel of the flotilla as "an armada of hate and violence".  We know the Irish activists involved to be sincere, committed people, with deep humanitarian convictions and concerns, who were committed to breaking the blockade of Gaza but in a peaceful, non-violent way.  Some Members of the Oireachtas had been with them and intended to join the flotilla.  It is compounding one injustice with another to try to brand such people as somehow being terrorist fellow-travellers.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_426">Deputies will be aware from my earlier remarks that uppermost in my thoughts now is the progress of the ship that sailed from Ireland, the <i>Rachel Corrie, </i>on which a number of Irish citizens are continuing towards Gaza. It is thought that she might be approaching Gazan waters in the next number of days.  I asked Ambassador Evrony to convey to the Israeli Government my request that, following the tragedy which has occurred, the <i>Rachel Corrie </i>be allowed to continue unimpeded and to deliver its cargo to Gaza.  I have just spoken in the past hour with the former UN senior official, Denis Halliday, who is one of the Irish citizens aboard the <i>Rachel Corrie.  </i>We will be watching this issue very closely — as willthe world — and it is imperative that Israel avoid any action which leads to furtherbloodshed.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">I have focused on the position of Irish citizens and on the immediate events but I am also deeply conscious of the wider context.  I find that issues I have been raising since the Gaza war last year have come to the fore again.  Israel must be brought to understand that military force is genuinely a last resort, not to be used if any other method is available.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">It has been said in Israel that, when one has a hammer, every problem tends to look like a nail.  Israel has a right to exist and to defend itself, as we would all accept, but that right does not override and supersede all other rights and the rights of all others.  As we saw in Gaza, so now we see in respect of an effort to help Gaza.  When one resorts to the powerful use of force, especially among civilians, terrible disasters such as this are not unexpected or unforeseeable — they are highly likely, sooner or later, usually sooner.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">In international dialogue, I have been stressing a central issue, namely, the continuing blockade of Gaza cannot be accepted as part of the <i>status quo</i> and allowed to continue indefinitely.  As the Taoiseach stated yesterday, public opinion in Ireland and elsewhere has shown that it will not accept this collective punishment of innocent people and will act to challenge it.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">From my visit to Gaza earlier this year, I know that what exists there is a dire and indisputable humanitarian crisis, with most of the population living in inhumane and intolerable conditions and with an increasing incidence of what the UN euphemistically calls absolute poverty.  The situation amounts to collective punishment of the population of Gaza and, as the EU acknowledged yesterday, is completely counterproductive.  As long as the siege of Gaza continues, it will inflict further injustice on the people who live there without contributing at all to the security of Israel.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">We are still gathering the basic facts of what occurred.  There is much more I could say, particularly on the broader context.  I will be following events closely and considering what further action we need to take nationally or at EU or UN level.  Debates are ongoing as we speak in Brussels and at the Human Rights Council in Geneva.  The Security Council in New York has already called in a presidential statement for an "impartial, credible and transparent investigation, conforming to international standards" of what has happened, a call that I fully support and echo.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">The week before last, I reported to the House that I would soon be deciding what action to take on the issue of the use of forged Irish passports in the assassination of Mr. Mabhouh in Dubai.  I am anxious that this important matter be given the attention and focus it merits and that it not become mixed up with the events we are now discussing.  It remains my intention to propose to the Government shortly the action I believe appropriate in this case.</p>

          <p eId="para_435">There is no disagreement between the Government and the Fine Gael Party on this issue.  We condemn the actions by Israeli forces against an international humanitarian mission yesterday, 31 May, that resulted in the unnecessary loss of life.  The international flotilla of six vessels — two cargo ships, a cruise liner and three yachts — carrying 10,000 tonnes of aid left Cyprus on Sunday and was expected to reach the coast yesterday.  The ensuing incident, which occurred in international waters, was a completely disproportionate response to an international humanitarian aid mission.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">There are three imperatives, those being, the immediacy of securing the safe return of Irish citizens illegally detained on the high seas, the immediacy of dealing with the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i>, which is approaching Gazan waters as we speak, and the requirement for a European response to the blockade by Israel of Gaza.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">The <i>MV</i>
                        <i> Rachel Corri</i>e, which set sail from Dundalk, has five Irish nationals and five Malaysians aboard and is due to reach Gazan waters tomorrow.  I note the Minister’s comments on speaking with Mr. Denis Halliday, an Irish citizen aboard the ship, and I support the Minister’s call to allow the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i> to reach Gaza so that its cargo can provide for the humanitarian and medical requirements of the Gazan people.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Yesterday, I wrote to my colleagues in the European People's Party who are in government and sought their support for the call for an immediate international independent inquiry into yesterday's events and the actions taken.  Deputy Timmins, our spokesman on foreign affairs, immediately requested that an emergency meeting of the foreign affairs committee take place to discuss this matter and that the Israeli ambassador and the Palestinian representative to Ireland should attend.  I understand the meeting will be held on Thursday, 4 June.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">Fine Gael supports the side of humanity and legality.  We want an immediate end to the Israeli blockade of Gaza, the construction of the wall on the West Bank and the extension of settlements, an end to Hamas's rocket attacks and a facilitation of humanitarian assistance through border crossings.  We want both sides to comply with UN Resolution 1860.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">Our policy on the Israel-Palestine conflict is based on four clear pillars, which I have outlined in the House umpteen times.  They are a two-state solution, a return to the 1967 borders unless amended by agreement between the parties, an agreed solution to the issue of Palestinian refugees who fled or left their homes in 1948 and 1967 and Israel to cease settlement activities and dismantle all outposts erected since March 2001.  To achieve this, all Palestinians must cease all acts of violence and commit to peace.  Fine Gael recognises Israel's right to protect its citizens from attack, but in doing so it should act within international law.  I deplore the killing by the Israeli defence forces of innocent men, women and children.  I deplore the rocket attacks by Hamas.  From this remove, it would appear that both sides have broken the Geneva Convention and international law.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">UNWRA does a magnificent job in Gaza and those involved in many agencies put their lives on the line defending the victims of conflict.  Last year, Deputies Timmins, Breen and Shatter and I visited Gaza, the West Bank and Israel where I saw at first hand the situation on the ground.  There is no difference between the opinion of Fine Gael and that of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  We support the Government's motion.  The House speaks for the Irish people.  This is a matter of singular international political import.  Our citizens, wishing to provide humanitarian aid, found themselves at the centre of an incident involving deaths on international waters because the Israeli defence forces attacked a ship.  It was unnecessary and over the top.  The deaths in the resultant international incident are of the most serious political import.  I hope the resolution of the House will be taken seriously by the Israeli Government and that it will be communicated in strong and clear terms by the Taoiseach and the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">Of immediate concern is the safety of our citizens and their return home.  A second issue is that of the <i>Rachel Corrie</i>.  The third issue with which we must deal is that of a European response, as is our entitlement under the Lisbon treaty, to a co-ordinated and comprehensive decision on the illegal blockade of Gaza by the Government of Israel.</p>

          <from>Deputy Billy Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_443">Fine Gael supports the motion.  The action was terrible and Fine Gael condemns it in the strongest manner.  The killing of individuals seeking to bring humanitarian aid to Gaza was a deplorable act and we extend our sympathies to those families who have suffered bereavement, to the colleagues of the people murdered and to the wounded and their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">The root cause of the issue is the treatment by Israel of the Palestinian people over a number of generations.  Time and again, an explosive issue puts the focus on the problem, we wring our hands and we move on until the next deplorable act.  Meanwhile, people are living under siege in Gaza.  The treatment of the Palestinians is best manifested by what is occurring in Gaza.  Those of us who have visited Gaza and seen what is going on there at first hand could not condone it by any manner or means.  There is no justification for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">Often, Israeli spokespersons roll out the issue of Hamas in Gaza to muddy the waters.  The treatment of Palestinians in the West Bank is equally deplorable, in that a community is being strangled by a mechanism that involves road blocks, the construction of a wall and the development of settlements and the sole aim of which is to make the economic function of the Palestinians dysfunctional.  The mechanism is succeeding.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Before we visited Gaza, we were briefed by members of the Kennesit.  Knowingly or otherwise, what they told us was untrue.  They spoke about the targeted attack on members of Hamas.  We saw evidence of that when we went to Gaza, but we also saw the destruction of the industrial base of Gaza in the last days of Operation Cast Lead, as well as the destruction of its intellectual base with the blowing up of the American international school.  It was clear that it was not a case of trying to take out terrorists, but trying to annihilate a race of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">The main problem is the failure of the Israeli Government to make its security forces answerable to it.  Historically, there seems to be a seamless division between Israeli Government policy and the actions of its military.  The most important part of the Government's motion today is the inquiry.  We want to know who decided on this course of action.  Was it the Minister for Defence, Ehud Barak, who was Prime Minister during Operation Cast Lead?  I understand that major military actions in Israel have to get the operational go ahead from the Minister for Defence.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The Turkish Government — probably the only Islamic friend that Israel has — requested the Israeli Government to let the <i>MV Mavi Marmara</i> through to Gaza.  The Turkish Government did not expect people on that boat to respond in the way that they may have done when Israeli troops landed on it.  When the Israeli troops landed on the ship, I am sure they did not expect to respond in the manner that they did.  I am not exonerating them from blame.  While the incident was horrific and has to be condemned, the core issue is in respect of the actions beforehand by the Israeli Government and its response to what actually happened.  If the Israeli Government stated that this was an operation that went tragically wrong, apologised and sought to mend its ways, we would not have the outcry that has occurred across the globe.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">We want to see the release of the Irish citizens, as outlined by the Minister and Deputy Kenny.  We also want to see the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i> allowed to offload its supplies in Gaza.  If there was no blockade in Gaza, then we would not have this difficulty.  This talk about letting supplies into Gaza is completely untrue.  Not even the very minimum requirements get through to Gaza.  Israeli policy is cultivating difficulty with itself in the future and it is also feeding those terrorist groups on the ground who control the economic daily life of what is happening in Gaza.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Deputy Kenny has outlined our policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which is to work for a two-state solution, a return to the pre-1967 borders, a recognition of the rights of the refugees of 1948 and 1967, a cessation of the rocket attacks, the free movement of people in Gaza and a deconstruction of the settlements that have been built since March 2001.  I believe that the policy of every political party across the country and across the EU is the same, yet there seems to be so much division.  The difficulty is with what we can do about it.  America is hamstrung due to its historical ties to Israel, so we cannot take our moral leadership from that country.  Germany is one of the main drivers of European policy in the EU but its "hands off" approach to Israel creates a difficulty for the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">What measures can we take as a small country?  If we are relying on Europe or America to make our decisions for us, then we will not succeed because the US and the EU wash their hands and move on from what they see as an intractable problem.  The new President of the US has sought to do something about this but he has received very little support from his colleagues in Congress.  I do not know if he will be able to do anything.  We are dealing with an Israeli Government that is more conservative and hard line than any in recent Israeli history.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">We can do three things.  We can consider withdrawing the Irish ambassador from Tel Aviv and expelling the Israeli ambassador.  We can also seek to restrict trade agreements.  We have condemned time and again, but the time may be slowly approaching where we have got to look at taking one of these actions if Israel does not change its approach.  We cannot be present in this Chamber next year or in 20 years' time talking about the plight of the Palestinians.  If the approach of Israel does not change, we have to examine the idea of carrying out some action.  What is morally right might then supersede economic self-interest because it is very difficult to stand by and do nothing when we see the plight of Palestinian children.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Terrorist groups such as Hamas and associated groups must mend their ways and recognise the right of Israel to exist.  Peaceful co-existance will only happen if we have direct talks between Israel and the Palestinians.  The Israeli approach has left the PLO out on a limb and undermined its authority over the last few years.  The PLO was the voice of reason for the Palestinians.  The Israelis did not assist them, and Hamas grew as a result.  Something more terrible than Hamas will soon grow if Israel does not mend its ways.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_289">
          <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_454">On behalf of the Labour Party I am happy to support this motion.  I would like to state the consistent position of the Labour Party on the blockade of Gaza.  It is illegal.  It is not only illegal but the efforts made to frustrate the breaking of the blockade in international waters are themselves illegal actions.  What is at stake in our discussion is the status of international law and maritime law.  Our own credibility is also at stake.  We have made many speeches about the Middle East and the position of Gaza.  However, we have reached a turning point this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">There is a set of conditions laid down in this motion that has been agreed by all parties in this House.  If the principle of international inspection is not acceded to, if the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i>, which has no Hamas members aboard and no guns aboard and the cargo of which has been inspected, is impeded under international law, if Irish citizens are illegally arrested and moved to a port or to a destination to which they had no intention of reaching, then that is illegality piled upon illegality.  It will fall to us to take action.  That action should ideally be in concert with other member states of the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">I support the Minister and have consistently supported his use of the phrase "collective punishment".  I do so very carefully.  Article 33 of the Fourth Geneva Convention provides, <i>inter alia</i>, that “No protected person may be punished for an offence he or she has not personally committed.  Collective penalties and likewise all measures of intimidation or of  terrorism are prohibited”.  That is the position in international law.  When we looked at Operation Cast Lead, which lead to so many deaths, there was always a requirement to draw a distinction between military action and the position of civilians.  That was not respected.  Not only should the principle of distinction have been enforced but the principle of proportional action on what were regarded as military targets should also have been enforced.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">There are other considerations far beyond these, such as the destruction of civilian infrastructure.  An example of this was the knocking out of an ice-cream factory a few hundred meters from inside the border in Gaza.  Basic electricity installations necessary for sewerage were interfered with.  Water facilities and mills used for the provision of flour were also knocked out.  The destruction involved gave no recognition to the principles of civilian distinction or proportionality or to international law.  There was then the succeeding notion that one could install a blockade against the principles of international law and seek to punish an entire population.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">I visited Gaza for the first time in the 1980s.  I was there in 2005, a few weeks after the withdrawal of Israel, with Andreas van Agt, the former Dutch Prime Minister, and others.  I was also there on the most recent visit by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs.  On that occasion we saw children playing on top of piles of rubble.  We could also see the evidence of replacement housing which could have been finished as it needed roofs, slates and so forth.  The money was there in what had been pledged by the region to enable reconstruction to take place.  That was being impeded.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">I am sick and tired of listening to the suggestion that there is a regular flow of supplies into Gaza from Israel.  John Ging, one of the most respected servants we have and of whom we should be proud, has put his life at risk to run the United Nations Relief and Works Agency and has consistently stated that what is required is to provide housing and medicine.  We are speaking about 1.1 million people, 56% of whom are children, 80% of whom are unemployed and more than 70% of whom rely on international aid for their food.  I often think about this.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">When I went first in the 1980s people were in refugee camps.  Approximately 70% of the people in Gaza are refugees.  I remember an old woman asking me what would she tell her grandchildren.  Her grandchildren are now the people in Hamas.  If one could point to one's father or one's grandparents and state that nothing has been achieved, what kind of situation is being created?</p>
          <p eId="para_461">I have always stated it was a disaster to have a general proscription of talks with Hamas.  I do not speak for Hamas but I know that its proscription by the European Union was a mistake because there was division within Hamas between the political wing and those in favour of military action.  It was a very bad decision taken by heads of mission rather than Ministers and was one of those unaccountable decisions.  The proscription stopped the evolution of talks that might have taken place and created an atmosphere for peace.  The European Union will end up talking to Hamas anyway.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">If we are not to waste what happened this week the response we should have morally to the loss of nine lives is that we should realise that statements are not enough.  There must be actions, such as diplomatic actions and actions in concert, that will force a real discussion on peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">I do not want to appear foolish but even when a school run by the United Nations Relief and Works Agency was bombed during Operation Cast Lead, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Romania refused to issue a statement condemning the action.  On the other hand, and it is to their credit, five states, namely, Belgium, Cyprus, Greece, Ireland and Sweden immediately issued statements condemning the action.  I do not underestimate the task within the European Union in achieving a common position but we cannot wait any longer for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">At 1.15 p.m. on Thursday, Ambassador Evrony will appear before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs.  People like me have always condemned the firing of rockets at any civilian population.  That too is a breach of humanitarian law.  I have been in Sderot and I have seen the rockets fired there.  It makes no sense that Hamas, which is holding Gilad Shalit, a young Israeli soldier, denies access to him by the Red Cross.  That is our position, but the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Foreign Affairs regularly returns to the position that those of us in favour of international law, against the blockade, who want talks to open to include the political wing of Hamas, against the evictions in Jerusalem, against the extension of settlements in occupied territories of the West Bank or who are in favour of increasing a flow of necessary materials to Gaza are somehow or another presented as uncritical supporters of terrorism or at least on the fringes of it.  We are no such thing.  However, I must say unequivocally that no country has the right to set itself above international law.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">We had this discussion in the early days of the Iraq war.  It was the abuse of the principle of a pre-emptive strike.  What people are stating, outside of the United Nations charter and in an abuse of that charter and international law, is that they have the right to decide what is a threat, and a right to interpret intentions at the point of departure in such a way as to enable them to make a strike in international waters leading to a loss of life.  This has no status — none at all.  If people want to look at the discussion taking place on the Iraq war in the neighbouring island of Britain they will see it has no basis in law whatsoever.  How parliaments in Europe are challenged this week in Europe is to watch on while law is being debased and political language does not mean anything anymore, watch people being murdered on the high seas, watch children continue to be starved and watch humanitarian actions mocked.  That is what is at stake.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">What happens now?  When Denis Halliday spoke at 6.30 this morning he simply stated that they were not seeking a confrontation but want to go with the <i>MV</i>
                        <i> Rachel Corrie</i> and deliver the cement, school books, school supplies and other items being carried and then return home peacefully.  If Israel interferes with that either in international waters or in the waters adjacent to Gaza it is deliberately stating that it does not care tuppence about us, the European Union, international law or humanitarian need.  If that is the case, it is important that before the House goes into recess we reply appropriately.  I have every confidence in the Minister doing so.  I have stated that is why the resolution includes the provision that he will take such diplomatic actions as are appropriate in responding to this incident and responding to the situation in which we may find ourselves.  I hope it does not come to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">On Thursday I would like to hear that there will be acceptance by Israel of an international inquiry and acceptance that these tragic losses should not be lost as an opportunity to resume real and meaningful talks; that there will be an ending of the blockade to Gaza; that there will be delivery of the supplies that are necessary; that there will be co-operation with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency; that there will be an end to the attempt to blacken people such as John Ging; that there will be respect for the intentions of those who want to assist in a humanitarian way; and that there will be an end to the attempts to try to blacken the people involved in these activities by the suggestion that they are somehow supportive of terrorist action.  We must not waste this week.  Out of the tragic blackness of all of this we must seek to do something very positive that will honour international law, parliamentary decisions and the decent people of Europe, who perhaps now will acknowledge that they should have acted earlier.  I hope this is what will come out of all of this.  That is why I am happy, on behalf of the Labour Party, which is an international party committed to international peace, to state we support the resolution.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_468">Mar aon leis na Teachtaí a labhair romham, ba mhaith liom comhbhrón ó chroí a leathadh le clanna na ndaoine a maraíodh maidin inné.  Ba mhaith liom chomh maith mo bhuíochas a ghabháil leis an Aire as ucht an rúin seo a chur faoi bhráid na Dála inniu mar tá sé tábhachtach go ndéileáileann muid sa Dáil le seo go beo.  Tá sé tábhachtach freisin go gcloisfidh Iosrael go díreach cáineadh ó Pharlaimint na hÉireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Ba mhaith liom chomh maith an t-ionsaí marfach seo a rinne fórsaí Iosrael ar an long ar a raibh mise le taisteal uirthi i dtreo Gaza chun cúnamh daonna a thabhairt do mhuintir Gaza a cháineadh go huile agus go hiomlán.  Bhí mise le bheith ar an long, an <i>MV Mavi Marmara.  </i>Ar bhealach amháin, is trua nach raibh mé air, ach ar an dtaobh eile is mór an faoiseamh dom é nach raibh mé ar bord maidin inné.  Is í an <i>MV Mavi Marmara </i>an long a d’fhulaing an chuid is mó den ionsaí marfach ó shaighdiúrí-commandos Iosrael.  Níor éirigh liomsa ná leis an Seanadóir Mark Daly ná leis an Teachta Chris Andrews oileán na Cipire a fhágaint.  Maidir leis sin, tá ceisteanna le freagairt ag Rialtas na Cipire faoi na cosc a chur sé orainn agus ar Theachtaí ó Pharlaimintí eile imeacht ón oileán.  Fillfidh mé ar sin lá eile, mar ní seo an lá chun déileáil leis sin.  There has been a murderous attack on brave citizens travelling to an area in which a man-made humanitarian crisis is unfolding — it is man-made because it has been caused by Israel.  The helicopter and heavily armed commandos boarding a ship, in the dead of night, which was ferrying supplies and humanitarian workers to Gaza had only one guaranteed consequence, that is, death and injury.  It is to be regretted that is what happened yesterday morning.  It was, therefore, a premeditated, murderous attack.  It was an act of piracy against the citizens of several countries, including Ireland.  It was also an act of war.  It has been compounded by the kidnapping and illegal detention of hundreds of people.  It is further compounded by the blatant lies from Israel’s spin machine, lies which have been repeated on the airwaves in Ireland for the past 24 hours and more.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">I commend this motion to the House.  I would have gone further and demanded immediate action rather than making it conditional on Israel's response to these calls because, as we have said in this House, we have been here before.  Not so many months ago we were here because of the actions of Mossad, the Israeli secret service, in abusing passports.  We were here before last year, when Israel was bombarding Gaza, a city which I visited a few months before Operation Cast Lead.  I would have gone further and demanded diplomatic actions and the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador.  I would also have gone further than the Minister has in demanding that the Israeli authorities allow the Irish-owned vessel the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i> into Gaza, a point to which I will return.  I would have demanded that if Israel did not take this action and lift the siege of Gaza that the international community would prepare another flotilla, this time with the backing of the international navies and the naval protection required, and send it in to declare that the international community is not willing to sit back and allow ships to be attacked in such a fashion in international waters.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">It is interesting, as we are talking here today, that the champions of Israel in this House are conspicuous by their absence.  They are the champions not of Israel itself but of Israel's murderous actions in Palestine.  They have been absent during this debate and from the House since the Order of Business finished.  Is Deputy Kenny speaking on behalf of all the Deputies of his party when he speaks on and endorses this motion?  We will probably hear more about that in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">I will set the context of the flotilla which I, along with two other Members of the Oireachtas, was to join.  In 2008 I was glad to be asked to travel on a boat from Cyprus to Gaza, along with Deputy Chris Andrews and a number of other parliamentarians from other European Union Parliaments.  We travelled into the Palestinian region of Gaza and brought with us a small amount of medical supplies — it was not much because of the cramped conditions on board the boat.  In October 2008 we saw the conditions in which the Palestinian people were living, something to which people who have visited before and since have alluded.  We met various groups and held briefings with the head of operations in the region, John Ging, who has been mentioned before — it was the first time I met him.  I remember being impressed by his presentation.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">I was struck by the deprivation he outlined and I saw the effect of the embargo, the blockade and siege which were imposed by the Israeli state on the 1.5 million people living in an area the size of County Louth.  He said, and many others have said since, including the Minister, that the blockade can be equated to collective punishment, something with which I concur.  I have repeated the phrase many times since because collective punishment is illegal under international law.  Since I left Gaza one and a half years ago, the situation has not improved.  In fact, it has become much worse due in no small part to the murderous attacks by the Israeli military during its onslaught in Operation Cast Lead in December 2008 and January 2009 when it bombarded the city, resulting in the deaths of more than 1,300 people, many of hundreds of whom were civilians and children.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">It indiscriminately bombed civilian targets, used white phosphorous, attacked Red Cross ambulances, used civilians as human shields and then compounded all of that by reinforcing the siege on the region.  Despite the devastation of aerial bombardment which destroyed what was left of the civilian infrastructure following on from previous attacks, no reconstruction aid has been allowed into Gaza.  Despite the fact that hospitals, schools and sewerage and water works were destroyed, cement has not been allowed into Gaza to make good or at least try to repair some of the damage.  Paper is not allowed in.  Wheelchairs are not deemed to be humanitarian aid. There is much more which Israel determines is humanitarian aid; the list is quite extensive.  A city is under siege.  Supplies which I and others involved in the Free Gaza movement were bringing to Gaza were no more than humanitarian aid.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">In October 2008 it was decided that, having been successful in gaining entry by one small boat, we would try to put together a larger flotilla.  I congratulate all of those who put together the flotilla and the effort and donations, in particular, from Ireland to prepare and buy the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i> for the trip.  The flotilla which came together and which was under attack yesterday morning was that idea in fruition.  There were nine ships with 10,000 tonnes of aid heading to Gaza to relieve a city under siege.  It is medieval, as the Minister said, because one does not hear about a city under siege except in films or history books — the world seems to have forgotten it.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">The time has come for consequences for those actions, which involve the systematic, clinical destruction of the civilian infrastructure, roads and factories.  I visited the airport when I was there and there is absolutely nothing left of it.  I visited the only electricity generating plant which is supplied by oil paid for by the European Union.  The Israelis did not let that oil into Gaza.  I visited hospitals which could not function because the supplies required were held up at the border or were not being let in.  I also visited schools which did not have copybooks.  I visited food distribution centres, one of which was destroyed during the aerial bombardment.  I met fishermen and farmers who could not carry out their daily activities because they were under attack.  These actions must have consequences and action must be taken at some stage.  We have repeatedly threatened sanctions but we have not gone any further.  Israel could in fact say that it is being rewarded for its actions.  The Minister must be sorry for his decision, only a few weeks ago, to allow Israel to join the OECD when we could have used our veto to temporarily block its accession.  This would have had the result of denying Israel another international platform from which to boast about its actions.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">The time has come to suspend the international trade agreement between the EU and Israel.  This agreement includes clauses upholding human rights and international law.  Every time we hold a debate about Israel in this House it is because it has breached these rights and laws.  When will the Government start the process of suspending or ending the preferential trade agreement?  I have congratulated the Minister on his stance because he has gone beyond his European counterparts but he should seriously consider calling for sanctions.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">The siege on Gaza is unjust and inhumane, and it increases insecurity in the region.  Israel does not realise this for some reason, perhaps because of an internal political agenda, but collective punishment should not be imposed at all, let alone because of internal problems within Israel.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">I take this opportunity to express my best wishes to all the Irish citizens who were involved in the flotilla and are now under arrest.  I wish those who are sailing on the <i>MV</i>
                        <i> Rachel Corrie </i>God speed.  I hope the lesson that the Israelis learned from yesterday morning is that they cannot attack humanitarian aid convoys with impunity.  I ask the Minister to do everything in his power to ensure the ship is protected as it enters Gaza with its cargo of humanitarian aid.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnGormley" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_291">
          <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
          <p eId="para_480">I rise with a heavy heart to speak on this motion.  It is profoundly depressing to ponder the face of the Palestinian people.  Like many other Irish people I have followed the events in the Middle East for many years and cannot but be moved by what is happening to the Palestinians.  The close involvement of so many Irish people with an aid mission which was viciously and wantonly attacked by Israel helps to bring the matter that much closer to home.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">I am appalled at Monday's dastardly actions by the Israeli Defence Forces.  This was a blatant act of international piracy which involved the unlawful killing and kidnap of humanitarian workers carrying a cargo of mercy to a beleaguered people.  Israel's behaviour is nothing short of outrageous.  Prior to this week that country was already at odds with international law but these killings, kidnappings and blockades of humanitarian aid have sent the Israelis hurtling into total lawlessness and contempt for international law.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">Amid my disillusionment, I take courage from a number of aspects of the matter.  I am heartened by the genuine support and empathy shown to the Palestinian people by the vast majority of Irish citizens.  I am proud to be part of a Government and a Parliament which are prepared to issue a strong and unequivocal condemnation of Israel's behaviour.  I commend the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, on the strong stance he has taken.  Today the Dáil must send the strongest possible message of censure to the Israeli authorities.  We must tell them that their actions are repugnant to all decent people in Ireland and across the world.  We must insist on safe passage for the Irish vessel, the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i>.  I join other Deputies in wishing all on board her God speed.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">This House demands the unconditional release of all Irish citizens and the other aid workers.  We abhor the unlawful killing of nine aid activists and we send our sympathies to their families.  Irish people's empathy with Palestine is based on our own sense of fair play and decency, as well as drawing on our historical experiences.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">Monday's actions by Israel were a subset of the ongoing outrage of the blockade of Gaza, which has impeded post-war reconstruction and deprived people of urgently required food, medicine and other necessities to sustain human life and dignity.  The United Nations has indicated that three quarters of the damage inflicted on Gaza in the 2009 war has not yet been repaired and that six in ten homes do not have enough food.  Every day the ordinary, innocent people of Gaza have misery and privation foisted upon them.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">Israel tells us that essential supplies sent via the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross prevent real suffering in Gaza but reports from aid workers, including Irish volunteers, tell a very different story.  An Amnesty International report describes mass unemployment, extreme food insecurity and food price rises.  Eight out of ten Gazans now depend on food aid.  More than 90% of Gaza's factories are closed and exports have decreased significantly.  Prior to the 2007 blockade of Gaza some 70 truckloads of merchandise were sent out of Gaza every day but since then only 260 truckloads in total have been recorded leaving the territory.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">Many years ago, I went on a trip to Palestine with Deputy Ó Snodaigh and other Deputies have also witnessed the baffling and capricious behaviour of Israel's border guards as they insult and humiliate the Palestinian people.  In this instance I am baffled about how the Israeli authorities classify goods for banning on the basis of potential military use.  Banned goods include musical instruments, chocolate, pens, biscuits, crisps, jam and fresh meat.  I fail to see any relevance beyond a vindictive and bloody-minded intent on the part of the Israeli authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">I understand it is Israel's aim to crush Hamas, which runs Gaza, but its actions are a collective punishment of all, including the majority of innocent Palestinians.  This is not only illegal; it is vastly counterproductive.  The practical and inevitable outcome is that the ordinary population is becoming even more dependent on Hamas and its smuggling networks.  Hamas takes revenue from goods smuggled through hundreds of tunnels running under Gaza's border with Egypt.  This dependence compounds the anger and frustration which drives young Palestinian people to make common cause with fanatics hell-bent on violence.  When I visited Bethlehem University, in the West Bank, I was told that many students are radicalised and become members of Hamas by their second year.  This response is understandable when one sees the pressures to which they are subjected.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">This Israeli-driven vicious circle is reminiscent of the ham-fisted attempts by the British authorities to crack down on terrorism on this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">Israel's outrageous acts risk being a recruitment sergeant for al-Qaeda just as Maggie Thatcher's wrong-headed policies drove young people to join the Provos in the 1980s.  Deputies should not in any way misunderstand me; I utterly condemn Hamas's acts of violence, just as I condemn those of Israel.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">We must recognise that Hamas is a democratically elected Government in Gaza, which is something of a rarity across the Middle East generally.  It is hard not to suspect Israel's blockade of Gaza is a deliberate attempt to sabotage viable government in Gaza.  Sometimes I fear it is a cynical attempt by Israel to stop any meaningful peace negotiations before they get off the ground, an approach based on the view that "We are ready to talk but there is nobody on the other side because they are too busy fighting".</p>
          <p eId="para_491">In the narrowest sense, Israel may claim Monday's event as some sort of victory.  The Free Gaza flotilla has been thwarted and the blockade of Gaza remains intact.  Few beyond the most fanatical of Israelis will see matters in this light.  The stark reality is that this Israeli action was a total outrage.  Today, we in Ireland are making clear that Israel has gone too far.  I urge the United Nations and the Quartet to join us in sending this clear and strong message to Israel and her Government.</p>

        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_292">
          <from>Deputy Pat Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_492">I welcome the motion tabled by the Government.  I remind Deputy Ó Snodaigh, who commented on Deputy Enda Kenny and the Fine Gael Party, that the four members of my party who travelled to Israel and Gaza in April 2009 were the first Members of the Oireachtas to travel to the region to see at first hand the devastation caused by Operation Cast Lead.  During our visit, we had fruitful discussions with all sides in Gaza and Israel.  I assure Deputy Ó Snodaigh that the situation in Gaza is at the top of my party's agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">This debate should focus on ensuring that Europe works together.  While we deplore the loss of life which occurred when the Free Gaza flotilla was intercepted at sea by Israeli military forces on Sunday night and Monday morning last and sympathise very much with those who were killed, this debate should focus on the lifting of the siege to address the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.  For far too long, the people of Gaza have been ignored by the European Union and we must use this opportunity to have the blockade lifted.  I urge the Minister for Foreign Affairs and his counterparts in other European Union member states to place the blockade of Gaza at the top of their agenda at the next European Council meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">Gaza is a strip of land 25 miles long and six miles wide.  With a population of 1.1 million, it is one of the most densely populated areas in the world.  On my visit to Gaza with Deputies Timmins, Kenny and Shatter, I described the area as an open prison.  People cannot leave the strip which is subject to a blockade.  That a metal and concrete fence separates Gaza from Israel speaks volumes.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">Operation Cast Lead left a trail of devastation in Gaza.  We saw at first hand the misery caused by the three week operation.  More than 15,000 homes were damaged and 100,000 people displaced.  The casualties of war were 1,400 Palestinians killed against 13 Israelis, some of whom were killed by friendly fire.  As in all wars, the victims were children.  Of the casualties in Gaza, 40% were children who could not defend themselves and did not stand a chance against F16 bombers.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">Deputies Michael D. Higgins and Timmins referred to the destruction of industry in Gaza.  On our visit, we saw an ice cream factory which had employed 250 people and had been razed to the ground.  Ironically, the factory had exported most of what it produced to Israel.  With unemployment currently standing at 80%, what future will the people of Gaza have?</p>
          <p eId="para_497">Before the invasion of Gaza, the area had a strong agricultural sector, producing 400,000 tonnes of food per annum.  Israeli bombs destroyed most production, flattening orchards and olive and date groves.  As a result, little food is being produced in Gaza.  We also saw at first hand the lack of mechanical machines in Gaza.  We observed rubble being removed in donkeys and carts.  As Deputy Kenny stated, we also witnessed the destruction visited on the American school in Gaza, one of 18 schools bombed in Operation Cast Lead.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">Other speakers referred to what has occurred as a result of the blockade.  For many years, Israel restricted the movement of people and goods in and out of Gaza.  It was only when Hamas took control in 2007 that Israel imposed an extensive, restrictive regime and created what I have described as an open prison.  Gazans may not leave and food cannot be exported.  This debate should focus on lifting the siege and the terrible humanitarian crisis in Gaza.  A Gazan who suffers a heart attack and needs to be transported to Jordan or East Jerusalem will probably die before being able to pass the Israeli border checkpoint at Erez.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">The events of Monday morning must be condemned, as they have been by many countries all over the world.  I am pleased to note Baroness Catherine Ashton, the High Representative, has issued a statement in conjunction with her Russian counterpart.  This is a unifying move.  The Israeli actions have been condemned by the United Nations Security Council which called for a "prompt, impartial, credible and transparent" investigation, an interesting choice of words.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">We have a golden opportunity to ensure the crisis in Gaza is discussed at international level and pressure is applied to Israel to lift the blockade.  While the wall built around the occupied territories has prevented suicide bombings, it has created a catastrophe.  Many questions must be asked about the events of Monday morning and different answers will be given depending on to whom one speaks.  Who started the violence when the <i>MV Mavi Marmara </i>was invaded by Israeli commandos?  The activists on board state the commandos started shooting the moment they hit the decks.  The Israelis, however, have a different version and claim the commandos were put under pressure.  A proper investigation into the incident is necessary to arrive at the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">As other speakers have said, I would hope that the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i> would make its way to Gaza with its humanitarian aid, which is needed.  We know Israel has restricted the goods coming into Gaza.  Children have not had a proper education since January 2009 and books cannot be brought in.  Cement and steel cannot be brought in for fear it would be used for rockets to be launched into Israeli territory.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">When we finish this evening's debate it is important that all the political parties in the House unite.  A great Irishman, John Ging, has taken over a job with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency in Gaza and his life is at risk all the time.  He is to be commended on his courage and on how he is trying to unify the people in Gaza regardless of whether they support Hamas or Fatah.  I will be asking the Minister some questions later.  The time has come for Europe and our counterparts throughout the world, including America, to act to lift the blockade.  If anything comes out of the bloodshed from Monday morning it should be that Europe speaks with one voice and works together.  I urge the Minister in conjunction with his counterparts, the Spanish Presidency and the incoming Belgian Presidency to put this matter at the top of the agenda.</p>

          <from>Deputy Darragh O’Brien</from>
          <p eId="para_505">I welcome the motion and commend the Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Taoiseach on the very strong line that has been taken.  Most importantly colleagues from all sides of the House who have spoken this evening have roundly condemned the unprovoked illegal attack on a humanitarian aid ship in international waters.  I am concerned as to whether the Israeli authorities will pay any heed to anything any of us in this House say today.</p>
          <p eId="para_506">I am convener of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and my colleagues Deputies Higgins and Timmins are present.  That committee has had occasion to question and discuss with the Israeli ambassador and his officials issues, including the ongoing siege of Gaza, which is nothing short of a humanitarian disgrace.  We have also discussed with him the continuing illegal settlements in the West Bank and the building of the wall, which is purely a land grab.  Israel has been basically strangling any life out of the Palestinian Territories.  It continues to ensure that a two-state solution, with which most moderates on both sides agree, does not happen.  An independent Palestinian state in the manner in which it is formed at the moment is not viable.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">We have witnessed the deaths of ten people with more than 30 injured in a raid by Israeli commandos on unarmed people bringing humanitarian aid.  If it was any other country bar Israel, I wonder what we would be talking about.  I welcome that the motion is strongly worded as have been the Taoiseach's comments.  We need a full independent inquiry into the incident.  As the Minister has said, we also need to ensure that the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i> is allowed to proceed unhindered.  As we speak, five Irish citizens are still in Israeli custody — illegally in my view.  I saw the father of one of them speaking on the news this evening at 5.30.  One wonders how any father, mother, brother or sister would feel about being in that situation.  Worse than that are the ten people who have lost their lives trying to bring some assistance to the people in Gaza who are being strangled with their economy on the floor with unemployment at more than 80%.  They do not have the most basic needs of water, education or medical supplies.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">In the past 24 hours, I saw the Israeli Prime Minister, Mr. Netanyahu, and other Israeli spokespeople continuing to defend the indefensible.  Should the Israeli authorities not give us the cast-iron guarantees we require on the safety of our Irish citizens in illegal custody and of the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i>, we should consider further steps, including the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ChrisAndrews" eId="spk_296">
          <from>Deputy Chris Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_509">I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the motion.  I express my condolences to the families of those who have lost their lives.  I welcome the positive stance the Minister, Deputy Martin, has taken, which is helpful and is recognised across the world.  Deputy Timmins made a very helpful and positive contribution, which is welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Where does one start when it comes to Israel?  One could look a long time back, but I would like to start with three or four years ago when Israel imposed the blockade on Gaza.  As previous speakers have said it is a humanitarian disaster.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, and Mary Robinson have been there.  John Ging is there on a daily basis and he has testified that it is a humanitarian disaster.  It is clear that is illegal and immoral, and must end.  As Deputy Breen said, it is, in effect, an open prison.  In November 2008, six weeks before operation Cast Lead, Deputy Ó Snodaigh and I took the same route this flotilla took and we could see for ourselves that it was an outrageous way to force anybody live.  On top of that, Israel then bombed the Gaza Strip and killed more than 1,400 people, including hundreds of children.  It made already horrific conditions even more horrific.  We then had members of Israel's Mossad organisation using stolen international passports going around and killing people illegally.  We have had an immoral blockade, the bombing of the Gaza Strip and the illegal use of stolen passports.  Now we have witnessed the attack of a peaceful flotilla bringing humanitarian aid.  Such disproportionate actions in effect force people into the arms of extremism.</p>
          <p eId="para_511">It is vital for the Irish State to now defend the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i>, a vessel bringing aid and support and containing people interested in the human rights of the Palestinian people in Gaza.  We must ensure that the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i> can arrive in Gaza city.  We must hold Israel accountable and there must be consequences for its actions.  Owing to the silence and appeasement on the part of the international community, Israel believes it can get away with acting with impunity.  We need to ensure there are consequences for its actions.  One could forgive the Israelis for believing they can get away with anything they want to do because for years they have been getting away with everything.  There have been no consequences or accountability for any atrocity.  We need to ensure that from now on there are accountability and consequences for Israel’s atrocities.</p>

        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Deputy Finian McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_512">I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important debate on the deaths of civilians in the Gaza flotilla in the past 48 hours.  I thank Deputies O'Brien and Chris Andrews for sharing time.</p>
          <p eId="para_513">What happened is a disgrace.  I wish to put on the record my deepest sympathy to the families of the dead and wounded.  I challenge the Israeli Government and its extreme right-wing agenda and express my total support for the Palestinian people in their hour of need.  I deplore the actions of the Israeli Army and commandos in boarding humanitarian ships outside Israeli waters.  That is not right and is an act of piracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">When I saw and heard what happened, it reminded me of the lies and deceit after Bloody Sunday here.  Bully boy tactics must never be tolerated.  I call on the Government and the international community to stand up to Israel and defend the rights of the Palestinian people.  I would also like Ireland to take a more assertive and independent foreign policy role with Israel with regard to the deaths of the peace and human rights activists and the abduction of Irish citizens.  I call on the Government to expel the Israeli ambassador until Israel obeys international law.  We must send out a strong message from this debate.  I welcome the reaction of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Martin, to the situation and welcome the remarks made by the Taoiseach earlier today in the Dáil.  It is important we take a tough stand on the issue.  Perhaps we should also consider the proposal to boycott Israeli goods until Israel begins to respect the Palestinian people.  This debate is about the lack of respect from one country for a smaller country, Palestine.  I would like to encourage our Taoiseach and Minister for Foreign Affairs to demand, at EU and United Nations levels, the ending of the blockade of Gaza and to urge the US Government to take a tougher stand with Israel on all violations of human rights and international law.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">Earlier today, I spoke to 40 US law students in the audiovisual room.  I told them clearly, as a friend of the United States, that I disagreed strongly with many US foreign policy issues, particularly with regard to Israel and Gaza.  I urge President Obama to stand up to Israel and defend the rights of the Palestinian people.  He is a major part of the solution on this issue.  The Israeli lobby in the United States is much too powerful and President Obama should listen to other citizens.  We all want peace and justice and we want respect for all countries, particularly for Gaza and the Palestinians.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_298">
          <from>Deputy Bernard J. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_516">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on this issue.  I congratulate the Minister, the Government and all who have contributed on the manner in which they have spoken and on having the temerity to bring together opinion in this House.  I attended the COSAC meeting in Madrid yesterday where the Irish delegation representing this House — of all parties — successfully initiated a similar resolution, a motion which was adopted at the closure of the meeting.  We eventually got the agreement of the 27 member states, although, unfortunately, the motion was watered down considerably from the original version.  However, there was unanimity on the final adoption of the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">Like others here, I was one of those who, along with other members from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, paid a visit to the Gaza region just under a year ago.  We saw at first hand the kind of issues that have already been mentioned.  There is no justification whatsoever for the kind of siege now being imposed on Gaza.  Any attempt by a democratic state to prolong such activity — obviously intending to continue with it <i>ad infinitum</i> — in pursuit of the blockade cannot be justified.  Unfortunately, it appears the Israeli authorities are showing contempt for the international community, because they know full well what international opinion is likely to be.  This is not to say that any of us support terrorism.  We do not, but we recognise that fair must be fair and some regard must be had for human and civil rights.  The total disregard of these by a government or any democratic institution cannot be countenanced.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">I strongly support the opinion expressed by a number of speakers, particularly the Fine Gael leader, which suggested to the Minister that he should engage with his EU colleagues on this.  The Government needs to engage with the entire European Community.  It is from that quarter that the greatest influence is likely to come.  As we know, there is a preferential trade arrangement between the European Union and Israel.  We recognise Israel is a small country in a location beset by hostile people.  However, that does not justify what is happening now.  The result of what is happening now increases support for terrorism on the other side.  Every time a violation of human and civil rights or an atrocity such as the one that has just happened is carried out by a legitimate government, it brings into disrepute the legitimacy of that government and shows a clear contempt for international opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">International opinion should mean something — at least it used to mean something.  Many years ago, this country appealed successfully to international opinion to become involved.  It was that engagement that eventually proved most helpful to our cause.  I remind the Minister that it is hugely important that we engage at EU level and that all the people of the European Union are brought on board.  Some of those in the Union are reluctant to become involved.  This, unfortunately, is our weakness, because the Israeli authorities are quite familiar with the weakness of the debate coming from within the Union.  This weakness gives Israel weight and strength to pursue the kind of activity it pursued on Sunday night and Monday morning.  That is not acceptable.  While the European Union is seen as a powerful entity, it will, unfortunately, be seen as a weak entity if it backs off and fails to impress upon the Israeli authorities the necessity to observe human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">During our visit to the region almost a year ago, we saw at first hand the evidence of what has happened there.  We did not just accept the evidence as presented to us, but asked probing questions.  The Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Joint Committee on European Affairs produced a joint report on their visit, a report that was much criticised by the Israeli authorities.  The Joint Committee on European Affairs is currently holding hearings and bringing in both sides to address it with a view to determining whether or to what extent human and civil rights were abused.  The parties should not be concerned about how this will be done.  The committee will carry out its work impartially, as it has done in the past.  The Israeli authorities should not be afraid of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">One thing that should come from this event is that it should be the watershed.  What happened on Sunday night and Monday morning should be the issue that determines whether the international community is capable of exerting positive influence in a democratic way on the Israeli authorities with a view to getting them to recognise that just because there are atrocities on the other side, they cannot dismiss international opinion and resort to the same kind of violence in which the so-called terrorists were involved or to which they resorted.  By doing that, they bring the legitimacy of the legitimate government down to the same level of those with no regard for that legitimacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">The Minister has the full support of all sides in this House and has an opportunity now, as a Minister representing a small country within the European Union, to exert that influence.  He will receive support from the wider European Community and from the United Nations.  Many contributors have spoken about the Irish representatives in the region and about John Ging and the tremendous work he has done and the fair-minded manner in which he has done it.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I cannot understand why it is not possible to find a means, under the auspices of the UN, to address the issues relating to Gaza.  I do not understand why it is not possible to transport food and medicine supplies and that the supplies necessary for reconstruction cannot be legitimately transported into Gaza under the auspices of the UN.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">The Israeli authorities must recognise that not everyone is their enemy.  Historically, some of us have supported their nation's right to exist.  By virtue of their recent activities, however, the Israelis are making it difficult for anyone to support them.</p>

Will he join me in commending Turkey on the restraint it has shown?  As a nation and in the context of its foreign policy, Turkey has made many advances in the past decade.  It is to be commended on the restraint it has shown to date in respect of this matter.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_532">The Deputy asked quite a number of questions.  I welcome the fact that this motion was drafted with the support of the entire Dáil.  I discussed the matter with the spokespersons from the different parties beforehand, showed the text to everyone and took on board some suggestions in order that we might have a complete text that represents the democratic voice of the Irish people — through the nation's Parliament — on this issue.  Arriving at an agreed text was important because it sends a unified statement to Israel and to the international community with regard to this country's stance.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">During our discussions, I made a number of key points to the Israeli ambassador to Ireland.  I reiterated our condemnation of what has happened and requested the immediate and unconditional release of Irish citizens.  I also requested full consular access to our citizens because in the 24 hours immediately following the incident, Ireland and all other EU member states were denied such access to their citizens.  The latter was in violation of the Vienna Convention.  I can confirm that the staff of the Irish Embassy in Tel Aviv have met all of the citizens that are currently detained.  Our ambassador met the two citizens who signed the declaration and who are on their way back to Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">We conveyed our view to the Israeli ambassador that this incident was caused by the overriding issue of the illegal blockade on Gaza.  We called for maximum restraint in respect of the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i>, which is currently sailing towards Gaza.  We asked the ambassador to request that, in light of what has happened, his Government should allow this vessel to sail unimpeded into Gaza.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">At our meeting, the Israeli ambassador took the line that has been conveyed by his Government's spokespersons.  To a large extent, we put to him clear messages to be conveyed to his Government.  The Israeli line has been to endeavour to defend what happened by stating that their soldiers were attacked, etc.  We pointed out that there is a complete blackout in respect of information coming from anybody who was on board any of the vessels that were involved in the incident.  This is either due to the fact that it is impossible to obtain access to such people or because communications were jammed in the 24 hours immediately following the incident.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">The story will unfold in the coming days and we may become privy to more information in respect of what actually transpired.  It will be interesting to hear first-hand accounts from those who were present.  Other pictures may emerge in time.  We must be conscious of that fact, particularly in the context of how we analyse what has happened, reflect on events and comment further.  There may be more to this matter than has first appeared to be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">The Deputy inquired about the possibility of Ireland bringing aid to Gaza.  We have supported the provision of aid to Gaza on a continuous basis, primarily through the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, and in particular in support of the construction of education and health facilities.  UNRWA has been hindered by the blockade.  For example, it has encountered tremendous difficulties in the context of obtaining cement for the construction of schools.  I visited a school in Gaza which, essentially, is housed in shipping containers.  With all of the international aid that is available, it would be easy, if the blockade were lifted, to construct a modern building to house the school in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">As Members stated, the blockade makes absolutely no sense and has undermined moderate opinion in Gaza.  As Deputy Higgins stated, it has also hardened hearts.  The blockade has deprived people of the basic necessities of life.  We know from our history what that means for the resolution of conflict, peace-building, establishing parity of esteem and transforming relationships between peoples.  All the blockade is doing is undermining any potential efforts towards peace-making and copperfastening prejudices, views, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">On my visit to the Middle East, I met a group of business people who had been trading with Israeli merchants for a considerable period prior to the war on Gaza and the imposition of the blockade.  Paradoxically, these individuals have been driven out of business and a new business elite has emerged.  Members of the latter operate through the tunnels that run under the border and are obliged to pay customs fees to Hamas, the very organisation Israel states it wishes to undermine and suppress.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">I was inspired by what I witnessed in the schools run by UNRWA, where children learn about the Holocaust.  In addition, they are also taught modules relating to human rights.  The children at the school performed a drama for me which centred on the themes of human rights and having respect for citizens from different backgrounds.  UNRWA is engaged in heroic work in Gaza.  It is led in this work by, among others, Mr. John Ging, who has been extremely effective, fair and objective in his approach.  Our aid has been channelled mainly through UNRWA.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">There would be no need for convoys, either official or non-governmental in nature, if common sense prevailed.  I am glad the European Union statement on this matter identified the counterproductive nature of the blockade.  There is a basic humanitarian issue that arises in the context of the blockade but there is also the fact that, as the EU states, it is completely counterproductive.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">The measures open to Government in respect of future action are self-evident.  At European Union level, we have already contributed strongly to the view that there can be no upgrading of the association agreement with Israel, particularly in light of the political situation there and the policies that have been implemented in recent times.  As a result of the events of recent days, we will continue to ensure this will not happen in the foreseeable future.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">We have other options open to us in terms of engagement with our European colleagues.  Deputy Durkan and others called on us to engage but the reality is we have already done so.  In the last year and a half to two years there has been a shift on the part of a significant number of European Union countries.  It may not be discernible from some distance, but it is discernible to me and others, culminating in the Swedish Presidency's progressive and constructive conclusions in December which offered the potential parameters of an ultimate solution and set out an unequivocal position in regard to the blockade on Gaza itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">It would be a significant move if Hamas were to agree to the release of Corporal Gilad Shalit.  Such a move has the potential to transform the situation.  We have repeatedly called for his release and will continue to do so as a measure that would have a significant impact on the situation in Gaza.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_304">
          <from>Deputy Michael D. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_545">I welcome both the motion before us and the quality of the Minister's response to Members' suggestions.  I have several questions and points that I hope will be of assistance to him.  There are important figures working in the Gaza context, among them the personal representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations.  When we were in Gaza last year a meeting was due to take place within several weeks which would have addressed the definition of essential items by the Israeli authorities in regard to the Erez Crossing.  At that time up to €40 million of assistance was pledged by, for example, Saudi Arabia which could not be spent to finish the houses which had been built and so on.  No progress was made as far as I can gather by the Secretary General's representative.  It filled me with despair that it came to nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">I am very familiar with John Ging's work having had the privilege of teaching him in NUI Galway.  He was one of the brightest and most distinguished students we ever had and I am very proud of his contribution.  However, I am very concerned at the manner in which his efforts are regularly blackened.  He has withstood an incredible attempt to tarnish his efforts among some of the most beleaguered people in the world.  Will the Minister comment on that?</p>
          <p eId="para_547">I am concerned at the position of Baroness Catherine Ashton in terms of addressing the issue of the blockade.  The contradiction felt by parliamentarians throughout Europe is that the European Union is Israel's best customer while Gaza is one of the places where the Union has spent a great deal of its development expenditure.  What was spent by the European Union has been wiped out in Gaza again and again, one incursion after another.  I wonder how genuine any change in the European Union's position can be.  I have drawn the attention of the Minister to what I suggested is the division in the camp.  That was in January 2009 in response to the bombing of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, UNRWA, facility.  I referred to the four countries that refused to issue even the mildest condemnation — Germany, Holland, Italy and Romania — and I mentioned the other group that had taken a progressive position on the defence of international law.  The European Union has no credibility nor does Baroness Ashton, if she cannot make progress on agreeing a new Common Position.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">I suspect — and this is not a criticism of the Minister — that running through European thinking on this has been a policy of non-engagement.  The Palestinians have been made pawns over several generations by different people who might benefit from the continuation of the conflict.  The policy of non-engagement has been disastrous.  In this context, the extraordinary position of Mr. Tony Blair, the representative of the Quartet, stands out as a particular example of non-performance.  When we were in Gaza last year Mr. Blair had not yet visited the area, as I understand it.  He certainly was not in residence in the hotel in Jerusalem at the time.  His has been a singularly dumb performance.  I have repeatedly suggested that the presence of a secretariat to the Quartet's proposals would have been invaluable in at least keeping text emerging at times when there was no performance by the United States and others.  The Minister probably agrees that what has taken place in the past 48 hours is a significant breach of the Geneva Convention.  I have no doubts in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The Israeli ambassador, Dr. Evrony, will appear once again before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs on Thursday.  If we do not make progress at that stage we must, this side of the summer recess, announce new actions that are meaningful.  We must be seen to act and not just speak.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_305" as="#Minister_for_Foreign_Affairs">
          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_550">The Deputy's contributions included questions and a general articulation of positions.  The essential items question in terms of what is and is not allowed in has been farcical at times.  Depending on who one talks to, or the week or the month, some items are on and some are off.  It makes absolutely no sense.  Much of what has happened could have been avoided if a more sensible approach had been taken to that issue.  From our discussions with UNRWA at the time it seems even materials for schools were being denied.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">Another issue was that young university students who had returned home at the time of the war on Gaza were not allowed leave the area to resume their studies.  We occasionally receive representations in regard to Palestinian students who cannot get out of Gaza to attend university in the United States or elsewhere.  It makes no sense that future leaders should be treated this way.  Education is the key to an enlightened, balanced view in life — why would one seek to suppress that?  These are the issues that continue to undermine and erode confidence in the possibility of any type of future for ordinary Gazans.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">In regard to Deputy Higgins's question on the potential blackening of Mr. John Ging and so on, we have been and continue to be very supportive of UNRWA.  At the highest level of the United Nations we have praised its role and sought support for it.  Likewise, we have sought support for UNRWA at the European Union through Baroness Catherine Ashton's office.  It seems there have been attempts  behind the scenes to change people's perspective on UNRWA.  If the agency is undermined, whatever foundations we have will be completely eroded.  I would not like to contemplate what would happen in education, health and so on if there were any significant undermining of its role and constructive contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">In terms of the European Union's position, it is no secret, as Deputy Durkan observed, that different member states have, for historical reasons, had different perspectives.  I observed that the conclusions under the Swedish Presidency were quite satisfactory from our perspective.  Having said that, when any event like this happens, there must invariably be a process even in terms of deciding on the wording that will be used in any statement that subsequently emerges.  That is certainly worrying.  I agree with Deputy Higgins that a breach of international law has occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">I understand from where Deputy Andrews is coming in terms of the "what next" question.  The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Ms Pillay, referred yesterday to Israel's disdain for international law and a continuing approach which suggests more and more breaches of international law is acceptable.  I stated yesterday that Israel's necessity is becoming a new international legal or moral code, with extrajudicial killings, forging of passports of citizens of other nations and in international waters the boarding of ships and the killing of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">Deputy Timmins hit the nail on the head when he said that the actual decision to go through with this particular exercise is wherein lies the fundamental flaw.  One cannot at 4 a.m. drop commandos on a boat, even if one's intention is to ensure no occurrence of disaster, and expect from this a docile response.  That type of scenario always results in chaos.  They could have waited for broad daylight or for the ships to come closer before doing so, as happened previously.  There were other options that could have been used, as has happened on previous occasions.  As I understand it, in one case a boat on which Deputies Andrews and Ó Snodaigh were on board was allowed into Gaza.  On another occasion, a ship was impeded and taken to Ashdod without any dramatics.  The seeds of this disaster were clearly sown in the original decision, a point that has been well made, one which any independent inquiry will have to address in terms of unravelling what happened.</p>

On the debate in regard to boycotting Israeli goods, following our own experience in respect of the Dunnes Stores strikers and the effect this had on apartheid in South Africa, has the Minister considered proposing a boycott of Israeli goods until the Israeli Government respects the rights of the Palestinian people?  Has he considered expelling the Israeli ambassador until Israel gives a commitment to respect international law?

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin</from>
          <p eId="para_564">In terms of the <i>MV Rachel Corrie</i>, we have received no assurances other than the Israeli ambassador having conveyed to us that the Israeli Government does not want conflict or confrontation with it.  One would hope that a different mindset will prevail in this regard.  Deputy Higgins indicated to me this morning that Mr. Denis Halliday had been in touch, following which I telephoned him.  We will maintain contact.  My overriding priority is the protection and safety of Irish citizens.  It is clear from the comments made to me by Mr. Halliday that is the overriding priority of the crew.  They are not seeking conflict or confrontation.  They have on board humanitarian goods which they wish to bring to Gaza.  The Israeli ambassador equally has stated that the Israeli Government does not want confrontation.  We have had no indication that they will facilitate any passage through of the ship.  That is the position as of now.  We will keep a close watch on this and will remain in constant contact with all parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">On the Deputy's comments in regard to the Goldstone inquiry, what has happened is regrettable.  What is most regrettable is the attempts to blacken members of the inquiry.  The intimidation and constant pressure on personnel is unacceptable.  I will meet shortly with personnel who served on the Goldstone inquiry to hear first-hand what has been going on.  At the UN Assembly, we took a clear line and independent position on this from the beginning.  We, along with one or two other countries, in terms of our European colleagues, were on our own on this at the first assembly vote.  However, there was a significant shift in this regard when it came to the second vote.  Things change.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">On Deputy McGrath's questions, we have not considered going the boycotting route.  I made a speech at the ICTU conference in Dublin Castle at which I set out our clear position in this regard.  Boycotts have in recent times been questioned in terms of their efficacy.  If one is to go down that particular route in terms of trade other countries would have to come into the frame.  We cannot be selective in this regard.  We have not considered the other proposals mentioned by the Deputy.  My first priority is the safe release of Irish citizens.  I should explain that ambassadors and diplomatic relations are to facilitate civil and diplomatic exchanges between countries even in times of great difficulty and stress.  That is the fundamental function of a diplomatic relationship.  The scenario outlined by the Deputy would be one of last resort.  As I stated, we are clear in terms of where we want to go in regard to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">On the American situation, I believe in the bona fides of President Obama.  I believe he has made strong efforts to try to get the peace talks going and has been frustrated by a range of issues that at times have called into question the capacity of the Israeli Government to engage in a meaningful talks process.  We all recall the visit of Vice President Biden to Israel and on his arrival a particular event and announcement that again torpedoed the proximity talks.  There is at times a sense of incoherence from the Israeli Government in respect of the process which has frustrated the commencement of the talks.  The appointment of Mr. George Mitchell was a genuine signal of intent by the American Government to from the beginning, contrary to previous Government's, engage with the Middle East question.  I believe we should welcome that aspect and dimension of President Obama's Administration's engagement with the middle eastern situation.  There are, as we know, also challenges in this regard.  We know the <i>realpolitik</i> of the situation within the United States and the particular strength of various lobbies and so on and the impact of those lobbies on policy etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Deputy Pat Breen asked about the IHH, which is the international relief foundation.  It is banned by Israel, which accuses it of openly supporting Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood but others, including the Turkish Government, would view it as a charitable relief organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">The key point is that we must establish the full facts of what transpired.  There were hundreds of people on that boat.  This interception happened in international waters.  As I have said, clearly, there were options that could have been pursued other than the option that was ultimately pursued.  I do not like branding people and in the conflict situation we have, people get branded, which may not necessarily be a fair designation.  We have had enough of that in the past while.</p>

          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
          <p eId="para_575">It gives me great pleasure to move the Second Reading of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2010.  It is a Private Members' Bill, the intent of which is to reduce Government regulated charges to give businesses, consumers and the economy a much needed boost.  We estimate that this Bill, if made law, would save the average household €400 a year and would reduce considerably the cost of doing business for struggling small and medium businesses and industries.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">There have been many analyses of the current crisis but the best one was offered by the National Economic and Social Council.  According to its analysis this country is facing a five-part crisis: a banking crisis, about which we all know, involving essentially banks that have either become insolvent or are in such a precarious position that they are no longer able to lend; a fiscal crisis whereby we are spending €20 billion more than we are able to collect in tax revenues; a crisis in the real economy which is essentially a crisis of unemployment and competitiveness; a social crisis, which is the impact of the recession on people's lives in that people can no longer pay their mortgages, are facing repossessions and cannot afford health care or health insurance; and also a reputational or ethical crisis, namely, the idea that people in this country have lost faith in our institutions or that there is an international loss of confidence in this State and in its capacity to pay its bills and our private sector's capacity to export and to deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">There has been a huge response to the banking crisis, one with which I do not agree but at least there has been a response.  There has been a huge response to the crisis in the public finances and while I do not agree with the detail of it, I agree with the action the Government has taken to reduce the deficit, but there has been an inadequate response to the crisis in the real economy, which is a crisis of unemployment and competitiveness.  I note the announcement today of 6,500 training schemes, which is welcome, but it is a drop in the ocean in the context of more than 400,000 people signing on the dole.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">Fine Gael believes that what is required from Government is a comprehensive response to each of those five sub-crises.  To date, the Government has concentrated its efforts on the budget and banking to the exclusion of everything else.  While we may differ on the detail of the cuts and the choices made by the Government to reduce public spending by €4 billion last year, we accept the principle and the necessity of it, and that it should have been done early on.  We were the first party to express our concern about spiralling public spending as far back as 2002 and the first to call for it to be reduced through measures such as the suspension of the national wage agreement, reductions in public sector numbers, savings in the drugs budget, culling quangos and reforming the rent supplement, among others.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">There has been some revisionism in recent weeks, particularly in the context of the Government's fight back where having accepted the blame one week, it has now attempted to spread the blame and is trying to focus attention on Fine Gael's policies on stamp duties or the contents of our 2007 manifesto.  However, Members can be sure of one thing, namely, that whatever caused this crisis it was not any policies or proposals put forward either by Fine Gael or the Labour Party.  What caused it was the policies implemented by the party opposite, policies that led to reckless lending by the banks, unregulated and untrammelled, reckless increases in spending, unsustainable cuts in taxation and the slow undermining of our national competitiveness from 1999 onwards.  In many ways, this Bill is about that; it is about competitiveness and attacking the crisis of unemployment and competitiveness in the real economy.  This is the crisis that is doing the most damage to our economy and society in the longterm.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">Last year the Government introduced two Bills, one entitled "Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 1) Bill" and the other entitled "Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Bill", Bills that people like to call "FEMPI" for short.  One of these Bills introduced the pension levy and cut fees paid by the Government to professionals for services provided to the State.  The other Bill introduced a cut in public sector pay.  In addition to that, Fianna Fáil and the Green Party, using social welfare legislation, cut child benefit and other social welfare payments.  However, instead of the Government reducing its charges, it has increased them.  Across the economy private sector businesses and the self-employed have reduced their prices, recognising that incomes have fallen and that they need to reduce their prices to retain their customers.  Last year prices across the economy fell by 5% and if one excludes mortgage interest, prices fell by 2.5% — that is the extent to which prices have fallen across the real economy.  Yet Government regulated prices increased by 6.7%.  The disparity is evident; private sector prices have decreased by 2% to 2.5% and Government prices have increased by 6.7% in a deflationary environment.  In real terms, Government prices increased by more than 11% last year, which was probably the biggest increase in Government prices in recent decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">This trend has continued into 2010.  The most recent inflation figures published this month by the CSO show that the price of clothing has fallen by 10.7%, the price of food has fallen by 7.1%.  We should count ourselves lucky that the Government does not control the price of food or clothing because they would probably have increased by 11%.   The prices that the Government controls have continued to rise.  Transport prices have increased by 4.4%, education costs have increased by 8.9% whereas overall prices have continued to fall this year and have fallen by 3.2% in the year to April, according to the CSO.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">It is easy to forget the extent to which the Government controls prices in the economy through direct charges, indirect taxes and through its regulators.  Among the prices and charges directly set by Government are the television licence fee of €160 a year, the driving licence of €25, the passport fee, if one can get a passport, of €80, the accident and emergency charge of €100, the inpatient charge of €75, the charge to sit the junior certificate or the leaving certificate of approximately €100, the third level registration fee of €1,500 in a country in which supposedly we do not have third level fees, not to mention prescription fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">Businesses and farmers must also pay Government charges, including charges such as a filing fee of €100 that must be paid by a new company, a company annual returns charge of €40, meat inspection fees of €5, an application for a bus or a truck diving licence of €110 and I could continue.  There are the fees charged by the OPW for the Government Publication Service, fees and disposals charged by the OPW, receipts for tests, examinations and analyses by the State Laboratory, valuation tribunal appeal fees, valuation certificates and valuation revision fees.  There is even a fee one is required to pay to the film censor.  There are data protection fees, immigration registration fees, visa fees and fees that must be paid to the Private Security Authority, PSA.  Many Members will be familiar with the problem being experienced in the private security industry on foot of the massive fees being imposed on it by the PSA.  There are fees for nationality and citizenship certificates and fees for firearms.  Many Members will be familiar with the impact that the broadcasting licence fee has had on independent broadcasters in particular this year.  There are veterinary inspection fees on live exports, fees for the inspection of dairy premises, fees from the sale of vaccines and livestock farm produce, fees for seed testing certification fees by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  There are also licensing fees, road transport licence fees, work permit fees charged by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation and employment agency licence fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">There is the statutory levy imposed by An Bord Bia and fees charged by Forfás and the NSAI.  I could go on forever.  A huge number of fees charged by the Government bring in receipts.  Of those I mentioned, receipts bring in approximately €414 million a year.  On top of that are the prices of petrol, diesel and home heating oil which consist, for the most part, of taxes levied by Government, including excise, VAT and the carbon tax.  The Government has raised an extra €5 million so far this year in extra VAT just as a result of the rise in the price of petrol and diesel, which comes on top of what it projects for the budget on that basis.  There are all the prices set or influenced by the Government's regulators, including bus, train and taxi fares which are agreed either by the Minister or the NTA, motorway tolls which are, in some cases, set by the NRA, electricity and gas prices set by the Commissioner for Energy Regulation, telephone and postal charges set by ComReg.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">I take exception to the decision today of Eircom to introduce a price increase by stealth, in the rounding up of the way it calculates bills.  One will be charged for every minute one speaks on the telephone even if it is for only ten seconds of that minute.  There are all the airport charges which are agreed by the Commissioner for Energy Regulation.  We know the extent to which the increases in airport charges have had an impact on tourism.  They have cost us routes to Irish airports and, as a result, are costing us in terms of tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">Despite the recent reductions in electricity prices our household electricity prices are still above average in the euro zone and are among the highest for medium sized industries.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">We should not forgot local authorities which also impose significant costs on businesses and charges on consumers.  These include waste and water charges and on-street parking fees.  We know now that from July there will be VAT of between 13.5% and 21.5% imposed on people who use those services.  It probably will not be imposed on businesses because they would be able to reclaim it from their VAT returns but it will be imposed on consumers.  That will mean the biggest one-year increase in waste and water charges for those who pay them, at a time when prices across the rest of the economy are going down and when, most crucially, incomes are going down.  It is as if the Government wants to squeeze people and businesses.  On the one hand, it reduces people's income through pay cuts and taxation, on the other it increases its own prices or those it controls.  It is essencially a pincer movement against the people, the private sector and the business economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">I welcome that the Government has established a bord snip, as one might call it, for local authorities and I look forward to seeing its report in the coming weeks.  However, it is important that the Government should respond to this quickly, say which recommendations it will implement and which it will not.  It is more than a year since the McCarthy report was published, if I remember correctly, and we still do not know from the Government which recommendations it will implement and which it has decided not to, let alone why.  The Government should respond quickly to the report on efficiency in local government and make an early commitment to split the savings between the Exchequer, taking perhaps 50% to reduce the deficit and using the other 50% to reduce charges to business and consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">As I stated, this Bill does not create a charge on the Exchequer but it requires all Ministers to present to the Dáil within four weeks a plan to reduce by 5% charges set by them.  We estimate the cost of doing this to be in the region of €60 to €70 million in a full year.  It will be up to Ministers to find the necessary savings from their own Vote but this will not be hard.  The McCarthy report contained more than €5 billion worth of savings.  I do not agree with all of them, nor does my party.  However, even identifying and implementing just over 1% of the proposed savings would produce the money necessary to implement this measure.  For example, implementing the proposals on the rationalisation of State agencies, the abolition of quangos or even the proposals on public procurement would provide the €70 million necessary to reduce Government charges across the board and still leave plenty to be saved.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">With regard to the prices set by the Government's regulators, the Bill requires that the Ministers for Transport and Energy, Communications and Natural Resources invoke their powers — which are in existing legislation — to make a policy direction to the regulators, calling on them to publish within three months their proposals to reduce the prices they have set.  The regulators should aim to reduce prices and tariffs to the euro zone average.  When we framed this Bill, we suggested there be an additional 5% cut across the board in all those prices but that cannot be done because energy prices, in particular, are affected by a number of different factors, for example, the price of a barrel of oil.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">However, there is plenty of room for further reductions in regulated prices.  The ESB made a profit of €340 million a year, for example.  Some of that is being used to reduce electricity prices but more of it should be used now to that end.  These are State owned companies and should act in our interest.  At a time of falling incomes, when so many people and businesses are under pressure, those profits should be squeezed to reduce the price of electricity for domestic users and businesses.  The same applies to Bord Gáis which made a profit of €119 million last year.  Again, it does not need to make such big profits this or next year.  Eircom, which increased its prices today, made a profit of €141 million last year.  I do not know what profits Vodafone or O2 made but I imagine they were significant.  They certainly charge more than they do in other countries and I imagine they make more profits here than in other countries.  Those companies can well afford to bear the burden of reducing costs in theseareas.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">The airports, An Post, toll operators and transport companies may find it more difficult to make these savings but they should be able to do so.  Everybody in the public sector, Departments and State agencies, people in their household income and everybody in their private businesses have had to find savings, reduce the amount they spend and do things in a different way.  Those bodies should not be exempt just because they have a commercial remit or aare defined as State companies.  If everybody else has to reduce their charges and prices and find efficiencies they should have to as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">This is a simple Bill but it is an important one.  As a country we must improve our cost competitiveness.  We have fallen from a situation in 1997-1998, when my party handed over the management of this country to the party opposite, where we were, by some measures, the first, second or third most competitive country in the world.  We have fallen now to 23rd place according to one measurement, 31st according to another.  Disappointingly, we continue to slide in the international competitiveness league.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">Competitiveness is about a number of different factors.  It is about costs — of utilities, services and property.  There does not appear to be any co-ordinated Government action plan to restore competitiveness.  There are a great number of plans in other areas and much big talk, there are taskforces and various documents but there is no clear plan from the Government as to how we will address the deficits in competitiveness, not only on the cost side but on the infrastructural side and in Government services to business.  The Government appears to think the only way to reduce costs is to cut wages but it is wrong.  There are other ways to reduce costs and they should be pursued.  In particular, businesses need the boost this Bill would give them by reducing the costs imposed on them by Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">Citizens and consumers need this Bill too.  They have had their incomes and benefits cut and their taxes increased.  Many have lost their jobs.  If the Government can use financial emergency legislation in the public interest to cut pay and benefits, surely it can use the same mechanism to cut Government charges and prices and give consumers and citizens a little relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">At the beginning of my speech, I spoke about the five part crisis, namely, the banking and budgetary crises, the crisis in the real economy and the reputational and social crises.  The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill 2010 is about the crisis in the real economy, about showing the Government understands the concept of fairness and that it is willing to reduce its own prices and charges, not only the wages and benefits of others.  It is about supporting businesses, especially small businesses, by reducing the pressure the Government imposes on businesses through regulation, charges and taxes.    At a time when businesses are suffering from banks not extending credit or squeezing working capital, it should be the case that the Government can assist them in some way, particularly by reducing the burden imposed by Government charges.  In many ways, small and medium enterprises are the backbone of the economy, employing 900,000 people during the boom, a number which has probably fallen to 750,000 or perhaps lower.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">I would hate to see the number fall further so there should be a co-ordinated Government approach to help struggling private sector businesses by introducing legislation that will force land and property owners to bring down rents, continuing to invest in infrastructure rather than cutting back, as is intended, and helping to reduce costs, particularly non-labour costs now that labour costs have decreased.  This Bill is timely, beneficial, sensible, affordable, relevant and doable.  I commend it to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_320">
          <from>Deputy Paul Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_598">I welcome this Bill and congratulate my colleague, Deputy Varadkar, on introducing it.  When the layers are stripped from the issue, it is about competition.  There was a time in the past ten or 12 years when the powers that be believed that irrespective of what happened to our economy, it would be fine as long as the building boom lasted.  Ministers and the ordinary people were blinded by the revenue coming in like it never had before.  They never looked under the canvas to find what was happening in the real economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">In the mid-1990s up to 2001 or 2002, we were very competitive with our industrial exports.  We could see that in Dublin and all over the country, as our industrial complexes were doing well and there was a significant amount of exports through Dublin Port and our airports.  With the product we were manufacturing, we had the ability to beat all competitors around the world.  This is the basis of competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">I will not spend too much time talking about the economic boom as it is what we do from now on that will count rather than being retrospective.  The problem is that it appears for some strange reason there are elements of Government which have taken their eye off the issue we are discussing tonight.  To be blunt, our nation must be able to export pigmeat to Japan, for example.  We were there years ago and for one reason or another we got kicked out.  Essentially, it will be competition and quality that gets us back there.  I remember being on a trip to India with the Minister and it was delightful to see how competitive we were in the area of computers.  There are engineering projects in China as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">We must be able to match the best in the world.  There are several factors alluded to by Deputy Varadkar that I do not have time to go through.  This is not purely about cost.  When the bubble burst in this country, there was only one issue that the Government could see fit to revisit.  Regardless of which party was in government after the bubble burst, it was necessary to go back to the people at a certain level but this Government went back in a big way.  Two Bills were mentioned which implemented a cut in public sector wages and the so-called pension levy.  They have cut deeply into wages and take-home pay, dramatically changing the way people think even more than how they invest and spend.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">I have no doubt the Minister knows what people want because he is a busy constituency worker.  They want to believe that everything within the remit of the State is being done to push prices down and make us more competitive.  It now appears that with all the pain that ordinary working men and women have had to take, we are still not as competitive as we should be.  Unless we implement some of the measures in this Bill, we will not achieve that target.  What is worse is that if we do not try to act in this way, people will stop working with us from a social perspective.  The gulf between the people and the Government will widen, and if this is allowed to continue for years, there could be much social unrest in the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">We know prices fell by 3.5% last year, which is good news.  The problem is that swathes of Irish life not only saw constant prices which were not reduced but also price increases.  There is a simple case in point that everybody will understand; how is it that the cost of providing ordinary drinking water around the country is so expensive?  The price is increasing dramatically, and everybody involved in the system has told me it will only get more costly.  I find it hard to understand why the underlying factors in the production of good clean water mean it will be so expensive.  Anybody examining the matter might also consider the bin charges, which will see an increase next year.  What is behind this?</p>
          <p eId="para_604">The ESB opened a new plant recently in Cork, which is to be welcomed.  There has been a reduction in gas and electricity prices but it has come from a significant and unsustainable height compared with anywhere else in Europe.  Even with lower charges we are ahead of most of the posse in this respect.  When the Minister is replying to the debate, he should give some indication of the Government's actions on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_605">The competitiveness listing for Europe makes for bad reading for Ireland.  Depending on which list is used, we are 23rd, 24th or 31st, which is no place for us.  We were going around Europe with our chests out until two years ago on the basis that some saw us as the richest nation in the world, but that did not last long.  The idea was based on the false foundation of the building bubble.</p>
          <p eId="para_606">Agriculture is the area I may know most about and I know the costs involved in the supply of services to that industry.  There are costs in meat factories involving inspections etc.  When a farmer sells an animal in this country, there are no fewer than eight subscriptions taken from the price of the animal by the time the transaction is complete.  I do not have time to go through every one but none is being reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">When such pressure has come on wages, I do not understand how this has not been filtered right through the economy.  In the private sector, if dentists, doctors or engineers were charging €50 in the past couple of years, I cannot understand why that would not be €45 now.  I am referring to nursing home, health and education charges.  For example, the cost of school travel has experienced one of the greatest jumps of all time with an increase of almost 100%.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">It is against this background that we in this country have some serious thinking to do.  I put it to the Minister, Deputy Pat Carey, and the Minister of State that, if they want to bring the people with them, the Government should at least be seen to be doing what is within its remit.  It cannot do many things, as those issues would be outside the Government's control no matter who was sitting across the floor, but there should be a downward pressure on the cost to consumers of those services for which it has a remit.  This has not occurred to the degree that it should have.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrankFeighan" eId="spk_321">
          <from>Deputy Frank Feighan</from>
          <p eId="para_609">I welcome Deputy Varadkar's Bill.  It is timely, as we have been at the end of an Irish version of one of the greatest pyramid schemes seen in any country.  I come from a business background and have employed people over the years.  We watched as costs rose, including rates, excise duties and the minimum wage.  Most businesses were lured into a false sense of security to the effect that they never had it so good.  Whenever Government or other charges increased, businesses passed the cost on to their customers, who believed they had enough money to pay.  No one searched his or her pockets to discover what was happening because we were told three years ago that we had never had it so good and that we would have a soft landing.  The landing has not been so soft and those who have really lost out are the 450,000 people who are out of work, have found themselves in negative equity and must curtail the lifestyles to which they had grown used.  They may see no future.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">Everyone, not just the Government, must try to get out of this downward spiral.  This starts and ends with jobs.  We must become competitive and examine what has occurred.  In my business, I am considering whether to get rid of a telephone or the Internet, closing down for half a day on a Sunday because the cost of employing someone that day is too exorbitant or having one or one and a half people working instead of three.  This is the situation across the country and, unfortunately, is being reflected in terms of real jobs.  If a business is to survive, one must try to cut, cut, cut.  Even though businesses have done this, most will not survive.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">Is it not easier for Government agencies now to help reduce prices in a bid to stimulate the economy?  Driving to Dublin by car costs €2.90 on the M4 and going to the airport costs €2.  Something could be done, given the rows of traffic pulling in at Kinnegad onto the old back road to save €2.90, and rightly so.  We must reduce tolls and fares to stimulate people into using motorways, which are safer.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">The Government does not have much say in bank charges, but the banks have been bailed out and have curtailed credit to businesses.  When businesses do not get credit, their overdrafts are reduced, which leads to a mad scenario.  If I put my Government cheque into a bank, it will take five working days to clear.  If it does not clear, I will be charged €10.15 for being over the limit.  The knock-on effect of this is costing businesses thousands of euro.  Government charges cost one small business located not far from me €2,000.  When these cheques are not honoured, there is a knock-on effect further down the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">I have raised this issue for at least one and a half years, but the Minister for Finance does not believe any serious problem has come to light.  Wake up and see what is happening.  When these businesses close, people will be unemployed.  We will not be able to afford that.  To make businesses competitive, the Government must cut its charges.  Businesses have already done so and Departments must follow suit.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">In some ways, the property tax is a way for local authorities to gain revenue.  I have been approached by people from the UK who have houses there and are trying to keep their family homes in the west or elsewhere in Ireland open.  Charging them €200 was lousy.  They kept the country going.  Seven or eight people from the UK told me of how they were trying to maintain houses, some of which were only sheds, and that they were being charged €200.  Even when they enter the country they are being hit.  Michael O'Leary of Ryanair could have opened more routes, but no.  The Dublin Airport Authority and most other airport authorities are charging exorbitant landing fees.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">Business must be done.  People are selling two for the price of one and giving considerable discounts.  The Government must examine how to provide further discounts.  My colleague, Deputy Connaughton, highlighted the matter of school transport.  Two years ago, transport for a junior cycle student cost €99 per year.  The charge has increased by 203% to €300 and there is talk of it rising to €500.  This will put people back on the road and undermine the future of school transport.  Local authorities have tried to reduce their rates, but only after 12 or 15 years of adding 3%, 4% and 5%.  Businesses could not afford the rates.  We see what is happening in terms of petrol and excise.  There was a tax rebate in respect of school transport, but we needed to get rid of it under European legislation.  Operators were promised an amendment to the legislation or that some provision would be made to repay them.  One and a half years later and they were virtually given the two fingers.  They will pass on the cost to ordinary children and hard-pressed parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">In terms of the way in which the Government has done business, I welcome the decision by councils in recent days to the effect that, where rental allowance subsidy is concerned, they might have been paying too much.  Across the board, they have reduced the subsidy by 15%.  This is a good idea.  The Government controls the power, so it must start examining how it does business.  Utilities are too expensive and rates and bank charges must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">Last week, I visited England.  I hope we are not following the UK model, which seems to be the case.  On the high street in Cricklewood, various shops had closed.  They employed people and provided services.  The same is occurring in Ireland, as is evident if one drives through any small town or village.  The way in which we have done business is over.  The person who worked 100 or 80 hours per week is no longer there because he or she cannot afford these charges.  Many businesses are being affected.  When they close in ones, twos and threes, jobs are not lost in the thousands.  Rather, they are lost in twos and threes in every town and village.  We must be competitive and reduce our charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Dara Calleary</from>
          <p eId="para_621">The Bill before the House today appears to have a laudable purpose, namely, to reduce the burden of cost on consumers and industry.  I wonder if there is any Deputy in this House who is not in favour of that as a general principle.  However, the reality of the matter is far more complex than allowed for in the proposals presented.  The Bill simply bears no relation to budgetary or economic realities, and I am opposing the Bill on this basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">The background to today's debate is the profoundly difficult budgetary situation in which we find ourselves.  These circumstances require an ongoing, credible plan of fiscal consolidation so that the amount of money spent by the State is more in line with the amount of revenues being brought in to the Exchequer.  Difficult expenditure adjustments have been necessary as part of this process, and it is undoubtedly the case that further savings measures will have to be identified.  The level and nature of charges applied in the Government sector is one element of this overall picture, and it is folly to state that fees and charges can be universally cut without any implications for maintaining front line public services or for protecting services to the most vulnerable.  If services are to be protected, then cutting public fees and charges across the board would invariably lead to eitheran increase in direct taxation, orreductions in expenditure over and above the level of consolidation already identified.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">The Government has its own plan to improve the quality and efficiency of State services, including in the regulation sector.  We have put in place well-developed mechanisms to protect the most vulnerable households from any undue burden from taxes, fees or charges from the State sector.  We have a plan to turn this economy around, to put our public finances back on a stable footing, and to get our banks lending again to businesses in the interests of job creation and economic growth.  Those are the only real and lasting approaches to helping our citizens and our businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">This Bill would completely undermine the long-established and carefully developed systems of independent regulation in this country.  The overall objective of economic regulation, in markets where there were traditionally natural monopolies, is to create the conditions for competition to emerge to help drive down prices.  We see today that competition is now emerging in the gas and electricity markets and consumers now have a choice of service providers.  Competition, more than anything else, will drive down costs for businesses and for the general public alike.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">Under legislation passed by these Houses, the costs of regulators are funded from industry levies rather than central taxation.  The Government is aware of the need to ensure that these levies do not present a disproportionate burden on the industry sectors that they regulate.  There are already a number of legislative controls in place on the setting of levies and the Government has moved to strengthen these.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">In line with the programme for Government, the performance of regulators in key economic areas such as communication, energy and transport has been carefully reviewed.  The Government has already moved to strengthen the mechanisms for assessing the performance of regulators and to monitor their delivery on the strategic objectives and priorities set for them.  Specifically, the Government's statement on economic regulation in October 2009 laid down the following principles.  First, in the context of future revisions to the legislation governing regulators, Departments will be asked to put in place arrangements for increased scrutiny of expenditure plans and the setting of industry levies, including approval of these by relevant Ministers, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance.  Second, the views of the National Consumer Agency and any industry and consumer panels or advisory councils will be sought in examining the regulator's draft estimate of income and expenditure for each financial year.  This will include any levies it is intended to prescribe and any observations should be communicated to relevant Ministers before these are approved.  Third, the potential for the joint collection of levies across regulators will also be pursued in line with the recommendations of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">More generally, the question of whether the activities of individual regulators represent value for money compared to their international counterparts must be kept under review in the context of the functions which they actually perform and their impact on the wider economy.  It is important to note that regulators' functions can vary widely across jurisdictions.  However, in the light of current economic circumstances, it is imperative that efficiencies are realised.  The issue of effectiveness and value for money will also be considered in the context of the amalgamations set out in the statement, as well as the improved performance evaluation framework.  These principles have been put in place to ensure the smoother and more efficient functioning of the regulators in all areas, consistent with the current regulatory framework.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">The proposed Bill takes no account whatsoever of the existing legal and administrative framework.  The Bill looks like it was written for another age — the age of a command and control economy when Ministers could issue diktats to monopoly providers.  Those days are thankfully long gone.  EU directives and a modern, dynamic system of public administration mean that large parts of our economy are subject to regulatory frameworks, with in-built mechanisms for driving efficiency and for ensuring that consumers get the best value.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">The Government is firmly committed to increasing competition as the best means of exerting downward pressure on electricity prices and is committed to ensuring diversity of energy supplies, with a particular focus on renewable energy, to reduce our exposure to volatile external fuel prices.  The Government supports continued significant investment in Ireland's electricity and gas networks to underpin security and reliability of supply.  Our policy is now delivering real and measurable benefits to energy consumers through increased competition and lower energy prices.  All consumers now have the option of switching to alternative suppliers, offering significant discounts on regulated electricity and gas tariffs.  The all-island wholesale single electricity market has been hailed as a flagship for regional markets throughout the EU.  Its transparent pricing mechanisms encourage investment and ensure that falling fuel prices are passed on to consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_630">Competition is also developing in the Irish gas market.  There are now eight licensed suppliers operating in the upper end of the market.  The recent publication of EU price comparisons by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland demonstrates that Irish electricity and gas prices are continuing to move close to and in some cases below EU averages.  Prices in Ireland are falling, while they are increasing in many member states.  The clear objective of energy policy and regulation in Ireland is to deliver competitive, secure and sustainable energy supplies.  In this context, the Fine Gael proposal for a ministerial direction to the regulator on energy prices is unnecessary and has the potential to undermine competition, market stability and much needed investment in the electricity market.</p>
          <p eId="para_631">In short, we cannot take a narrow, piecemeal approach in these matters or try to impose short-term price reductions which are unsustainable and damaging to competition in the longer term.  There is no quick fix in these matters which the regulators, or anyone else, can propose.  The proposed Bill would lead to <i>ad hoc</i> interventions in regulated areas and in the long run would undermine the regulators’ key role in ensuring the lowest prices possible consistent with stable, secure and competitive energy markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">The Government is well aware of the need to protect vulnerable households from suffering any undue burden from public fees and charges.  In fact, there are widespread exemptions, subsidies and reliefs stitched right into the range of public service charging mechanisms.  There are also targeted reliefs and benefits in a number of areas, including the fuel allowance, free telephone allowance and free television licence for social welfare recipients.  There are about 1.3 million holders of medical cards who are protected from the burden of fees and charges in the health area.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">The simple fact is that it makes no sense to look at the issue of public fees and charges in isolation from the other elements of the budgetary and economic strategy, or to present them in a populist or facile fashion.  What is required is a balanced, rational and strategic approach to managing our economy, in a way that deals with the full spectrum of budgetary and economic issues.  This is precisely the sort of approach that the Government has now put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">Central to our economic recovery plan is the major process of fiscal consolidation to restore the public finances to a sustainable position over the medium term.  This process of expenditure consolidation was initiated in the 2008 budget, when an efficiency review of all administrative spending across the whole public service was announced.  This included possible inefficiencies due to the multiplicity of boards and agencies, the need for better sharing of certain services, and efficiencies in management, travel and consumables in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">The next major step was taken in July 2008, when a range of efficiency and savings measures were put into effect by the Minister for Finance, including those identified as a result of the efficiency review process.  These savings included a 3% reduction in payroll costs for all Departments, State agencies and local authorities — other than front line health and education services — and a 50% reduction in expenditure on consultancies, advertising and public relations by Departments and agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">In the 2009 budget,the Minister for Finance announced a programme of rationalising State bodies and agencies.  The Minister also announced the establishment of the special group on public service numbers and expenditure programmesin November 2008, with a remit to identify potential savings in all areas of Government expenditure, including through reducing the number of staff working in the public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">By the start of 2009, international forecasts for the global economy had been revised sharply downwards, reflecting the effects of worldwide upheavals in the financial markets.  Against this backdrop, we set out a revised multi-annual fiscal consolidation plan in January 2009, with the objective of bringing the overall deficit back within the 3% ceiling in a credible manner.  That multi-annual plan remains, broadly speaking, in effect today, and our subsequent policy actions have been designed to implement and to underpin that consolidation drive.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">Accordingly, further programme and payroll savings of approximately €3.5 billion were announced in the first half of 2009.  The main element of the February package of measures was the introduction of the public service pension-related pay deduction.  This deduction was also applied to the various regulators mentioned this evening.  Additional capital and efficiency measures were also announced at that time, including a 25% reduction in the rates of the domestic travel and subsistence allowances and an 8% reduction in fees paid for professional services, many of which were referred to this evening.  The supplementary budget in April 2009 continued the process begun by these earlier savings measures, consolidating the expenditure reductions through a range of programme savings.  Most recently, the budget for 2010 delivered expenditure reductions of an additional €4 billion, achieved through a combination of payroll, social welfare and other programme adjustments, reflecting the sharp fall in the price levels across the economy over the course of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">All of these measures, difficult though many of them have been for everybody, are designed to restore our credibility and to sustain confidence among households, the domestic business sector and the international investment community.  So far, we have been successful in this endeavour.  The budget for 2011is the vital next step in this plan and again the Government stands ready to do what is necessary to protect our economy and our future prosperity.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">We will not achieve that task on the basis of distractions and ill-thought-out proposals of the sort embodied in the Bill.  On this basis the Government opposes the Bill and I call on the House to do likewise.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_325">
          <from>Minister for Transport (Deputy Noel Dempsey)</from>
          <p eId="para_641">I am delighted to have the opportunity to address some of the issues raised by the Bill.  I must start by stating it is a very flawed Bill, notwithstanding the attempt it is making to piggy-back on some of the measures already adopted by the Government in dealing with other sectors through the legislation that had to be passed over the past 12 to 18 months.  As my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, stated it is flawed because it simplistically attempts to impose the same approach on sectors where it is entirely inappropriate.  In the time available to me, I want to take some examples from my area of responsibility in transport to show how simplistic the analysis is that underpins the Bill and what the real implications would be if we were foolish enough to accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">I will begin by examining bus and train fares.  I do not think it is a secret from anybody in the House that CIE faces very severe financial constraints; it is in a very severe financial position which is not sustainable.  Despite the fact that it has a huge level of Exchequer support, in the region of almost €300 million for the provision of public service obligations, PSOs, the group had an overall deficit last year of €77.7 million.  That deficit is as a result of falling passenger numbers, caused by the economic downturn, the constraints put on the Exchequer subvention in recent years and the fact that fares have been frozen since the end of 2008.  All of these have contributed to that deficit.  The CIE group of companies must reduce the deficit and is doing so by producing a range of cost reductions and increasing efficiencies, and in some cases it has had to put in place service reductions.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">As recommended in the Deloitte report, Dublin Bus is engaged in reshaping its network to improve services and provide better value for the customer and the taxpayer.  Bus Éireann is similarly seeking to provide a comprehensive range of services in a more streamlined and efficient manner.  Equally, Iarnród Éireann is committed to maintaining the quality of the commuter and mainline services, despite the resource constraints it faces.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">It is not possible to add a requirement to CIE to reduce fares.  That would severely compromise the already reduced revenue base.  Prior to a 9% increase in fares in 2003 CIE fares had declined by approximately 20% in real terms over the previous ten years.  Referring back to my previous role as Minister with responsibility for energy, one of the major reasons we had such increases in electricity prices up to two years or 18 months ago was because for the previous ten or 15 years prices had not been allowed to increase in line with inflation.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">CIE fares had declined by approximately 20% in real terms over the ten years up to 2003.  From then until the end of 2008, annual increases were improved due to increased operating costs.  However, no increase was approved in 2009 or 2010.  The fare increases granted previously were to try to sustain the financial health of the CIE companies.  I want the CIE companies, and I have made it clear to them, to minimise the impact on their finances of the current recession so they can intensify their efforts to increase the modal share of public transport and to respond when passenger demand increases in line with economic recovery.  Jeopardising CIE finances through imposing fare reductions does not serve the promotion of public transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">In the past year we have seen significant changes in the institutional and legislative arrangements with the establishment of the National Transport Authority and the passing of the Public Transport Regulation Act.  Direct award public service contracts are now in place and they represent the new way of doing business between the funding authority, the NTA, and the CIE group of companies.  They provide a more formal basis for the allocation and monitoring of Exchequer support for the loss-making and socially and economically necessary PSOs.  These changes will help to ensure the taxpayer and the consumer get the best possible value from our public transport services.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Delivering a quality driving test service is critical to the promotion of safe road use among learners and newly qualified drivers.  The fee for a standard car test is €75.  That fee is below the economic cost of providing the test.  The Road Safety Authority plans to deliver 145,000 driving tests in 2010 and a higher number if demand increases.  The RSA has significantly reduced input costs this year and it has maintained wait times under the national average target of ten weeks.  Reducing the test fee by 5% would reduce RSA income by €525,000 but it would cause a significant deterioration in the average waiting times nationally and the authority would not be able to maintain testing at all of the current test centres.  The only alternative would be for the Exchequer to make up the lost income and the Exchequer is not in a position to do so.  What the Fine Gael Bill proposes is transferring some of the cost of the test from the user, the person who has to do the test, onto the shoulders of the taxpayer and I do not think the taxpayer will thank them for that.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">In regard to the driver theory test, again it is delivered by a private company, which successfully tendered for it.  The fee for the theory test is very competitive and is currently self-funding.  Any reduction in the fee will require the Exchequer to subsidise the service and make payments to the private company to compensate for lost income due to the reduced test fees.  Cost reductions and efficiencies have already been secured and the recent tendering process has validated those costs.  Reducing fees will inevitably lead to the closure of smaller theory test centres, increase the waiting times again and result in a requirement for some element of Exchequer funding.  The current fee is €34.60 and the RSA plans to deliver 120,000 theory tests this year.  A 5% reduction in test fees would require an additional Exchequer subsidy of €213,600 if service reductions are to be avoided.  Fine Gael wants to transfer some of the cost of the theory test from the beneficiary to the taxpayer generally, something for which it would not thank it.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">As regards the National Car Test, NCT service, the RSA recently tendered and awarded the contract to a private company for a ten-year period, commencing on 4 January 2010.  The new contract provided for an enhanced service with additional test items, new test centres and other enhancements over the life of the contract.  The RSA managed to secure those enhancements while not increasing the fee to the public and it will be in a position to hold the current test fee for at least three years.  The current test fee is €50 and the RSA plans to test up to 1 million vehicles this year.  Reducing this fee by 5% would produce a shortfall of €2.5 million and the contractor concerned would have to be funded by the Exchequer to cover the shortfall.  The bottom line is that a contractor has been awarded the contract following a European Union tendering process and best value has been demonstrably achieved.  In those kind of circumstances there is no basis in which to demand a reduction in fees unless the taxpayer will make up the shortfall.  There is no reason the taxpayer should do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">The Bill also seeks to cover motorway tolls.  There are eight toll schemes on the national road infrastructure in Ireland.  There will be nine when the M3 opens on Friday and ten when the Limerick tunnel opens later this summer.  The majority of toll schemes are operated by public private partnership companies under concession contracts, such as the M1 Drogheda bypass, the M4 Kilcock-Kinnegad motorway, the M6 Galway-Ballinasloe motorway, the M8 Rathcormac-Fermoy motorway, the M25 Waterford city bypass and the M7 and M8 motorway which covers Portlaoise, Cullahill and Castletown.  The M3 Clonee-Kells motorway will also be included in this category when it opens on Friday.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">The public private partnership contracts were awarded on the basis of an agreed tolling arrangement and the terms, including those related to toll charges, cannot readily be changed.  To do so would be an inappropriate interference with contractually binding agreements entered into with private investors.  The contract provides that public private partnerships tolls are linked to inflation under the various by-laws relating to motorway tolls.  Those by-laws provide for an upward-only review of the tolls.  If the NRA was to seek a reduction——</p>

          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
          <p eId="para_652">Is that not the problem?  They are linked to inflation and not deflation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_327" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
          <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_653">If the NRA was to seek a reduction in the tolls then the operator would seek compensation from the State for the shortfall.  Guess who would pay for it?  The taxpayer.  The NRA operates the other two national road toll facilities, namely, the Dublin Port tunnel and the M50, and the revenues accrue directly to it.  It is responsible for setting the toll rates charged for using these facilities and it can adjust the rates annually in line with the rate of inflation, as measured by the consumer price index.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">In the case of the M50, the average annual inflation rate for 2008 of 4.1% would have given rise to an increase in toll rates of 10 cent.  The NRA decided not to increase the toll on all vehicle categories at that time.  For 2010 all toll rates, except the car toll, have been reduced by 10% in line with deflation.  The car toll has been maintained at €2 for the third consecutive year.  In effect, this means that the car toll is in line with inflation when measured over the period 2008-09.  All net revenue generated from tolling on the M50 is used by the NRA to cover the buy-out clause of the Westlink and the M50 upgrade.  Any revenue loss arising from a reduction in these tolls would have to be made up by the taxpayer generally rather than directly by the users.  I do not think the taxpayer would favour that.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">The Dublin Port tunnel is used primarily for traffic demand management purposes and not to raise revenue.  The tunnel relieves surface road congestion in Dublin city by diverting heavy goods vehicles from Dublin Port directly onto the motorway.  This has positive knock-on effects for bus users, pedestrians and cyclists travelling along the city quays, including better quality air and safer travel.  It is, therefore, not appropriate that this toll be adjusted in line with inflation but that it is determined on the basis of ensuring it continues to function effectively in terms of traffic management.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">In January 2010 the NRA made significant reductions in port tunnel charges in order to alleviate congestion in the city because the tunnel could safely accommodate extra exiting capacity as a result of the progress on the M1 and M50 roadworks and the opening of the new Macken Street bridge.  Peak rates reduced from €12 to €10 and a new off-peak rate of €3 was introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">As regards airport charges, the Bill would require me to invoke powers under section 10 of the Aviation Regulation Act to direct the Commission for Aviation Regulation, CAR, to publish a proposal to reduce charges.  In fact, I have no such power.  Section 10 of the Aviation Regulation Act allows the Minister for Transport to issue general policy directions to CAR.  There is no provision for the issue of specific directions in regard to charges.  In this context it is the responsibility of CAR, under the Act, to balance a range of different considerations, including traffic forecasts and projected operating costs, together with investment costs, before arriving at its decision on charges at Dublin Airport.  It would not be appropriate to interfere in that legislative arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">CAR made its determination for 2010-14 as recently as 2009.  In making this determination it reviewed all relevant factors, including the projected operating costs, the commercial revenues, traffic figures and financial commitments relating to the major investment programme at Dublin Airport.  CAR's analysis did, therefore, take into account the projected cost environment in the economy and it has set very stringent operating cost targets for the DAA in the 2010-14 regulatory period.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">Overall, the Bill seeks to be populist but in reality it demonstrates a fundamental misunderstanding of the realties of transport charges.  It ignores some of the basic facts, such as its claims that the CIE companies are heavily loss making and are engaged in major efficiency programmes to rectify this and that driving test fees do not reflect the full cost of providing the service, despite the efficiencies which have been achieved, and the fact that the theory test and the NCT have been awarded by competitive tendering and the fact that CAR already determines airport charges by a rigorous process.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">In short, the approach embodied in the Bill is, in so far as transport charges are concerned, grossly over simplistic and would be greatly detrimental to services and, therefore, to the consumer.  The Bill tries to perpetuate the myth that there is such a thing as a free lunch.  One would have thought that even Fine Gael would know that is not true.  It should also know that we have a very sophisticated electorate which is not easily fooled by populist rhetoric.  If Fine Gael believes it can fool the electorate with Bills such as this it will learn to its cost that it cannot.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">In the transport area the effect of what Fine Gael proposes is very simple. Instead of ensuring those who use the services pay the full economic cost, they want to transfer the cost to taxpayers even though many will not be using the services.  I do not think the taxpayers of this country will thank them for that.</p>

          <p eId="para_664">I want to outline the Labour Party's analysis of this Bill.  I studied it with great interest and welcome its engagement with the real economy.  I am afraid, however, that the Government's response consists of a rather dry rebuttal.  I will begin by addressing the assumptions on which the Bill appears to be built.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">When the costs are aggregated, the net loss to Government revenue arrives at a certain figure and it is reasonable to investigate how that gap can be filled.  The explanatory memorandum to the Bill suggests that the shortfall can be met through the proposals of the so-called McCarthy report, such as the elimination of quangos and wastage.  This is perhaps the weakest element of the proposed Bill.  The lack of specificity leaves it open to the suggestion that the services that might be lost and the employment necessary to sustain such services would be significant.  An alternative would be to seek to recover from general taxation such funds as would fill the gap in revenue.  This, however, would contradict one of the central deflationary assumptions of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">I will be positive by suggesting an analysis of the economy which is radically different to that put forward by both major parties.  We are not in dispute about certain facts, perhaps the most frightening of which are the 430,000 people who are unemployed.  I agree with Deputy Varadkar when he suggests that we should consider the report of the National Economic and Social Council on the different crises that we face, namely, a banking crisis, a fiscal crisis, a real economy crisis and a social crisis.  I propose to speak about the social crisis because the weakness in the Government's response to this Bill is its continued clinging to a residual theory of the real economy.  It described yet again the adjustment to the outrageous collapse in the banking system but it cannot deny the obvious gap between income and expenditure which is the basis of the fiscal crisis and it falls down entirely in its analysis of the implications for unemployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">If one wanted to approach the matter differently I would suggest beginning with the social crisis to which the National Economic and Social Council refers and the consequences for unemployment.  In trying to reconstruct citizenship in an atmosphere of lost trust and institutional bankruptcy, we would be better off speaking about a social floor.  If, for example, we want a productive economy in an inclusive society, we could define a social floor below which citizens can not be allowed to fall.  We could then consider discretionary consumption above the social floor and the different ways this could be structured.  In the absence of a social floor and the necessary social protection legislation to sustain it, we will not address the unemployment problem or exclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">The National Economic and Social Council report discusses the social consequences of unemployment.  If the economy is deflated in such a way that the unemployment figure is increased we will lose taxation, increase the cost of social welfare provision and, most importantly, erode solidarity and social cohesion by contributing to social misery.  This debate has revealed some interesting facts about the two major parties in regard to the role of the State.  On behalf of the Labour Party, I assert that the State has a role to play in social protection and establishing a social floor which would make inclusion possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">Beyond this, however, we should also investigate the role of regulators.  Deputy Varadkar usefully draws attention to the role of the regulator in his Bill.  In a speech to the UCD law society former EU Commissioner, David Byrne, spoke about the relationship between the Minister and the regulator.  I believe it is unconstitutional for a Minister to the divest him or herself of responsibility to the Dáil.  No Minister can give away functions for which he or she has constitutional responsibility.  When one transfers powers to a regulator one is expected to do so in a way that makes it perfectly clear where policy begins and administration ends.  One of the problems with the regulatory framework which the Government is so anxious to defend is the lack of clarity on the boundary between policy and administration.  This problem arises, for example, between the Minister for Health and Children and the HSE.  I do not believe that Minister was entitled either under the Constitution or by law to divest her responsibilities to the HSE, particularly in respect of accountability to this House.  A close reading of Mr. Byrne's paper would support my assertion.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">The contribution from the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Calleary, revealed Fianna Fáil's extraordinary mixture of ideologies.  He claimed, for example, that competition will automatically sort everything out and then referred to telecommunications and infrastructure.  What we have done in the area of telecommunications has been a nightmare.  A State company that was quite capable of expanding our infrastructure to bring us into the modern age was used to make a speculative run at the markets and four or five owners later our infrastructural deficit is disastrous.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">I cannot agree with Deputy Varadkar's proposed reductions in respect of the licence fee, which sustains public service broadcasting.  The right of citizens to participate in the common discourse and have access to education, information and entertainment should be sustained rather than abandoned to the commercial market.  We have already paid a heavy price in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">As I do the sums on the savings of €5 here and €10 there, I am reminded of the oldest principle in taxation, that the administration of gathering such adjustments should not exceed the yield itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">I am afraid the Bill does not stand the test in this regard.  It would create a large gap and the unemployment and services consequences of filling this gap remain unspecified.  For this reason, on behalf of the Labour Party, I must refrain from supporting the Bill as it stands.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_331">
          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_674">I thank Deputy Michael D. Higgins and the Labour Party for sharing time.  It is unfortunate that the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, left the Chamber.  Having had occasion to serve on the Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment with the then Deputy, I found him to be an eminently sensible person who was focused on trying to find solutions to our problems.  He stated, however, that the Government has "put in place well-developed mechanisms to protect the most vulnerable households from any undue burden from taxes, fees or charges from the State sector."  What is it about Government Buildings that transforms an otherwise sensible person into someone who would make such a statement?  When one considers the devastation visited on people on low incomes and welfare, it is clear this statement emanates from cloud cuckoo land.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">The Green Party, when in Opposition, consisted of reasonably sensible people with a social conscience interested in trying to organise a decent society.  This, at any rate, is what its members proclaimed at the time and I, like a number of other voters, believed them.  What emerged when the Green Party entered Government Buildings?  I will not go there but will instead deal with the Fine Gael Party's Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">While this legislation is not perfect, I support in principle what it seeks to achieve, namely, a reduction in the cost of doing business and the removal of the burden of the State from the backs of businesses and ordinary householders.  I support this concept in general and do not propose to elaborate on the specifics of the Bill.  The more appropriate course of action is to discuss the Government's reaction to the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">The Minister for Transport made excuses for the difference in contractual provisions on toll charges as between public private partnerships and the National Roads Authority.  The Government made a hames of the contracts with PPP companies when it agreed them.  No one on this side of the House inserted a clause stipulating that only inflation could dictate changes in the level of toll charges and deflation would not be considered.  Despite the fact that he and his colleagues were responsible for these contracts, the Minister proclaimed this evening that the Government was powerless to do anything about them as to do so would leave the poor taxpayer having to pick up the tab.  Taxpayers would not have to pick up the tab if the Minister and his colleagues had considered the issue at the time.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">We also heard Government party Members refer to competitiveness.  This returns me to the issue of tolls.  Thankfully, as a result of the Celtic tiger, the sweat of many working people and the substantial contribution of entrepreneurs to the Exchequer, we have a number of new motorways.  Rather than encouraging greater use of the motorway network, we are fleecing drivers who choose to use it.  Motorways are designed to get one from point A to point B as quickly and safely as possible.  One of the most competitive attributes a business can acquire is an ability to shift its people and products quickly from point A to point B.  The system does not work in this way because we are ripping off businesses at every opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">On energy costs, I return to the interesting contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_680">The overall objective of economic regulation, in markets where there were traditionally natural monopolies, is to create the conditions for competition to emerge to help drive down prices.  We see today that competition is now emerging in the gas and electricity markets and consumers now have a choice of service providers.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">Consumers may have a choice of providers but the ESB is not allowed to reduce its charges.  Although the company may be allowed to reduce prices at the start of 2011, it is prevented from doing so now under a directive the Government issued to the Commission for Energy Regulation.  As a result, we enjoy — dare I use that word — what are among the highest energy costs in Europe.  This is the direct result of a Government policy which seeks to create competition through the establishment of an artificial market.  As everyone knows, competition must be real because artificial competition will be found out, as was the case with the recent property bubble.  The Government has been completely wrong-footed in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">Despite a reduction of 10.4% in ESB charges in slightly more than one year, electricity prices remain exorbitant by any standard.</p>

          <p eId="para_684">Businesses cannot operate without energy.  In some cases, the more energy a business uses, the more productive it is.  The Government, however, is hammering business.  While I fully support measures to incentivise green energy to meet our carbon commitments, this must not be done in a token, artificial manner to raise funds, as was evident in the most recent budget.  Green Party members clapped themselves on the back as if they had done something wonderful when, in reality, they ripped off the poor old motorist, householder and consumer.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">The Government does not listen to real people such as small business owners.  I will give an example of what it is doing wrong.  Among the issues discussed by the Minister for Transport were train journeys.  I used to travel frequently by train between Dundalk and Dublin but have not used the train service in more than two years because Iarnród Éireann introduced car parking charges of €2 for each use of the carpark.  If one parks at a railway station and is caught overnight in Dublin or elsewhere, one will find one's car clamped on one's return.  As someone with a background in business, I would have taken a completely different decision from that foisted on train passengers.  I would have tried to make travelling by train attractive by spending a few thousand quid to erect a shelter from the railway station to the centre of the carpark.  This would have provided commuters with some shelter on wet mornings and allowed them to reach the station without getting soaked.  Iarnród Éireann has taken the wrong approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">On the issue of signage, if someone wants to erect a sign either advertising his or her business or giving directions, he or she must pay the local authority a €650 fee per sign per annum.  I am lucky because I live in the Cooley Mountains and constituents in bother who do not know my number find it difficult to find me because they must traverse several boreens and twists and turns to reach me or my business.  It is ridiculous that companies in rural areas that need to erect a sign for directional purposes to allow suppliers or customers find the business without first calling into every house along the way must pay this licence fee.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">The Government informs us it is addressing competitiveness.  Competitiveness is being used by the Government as an excuse to reduce the minimum wage and get stuck into the very people the Minister of State, Deputy Calleary, said it was supporting.  It is utter nonsense to claim the Government is supporting people on the margins.  It is time the Government started to listen to someone on this side.  Adopting the principle behind this Fine Gael Party Bill would not be a bad start.</p>

          <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
          <p eId="para_689">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_690">I commend the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Carbon Revenue Levy) Bill 2010 to the House.  I am very pleased to have this opportunity to present the Bill for consideration and I thank the Opposition Deputies for their co-operation in ensuring that it can be addressed today.  Carbon windfall gains will only exist up to the end of 2012 which means that we only have a very limited window to recover these gains and a failure to enact the legislation in this session would see that window shrink considerably.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">I know this subject is close to Deputy Coveney's heart in particular.  His Private Members' motion of June 2008 set out the policy on this extremely complex matter.  This legislation required substantial work to be undertaken by my Department, involving legal discussions with the Office of the Attorney General and much technical work in concert with the Commission for Energy Regulation.  Electricity consumers did not lose out during this period of examination as the ESB, which is the largest electricity generator receiving the majority of the carbon windfall gains, provided a €300 million rebate which was used to reduce prices for all electricity consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">I propose to outline the background to the legislation and the structure of the electricity market that gives rises to carbon windfall gains for electricity generators, followed by a brief outline of the major provisions of the legislation.  I hope that this can be accomplished relatively quickly to allow more time for me to get the views of the Opposition Members of the House in advance of the Committee Stage, which I believe is provisionally scheduled for next week.  I have already held an informal briefing session for Deputies off-site on these measures and officials from my Department will also be happy to provide clarifications on any issues that may arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">The main purpose of this Bill is to recover a substantial portion of the unearned carbon windfall gains that electricity generators are currently receiving through the single electricity market.  Electricity generators are receiving these windfall gains because the market structure allows them to pass through to consumers the full opportunity cost of their carbon, in other words, what they would get for selling their carbon allowances.  However, the generators receive the vast majority of their carbon allowances for free.  This gives them a profit without any significant commensurate cost and it is these windfall profits that the levy will recover.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">The European Union and its member states, including Ireland, are signatories to the Kyoto Protocol, which requires reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases by specific amounts.  The EU emissions trading directive, Directive 2003/87/EC, was implemented to assist member states in achieving these targets by establishing a carbon trading regime whereby large emitters of greenhouse gases were required to possess allowances for their emissions.  Article 10 of the directive requires member states to allocate at least 90% of the allowances free of charge in phase two of the emissions trading scheme which runs from 2008 to 2012.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">The directive was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading) Regulations 2004, SI 437 of 2004.  These regulations led to the creation of national allocation plans which determined how the allowances were to be allocated sector by sector.  Under the Irish national allocation plan covering phase two of the ETS, which runs from 2008 to 2012, electricity generators receive the vast bulk of their required carbon allowances for free with only a small amount of the allowances auctioned.  The individual allocation to each generator is based upon an average of its emissions in the period 2003 to 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">Although generators receive the majority of their allowances for free, they are only able to monetise them through a decision taken by the single electricity market committee, which governs the operation of the all-island wholesale electricity market.  In a decision paper published in March 2008, the SEM committee determined that regardless of how they receive the carbon allowances, all electricity generators must include the full opportunity cost of carbon in the bids they submit to the gross mandatory pool of the single electricity market.  The net effect of this decision was to raise the wholesale cost of electricity by the opportunity cost of carbon faced by the marginal generator in the single electricity market, which in turn impacts the retail cost of electricity to all consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">However, as noted earlier, since generators receive the vast majority of these carbon permits for free, the higher system marginal price leads to increased profits for all generators in the market without any significant commensurate cost.  These unearned gains are what we call carbon windfall gains and it is these gains that the carbon revenue levy seeks to recover.  The levy will recover most, but not all, of the windfall profits that accrue to generators by requiring each electricity generator to pay a sum equal to its emissions on a quarterly basis, multiplied by the average price of carbon over that period, further modified by a percentage rate of 65%.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">Technical and administrative restraints make it impossible in practice to determine the exact windfall gains that accrue to each electricity generator.  In order to develop a levy that is workable, we have had to base the levy upon an approximation of the gains that are accruing to generators.  To do this we are placing a levy upon each generator's total emissions, multiplied by the average price of carbon over the levy period.  Calculating the levy in this way means that we do not have to consider the source of the generator's allowances, the internalised value they may represent to the generator or that portion of the emissions that may be attributable to the in-house consumption of the generator.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">Using this methodology potentially creates the risk of placing a levy upon generators that would actually be in excess of the windfall gains that they are earning.  Therefore, I have specified in the legislation that the levy will applied at a rate of 65%.  This rate can be modified by ministerial order, following advice from the commission on the operation of the levy and a public consultation.  I am satisfied that 65% represents an equitable return for the State at this stage.  Some electricity generators claim that they already use some of their gains from the carbon windfall to offer lower electricity prices to their customers via their supply arms.  Allowing generators to retain a portion of their windfall gains ensures that we do not entirely eliminate the scope for generators to pass carbon windfall gains on to consumers through their supply arms if they so wish.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">Generating stations which are the subject of the public service obligation order made under section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act are exempt from the carbon levy.  In the case of conventional PSO plant such as the peat generating stations, Aughinish and Tynagh, these generators are not earning any carbon windfall profits.  Since the levy is specifically designed to recover unearned carbon windfall gains, where there is no windfall gain there can be no levy liability.  The gains arising from the incorporation of carbon to PSO plant accrue to electricity customers through reduced PSO costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">With regard to the renewable plant in the PSO, renewable generators create no emissions and as such have no carbon allowances allocated by the EPA.  Therefore, there is no basis upon which to levy renewable generators.  The original purpose of the emissions trading scheme was to incentivise and make renewable electricity generation more competitive than conventional generation.  Exempting renewable generators from the levy is, therefore, in keeping with the spirit of the directive.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">It is anticipated, based upon modelling work undertaken by the CER, assisted by EirGrid, that setting the percentage rate at 65% will lead to the collection of approximately €75 million over the first 12 months of the operation of the levy.  Of course, these sums are based on certain assumptions and any deviation from the assumptions made in the modelling work has the potential to affect levy proceeds.  For example, changes in the price of carbon will directly affect the sums raised by the levy.  Increases will see the levy raise additional sums, while falls in the price of carbon will see levy receipts decrease.  The windfall profits earned by generators are of course affected in the same way.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">It is also possible that changes in underlying fossil fuel prices could affect levy receipts if the changes are big enough to shift the dispatch schedule of the market.  For example, at present, with gas prices at historical lows, gas plants tend to be cheaper to operate than coal plants.  In the Irish market this means that over the past year Moneypoint has run considerably less than it would otherwise have expected to.  Since coal is particularly carbon intensive this means that our emissions are currently lower than would otherwise have been expected.  Therefore, if gas prices were to increase enough that Moneypoint is dispatched before gas plant this would increase the sums raised by the levy, as coal is a more carbon intensive fuel than gas and ESB's emissions would be higher.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">The legislation provides that proceeds from the levy will be disbursed into or for the benefit of the Exchequer.  The CER will be collecting and accounting for levy proceeds on behalf of the Government and I, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, will direct the CER as to how the levy proceeds should be disbursed in line with Government policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">Protection of the competitiveness of Irish enterprise is a key motivator of this legislation.  The large energy users that will benefit are significant employers with both indigenous and multinational bases.  Electricity costs are a key part of the competitive pressures on large energy users in Ireland, particularly energy-intensive exporters or those that are part of large multinationals which regularly review and benchmark costs across multiple locations.  The Government is of the view that it is imperative to take all possible actions to support the enterprise sector and employment by focusing efforts on reducing costs, where we can, for large energy users.</p>
          <p eId="para_706">The levy will come to an end at the close of 2012 as after that date all carbon allowances will be auctioned, rather than allocated to generators for free.  This will end the issue of the windfall profits.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">I now propose to outline the main provisions of the Bill.  For the convenience of the House an explanatory memorandum provides a synopsis of the provisions of the Bill.  Part 1 of the Bill is a standard provision concerning definitions.  Part 2 of the Bill is an amendment to section 9 of the Electricity Regulation Act of 1999, assigning the collection and recovery of the carbon revenue levy to the CER as a new statutory function.  Part 3 is the substance of the Bill.  It inserts a new Part into the Electricity Regulation Act 1999 and deals with the calculation and collection of the levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">Section 40B contains the definitions which are used in the new Part.  The bulk of these definitions come from SI 437 of 2004, which is the Irish implementation of Directive 2003/87/EC which establishes a regime for greenhouse gas emissions trading.  Section 40C clarifies which electricity generators will be subject to the levy — those who are in receipt of allowances from the Environmental Protection Agency and who are bound by the single electricity market trading and settlement code.  Section 40D sets out the formula to be used for calculation of the carbon revenue levy.  Section 40E provides for the modification of the amount calculated in the formula in section 40D by a percentage rate, as specified in the next section.  Section 40F details the percentage rate that will be used to modify the levy amount payable.  It also allows for the modification of this rate by the Minister via order, following a review of the levy's operation.  Any draft order changing the percentage rate will be subject to public consultation before any final decision is made.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">Section 40G requires electricity generators to make returns to the commission within ten working days following the end of each levy period.  These returns must specify the emissions made by generator in the preceding levy period.  This section also gives the commission the power to make regulations relating to the information that must be contained in the returns from the generators.  Giving false information to the commission in a return will also become an offence under this section.  Section 40H requires the commission to issue each electricity generator who makes a return to the commission, a levy assessment notice detailing the precise amount of the carbon revenue levy payable by each generator, along with the calculations used by the commission to determine that figure.  The notice must be issued by the Commission within ten days of the receipt of the returns from generators containing their emissions.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">Section 40I stipulates that each electricity generator has 15 working days from receipt of its levy assessment notice to pay the commission the amount specified in the notice.  Section 40J makes compliance with the carbon revenue levy a condition of licences granted to electricity generators.  Section 40K details the interest rate that will apply to any late payments made by electricity generators.  The rate that will apply is the standard rate outlined in the late payments in commercial transactions legislation.  Section 40L grants the commission the ability to recover any outstanding amounts owed by electricity generators as a simple contract debt in any court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">The final section, 40M, outlines how the levy proceeds are to be dealt with by the commission. It is to pay the levy proceeds into an account which shall stand separate from all its other accounts and shall be subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  A report on the performance of the commission on its functions with regard to the carbon revenue levy will also be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas each year.  Funds will be disbursed from this account only on the direction of the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, and they shall be disbursed into, or for the benefit of, the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">It is vital that the legislation be enacted by the end of June.  I have signalled my intention to use the proceeds of the carbon levy to reduce electricity costs for large energy users who are typically large employers and concentrated in the high value export sector.  To enable this, the levy must be in place by 1 July 2010 at the latest.  For every month that the legislation is not enacted, approximately from €6 million to €7 million will be lost to the levy and electricity generators will continue to enjoy these unearned windfall gains.  Over the past 12 months, Ireland had the second largest price reduction in gas prices to business in the EU and the third largest reduction in electricity prices for both business and householders.  This Bill is another important measure that will boost our competitiveness and deliver real benefits to business and consumers alike.  I look forward to working closely with the CER on ensuring the speedy implementation of the Bill's provisions, following enactment.</p>

        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_336">
          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_713">I welcome this legislation and recognise the work that has been done in the Department to produce the Bill as a Bill in its own right.  It is important to give credit where it is due and I suspect there has been significant work in the Department over the past ten days or so to put this Bill in place.  It is far more satisfactory to deal with the issue of the levy by way of a Bill.  A Bill is more comprehensive and is preferable to an amendment to the bio-fuels legislation that passed through the House last week.  I know producing a Bill meant there was a short delay and involved significant work and inconvenience for the Department, but the net result is that we will have sounder legislation that is separate from the bio-fuels legislation.  In fact, we were not able to introduce an amendment on Committee Stage of that legislation because it was not directly related to bio-fuels.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">I would like to signal some of the issues I suggest the Minister might try to take on board on Committee Stage.  The Fine Gael Party intends to facilitate the passage of this legislation through the House, but hopes to make some helpful suggestions to help the Minister achieve his aims.  We have been calling for this change for some time.  I recognise this issue was not as easy to deal with as I outlined two years ago and that the Office of the Attorney General had to deal with some detailed legal issues.  However, despite the fact the ESB has made a significant gesture and given a rebate to energy users, it is worth mentioning that because of the two-year delay, we have missed an opportunity and have not been able to recoup to the State the unearned profits made by all the non-ESB companies on the back of energy users.  We should have been able to recoup and recycle that money back into either reducing energy costs or providing alternative energy conservation schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">How will this legislation impact on the all-island market?  Generators in Northern Ireland will not be subject to this legislation, but they operate in competition with generators in the Republic because of our single all-island electricity market.  Will the Minister explain how the legislation will impact on the relationship between generators north and south of the Border in the area of competitiveness?  Has the North a similar regime to ours whereby it gives generators free carbon allowances or provides 90% of the allowances they use for free?</p>
          <p eId="para_716">On the issue of the 65%, the Minister has been quite conservative.  He said the Government recognises the fact there are unearned profits, but it only intends to take back 65% of the value of the emissions the generators emitted during each quarter.  I can understand it cannot be 100%, because generators only get only from 85% to 90% of the allowances they need.  Therefore some percentage must be discounted.  However, I do not agree with a part of the Minister's speech in this regard.  He said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_717">It also should be noted that some electricity generators claim that they already use some of their gains from the carbon windfall to offer lower electricity prices to their customers via their supply arms.  Allowing generators to retain a portion of their windfall gains ensures that we do not entirely eliminate the scope for generators to pass carbon windfall gains on to consumers through their supply arms if they so wish.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">This is what we are trying to get away from.  We are trying to get away from the idea that we should allow the generators themselves to decide how unearned profits are disbursed.  It should be the Minister who decides whether that money is rebated to customers or used to reduce the cost of network charges.  Therefore, we need to know the exact amount of unearned profits and to maximise the take back to the State of those profits before we decide how to rebate customers, reduce prices or offer alternatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">It is not acceptable to state that we suspect energy generators are keeping their prices down because they have the cushion of unearned profits.  Either we are recouping what is unearned or we are not.  If customers are obliged to pay for the carbon element to which the electricity they are using gave rise when it was generated, then the State should take back as much of this money as possible and decide, in a responsible way, how best to provide people with a rebate.  I understand from where the 65% comes but I am of the view that it can be revised upwards slightly.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">The carbon revenue levy will not apply to energy generators that are subject to a PSO.  I am aware that the Minister has some concerns in this area in respect of peat.  Essentially, the carbon revenue levy is not going to be applied in respect of the dirtiest fuel we have which is responsible for emitting the most carbon per kilowatt hour.  I ask that the Department reconsider the position in this regard.  The Department's current rationale appears to be that this is power generation which is partially sponsored by a public service obligation for which everyone must pay and that if the cost of producing power from peat is going to be increased by adding a carbon revenue levy, well then the PSO will have to be increased in order to meet the cost.  On the basis of the rationale to which I refer, the question then arises as to what is the point in doing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">Would it not be more honest to inform people that the PSO will have to be increased because there is a cost for carbon which somebody must pay?  Once the Bill is transparent in respect of how that money should be paid and as long as the unearned profit is recouped and paid back to people in a sensible way, then the rationale that is applied in respect of coal, gas and oil should also be applied to peat, even if this means the PSO must be slightly higher.  We could show the increase on people's bills and expose the fact that producing energy by using certain fuels is expensive, rather than trying to hide the figure by incorporating within the PSO a windfall levy for which consumers are paying.  Essentially, the latter involves hiding the truth.  If other carbon-based fuels are subject to the PSO, then peat should also be subject to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">There are a number of sensitive aspects to the debate on generating electricity from peat.  There are people in my party who live in constituencies where large numbers of people are employed in peat-powered generating stations.  For social, local and economic reasons, those stations must be kept intact.  We need to phase out the use of peat over time while ensuring that people remain in employment during this process.  We must even try to increase the level of employment by introducing more sustainable biomass products to replace peat.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">Peat-powered generating stations are not going to disappear anytime soon.  However, we must be honest with consumers and inform them as to what they are paying, why they are paying it and indicate on what the different charges on their bills are spent.  I understand the new calculations to be introduced in the summer will mean that the PSO will increase to a significant degree.  Regardless of whether it is this new PSO, the carbon revenue levy or a carbon-related element of one's energy bill — which the Government is going to recoup and actually spend in a way that will lead to price reductions — people must be provided with information in respect of what they are paying.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">I wish to raise a rather controversial issue.  Even though the principle relating to the recoupment of unearned profits is correct, there is something wrong with the fact that the energy generators who produce the most power generally operate the most efficient and modern plants and thereby cause the fewest emissions.  The Viridian plant at Huntstown, the newly opened ESB plant in Cork harbour and the new Bord Gáis plant in the same location are the most efficient plants in the country in terms of emissions.  One would like to believe that if we can get the infrastructure right in the Cork area, we can ensure that the most efficient plants are those which are producing the most power.  This will mean that they will be charged most in respect of the windfall levy because they will be selling the most power onto the system.  That is fine.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">Let us consider the position with regard to our dirtiest plants.  Moneypoint, which uses coal, is one of the dirtiest plants in the country.  Moneypoint has not been used as much in the past 12 months as might have been the case because a number of gas-powered stations have competed successfully with it.  As a result, the plant does not pay as much of a windfall levy because it is not producing as much power as heretofore.  However, there are still carbon allowances attached to Moneypoint that were granted on foot of its producing power at a level that was calculated on the position in a base year.  Should we not be recouping windfall profits that are made on the back of trading carbon allowances that are unused but that are given free of charge in the first instance?  Does not this argument have as much merit as recouping carbon charges which are paid for by the customer but which are given free of charge to the generator?</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Viridian is particularly concerned with regard to this matter.  It is of the view that it is being hammered with carbon charges because, as a result of its modern plant, it can produce power efficiently, cost effectively and with relatively low emissions.  What about the plants that are only producing power 20% or 40% of the time?  They will have excess allowances available to them which they will be able to trade.  Will the profits or windfall gains made from trading allowances which were provided free of charge but which remain unused also be recouped?  Perhaps there is not a market for the ESB to trade unused carbon credits.  If there is such a market, however, I do not understand why the Government should give something away for nothing and then not recoup the windfall gains that are made as a result.  If the principle of recouping unearned profits for which consumers have paid holds sway, then the windfall gains to which I refer should also be recouped.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">I accept that my argument in respect of this matter was somewhat long-winded in nature.  I hope, however, the Minister understands the point I am making.  Ultimately, we want to ensure that we incentivise the most effective, modern and cleanest power plants.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">My next point relates to how the levy will be disbursed.  The Bill is not as precise in this regard as was the briefing we received during the face-to-face discussion in which we previously engaged on this matter.  I understand that the Minister intends to raise approximately €6 million to €7 million per month through the levy and will try to provide a rebate for large energy users by reducing the network charges relating to them.  This will be similar to what the ESB has done in respect of the €300 million to which the Minister referred earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">I have a difficulty in respect of this matter.  The first thing we must do is ensure that the charges that will be imposed will be as competitive as should be the case.  In other words, we should not subsidise a system that is already overly expensive.  The regulator, by means of a direction from the Minister's office, must ensure that we have the most efficient networks and grid business possible and that charges will be no higher than is necessary.  It is only when that stage is reached that we should introduce a rebate to reduce costs even further.  What we should not do is reduce costs from a level that is already too high.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">The question many people would ask about the €300 million that was supposedly given back by the ESB is whether it is being taken away from a network charge that was already too high.  I hope the Minister will consider that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">There is no requirement in the Bill that the proceeds of the carbon revenue levy be recycled into energy.  That is left to a decision of the Minister with the prior consent of the Minister for Finance.  Under subsection 40M(3), as inserted by section 3, the funds in the account "shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in such manner as the Minister may direct following consultation with the Minister for Finance".  In other words, money is going into the Exchequer and there will be a negotiation between the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and the Minister for Finance as to how it is spent.  That is very different from what the Minister said in his speech.  I welcome his undertaking to bring energy prices down for large energy users and perhaps look at using some of the money for other energy programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">However, that is not what is in the legislation.  I would generally be slow to prescribe in legislation how money is spent because that is bad practice.  A future Minister must have the flexibility to decide how revenues are spent; that is the job of a Minister.  However, this legislation will apply only for a temporary period, between now and the end of 2012, so there are only another two and a half years to go before it becomes irrelevant.  In that context, the Bill should prescribe in a more definite way how, in the next two and a half years, the €200 million or €300 million we raise through the carbon levy is spent in order to bring energy prices down to a level that will make us more competitive.  I am anxious to see an amendment in this area so it is not simply the case that the moneys raised will go into the Exchequer and be allocated on the basis of a political decision.  I am largely in agreement with the Minister on how it should be spent, but that should be prescribed in the Bill.  If this legislation were to apply for the next ten or 20 years, it would be a different case entirely.</p>

          <p eId="para_735">This legislation may be challenged in the courts, although perhaps the only company willing to do so will be Viridian.  I do not expect the State-owned energy companies will take the Minister to court; they would be ill advised to do so and will simply have to put up with it.  However, the same does not apply to private energy companies and we must prepare for that by ensuring we have a legally sound case.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">There is a particular case in regard to Endesa Ireland Limited, and the Minister is aware of my concerns in this regard.  Endesa spent a substantial sum in purchasing two power generating stations from the ESB.  My understanding is that it then paid a separate amount to purchase carbon allowances between now and the end of 2012.  The ESB, which sold the allowances to Endesa, was paid for an average value of those allowances between now and 2012 taking an average value for carbon.  Essentially, therefore, Endesa has already paid for its carbon allowances while everybody else got them for free.  The ESB, meanwhile, has effectively been paid on the double for the carbon allowances that apply to the Endesa plants because it got them for free initially and then sold them.  I do not blame the ESB for that; it did a great deal when it sold the two power plants.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">I do not expect Endesa will have to pay a very large carbon levy in any case because I do not expect it will produce that much power onto the grid between now and the end of 2012.  However, in the case of the energy it does produce, we must consider whether it may be appropriate to exempt the Endesa plants or to seek some other way of recouping what the company has already paid under its contract with the ESB.  When I mentioned this to representatives of the ESB, they laughed at me and said I surely did not expect their company to pay for the emissions Endesa will produce between now and 2012.  To some extent, however, fairness would dictate that this should be case, although legally it is probably not possible to do so.  I ask the Minister to review this situation because it is a particular case.  Endesa paid for its allowances in expectation that they would have value, unlike the other energy companies which got the allowances for free.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">I look forward to Committee Stage of the Bill when I propose to table several amendments in respect of the issues I have raised.  I hope the Minister will take some of them on board.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_339">
          <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
          <p eId="para_739">I thank Deputy Coveney for sharing time.  I too wish to address the Endesa issue as the legislation is a cause of significant concern for that company.  Endesa Ireland Limited spent some €450 million purchasing two power stations from the ESB, at Great Island and Tarbert, and hopes to make an investment of €500 million in those plants.  While the Bill may not impact the company to the extent it originally feared, it is nevertheless a negative as far as it is concerned.  As I said during the debate on the Energy (Biofuel Obligation and Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010, Endesa purchased all the carbon allowances allocated to the two stations from the ESB as part of the competition organised by the latter to divest some of its assets.  The competition rules required that the participants included a separate line item setting out the value for the 2008 carbon emission allowances.  The 2009 to 2012 carbon allowances were valued at the expected market rate of €25 per tonne and included in the total offer.  That is one of the reasons Endesa paid such a large amount for the ESB's stations.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">Since taking ownership of the assets, the value of the EU allowances, EUAs has fallen.  Rather than enjoying a windfall gain, therefore, Endesa has suffered a loss.  EUA prices are now approximately €12 per tonne compared to the €25 per tonne Endesa paid to the ESB.  If anyone has enjoyed a windfall profit in respect of Endesa's EUAs, it is the ESB.  As I said, Endesa intends to make a significant investment in the generation stations at Great Island and Tarbert.  Such investment could create up to 300 jobs in construction at Tarbert as well as providing jobs in running the station and attracting further industry to the area.  According to the company itself, Endesa's ability to invest will be diminished with each additional reduction in income.  Endesa's income streams, energy sales and capacity payments have fallen significantly.  Its 2009 running hours were 50% less than in 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">They are expected to fall again by half in 2010.  The capacity payment was reduced by 15% from 2008 to 2009.  This, too, is expected to fall further in 2010.  The introduction of an emissions levy would further reduce Endesa's income.  It is important to note this.  This levy seeks to recover windfall profits.  Endesa Ireland has not enjoyed windfall profits.  Any windfall profits associated with Endesa's allowances are not as I have stated currently on hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">Endesa Ireland is the only generating company in Ireland that has paid for EU aid and is actually suffering a loss as the allowances were in 2009 valued much higher than they are now.  I appeal to the Minister to consider the Endesa case and to exempt it from the levy if at all possible.  The Minister graciously met some time ago with a delegation from Endesa Ireland, which they appreciated.  I believe it has put its case directly to the Minister and to his officials.  From a small gain the Minister would enjoy a great deal of good will from this company which we want in the market in terms of competition and potential job creation in Cork and Kerry in the not too distant future.  The Minister will be aware Endesa Ireland has applied to Kerry County Council for planning permission in respect of its proposed conversion operation in Tarbert.  It is hoped there will be no problems in this regard.  There is a proposal to provide a pipeline from Foynes to Tarbert to provide gas, which is another issue.  Shannon LNG has received planning permission for a pipeline which pipeline it is hoped will in the future serve both Shannon LNG and Endesa.</p>

        <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_340">
          <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_743">I welcome the Bill and the fact that a common sense approach has been taken by the Minister following a certain amount of pressure and protest from the party Whips on this side of the House.  I was extremely concerned at the idea that a couple of amendments tacked onto the bio-fuels Bill would somehow suffice.  That we now have a pristine Bill with an impressive title, namely, the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Carbon Revenue Levy) Bill 2010 is welcome.  It is appropriate that we take this approach when it comes to legislative changes and that the Minister desists from trying to have a portmanteau approach to legislation which includes a bit of this and that.  I am sure that may be a better use of time within the Department but it is not good legislation in terms of outcome.  I regret democratic accountability tends to be a little slower but is the better fort at the end.  I thank the Minister's officials for taking the time to brief me on the arcane workings of the Irish electricity market.  The extent of expertise within the Department is reassuring in terms of what is a complex area.  While currently this is a particularly complex area it will in 2012 become less complicated.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">The Bill addresses an issue which has been raised many times in terms of windfall profits that exist in the market and need to be captured in some way.  This legislation is the way the Minister has chosen to address the issue.  I have some concerns about the Bill.  The Minister has stated on a number of occasions that the funds will be used to relieve the high cost of electricity to large electricity users.  However, there is not one mention in the Bill of small, big or large users.  What we have is a mechanism whereby money is collected through the CER and put into an account along with what is left over from the dividend money.  It will be the responsibility of the Minister of the day, with the sanction of the Minister for Finance, to decide how that money is disposed of.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">It is worth setting the context of electricity prices in regard to which there are concerns.  The recently published Sustainability Energy Ireland report states there has been some improvement in terms of price, which is extremely welcome.  However, we have not reached a point where we can say that the price of electricity is not an issue, particularly when compared to other countries.  We are still above the European average.  Electricity prices for medium to large business consumers are 4% to 6% above the EU average.  This group of customers accounts for approximately 53% of the market.  That is a matter of great concern when one considers the economic situation in which we find ourselves and how important it is for us to be competitive.  The price of electricity to the average consumer is approximately 7% above the EU average, which is not any source of comfort for us.  There is a real danger that this type of measure to alleviate the burden on the larger user does not address the issues around cost.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">The Minister made the point that generators have been provided with free carbon credits and that they were able to earn a monetary return on those credits, which led to excess windfall profits.  He has also stated that the Bill seeks to remove these gains.  The Minister indicated that it is estimated that €75 million per annum will accrue.  That there is this pot of money is not disputed.  It is interesting to see how significant it could be.  In Britain, it is estimated to be as much as €15 billion.  Obviously, this depends on the price of carbon.  It is an important element when one considers that even in the couple of years prior to the changes a significant amount of money will accrue.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">I am concerned that this legislation could be subject to legal challenge.  I hope the Minister makes every effort to ensure this does not happen.  Given we have only two to two and a half years during which this new regime will apply it would be problematic if much of that time was spent in the courts.  An issue not yet mentioned by other speakers and on which I would like clarification because it comes up quite often is that according to the Government's own guidelines a regulatory impact assessment on this proposal should have been prepared and published.  I am not aware of any such assessment.  The eGovernment website states this is a requirement but it has not happened in this instance.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify the matter when replying, maybe I am missing something.  This is an issue that has been raised and not dealt with by the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">Section 40 of the Bill proposes that the money go into a separate account and be disposed of by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  There is no requirement other than public good to do anything specific.  There is no commitment for example to assist carbon efficiency, fuel poverty, to enable better energy conservation or to assist the large energy user.  This money could disappear into the maw of the Department of Finance.  At a time when the public finances are under chronic pressure I wonder how secure are the commitments the Minister is making.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">Will the Minister indicate if he has the sanction of the Minister for Finance for what he is planning?  I would much prefer if a regulatory regime, even by way of secondary legislation, was part of this legislation to ensure that what the Minister said will happen will transpire to be the case.  We will argue that on Committee Stage but in the meantime he might indicate if he has the sanction of the Minister for Finance for what he is planning.  If this is vague and not pinned down, I am sure extreme pressure will be brought to bear to use that money for a different purpose.  This is a lacuna in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">The Minister made an appointment to the CER some time ago, which was not publicly advertised, in the way I presumed it would have been.  This is a fairly high paid job and the appointment was made by way of a telephone call and a cosy chat.  That is no reflection on the person who was chosen for the position but it is not the way an appointment of such seriousness should be made by a Minister, regardless of the good intentions he or she may have.  There was nothing legally wrong with what the Minister did.  That is why I am concerned about a situation that could arise where nothing is stated in this respect in the Bill.  In this instance, the Minister has said a  good deal, but the Bill is silent.  It is an anomaly that needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">I am raising issues not because I do not want to support the Minister or the measures but because I envisage that it is not political opposition but a legal challenge that is the biggest threat that will arise in regard to this Bill.  The Bill needs to be robust and that is the reason I am raising questions.  There is the issue of a regulatory impact analysis.  Some generators are exempt from the levy such as peat burning plants owned by State companies, namely, the ESB and Bord na Móna, and the privately owned Tynagh Energy and Aughinish Alumina.  The Minister has explained the reason for this and it makes sense.  I listened to what Deputy Coveney said about this and he also made sense.  It is not a central issue, although I would have thought it was a green issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">Complaints have been made that this legislation is unfair and will militate against certain generators.  While a certain number of issues will always arise that do not have a sound basis, they still have to be examined.  For example, there is matter of the competitive disadvantage this measure will create in an all-island market where generators in Northern Ireland will not be governed by this regime.  The ESB has a plant in Northern Ireland and it will be exempt because the same regime will not be in place there.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">I want to echo what has been stated about Endesa Ireland.  In its submission it states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_754">As part of the Asset Strategy Agreement between the ESB and CER, ESB divested 1,068 MW of generation plant that were purchased by Endesa.  As part of the package, Endesa purchased the . . . [allowances] allocated to these stations and the rights to future ... [allowances], which we valued at the 2008 spot price.  Since 2008, the value of . . . [these allowances] has fallen, meaning that Endesa has suffered a loss relating to the . . . [allowances] rather than the windfall profits enjoyed by all the other generation companies in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">Endesa's existing units are older, inefficient and are not scheduled to run in the market.  They are only used to provide critical support to the grid and it believes that only generators that are included in the market schedule should be included in the levy.  It would be useful if the Minister were to provide some comfort in regard to an issue that is having an effect and about which a number of Deputies have expressed concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">The semi-State sector is dealing with this levy in its own way and it will be able to accommodate it but there are concerns about its impact in the private sector, namely that it will discourage efficient plants and will result in increased emissions.  If it were to be the case, and I hope it will not be, that higher electricity prices and higher emissions resulted from the introduction of this legislation, we would all be extremely disappointed.  Therefore, we must make sure that will not be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">To make certain presumptions about generators without having evidence one way or the other raises questions.  If it transpires that the presumptions were wrong, we will end up with either higher prices or higher emissions.  Private sector operators have said that some generators at least are recycling the windfall back to their customers in the form of discounts.  Their concern is that this will end up being a discount that will be taken from their customers, which tend to be small and medium-sized enterprises, and given to the large energy users.  It seems extraordinary that there is no way for that to be assessed and analysed in some limited way to ascertain whether that is the case.  Viridian is a front-runner in arguing its case.  In its submission to the Department it states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_758">The measure cannot have the effect of reducing electricity prices to consumers.  On the contrary, it is almost certain to increase costs for consumers to the extent that the Levy is passed through wholesale or retail tariffs.  Suggestions that the Levy might subsequently be rebated to certain consumers are misplaced.  It is not permitted under the Bill and, more importantly, it is open to the same criticism that forced the European Commission to reject part of the national allocation plan for the Netherlands.  Put simply, it unduly favours those singled out to get the rebates, has negative environmental effects and it is likely to distort competition.  The best possible outcome for consumers is that they will be no worse off and even that outcome is most unlikely.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_759">As a consequence, competitiveness of Irish business is likely to be harmed.  Furthermore, the disproportionate impact on Viridian, as a private investor in the Irish market, sends an adverse signal to potential inward investment.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_760">Proposals of a similar kind have encountered difficulty in other EU member states.  The Spanish Government abandoned a similar measure in July 2009 and litigation connected with the period when the measure applied is ongoing in the Spanish courts.  A similar measure was recently proposed and abandoned in the Walloon region of Belgium.  In Germany, where we understand that connected litigation has been successful, the Government abandoned measures in December 2007.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_761">Any Regulatory Impact Analysis . . . of the impact on generators and/or the price of electricity to consumers would have revealed several fundamental issues with the measure.  No RIA has been carried out, whether for this measure or previously, and the measure suffers from this missing analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">I have not had a chance to consider the European context.  I am merely referring to cases and situations covered in Viridian's submission.  I presume that this issue has not foundered in other countries where similar attempts were made by governments because if it has foundered, we need to take account of that experience.  It might be useful if the Minister were to comment on that point in terms of what has happened elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">Some informal meetings were held with some generators and the Department and even the Minister, consequent on the paper that was produced in July 2009 which generated a certain amount of interest.  However, that is not equivalent to a form of consultation, which I would have thought was a requirement and certainly a way of pre-empting any difficulties that might arise subsequently.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">The general point about the windfall tax is indisputable.  I do not believe anybody in the House will create difficulties in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">What is done with the money is open to question.  Measures that would ensure greater energy efficiency or deal with fuel poverty, for example, might have been something a Green Party Minister would promote.  However, the Minister has chosen instead to reduce the cost for the large energy or electricity user.  Whatever he does about that needs to be regulated and the regulations must be provided for in this legislation which will last for only two years, in any case.  There may be other ways to deal with this but we can talk about that on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">The fact that sizeable money, some €300 million, was found as a sweetener when the ESB made its case for a price reduction to ensure it was accepted was a great relief to customers.  However, I have concerns.  One does not relate directly to this Bill but I wish to raise it.  It is a small matter but seems to me to indicate an approach by the CER that goes outside its brief.  The commission is pulling weight in a way I find not to be in the interests of the consumer.  The recommendation of the CER is that the ESB price controls will go when they hit 60% of the domestic sector market.  I welcome that.  It is a good sign and a good move forward.  Let us see what happens.  However, tagged on to that recommendation, the CER stated the ESB must take its brand name off the retail part of its business.  The officials who came before the Oireachtas committee said they, too, were not happy with the requirement and I got the impression the measure would not go ahead.  However, what the CER is saying, in essence, is that if the ESB does not take its name from the retail part of its business, the commission will make the mark at 50% which would slow the chance of having either a price reduction or the freedom from controls that is sought by the ESB.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">It may seem like a small point but I do not believe any interest is served in taking away a brand name people know and trust.  The semi-State companies in this country developed in times when we were extremely restricted in what we could do.  The private sector did not deliver through the period from the 1930s to the 1960s and the semi-State companies were the pioneers that showed what could be done.  Those were flagship industries, whether the ESB, Bord na Móna, or whatever.  The idea that older people, in particular, can no longer have their ESB account because the CER decides the company must get rid of that name and call itself something else oversteps the mark.  I do not believe it is the business of an energy regulator to determine a brand name, quite apart from the cost involved which would be phenomenal.  It is not in the interest of consumers for the CER to determine the tried and trusted brand name which is available to people, or to take it out simply at the stroke of the regulator's pen.  The regulator should be more concerned about prices and less about brand names.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_769">I wish to share time with Deputy Michael Kitt.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Electricity Regulation (Amendment) (Carbon Revenue Levy) Bill 2010, legislation that has only recently come before us and which is moving quickly through the Oireachtas.  I understand the Minister is very keen for it to be completed as soon as possible.  I will make some observations on the Bill before moving to a specific issue I wish to raise that is connected with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">The purpose of the Bill is to provide a new function for the Commissioner for Energy Regulation to collect and recover the carbon levy and to insert a new part in current legislation stating how the levy will be applied and administered by the commission.  It places a requirement on relevant electricity generators to pay the levy in line with the provisions of this Bill and sets out the enforcement regime and implementation of the levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">It is generally agreed that the Bill does not contain specific details as to how the levy will be spent.  That probably will be arranged by regulation or an enabling section, allowing the Minister, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, to decide how this will be done by the Exchequer.  Although we do not have those details now, on Committee Stage the Minister will be able to flesh them out.  Some of the detailed implementation of that aspect of the Bill will have to be worked out after the primary legislation goes through the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">Under an Irish implementation directive, electricity generators receive an annual allocation of carbon allowances for free.  I am conscious that in debating this legislation we are talking a good deal of jargon.  Some people fully understand this, others do to some extent but many people will not grasp what we are talking about tonight and it is important to recognise that.  I wish to keep my language as simple and basic as possible because this language is specific to the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">The net effect of the single electricity market committee decision to include the full cost of carbon in the wholesale price of electricity is that the higher wholesale price leads to increased revenues for all generators in the market.  The levy on those revenues will be in place until the end of 2012.  I shall return to the issue of the wholesale price of electricity because I have a specific point regarding what I believe should be included in the wholesale price.  I do not believe it is now included but that can be clarified by the Minister in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">I refer to specific sections of the Bill.  It provides for the function and setting up of new powers for the commission in regard to this levy.  Subsection (3) of the Bill provides that generators which are subject to the public service order obligation under current legislation are exempted from paying that levy.  I shall come to that in more detail presently.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">The detail of the legislation is very strong on the powers of the commission.  Generators will have to make returns to the commission within ten working days following the end of each levy period.  They will then get a certificate and have 15 days to pay the levy, after which conditions of licence will be granted, as specified in the legislation.  There may be an issue about interest on unpaid amounts of the carbon revenue levy or late payments, and how the proceeds of the levy are to be administered by the commission.  There will be a dedicated bank account, the payment is to be in a manner auditable by the Comptroller and Auditor General and the accounts will be laid before the Oireachtas each year in the annual report.  That is all very good concerning getting in the income and it will be all accounted for, but it is accepted that the legislation does not go into similar detail in regard to how the particular levies as collected will be spent.  That is a fair comment and further light will be cast on this matter as the legislation goes through.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">For the benefit of the public, it is important to acknowledge that this is an all-Ireland project.  People forget that when we go into the nitty-gritty detail of the Bill.  The all-Ireland project is a joint initiative by the Commission for Energy Regulation and the Northern Ireland authority on utility regulation.  The aim is to create a single market for natural gas and electricity on the island of Ireland on an all-island basis, to start it following joint meetings of our respective Ministers and the Northern Ireland Minister with regard to creating an all-Ireland energy market.  In November 2007, the single electricity market went live and commenced the trading of wholesale electricity in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland on an all-Ireland basis.  That is a small point I wish to make in the context of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">Power companies are benefiting from the windfall at present because they are charging their customers the full cost of greenhouse gas emissions even though EU law has decreed that the generators do not have to bear this cost until 2012.  The opportunity cost is included in the wholesale prices, and revenue has been raised as a result.  It is important to recognise that the biggest generator of electricity in Ireland for a long period has been the ESB and it receives the majority of the carbon windfall gains.  It has utilised this to reduce prices for electricity consumers, with the ESB quoting a figure in the order of €300 million passed on to its customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">Generating stations, which are the subject of the public service order obligation, are exempt from the carbon levy.  Peat generating stations, such as those owned by Tynagh Energy and Aughinish Alumina, do not earn any carbon credit windfall profits and as such will not be liable to any levy.  This is logical — if the plants are not gaining the profits, they cannot be levied on such profits.  It is important that the legislation exempts renewable energy generators from the levy, which would be in keeping with the spirit of the EU directive.  Renewable energy does not create emissions and should not be included in this measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The legislation provides for proceeds to be distributed for the benefit of the Exchequer.  The Minister indicated in his speech tonight that he will direct the regulator on how to disburse the proceeds in line with Government policy, and we look forward to receiving it in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">The wholesale price is a key factor which I would like to see taken into account.  The wholesale price is not just the cost of generation at the power stations and should include the cost of transmission of the electricity to the customer.  The wholesale price of any product is not the price inside the factory gate but takes into account the price which the retailer of electricity can achieve.  They must bear the cost of transmission from the power plant to where it is sold.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">This issue involves EirGrid, which has a 20-year plan to upgrade electricity transmission across Ireland with billions of euro in investment.  It is welcome but portions of the plan will be quite controversial.  EirGrid has a plan that can be distilled to the single idea of producing a phenomenal amount of renewable energy along the west coast of the country, with the erection of pylons across the country facilitating its transmission to where it is needed on the east cost.  In itself, that will cause major issues for the environment and carbon footprints.  I do not know if that has been taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">The cost of EirGrid investment should be taken into the wholesale price of generating electricity and transmitting it to customers.  The cost of production at the plants is a key cost but is not the only one; if power cannot be moved from the plant where it is generated, it cannot be passed to a customer.  That should be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">EirGrid is embarking on a very ambitious 20-year plan to upgrade and strengthen the country's network.  Detailed correspondence arrived from EirGrid today detailing the proposal for a Laois-Kilkenny electricity transmission network reinforcement scheme, which is running into much local opposition.  EirGrid has indicated its wish for a major new substation in the centre of Ireland to take power from the 400 kV lines and spread it across the 110 kV lines into various other surrounding counties.  The documentation deals with upgrading the Laois and Kilkenny area but the details include several other counties.  EirGrid set out a document and participated in public consultation, which commenced prior to going under the critical infrastructure section of An Bord Pleanála.  The documentation, however, is not a full representation of what is proposed behind the scenes.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">I will refer to the issue again.  I have highlighted the point and there have been public meetings.  I will conclude as I have agreed to share time with Deputy Micheál Kitt.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_786">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill and thank the Minister for introducing the legislation.  He has taken a common sense approach despite having to take the decision quickly because carbon windfall gains only exist up to the end of 2012.  There is a short period of use.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">With regard to the €300 million rebate announced by the ESB which has reduced prices, it is fair to say we had a very cold winter and start to the year, so it was important that the reduction came about.  It was difficult for older people in particular.  I welcome the Minister's comments on the all-island wholesale electricity market but I would raise the question of how this affects us.  We are signatories to the Kyoto Protocol as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">I am glad that Tynagh in Galway has been mentioned, along with Aughinish.  Tynagh is not an old plant and although it is conventional, much good work is being done there.  I support Deputy Coveney's comments on biomass.  It is important to emphasise that gas prices are lower because there has been a great variation in oil prices.  Oil is now dearer than ever before and in discussing competition and exports, we must hope that the figures for gas will stay low and the oil price will not increase.  We would like to see reductions.  Ireland has had the second-largest reduction in gas prices for businesses in the EU, and it has seen the third-largest reduction in electricity prices for both businesses and householders.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">In Tuam, there is a good example of bodies working together, particularly where the ESB is putting down infrastructure in conjunction with gas, telecoms and the broadband which the Minister provided money for as part of a €30 million package for the Tuam water and sewerage scheme.  I would like to see more of those pipes going underground, as would tidy town committees.  Many school boards of management have written to us saying that they would like to see ESB lines underground.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">The Minister for Finance spoke about a carbon tax, inclusive of VAT, yielding approximately €250 million in 2010.  He mentioned this would boost energy efficiency, support rural transport, which is very important in a rural constituency like my own, and alleviate fuel poverty.  The question of fuel poverty must be tackled as we help people on low incomes.  I am told we cannot ring-fence revenue for specific purposes but those areas are important and there should be investment in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">There has been much concern about increases in prices for petrol and agricultural diesel but there would also be concern if other fuel products see price increases.  It is important that with this Bill we see funding in the short term to ensure progress in this regard.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AndrewDoyle" eId="spk_344">
          <from>Deputy Andrew Doyle</from>
          <p eId="para_792">I understand the Minister wishes to conclude so I will be brief.  I compliment Deputy Coveney on hammering away at the issue of windfall tax for the past number of years.  My colleague, Deputy Connaughton, said he was sick of listening to him going on about the issue up to the point that he did not believe Deputy Coveney but his efforts have borne fruit.  Part of the problem with windfall tax as it was discussed was that nobody understood the issue or believed it.  It is complex.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">The fundamental purpose of any kind of carbon levy is to reduce the amount of carbon going into the atmosphere and drive down the cost of energy.  I am concerned that the revenue from this Bill will disappear into a black hole in the Exchequer, to be redistributed on the approval of the Minister for Finance.  This does not offer much comfort to those involved in alternative energy projects that are waiting to be primed and promoted in an effort to deliver more carbon efficient energy at a competitive cost that will drive down the price of energy.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">We are moving into an era in which the emissions trading system, ETS, will be reviewed and the cost of providing carbon credits as a currency will inevitably increase, impacting on food production and general energy production.  The Bill seems simple, but what it is trying to achieve is complex.  Unless we are careful that the Bill is not challenged and that the €6 million or €7 million referred to by the Minister reverts directly to the alternative energy projects, the rapid expansion of which would allow consumers to avail of cheaper energy, we will be in trouble.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">A paradox of the Bill is that the most inefficient energy generation stations will suffer the most even if they are trying to improve their efficiency levels.  Deputies McManus, Coveney and Deenihan referred to Endesa's problems.  On the one hand, it is trying to make stations more efficient and, on the other, it is being levied at the highest level while other stations, such as Moneypoint, have a vast amount of free carbon allowances that are calculated on old generation figures.  If the Bill is to work, there must be some way of recalculating to whom the carbon allowances will be allocated.  If we do not do this, the old inefficient stations will stay inefficient and they will be unable to play their part while some newer stations will benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">The question of who will benefit from the Bill has been raised.  It is feared that a select few will be chosen to benefit at the expense of small and medium-sized enterprises that can provide jobs.  I know we are all under pressure, but we must be careful about the way in which the funds generated are re-allocated.  This is key.  People involved in the alternative energy sector, including biomass generators, are concerned that, instead of their sector seeing a benefit from the Bill, the money will vanish into a black hole like lotto funding to shore up the Exchequer's accounts.</p>

          <p eId="para_797">I am pleased that we have been able to have this Second Stage debate and that we have been able to introduce stand-alone legislation.  As Deputies have stated, the Bill is complex and difficult.  As I have mentioned several times, I was told by my Department that it would have been possible to handle this matter in an alternative way, but the flexibility shown in getting through Second Stage tonight will allow us on Committee Stage to get into many of the complex details raised on the floor.  They are not easily understood, but they are worth serious consideration.  Deputy Coveney raised North-South issues and we will revert to the valuable questions involved on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">As to the 65% figure, being precise about the real windfall accruing to each generation station is difficult.  During our more extensive debate on Committee Stage, we can revert to the question of what the figure should be and discuss why we believe 65% is the right figure while still allowing flexibility in the ministerial order for adjustment if we see fit.</p>

          <p eId="para_803">Were I Deputy Coveney, I would watch out.  He has a big man on either side.  We will revert to the issue, as I would like to see progress.  We must give detailed consideration to the point on whether we will be punishing inefficient generators.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">Regarding some of the questions raised by Deputy McManus and others about whether we can be certain of the proceeds and whether the Minister for Finance has bought into the idea, the answer is "Yes".  We have put a great deal of work into this area in the past two years to try to improve competitiveness for certain industries at this particularly sensitive time.  For example, the food industry was at real risk one or two years ago because of high electricity prices and a dramatic drop in sterling.  Many industries employing a large number of people were placed in danger.  The Government worked to put together a platform of changes to achieve what has actually occurred, namely, a lowering of the cost at a critical time.  I have entered into commitments to draft a flight path out of some of our high costs.  This Bill is one element of that and the Government has agreed the overall approach, for which reason we are making these provisions in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">I have a myriad of areas in which we could spend money, but the Bill is part of a wider approach agreed with the regulator in terms of the pricing of electricity in an appropriately regulated and marketed way.  However, it is not appropriate to include the detail of the allocation of funds in the Bill.  It is better to put the money in the fund and then redistribute it in an effective way.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">The Bill must be market based.  We must work within the single electricity market and our regulated system, which has served us well.  The Bill will be of benefit in achieving certain policy objectives in the next two years, but it cannot interfere with the competitive market because the latter is working.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">I have listened to the Deputies' comments on players, in particular Endesa.  We can revert to this matter on Committee Stage without committing to specific changes on Second Stage.  The primary purpose of this Stage was to get the arguments out and to get the Bill into Committee Stage for further consideration.  I look forward to that Stage.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_810">St. Joseph's School, Parnell Street, Waterford, which caters for children with a mild learning disability, and St. Martin's Special School, Ballytruckle, Waterford, which caters for children with a moderate learning disability, effectively have had no speech and language therapy service since May 2009.  The schools had been sharing a speech and language therapist who spent two days in St. Joseph's, two days in St. Martin's and one day on administration.  I understand that the therapist who had been supplying the service has been on sick leave since May of last year, but the HSE has failed to provide a replacement service for the pupils of both schools.  This means that the children with mild and moderate learning disability attending these schools are deprived of this essential service.  Individual crisis cases can be referred to the speech and language therapy service at Waterford Regional Hospital, but this is of little use because the children need regular weekly therapy services.</p>
            <p eId="para_811">Some pupils attending St. Joseph's School who needing speech and language therapy can come from some distance away, making it all the more essential that a regular service be provided in their school.  The children of St. Joseph's and St. Martin's are not receiving the quality of education to which they are entitled and their ability to achieve their learning potential is being seriously compromised.</p>
            <p eId="para_812">It shows the hollowness of the undertakings given by this Government to protect the most vulnerable sections of society when those with a learning disability are so shamefully neglected.</p>
            <p eId="para_813">Children are now being enrolled in these schools for September 2010.  New pupils requiring speech and language therapy will need to be screened by the speech and language therapist in order that appropriate programmes can be put in place.  I call on the Minister to ensure the deprivation of these children in this essential service is put right forthwith.  The effect of not providing this therapy is that the overall educational service provided for these children will continue to deteriorate, and the net effect of not having badly needed speech and language therapy will be to compound the difficulties of these vulnerable children who need every possible support and assistance in aspiring to the optimum quality of life.  It is a measure of how uncaring the HSE, the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Skills have become if they can live with a situation where the vital needs of these children are being so shamefully abandoned.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnMoloney" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_352">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy John Moloney)</from>
            <p eId="para_814">I will be taking this Adjournment matter on behalf the Minister for Health and Children.  I thank Deputy O'Shea for raising this matter and I am pleased to have the opportunity to outline the position on the speech and language therapy service at St. Joseph's special school, Parnell Street, Waterford, and St. Martin's special school, Kilcohan, Waterford.  The Health Service Executive has advised the Minister for Health and Children that the speech and language therapy service for St. Joseph's and St. Martin's schools in Waterford have been provided directly as a school-based intervention programme for several years, totalling one whole-time equivalent staff member.  The service to both schools caters for all children in the two schools, with 94 children currently identified as requiring intervention, varying from high priority direct intervention to low priority review with school support intervention programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_815">The speech and language therapy service was suspended in 2009 owing to staffing issues.  School support intervention programmes have continued and a speech and language therapy service to a limited number of children has been offered within existing staffing resources.  The HSE has been endeavouring to address the issue and is now developing a revised approach over the coming months that will create a structure of integrated therapy to schools in the Waterford area.  St. Joseph's special school will be considered within this primary care development.  Depending on the individual child's needs, it is likely that therapy provision could be delivered through continuing therapy in the community-based clinics or, where appropriate, in a school-based therapy programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">Owing to the specialist nature of the St. Martin's school caseload, the HSE is recommending a resumption of therapy sessions within the school for these children.  It is hoped to resume services within the school when staffing allows.  In the interim, a temporary allocation will be provided through primary care for high priority cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">Service continuity can be affected by staffing issues arising, including resignations, maternity leave, career breaks and so on.  The maintenance and development of speech and language therapy services remains a priority for the HSE locally, with three new additional posts appointed in the past two years in primary care, disability services and child psychiatry.  Children who continue to meet the criteria for other specialist HSE services will continue to receive their intervention through these multidisciplinary teams, including early intervention for all children under six years, autism spectrum disorders where the intervention of the ASD team is indicated, child and adolescent mental health service teams following diagnosis of mental health disorder, and a central remedial clinic service in Waterford where children present with primary physical disability and where continued multidisciplinary team intervention is recommended.</p>
            <p eId="para_818">I re-affirm the Government's commitment to the national disability strategy and to its long-term goals and objectives which we will continue to pursue in the coming years in partnership with all the stakeholders.  Our commitment in the areas of disability and mental health is consistent.  Approximately €1.6 billion is spent annually by the health services on disability programmes, including residential, day care, respite, assessment and rehabilitation services.</p>

            <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
            <p eId="para_819">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this very important issue on the Adjournment debate.   Áras Attracta in Swinford, County Mayo, was set up 22 years ago and has 116 residents.  Over the years the staff have been dedicated and caring and have provided a wonderful service to their clients.  This has always been reassuring to their families and loved ones, but developments and cutbacks in recent years have caused concern and changed the picture.</p>
            <p eId="para_820">The residents live in bungalows in Áras Attracta — up to ten in each bungalow.  This has increased from seven or eight in the past.  This means that the set of standards of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, of having an individual bedroom for each client is being breached.  In March 2009, bungalow No. 10 closed which increased the numbers to a maximum of ten in four of the other bungalows.  Now it is proposed to close bungalow No. 8 in Áras Attracta which will cause further upset and discommode the residents who cannot speak up for themselves.  We are talking about residents who find it very difficult to cope with a new setting in their lives.  They have become comfortable and secure with their friends over the years.  It is very unfair to upset their routine and the care to which they have become accustomed and with which they are comfortable.</p>
            <p eId="para_821">The HIQA standards state the individual should have an area of personal space that comprises his or her own personal possessions, thoughts and feelings upon which no other person intrudes without his or express permission.  If this bungalow closes, leading to an increased number in the other bungalows, then it will be impossible to maintain that standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_822">As well as the increase in numbers in each bungalow, leading to more residents with shared bedrooms, there are further impacts to this decision.  Clients with behavioural problems will now live with clients with challenging behavioural problems.  Clients with mild disabilities will live with those who have profound disabilities.  The same number of clients will be cared for with fewer staff and overcrowded day rooms will increase.  Client activities, recreation and stimulation will decrease as staff will not be able to manage increased numbers.  There will be increased demand for a decreasing level of bath, shower and toilet facilities because of the closure of the bungalow.</p>
            <p eId="para_823">Everyone accepts savings must be made where possible, but theseshould not impact on the safety, security or care of the most vulnerable in our society.  It will be very difficult under the new arrangement to maintain the quality of service that has existed until now.  Another worrying aspect of this proposed closure is that HIQA's own standards and regulations are being breached, but there has never been an inspection of an intellectual disability service in Ireland.  The standards are set but are not implemented nor the facilities to which they apply inspected.  This has led to horrendous consequences elsewhere in the health service and the same mistakes should not continue to be made here.</p>
            <p eId="para_824">I have an e-mail in my possession from a staff nurse who is currently off work because of an assault that took place because she was working with staff shortages.  If the closure of this bungalow goes ahead, it will have serious consequences for the residents and for the safety of the staff.  I appeal to the Minister and the HSE to reverse this decision immediately.</p>

I thank Deputy O'Mahony for raising this matter and I am pleased to take this opportunity to outline the position on the proposed closure of a ten bed bungalow at Áras Attracta in Swinford.</p>
            <p eId="para_826">The Health Service Executive has advised the Minister for Health and Children that Áras Attracta is a residential and day care service for people with intellectual disabilities in Swinford, and the service provides for 116 residential clients and 17 day care clients.  It is a modern, purpose-built campus with residential bungalows and facilities for clients, including a workshop, gym and swimming pool.  Each bungalow is in excess of 3,000 sq. ft. and is designed for ten residents.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">As part of the Mayo primary community and continuing care cost containment measures for 2010, management at Áras Attracta is re-organising services to keep the service within budget while also ensuring the high quality of care for clients continues.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">Management has engaged with staff and their representatives to seek proposals on how the service can remain within budget this year.  These proposals have been considered and cost saving measures, including renegotiation of suppliers' contracts and efficiencies in the use of heating, are being implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_829">The option of closing one bungalow is being considered and will be brought to a Labour Relations Commission review on Thursday.  Áras Attracta is a large site with a number of residential bungalows, and clients may move from one bungalow to another following consultation with the clients and their families and clinical and risk assessment.  The movement of the clients to other bungalows within the campus is possible due to the reduction in the number of clients at Áras Attracta.  The HSE would like to reassure clients, their families and friends that Áras Attracta will continue to deliver a high quality service to meet the needs of its clients.</p>
            <p eId="para_830">I would like to take this opportunity to re-affirm the Government's commitment to the national disability strategy and to its long-term goals and objectives, which we will continue to pursue in the coming years in partnership with all the stakeholders.

            <p eId="para_836">The bog owners were very shabbily treated because nobody received an individual letter to explain the reason for the confiscation of their bogs, and that is what this is.  It was announced in a news bulletin after the Government made its decision.  An interdepartmental committee had been sitting on this since last August but we never heard what it came up with as its findings were never published.

I do not know where the €1 million came from or to whom it was given.  Whatever flexibility is in the system should be used to go back and discuss it further.

            <p eId="para_844">This is a very serious issue as people in the midlands and on the west coast where there is bogland have discovered that they will be prevented from non-commercial turf cutting, which they have been used to for generations.  It is not something we should throw out without proper consultation, or stakeholders being involved in the solution rather than having a diktat from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">No derogation was given to Ireland under the EU habitats directive because a blind eye was turned to it for political reasons.  In the meantime there was no proper consultation to seek a solution to include people who are the custodians of the environment, particularly those involved in agriculture, the land or turf cutting.  They are the people who have nurtured the environment over the years and they do not need the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or the Minister to sanction by diktat 32 boglands, as he did last Saturday under the EU habitats directive, to make them conform.</p>
            <p eId="para_846">We need meaningful consultation and engagement.  Perhaps we could have a pilot scheme on one bog where stakeholders could come to an agreement on a model for conservation that could be used on other boglands to comply with the outcome of negotiations on the EU habitats directive, and mediation if necessary.  Down through the years, these people have been involved in turf cutting for non-commercial domestic fuel.  We do not hear anything about the blanket banning of Bord na Móna from bogs as a conservation measure.  Under the EU habitats directive, small householders traditionally involved in turf cutting are being blamed for the lack of conservation.</p>
            <p eId="para_847">I call on the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, through the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, to get meaningful negotiations under way, and ensure we have a pilot programme rather than the blanket ban, which is coming down the tracks and which was started last Friday by the Minister.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnMoloney" eId="spk_364" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children">
            <from>Deputy John Moloney</from>
            <p eId="para_848">I am glad to provide the House with an update on the need for restrictions on turf cutting in a small number of designated raised bogs, and the arrangements that are being made to assist those who are affected.  Ireland's raised bogs are very rare natural features and valuable ecosystems.  Over time, Ireland has lost most of its raised bog area to land reclamation and peat exploitation.  Once lost, our bogs cannot be replaced.  The challenge for this generation is to strike a balance to protect the very best of our bogs so that future generations can enjoy them, while at the same time allowing the current generation to continue traditional practices like turf-cutting on non-designated bogs.</p>
            <p eId="para_849">The Government and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government have been working hard to strike that balance.  For this reason only, the best of our remaining raised bogs were designated as special areas of conservation, SAC, or natural heritage areas, NHA.  The Government is legally obliged to protect these sites under EU and national law.  To this end, commercial turf extraction was ended on these sites many years ago but a derogation has allowed continued cutting for personal domestic fuel supply for a period of ten years.</p>
            <p eId="para_850">The available evidence is that even this limited turf-cutting, and the drainage required to facilitate it, has caused asignificant loss of protected habitat.  It does this in two ways: the drainage lowers the high water level necessary for peat formation to occur; and, more obviously, the turf-cutting removes part of the bog itself.  If the drainage and the turf-cutting continue the bog will stop functioning as a bog, stop forming peat, and will ultimately disappear.</p>
            <p eId="para_851">The ten-year derogation period for the 32 raised bog sites designated as special areas of conservation between 1997 and 1999 has now ended and no more turf cutting is permitted in these sites without the express consent of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The derogation comes to an end for a further 24 SAC bog sites at the end of 2011 and on 75 NHA sites at the end of 2013.  In total, these sites constitute less that 5% of Ireland's bogland where turf extraction is feasible.  Turf-cutting can continue as before on more than 95% of Ireland's bogland.</p>
            <p eId="para_852">The Government recognises that the end of the derogations will affect a number of land and turbary right owners, who normally source their fuel from these bogs, and is putting in place measures to address their needs.  The shape of afinal scheme addressing their interests will be decided over the coming months but interim arrangements have been put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">The Minister, Deputy John Gormley, will provide interim funding to address the immediate needs of those who have been relying on these bogs to source their fuel.  It is estimated that approximately 750 cutters will be affected this year out of the tens of thousands who still have access to turf banks.  Those eligible can apply for a grant of €1,000 towards their fuel needs for the coming winter.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">The Government has also announced that it will not, for the time being, accept new applications to the voluntary bog purchase scheme but confirmed that applications already received will be processed. In the coming days, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will be writing to people who may be affected this year by the end of the derogation.  Details of the interim compensation scheme will be provided.  At the same time, work is continuing to identify how best to address the long-term needs of those affected by the restrictions that are required on these sites.  These include, but are not limited to, the provision of suitable turbary rights on undesignated bogs, where appropriate and available.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, and his Department will continue to engage with interested parties before any final decisions are taken in this regard.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_365">
            <from>Deputy John O’Donoghue</from>
            <p eId="para_855">I wish to preface my remarks by stating that I fully accept the bona fides of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, in seeking a public debate on whether the RBS Six Nations championships and the Heineken Cup should be on a free-to-air television basis.  I thank the Acting Chairman for affording me the opportunity to contribute to this important public debate.</p>
            <p eId="para_856">Everybody will accept that the growth of the game of rugby is directly correlated to the amount of money invested in the game and the consequential success of our teams.  In effect, this means that there is a balance required between revenue and television exposure.  I am concerned that a move to free-to-air would swing the pendulum all the way towards television exposure and upset the balance which currently exists.  I say this because while various commentators have expressed doubts about the potential loss of between €10 million and €12 million to the IRFU, they fail to recognise the net beneficiary of their membership of the Six Nations and the Heineken Cup collectives which own the broadcast rights to these tournaments and which sell the rights centrally.</p>
            <p eId="para_857">European rugby is structured in a very well organised way, whereby it can maximise the revenue potential, distribute the moneys in an equitable fashion and thereby ensure a vibrant set of well-resourced teams making up the competitions.  Irish rugby is a net beneficiary of this structure with Irish broadcasters committing some €5 million to the central pools and the IRFU receiving back some €16 million from television pools.  To upset the balance and structure of these collective selling organisations would be potentially disastrous for Irish rugby given the volatility, commercial tensions and different agendas of the partners in these collectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_858">The other key issue is that the broadcast markets in the United Kingdom and Ireland are inextricably linked and are almost inseparable through overspill of signal, further complicated by the fact that Irish rugby spans both broadcast jurisdictions in the Republic of Ireland and the North of Ireland.  If decisions are taken to ring-fence these competitions for free-to-air in the Republic of Ireland, in effect, it excludes Sky and ESPN from the market place not only in the Republic of Ireland but also potentially in the United Kingdom.  Sky bought the rights to the European Rugby Cup in the United Kingdom and Ireland on the basis of driving sales in Irelandand Wales.  If ESPN and Sky are not bidding for rights the IRFU is, in effect, left to the mercy of the State broadcasters in Ireland and the United Kingdom, as ITV and Channel 4 have insufficient funds to purchase rugby rights, who have shown time and again that they will use a monopoly position to their commercial advantage and drive down revenues.</p>
            <p eId="para_859">I am very much afraid that if the Minister's proposal is put in place we will see a spiral of decline in the professional game which, in turn, will undermine the club and schools game in Ireland.  The loss of revenue of between €10 million and €12 million per annum to the IRFU, in the order of up to 20% of its annual income — some would argue it is up to 24% — will lead to the loss of Irish rugby's finest players to foreign teams; a probable reduction in the number of Irish professional rugby teams; the inability of Ireland's international and provincial teams to compete at the highest levels in the World Cup, the RBS Six Nations championship, the Heineken Cup, the Magners League and the Amlin Cup; and a significant reduction in the levels of financial support for club and schools rugby.</p>
            <p eId="para_860">It has to be remembered that Irish rugby's position at the negotiating table of the Six Nations and the Heineken Cup would be severely weakened as each partner is expected to deliver a series of assets to the table in a manner that will allow them to maximize the centralised negotiation of television rights by the respective tournaments.  While I understand the French have designated certain elements of these tournaments, they are in the enviable position of being able to bring major terrestrial television channels to compete at the table for their rights and to compare their situation with Ireland is simply to misunderstand the commercial realities.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">I have heard the academic argument being made to the effect, "But they will have the right to sell their games here into the other markets".  That simply does not take account of the reality that broadcasters want to buy tournaments or events in their entirety.  In this way they can build audiences and make it a success from their perspective.  If the IRFU is no longer part of the central selling arrangements it will only own the rights to three out of five Irish matches in the Six Nations tournament in a good year in a competition that consists of 15 matches in total.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">Trying to sell matches on a piecemeal basis hugely diminishes their interest and, in turn, value for broadcasters, leaving the IRFU seriously exposed as to the value of matches with no guarantee that broadcasters in other countries will actually want the match or that the rights' holders will sell the rights at Irish market values for the away matches back in to the Irish market.  I support rugby on free-to-air channels as part of a balanced approach and indeed the Six Nations Championship is currently free-to-air and the Heineken Cup is available free-to-air on a deferred basis.  What nobody wants is the dismantling of a hugely successful structure with resultant carnage.  Ireland's failure to bring unencumbered television rights to the table would inevitably reverse the position whereby the IRFU receives greater revenues from television rights through its membership of ERC and Six Nations than it can put into the central pot.  The unfortunate facts are that an enormous drop in revenue would lead to a spiral of decline with Irish rugby becoming a second class citizen on the world stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_863">I am convinced that the ultimate consequences of the Minister's proposals would be as follows — a significant reduction in resources for the professional game; the inability of the Irish provincial teams to compete at the highest levels; the loss of Irish rugby's key income generators, that is, its best players; a probable reduction in the number of professional provincial franchises or teams; the inability of the Irish international team to be a serious and consistent force at international and World Cup levels; the rapid decline of Irish rugby into a second tier contender and the end of the game's mass appeal in this country; the consequential reduction in the effect and value of a strong and vibrant rugby sector to the national and regional economies; and the weakening of international sporting relations and patronage for Ireland incorporated.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_366">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_864">I welcome the chance to engage further in this debate.  I intended to listen to the priority question which was asked today and I am again called to respond to this issue because of the nature of our Adjournment debate.  I am happy to do that.  If the Deputy would like, I might respond to him by throwing back a number of questions to aid his consideration.  Taking his points, if I can, the direction of my questions will be based on his speech and some of the thoughts I have reflecting on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">The first point is debatable.  The Deputy said that the growth of the game of rugby is directly correlated to the amount of money invested in the game.  People would question that assumption but I will accept it for the moment.  The €250 million that the Government has invested in recent years in stadiums and clubs and through licence fee money and broadcasting rights gives us a say in sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_866">We are selling broadcasting rights for approximately €5 million, with €3 million from the sale of Six Nations games and €2 million for the Heineken Cup but the Deputy estimated losses of €10 million to €12 million from our shared pool with other broadcasters.  I would question his estimate, however.  The bulk of the money we bring in from other countries, or approximately €8 million, comes from Six Nations games and I understand this money is guaranteed by contract arrangement for the next three years.  I see no reason why that should not continue into the future as the revenue that we would accrue.  The fear of losing €11 million is greatly diminished by the certainty that €8 million is already guaranteed.  In regard to the Heineken Cup, we are selling rights for €2 million and collecting €3 million in additional revenue — these figures are broad and I merely use them to tease out the Deputy's arguments — and we must ask whether we are likely to lose this money.</p>
            <p eId="para_867">I disagree with the Deputy's assertion that by seeking to ring-fence games away from pay television, we would threaten these revenues.  I do not think anybody is proposing an arrangement which would exclude pay television operators, who provide good coverage and important sporting services.  All we are seeking is to ensure that Irish people are not excluded from certain events.  The evidence shows that by closing off free-to-air access, at least four fifths of the audience are excluded.  We would thereby prevent Irish sporting fans from viewing games which they regard as important.  Younger people would be excluded because typically they cannot go to pubs to watch games.  It is important that they have their heroes and that they can grow up thinking they will be the next Ronan O'Gara or Brian O'Driscoll.  We would also be excluding older people.  I have received genuine correspondence from all sides of this debate, including letters from people who expressed fears that anything would happen to the sport.  That is the last thing I would like to see.  I have also received a number of letters from older people who played the game in their youth but cannot follow it now unless it is made free-to-air.</p>
            <p eId="para_868">Rugby, which has done very well recently, can be moved away from what is seen as an exclusive arena involving certain schools and areas to a broader constituency which might include the Deputy's own county.  Exclusion would not be a clever strategy for the development of the game of rugby in this country.  I can offer many good examples of how we can offer an inclusive approach that is also commercially viable.  Most recently, FAI friendly matches were made available on free-to-air television in Ireland as well as on pay television.  In the past one could switch from one commentator to another without affecting transmission or broadcasting rights.  Numerous broadcasters and commentators were able to share Champions League matches, thereby making them even more popular and successful.  Rather than seeking to ring-fence, therefore, we want to include as many as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_869">The Deputy personally believes Six Nations matches should be free-to-air.  I have heard similar opinions from other people who have raised concerns about these proposals.  If it is his personal view that Irish people should be able to see the Irish team in action, it is better to be honest and ask broadcasters to negotiate to put such arrangements into place.  That will not undermine the revenue stream for the Irish team or rugby in general.  I welcome the ideas of others in regard to trying to ensure matches are free-to-air without guaranteeing that objective.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">It is true that France has in place commercial arrangements which guarantee free-to-air access for the national team and local teams when they are playing in their Heineken Cup finals.  I accept that France has greater commercial might but while we may be small in numbers, we have enjoyed huge success when we travelled away to support our teams.  I contend that we have made that competition in recent years through free-to-air access.  We were able to build our success because so many people were able to watch matches, with 500,000 people tuning in to share the experience of winning.  We should not be shy when we go to other countries for sporting occasions.  More than any others, Irish supporters bring colour and a good atmosphere.  That is worth something.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">I do not suggest a piecemeal approach to selling rights.  It is up to the IRFU and its international partners to agree the best arrangements.  We are not looking to impinge upon rights, sales or commercial revenues in other countries.  I believe it is possible to meet both objectives.  The Government is considering the public interest in making certain sporting events freely available and paid for at commercial rates to help the sport continue to thrive.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">I do not agree with the Deputy's conclusion that such an approach might weaken our international sporting relationships.  The French and British Governments are considering the very same measures at present.  Nor do I think it will damage patronage for Ireland, Inc.  This country is not just a commercial operation.  Ireland comes together for key sporting events, such as certain Gaelic football, hurling, soccer and rugby matches.  We are slightly diminished when we do not share these successful moments.  We must consider whether we want to protect and develop these events for the Irish nation as well as for the good of Irish sport.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_877">I propose to take Question Nos. 30, 32 and 75 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">The Government has set the renewable electricity target at 40% by 2020.  The 40% electricity target is consistent with the EU target addressed to Ireland under the Renewable Energy Directive, which requires Ireland to meet the target of 16% renewable energy in all energy consumed (encompassing electricity, transport and heating) by 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">As part of the ongoing work to further support the development of biomass, I have recently announced new Renewable Energy Feed In Tariffs (REFIT) for biomass technologies.  The supports will range from 8.5 cent per kilowatt hour to 15 cent per kilowatt hour depending on the technology deployed.  Co-firing with miscanthus or willow will qualify for the rate of 9.5c per kilowatt hour which is fully payable to the generator.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">The technologies supported include Anaerobic Digestion Combined Heat and Power, Biomass Combined Heat and Power and Biomass Combustion, including provision for up to 30% co-firing of biomass in the three peat powered stations.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">These new support tariffs will assist the development of a sustainable biomass supply sector in Ireland.  They will ensure that there is a ready demand for biomass and will build on the measures already in place including the REHEAT programme and the Energy Crop grant schemes run by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  The support tariffs will require State Aid clearance from the European Commission before they can be implemented.  Their announcement sends a clear signal to the market at this point and my Department will progress the State Aid clearance over the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_882">Both ESB and Bord na Móna have been conducting research and development and co-firing trials at the peat stations utilising a variety of biomass including miscanthus and willow.  The trials have also involved laboratory tests on the chemical and physical properties of various materials.  Decisions by ESB and Bord na Móna on optimum co-firing material and related timeframes will be taken in light of the ongoing trials.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">Both state companies are in ongoing discussions with market players in relation to sourcing supplies for co-firing.  The companies themselves will be responsible for making the commercial decisions to award contracts.   The objective is to utilise domestically produced biomass as much as possible.  My Department is working with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to ensure that the support schemes for energy crops and forestry are in alignment with the scale of demand by the power generation and heat sector.  I  understand there is a substantial amount of miscanthus available for co-firing at present which should be fully consumed during the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_884">The new Miscanthus Pilot Demonstration Programme provides support for the deployment of renewable heating systems fuelled by miscanthus in the commercial, industrial, services and public sectors.   The programme, which was launched on 30th April 2010, is administered by SEAI.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">The use of miscanthus as a fuel has been low in Ireland, due not least to limited experience with its use as a boiler fuel.  The Miscanthus Pilot Demonstration Programme is intended to support the establishment of a number of exemplar boiler sites.  These exemplar sites will serve to provide critical information on the supply chain logistics and the technical suitability of miscanthus as a boiler fuel in an Irish context.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_888">I propose to take Question Nos. 31 and 54 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">The Government has set a target of 10% of all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2020, which equates to around 225,000 vehicles.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">On 24 May I signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Mitsubishi which will ensure that Ireland will be one of the first countries in the world to be supplied with Mitsubishi electric cars.  Under the terms of the MOU my Department and ESB will be able to avail of a range of technical and market information on developments in electric vehicles.  Similar to the previous Memorandum and Agreement with Renault-Nissan, this MOU does not convey any exclusive rights for the company in relation to the provision of electric cars.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">Progress has also been made in discussions with other major motor manufacturers to make other early production vehicles available to the Irish market and I expect that other agreements will be developed in the foreseeable future.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">Electric vehicles will play an important role in reducing the transport sector's Greenhouse Gas Emissions and in reducing our reliance on imported fossil fuels.  There is now very significant global investment underway in research and development in this area.  The technology is maturing to a point where large scale commercial deployment appears feasible in the short to medium term.  There is keen interest internationally in Ireland's decision to be an early mover in this field, particularly in our decision to go with a national rollout of charging infrastructure.  Ireland is seen as an excellent test-bed particularly in relation to network infrastructure development.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">We already have a number of incentives in place which demonstrate the Government's commitment to promoting electric vehicles in Ireland.  The VRT exemption for electric vehicles and the VRT reliefs of up to €2,500 for plug-in hybrid vehicles, which were due to end in Dec 2010, have been extended in the Budget for a further two year period.  I have also announced the introduction of a grant scheme for up to 6,000 vehicles over a two year period from January 2011, which will provide grants of up to €5,000 for full battery electric vehicles and up to €2,500 for plug in hybrid electric vehicles.  The grant scheme will be administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and full details will be published well in advance of the scheme commencement date of Jan 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">The support schemes are non exclusive and will be open to any vehicle from any manufacturer, which meets the qualifying criteria.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">ESB is planning to roll out up to 1,500 charge points nationwide by December 2011.  The rollout has already begun in Dublin and charging points will also be installed in Cork, Galway, Waterford and Limerick. ESB also plans to install up to 30 fast charge points across Ireland by the end of 2011, with nine expected to be set up by the end of this year.  The same infrastructure will of course support plug in hybrid vehicles.</p>
            <p eId="para_896">My Department, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) and ESB Networks are also discussing the electric vehicle infrastructure network build out programme including cost recovery and access arrangements.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_370">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_899">I propose to take Question Nos. 33 and 68 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">The Home Energy Saving scheme (HES), which is administered by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), has a capital budget allocation of €24.3 million this year.  In addition, a further €46 million has been allocated to a national retrofit programme, with a substantial portion assigned to HES.  In total expenditure of €21.3 million has been incurred to date this year in respect of HES.  In light of the fact that the specific HES capital allocation is 24.3 million, it is expected that at present rates of expenditure the HES allocation will be spent in full and the programme will continue by drawing down from the related RETROFIT allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">New applications are being received at a rate of more than €1 million per week.  Experience on this and other schemes shows that not all homeowners approved for a grant will proceed with works.  Given the high trend of approved and new applications, I expect that most if not all of the available funds will be drawn down this year.  The rate of funding commitment and expenditure to date this year is a strong endorsement of the Scheme and the level of interest among homeowners.</p>
            <p eId="para_902">There is no waiting list for the applications under the Home Energy Saving Scheme.  The waiting time for the Warmer Homes Scheme is generally between 3 and 6 months.  Warmer Homes is also managed by SEAI.  It is delivered through a combination of 23 community based organisations (CBOs) and a panel of private contractors.</p>
            <p eId="para_903">CBOs work in partnership with their local network of poverty and community support organisations.  These include public health nurses, MABS and the Society of Saint Vincent de Paul who work with CBOs to identify and address vulnerable homes.  Each CBO is responsible for managing the applications in its own operational area.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">The CBOs are in a process of adjusting to the rapidly increasing scale of the Warmer Homes scheme.  Between 2000 and 2008, a total of 20,881 homes were upgraded under the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">By contrast, 19,126 homes were upgraded in 2009 alone.  I fully expect even more homes to benefit in 2010.  This is a very significant increase in scale of operations over a short period of time and has required CBOs to put in place additional resources and systems necessary for delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">Private contractors were engaged on a pilot basis in 2009 to address the increasing demand for the scheme and in order to move quickly to nationwide coverage.  This approach is being extended in 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_907">Through a combination of these two approaches, SEAI advises that the waiting times under the Warmer Homes scheme should reduce further over the course of this year.  I can also advise Deputies that a dedicated hot line — 1800 250 204 — has been in operation for some time and all queries, from scheme applicants and public representatives, on delivery dates for individual households and/or funding agreements are dealt with immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_908">In addition, the programme manager for Warmer Homes, Mr. Michael Martin of the SEAI, is available to deal with queries on 042 939 1548.  The availability of both points of contact is designed to ensure that there is no delay in dealing with specific queries related to the delivery of Warmer Homes.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Conor Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_910">The Deputy will be aware of the background in relation to fish passage at the Fermoy weir and the need to ensure compliance with the Habitats Directive in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">On taking up responsibility for the inland fisheries brief, I reviewed the approach to resolving the barrier to fish passage at Fermoy.  I was aware of the importance of ensuring that progress was made and the need to avoid further delays.</p>
            <p eId="para_912">I wish to emphasise to the House that at no time has the removal of the weir ever been contemplated for the purpose of addressing the barrier to fish passage or installing a rock ramp pass.</p>
            <p eId="para_913">I have made major efforts to engage with the Council, the rowing club and other interests in Fermoy, including local Deputies, in order to discuss their concerns in relation to this matter and their views on how the requirements for rowing and fish passage could be met.</p>
            <p eId="para_914">On foot of my discussions with interested parties and contacts with the European Commission and the Attorney General, I agreed to afford the Council an opportunity to implement its preferred solution of repairing the existing fish passes in the weir.</p>
            <p eId="para_915">That was not an easy decision for me to make in the light of the technical advice I received which stated that the repaired pass would not solve all the problems of fish passage.</p>
            <p eId="para_916">I have given the Council every opportunity to act immediately and with speed to carry out the works they envisage in the repair of the existing fish pass.</p>
            <p eId="para_917">I now urge Fermoy Town Council to carry out the works as directed.  I would add that I also made it abundantly clear that if that solution did not work, then I would have no alternative, indeed no hesitation, in requiring the rock ramp proposal to proceed.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_372">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_919">I have never called for a partial break up of Bord Gáis Éireann.  The Deputy may be referring to the requirements under the EU Third Energy Package, to separate customer and energy supply from the transmission and distribution networks in vertically integrated energy utilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_920">The EU Third Energy Package entered into force on 3 September 2009 and the various Directives will be transposed into Irish law by the due date of March 2011.  The Package requires Member States to further unbundle gas transmission system operations from supply.  In the case of vertically integrated gas undertakings such as Bord Gáis Éireann (BGÉ), the separation of transmission and distribution businesses from customer supply, is legally required no later than March 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_921">There are three legal options available under the Third Package.  The option of Full Ownership Unbundling, requires the complete separation of the networks business from supply.  The second option requires the setting up of an Independent System Operator.  This is a less radical split, designed to ensure that the networks system operates independently.  The third option of an Independent Transmission Operator, provides that transmission networks are maintained within the utility in a completely ring-fenced structure.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">My Department has been engaged in analysing the most appropriate unbundling model for BGÉ that complies with the Third Package and works best for the Company and the State as shareholder.  In that context my Department commissioned external advice in order to fully inform an assessment of the optimum future structure for BGÉ's transmission system operator under the Package.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">Both my Department and I have had discussions with the BGÉ Group of Unions and liaison is ongoing.  My Department is also liaising with the Employee Share Ownership Trust on its perspective on the matter.  In conjunction with my colleague the Minister for Finance, I expect to come to a final view shortly on the most appropriate model for Bord Gáis Éireann under the Package.</p>
            <p eId="para_924">The EU Third Energy Package also introduces new rules for the promotion of regional and bilateral cooperation between energy transmission system operators and regulators leading to the establishment of regional gas markets.  These objectives dovetail closely with work underway by the Regulators North and South on developing Common Arrangements for Gas for the island.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_929">I propose to take Questions Nos. 37, 39, 49 and 63 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_930">The telecommunications market, including the provision of fibre based next generation networks, is fully liberalised and subject to both EU and national competition and regulatory rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_931">Government policy on the development of the electronic communications market in Ireland is set out in "Next Generation Broadband — Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland", which I published in June 2009.  The policy paper was developed in accordance with various key principles, which are crucial to the development of the market including—</p>
            <p eId="para_932">(i) competition, at platform and service levels, which drives innovation and investment,</p>
            <p eId="para_933">(ii) investment certainty for service providers considering investing in network infrastructure,</p>
            <p eId="para_934">(iii) investment intervention by Government to bridge any digital divide in cases of market failure and to meet the State's own communication needs, and</p>
            <p eId="para_935">(iv) appropriate regulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">This policy has facilitated significant progress in broadband roll out and broadband speeds over recent years.  For example, Ireland has over 1.443 million broadband subscribers and our broadband per-capita penetration rate is 32.4%.  Internationally, Ireland ranks 11th of the EU 27 for per-capita broadband penetration (composite fixed and mobile), 4th for mobile only penetration, and 14th for fixed broadband penetration.</p>
            <p eId="para_937">Of the homes with broadband connections, 68.4% of them, and 72.8% of SMEs are using broadband speeds of 2mbps-10mbps.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">I welcome all plans by service providers across different platforms to invest in high-speed broadband and will ensure that the State continues to provide a supportive environment for such investment.  The policy environment is facilitating progress. The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) will ensure that broadband services are available throughout Ireland by the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">Even after the full roll-out of the NBS  there will be a small percentage of premises outside the areas covered by the scheme that will have persistent difficulty in obtaining a broadband service. This is primarily due to technical and locational reasons (suitability of telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).</p>
            <p eId="para_940">Funding for rural broadband has become available from the European Economic Recovery Plan through the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD) administered by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. This Department is responsible for developing a new measure under the Rural Development Plan to use this funding to address the issue of basic broadband availability in remaining un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">State Aid approval has been granted by the European Commission as part of the overall process of securing the necessary approvals and funding for the scheme. Detailed planning is now underway for this scheme.  The key qualifying criteria for the scheme will be that the premises in question is in a rural area, outside the areas covered by the NBS and cannot be served by existing service providers.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">It is intended to commence the scheme later this year with the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  It is expected that the roll-out phase of the scheme will be carried out during 2011 and 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">In addition to these actions, Building Ireland's Smart Economy identifies Ireland's educated population, with 85% of 20-24 year olds  having completed post-primary education, as one of the strengths of the Irish economy and commits to "the pursuit of the objective of equipping second level schools with 100mbps broadband connectivity."</p>
            <p eId="para_944">78 schools have been chosen to take part in a pilot project, sponsored by my own Department and the Department of Education and Skills, and all will have their enhanced bandwidth available to them for the beginning of the next academic year in September next. This innovative project presents a very real opportunity to demonstrate the benefits and positive impacts of high speed bandwidth and appropriate ICT equipment on the teaching and learning environment within these schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_945">The revised Programme for Government includes a commitment to rolling this out nationally to all second level school.  The June 2009 policy paper also proposes the establishment of a Next Generation Broadband Taskforce comprising industry, Government and ComReg, aimed at ensuring that the development of broadband in Ireland will meet the demands of Ireland's Smart Economy.  My Department liaises with industry participants and with ComReg on an ongoing basis and these discussions encompass all matters relating to broadband infrastructure development.  I have made it clear on a number of occasions that I favour a collaborative approach to broadband investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">I intend establishing the broadband Taskforce in the near future to progress the collaborative approach that was established in our initial broadband policy forum in Dublin Castle.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">As part of the ongoing bilateral engagement with industry players on broadband development, my Department has had discussions with eircom.  I recognise the importance of eircom as the incumbent telecommunications provider and I welcome their stated intention to invest in new next generation networks and the recent approach of the company in support of its wholesale operations with other telecommunications providers.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_949">I welcome the decision by the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) on the roadmap for electricity price deregulation.  This is an important step on the path to developing a fully competitive electricity market in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_950">This decision demonstrates that Government policy to encourage competition is paying dividends through lower prices and greater choice for Irish homes and businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_951">The outcome of the roadmap decision is that ESB retail tariffs for all business customers will no longer be regulated by the CER from the autumn.  The decision paper also sets out the criteria for deregulation of tariffs in the domestic market in the foreseeable future.  Among these criteria is a commitment from the ESB on the rebranding of the ESB Customer supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">The CER decision follows an in-depth consultation which received 21 submissions from electricity market participants and industry and consumer representative groups.  The process also drew on the results of a joint CER/Northern Ireland Authority for Utility Regulation customer behaviour survey.  The survey found that 28% of domestic customers believe that their electricity supplier is responsible for power failure repair and 25% believed their supplier was responsible for grid maintenance.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">This demonstrates that there is confusion among some domestic customers as between the role of the supply companies and the role of the network companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">The third EU electricity market Directive requires that vertically integrated distribution system operators such as the ESB shall not, in their communication and branding, create confusion in respect of the identity of the supply branch of the utility.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">In that legal context and in support of competition it is important and indeed necessary to address the ESB branding issue.  I fully expect the ESB and the CER to agree a solution which supports the further development of competition, is in the best interests of Irish electricity consumers and takes account of any legitimate concerns.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_959">I propose to take Questions Nos. 40, 42 and 71 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">My Department entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) in late December 2008. Since then, 3 has progressed its network rollout and NBS broadband services are now available in more than 65% of the 1,028 designated Electoral Divisions (ED) to be covered under the Scheme.  Under the NBS contract, all EDs in the NBS Coverage Area are required to have broadband connectivity by the end of September 2010. The total current and capital cost of the full roll-out of the NBS has been estimated by "3" at some €223m, of which a maximum of €79.8m will be contributed by the Government and the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">The Government and the EU contribution to date, under the Scheme, amounts to some €48m.</p>
            <p eId="para_962">Currently the mobile wireless broadband service (I-HSPA) specifications include a minimum download speed of 1.2Mbps and a maximum download speed of 5Mbps, a minimum upload speed of 200kpbs and a maximum upload speed of 1.8Mbps.  A maximum contention ratio of 36:1 also applies, with a data cap of 15GB.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">The satellite product, deployed in a very limited number of cases, has contracted minimum speeds of 1Mbps download and 128kbps upload, with a maximum contention ratio of 48:1, with a data cap of 11GB.</p>
            <p eId="para_964">Under the NBS contract, the mobile wireless broadband products will be upgraded to higher specifications (speeds, contention and data caps) in July 2010 and again in October 2012 without any increase in the monthly recurring charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_965">Following the 2010 upgrade, NBS subscribers will experience minimum download speeds of 1.6Mbps and maximum download speed of 6.8Mbps, minimum upload speeds of 1.2Mbps and maximum upload speed of 4Mbps, with a maximum contention ratio of 22:1.  The data cap will increase to 25GB.</p>
            <p eId="para_966">Following the 2012 upgrade, NBS subscribers will experience minimum download speeds of 2.3Mbps and maximum download speed of 10.4Mbps, minimum upload speeds of 1.4Mbps and maximum upload speed of 4.8Mbps, with a maximum contention ratio of 18:1.  The data cap will increase to 40GB.</p>
            <p eId="para_967">Similarly, following contracted upgrades to the satellite product in July 2012 and again in February 2014, minimum download speeds of 1.6Mbps and 2Mbps respectively, together with a minimum upload speed of 256Kbps and a maximum contention ratio of 48:1, will apply, with the data cap remaining at 11GB.</p>
            <p eId="para_968">My Department has put in place robust monitoring of the NBS to ensure that the network delivers the minimum specified service or better to all users.  Performance delivery data, which is submitted to my Department on a monthly basis or as required, is critically analysed by independent technical consultants Analysys Mason Ltd.</p>
            <p eId="para_969">The monitoring arrangements provide information on a wide range of key indicators including the broadband excess availability in each cell of the network, the number of customers resident in that cell and actual contention and latency values.  Utilisation thresholds are set for each element of the network and upgrades of the network and its capacity are automatically triggered at contractually agreed levels of traffic to ensure that the quality of the broadband service is maintained.</p>
            <p eId="para_970">In addition, a sample selection of customers is monitored for quality on a monthly basis. Download and upload speeds are sampled at a number of locations monthly to ensure that minimum speeds are met or exceeded.</p>
            <p eId="para_971">The NBS contract also provides for independent monitoring and audit at any stage during the contract with a view to verifying that the services are being provided in accordance with the contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_972">I can confirm that 3's I-HSPA network which is used to deliver the NBS is designed and dimensioned to ensure that the network delivers the minimum contracted service, or better to all NBS users. Performance monitoring reports, including customer experience data, confirms this to be the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">Based on the most recent monitoring reports for I-HSPA and satellite, I can confirm that the average user has been able to receive download speeds in excess of the minimum requirements and the network is virtually un-contended.  This level of service delivery is supported by the sampling of customer experience and the speed sampling.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">On the basis of the information provided to my Department, I am satisfied that the specified service levels required under the NBS contract are being met.</p>

        asked the

          the mechanism by which new windfarm proposals can seek grid connection outside of the Gate 3 process.  
        [23089/10]

          </question>
          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_376">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_976">The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has statutory responsibility for grid connection offers and for oversight of EirGrid's grid connection process including the Gate process for renewable energy.</p>
            <p eId="para_977">The CER Gate 3 process which sets out to facilitate connection of around 4,000 MW of additional renewable capacity is currently underway.  Once the level of take up of Gate 3 offers becomes clear, the CER will decide how to address any issues arising, including the timing and selection criteria for additional grid connections.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">A strategic framework to deliver on the potential for offshore renewable energy and for exporting renewable electricity from Ireland is also a key priority.  This will take account of grid technology developments, power flow management techniques, and progressive interconnection with the UK, and potentially Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">There are currently over 1,500 megawatts (MWs) of renewable generation capacity connected to the electricity grid.  Wind powered technology is the dominant renewable technology.  Over 100 individual windfarms have been connected with a combined capacity of 1,260 MWs.  240 MWs of hydro-power are connected.  The balance represents biomass plants mainly landfill gas.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">The contribution from renewable energy connected to the electricity grid is increasing very steadily from year to year.  Renewable generation contributed 11.9% of all electricity consumed in 2008 compared to just 4.4% in 2003.  Renewable generation in 2009 is estimated to have represented 14.4% of all generation consumed.  Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's recently published Report on Renewable Energy trends confirms that Ireland is on schedule to meet the 15% target for electricity from renewable sources this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">In addition to projects already built and connected, a further 1400 MWs of capacity have already signed grid connection offers from the Gate 1 and Gate 2 processes and will be built and connected to the grid over the next two or three year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">The CER and EirGrid previously estimated that around 5,800 megawatts (MWs) of renewable capacity would be required in total to deliver the 40% target in 2020.  Subject to trends in electricity consumption and other factors the prospects that the 40% target may in fact be exceeded.</p>

            <p eId="para_984">The Government is giving high priority to supporting the development of Ireland's ocean energy potential.  Not only will ocean energy contribute to Ireland's renewable energy targets, it has considerable potential for inward investment and enterprise activity in support of economic renewal.  The research activities of the Hydraulics and Maritime Centre at University College Cork are a key part of the Ocean Energy Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_985">The Ocean Energy Unit in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) is supporting University College Cork to upgrade the existing wave-basin located at the Hydraulics and Maritime Research Centre (HMRC). The facility provides research and testing facilities for a variety of offshore purposes. The upgrade of the existing facility includes new wave generating equipment, new experimental test rigs, improved workshop facilities and advanced computer solutions for numerical analysis and modelling.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">SEAI is also working with the Marine Institute, UCC and other industry stakeholders in putting in place an enhanced management and operational structure for the HMRC reflective of its role in the national ocean energy research programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">There are proposals for a new National Ocean Test Facility to be developed as part of a Maritime and Energy Research Centre (MERC) beside the National Maritime College at Ringaskiddy.  These proposals would see the HMRC relocate its facilities to a site adjacent to the National Maritime College. These plans are at an early stage of development and significant work including costings remains to be carried out before firm proposals are brought forward. The funding of €1.5m made available for the HMRC thus far has largely been for the purchase of equipment, all of which can be transferred to the new facility at MERC if such a transfer is decided upon.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_378">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_989">I look forward to working with the new Energy and Climate Change Secretary, Chris Huhne on all matters of mutual interest including energy security.  I met Minister of State Charles Hendry at the Energy Council yesterday 31st May during which we touched on a number of bilateral energy issues including gas security and emergency planning.  I am hoping to have a bilateral with Secretary Huhne in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">Currently around 96% of Ireland's gas needs are met by imports from the UK via the two subsea interconnectors with Scotland.  This infrastructure also supplies the gas needs of Northern Ireland, through the Scotland Northern Ireland Pipeline, and the Isle of Man.</p>
            <p eId="para_991">The three interconnectors are operated by Gaslink, a subsidiary of Bord Gáis, on behalf of Ireland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Man.  International treaties between the Governments of Ireland and the UK were signed on the construction of each of the two subsea interconnectors.  The Treaties set out the terms for the operation of the pipelines and include provisions on security.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">There also are gas emergency arrangements in place between Ireland and the UK.  In the event of a need to reduce gas load in the UK, the arrangements provide that Ireland, Northern Ireland and  the Isle of Man will be given equal treatment on a pro rata basis.  Emergency plans for both gas and electricity are tested with the UK through joint annual emergency exercises.</p>
            <p eId="para_993">Given the high level of integration of the UK and Ireland's gas systems, there is a close bilateral working relationship with the UK on energy security issues, including liaison on EU developments.  The interests of Northern Ireland are also fully reflected under the bilateral framework.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">These bilateral arrangements will be enhanced through the framework for regional and EU cooperation on security of gas supply under the forthcoming European gas security of supply Regulation.  The Regulation is expected to be adopted later in the year.  The Regulation will require Member States to formally consult with each other as part of their emergency planning processes.  This provision will underpin the existing arrangements between Ireland and the UK.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">We are working very closely with the UK and Northern Ireland to ensure optimum coordination of existing emergency arrangements.  We will also be fully collaborating with the UK to ensure maximum coordination on the implementation of the forthcoming Regulation to mutual benefit.  This includes the further formal enshrining, as necessary, of bilateral arrangements for security and emergency planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">Apart from cooperation with the North and the UK, there are other fora for regional cooperation where issues related to energy supply and security arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">We work closely with our colleagues in the energy sectoral group of the British-Irish Council (BIC), specifically on grid infrastructure and marine energy issues.  The BIC Members are Ireland, Northern Ireland, the UK, Scotland, Wales, Jersey, Guernsey and the Isle of Man.  The enhancement of the Grid linking these islands, and with mainland Europe, is a key opportunity to realise greater levels of security of supply and sustainability.  I discussed these issues with my colleagues at the inaugural Ministerial meeting of the BIC Energy Group in London in March.  We will explore opportunities for enhanced cooperation again at the BIC Summit in Guernsey towards the end of this month when I look forward to meeting Secretary Huhne.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">One area for discussion between BIC members relates to the announcement of the EU North Seas' Grid Initiative on 7 December 2009. Under this initiative, the Irish and UK Governments have agreed to work with the Governments of Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Denmark, Sweden and Norway to develop an integrated offshore grid in the North and Irish Seas.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">In addition, Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland are conducting the Irish Scottish Links in Electricity Study (ISLES) study to establish the viability of an offshore electricity grid network to exploit wind, wave and tidal resources in the Irish Sea and Atlantic coastal areas.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1003">The report referred to, "An Assessment of the Potential for Geological Storage of CO<sub>2</sub> in the Vicinity of Moneypoint, Co. Clare”, is the final report of a piece of geological research study, which was commissioned by the Environmental Protection Agency, with support from the Geological Survey of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1004">The report does not state that "carbon emissions from Moneypoint can not be captured and stored underground".  What this report concludes is that the geological characteristics of the rock formations in the West Clare area, where Moneypoint coal-fired power station is located, are unsuitable for storing carbon dioxide.</p>
            <p eId="para_1005">Should we choose to maintain a coal-fired plant in our power generation mix after 2020, then such a plant would be likely to be either a refurbished Moneypoint or a new build coal station on the existing site.  As coal is the fossil fuel which emits most carbon dioxide, prevention of such emissions or dealing with them after they are emitted is a priority action in national and international programmes which address climate change, as well as a likely EU requirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">The ESB is currently investigating the technological options for dealing with such emissions. One of those options involves filtering the carbon dioxide out of the flue gases after combustion, transporting it by pipeline and storing it in suitable geological structures underground.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007">Several studies of the potential for carbon dioxide storage in Ireland have indicated that the West Clare Basin, close to Moneypoint, looked promising, and so the research which was the subject of the recent report was undertaken as part of the EPA's Climate Change research programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1008">However, there are other possibilities.  For example, part of the depleted Kinsale gas field structure may be suitable for this purpose. In the transition to a low or zero carbon energy system, keeping more carbon dioxide from entering the environment is vital.  If coal stays in our fuel mix, a facility for carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) will be crucial. That is why I have established an Interdepartmental Committee on CCS to look at all the technical, environmental legal, regulatory and other issues concerned with implementing CCS in Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_1012">Significant progress has been made over recent years in both broadband roll out and quality and mobile telephony services.  For example, Ireland has over 1.443 million broadband subscribers and our broadband per-capita penetration rate is 32.4%.  Internationally, Ireland ranks 11th of the EU 27 for per-capita broadband penetration (composite fixed and mobile), 4th for mobile only penetration, and 14th for fixed broadband penetration.  Of the homes with broadband connections, 68.4% of them, and 72.8% of SMEs are using broadband speeds of between 2mbps — 10mbps.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">Only 19% of the non residential subscriptions and only 25% of the residential subscriptions are in the 1–2 Mbps range.  Higher speeds, in some cases up to 50Mbps, are also available to residential and SME customers in urban areas.  Speeds of up to 24Mbps are becoming more generally available from DSL providers and 30Mbps products are available from the main cable operator.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">ComReg's Quarter 4 report also shows a mobile penetration rate of 119%, with 5.3 million subscriptions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1015">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband and mobile services, is a matter in the first instance for electronic communications service providers who operate in a fully liberalised market.  In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where appropriate and possible.  Government policy is set out in "Next Generation Broadband — Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland", which I published in June 2009.  The policy paper sets out the Government's position that investment in broadband infrastructure is primarily a matter for the private sector, facilitated, where appropriate and possible by Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">The Government has undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where operators have been unable to offer services on a commercial basis.  In the case of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), 3 is progressing its network roll-out  and NBS broadband services are now available in more than 65% of the 1,028 designated Electoral Divisions (ED) to be covered under the Scheme.  Under the NBS contract, all EDs in the NBS Coverage Area are required to have broadband connectivity by end September 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">It is accepted that even after the full roll-out of the NBS there will still be isolated incidents of premises outside areas covered by the NBS scheme that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (e.g.: a telephone line may not be suitable or is too far from an enabled exchange, or; the premises do not have "line of sight" to a base station).  The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Plan (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives and given State Aid approval to a rural broadband scheme.  In this context, my Department is currently progressing the detailed design and implementation of such a scheme which will be available to unserved rural premises outside of the NBS areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_1031">The objective of the one-stop-shop commitment in the Next Generation Broadband policy paper "Gateway to a Knowledge Ireland", is to facilitate telecoms network operators in gaining access to ducting that exists along publicly-owned energy, transport and other infrastructure so as to help reduce the cost of fibre roll-out for backhaul networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032">Government policy is to make available all State-owned infrastructure on an open-access basis in so far as is possible and I do not favour exclusive deals being done whereby one service provider secures exclusive access to a particular State-owned network.</p>
            <p eId="para_1033">An important step in delivering on this commitment is the Communications Regulation (Premium Rate Services and Electronic Communications Infrastructure) Act 2010, which provides that the National Roads Authority (NRA) is the single point of contact for access to ducts on motorways and other national roads.  This means that telecommunications service providers no longer have to approach individual local authorities when seeking such access.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">The legislation also allows the NRA to make a scheme, which will permit it to impose charges for the use of ducts made available by the NRA on national roads, subject to the approval of the Minister for Transport following consultation with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035">I am satisfied that this will provide an open and transparent way of setting access pricing for NRA infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">I understand the NRA is currently exploring how best to develop this new business, which will include consultation with service providers and other stakeholders.  I very much welcome this development as it is an example of what I set out to achieve in facilitating open access to State-owned ducting.  Such open access is a clear policy objective of mine.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">The NRA model is a significant advance and I will be seeking to extend this approach to other suitable State-owned infrastructure.</p>

            <p eId="para_1040">The initial discussions indicate that there are technical challenges associated with the use of Short Message text technology to broadcast emergency messages.  The mobile phone technologies were never designed to send short message service (SMS) messages simultaneously to all users of the mobile phone network.  The  question of how long it would take for messages to go through is being analyzed, and there are concerns that it could take some time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041">The mobile phone operators have also indicated that there may be issues associated with resultant increased numbers of helpdesk calls which such messages might generate.  All these issues are being considered along with other methods for the delivery of emergency messages using television and radio broadcast networks. The simplest approach used in the past is regular announcements on these networks.</p>

I am advised that the robustness of any report would require access to data on matters such as customer port interfaces, backhaul connections and other technical aspects of the Internet connectivity.  My Department is working with ComReg with a view to exploring how best to proceed and, if appropriate, ComReg using its powers and expertise to maximise the robustness of any report.

            <p eId="para_1049">I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 64 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1050">Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides the legislative basis for the development of Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) services in Ireland and for analogue switch off.  Under the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 2009, RTÉ is required to develop a national free to air DTT service which enables the switch off of free-to-air analogue television services in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_1051">The RTÉ DTT service is required to provide a digital platform for the existing analogue free to air television services, and provide space for additional public service channels, if required.  In the event of spare capacity it can be used by RTÉ on a commercial basis, to offer carriage to other commercial television channels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1052">In relation to commercial DTT, the Broadcasting Act also provides for the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland (BAI) to seek to licence commercial DTT services in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053">A competition for a commercial DTT service provider was initiated by the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland (BCI) in 2008.  Three applicants were short-listed.  In July 2008 the BCI announced its intention to enter into negotiations with Boxer DTT Ltd, the highest placed consortium.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">Boxer withdrew from the process in April 2009.  As a result, negotiations commenced with the next placed bidder, the OneVision consortium.  In April 2010, BAI withdrew the contract offer from OneVision as that consortium was unable to reach agreement with the network operator, RTÉNL.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055">The BAI offered the contract to the third place consortium, Easy TV earlier this month but they declined the offer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1056">While the fact that the BAI process did not result in a commercial DTT operator is unfortunate, the plans for the national RTÉ DTT service continue to be progressed.  In this regard, I signed an Order, SI 85 of 2010, under section 129 of the Broadcasting Act, 2009 requiring RTÉ to launch their DTT service to approximately 90% of the population by 31st October 2010.  I have been informed by RTÉ that they are on target to meet the October launch date and I welcome this development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1057">The 2009 Act also requires RTÉ to provide the full national digital service by the end of 2011 or such date as I may specify.  I have communicated to RTÉ that the date for the provision of a full national DTT service is 31st December 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_1058">The development of a national DTT network is important to Ireland, both in terms of securing the future of public service broadcasting and in terms of the benefits to be accrued from the use of the "digital dividend".  The "digital dividend" arises from the closure of the analogue television network and is a clear enabler of economic and social growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059">My priority is therefore to provide for the closure, in 2012, of the analogue terrestrial "free to air" broadcasting services provided by RTÉ, TG4 and TV3.  The European Commission has set 2012 as the timeline for analogue switch off throughout Europe and the EU Council of Ministers has asked Member States to complete switch over by 2012 in so far as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1060">Whilst a commercial DTT service is not essential to provide for analogue switch off, it would have provided additional consumer choice.  In this regard, I intend to meet with those involved in the development of DTT and analogue switch over (ASO) in Ireland, the BAI, ComReg and RTÉ, to consider the broadcasting, telecommunications and spectrum policy issues that arise as a result of the outcome of the BAI's commercial DTT process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1062">The Smart Metering Programme is a central component of the Government's strategy to radically enhance management of energy demand, deliver smart networks and enable greater energy efficiency through the use of cutting-edge technology.  The harnessing of renewable energy and the development of micro generation and electric vehicles is creating an utterly different supply and demand energy landscape.  The integration of energy and ICT systems will deliver an energy network which looks a lot more like the Internet than a traditional grid.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1072">The National Energy Retrofit Programme announced on Budget Day in 2010 is a major initiative which will reduce energy costs and carbon emissions in homes and business while also creating jobs and developing a sustainable market for energy services.  It will significantly reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and contribute to meeting the national efficiency targets including the target of 33% set for the public sector.  It will also create significant employment in the energy and construction sectors in support of economic renewal and building the Smart Economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1073">The detailed design and specification of the new programme is being finalised by my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  In broad terms the Retrofit Programme will bring together the Home Energy Savings Scheme (HES) and the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS), as well as support programmes for business and the public sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074">The programme will involve energy supply companies, energy services providers, construction workers, energy auditors and policymakers, working together to deliver energy savings, cost reductions and ultimately smaller carbon footprints for energy customers throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">Pending the launch of the Retrofit Programme, which is subject to Government approval, all existing schemes, including the Home Energy saving scheme, are fully open for business with applications being received and processed by SEAI.</p>
            <p eId="para_1076">The HES Scheme provides grant assistance to homeowners for energy efficiency retrofitting measures including attic and wall insulation, very high-efficiency boilers, heating controls and Building Energy Rating (BER) assessments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">The scheme is open to anybody owning a house that was built prior to 2006.  Homeowners can expect to save up to €700 per year on their energy bills if they install the full suite of measures available under the scheme.  The scheme offers grants of up to 40% of the typical cost of energy efficiency upgrade measures, depending on the measure concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">The scheme, which was launched in March 2009, had attracted 40,724 applications by the end of 2009.  Some €16.26 million was paid out by SEAI by the end of the year, representing 33,434 energy efficient measures installed in 18,183 homes.  In 2010, already over €16m has been paid to homeowners under the Home Energy Saving scheme (HES). The scheme allows homeowners six months, from the date of grant approval, to have the work undertaken.  Applications, take up and expenditure trends in 2010 to date have been most encouraging with over 1,000 applications per week on average.</p>

            <p eId="para_1081">I propose to take Question Nos. 66 and 77 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1082">I am working closely with the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to ensure a unified approach to energy affordability.  Our Departments are collectively working to finalise the energy affordability strategy which I expect to bring to Government this month.  I launched a public consultation process on the proposed strategy in March this year seeking the views of interested parties on all dimensions of energy affordability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1083">The Strategy will set out actions under way and proposed further actions to protect vulnerable households with a view to ensuring that existing and future measures are targeted at households where the risk of energy poverty is greatest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1084">Enhancing the energy efficiency of homes through structural improvements is pivotal to the Government's strategy to address energy affordability.  To date, energy efficiency improvements in nearly 40,000 homes have been made under the Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS).</p>
            <p eId="para_1085">The WHS provides energy efficiency improvements to homes in, or at risk of, fuel poverty and is primarily delivered by community based organisations (CBOs) of which 23 have, to date, been approved to provide this service.  The CBOs work in partnership with their local network of poverty and community support organisations including public health nurses, MABS and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to identify and address vulnerable homes.  Private contractors were also engaged in 2009 to address the increasing demand for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086">5,343 low-income homes benefited from energy efficiency upgrades under the WHS in 2008, with a further 19,000 retrofitted in 2009 (including nearly 3,000 homes delivered by the ESB according to WHS specification).  Some €15 million was provided for the scheme in 2009, with a further €5 million provided by ESB and BGE.  Of the €15 million Exchequer allocation €12.4m was spent under the scheme last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1087">To date this year, the WHS has been delivered to 5,480 homes.  I am confident that this year's target of 22,500 homes will be achieved.</p>

            <p eId="para_1094">The setting of electricity and gas network tariffs is the statutory function of the independent energy regulator, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).</p>
            <p eId="para_1095">The CER reviews electricity and gas network charges on an annual basis and publishes its decision on these each summer, following a detailed consultation process. These charges are then included in the determination of final retail tariffs, both for ESB and BGE regulated tariffs, and for the prices offered by independent suppliers in the electricity and gas markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1096">Network charges are only one component of final retail tariffs. In recent years, the most significant factor in determining both electricity and gas retail tariffs has been the wholesale price of gas.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">In addition to the annual reviews, the CER is also close to completion of the third review in its cycle of 5-year reviews of electricity network expenditure, which also set the framework for the transmission, distribution and supply elements of the tariff for the subsequent five years.  The first review in the cycle commenced in 2000 with a programme of significant infrastructure investment to address the deficit left by two decades of under-investment in our networks.  The outcome of the current network review will come into effect on Oct 1st 2010 for the five year period to 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_1098">The review is designed to ensure that ESB and EirGrid make even greater efficiencies in operational and capital expenditure relating to networks, thus minimising costs for consumers, while at the same time facilitating vital investments in electricity networks to ensure security of supply, facilitate the increased penetration of renewable generation and underpin the transition to a low carbon economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099">The provision of secure competitively priced energy supplies and the delivery at least cost of strategic energy infrastructure are central to the Government's core economic strategy of growing the smart economy with a thriving enterprise sector and high quality employment.</p>

          <speech by="#EamonRyanGP" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_399">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1101">The Irish oil industry is fully privatised, liberalised and deregulated and there is free entry to the market.  The Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) has no function in relation to the price of petrol, diesel or home heating oil.  There is no price control on petroleum products and it has been the policy objective of successive Governments to promote price competition and consumer choice.  The CER therefore has no role in relation to the oil supply market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1102">On foot of a request from my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the National Consumer Agency (NCA) undertook a survey on retail prices of petrol and diesel.  The NCA completed its report in December, 2008, which is available at www.consumerconnect.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_1103">The NCA Report noted that the prices that Irish retailers charge for oil products relate to the refinery price rather than to the price of crude oil.  The refinery price for oil products varies with demand and does not always move in line with crude oil prices.  There is a time lag between movements in crude prices and refined prices. The current prices at the pump reflect global market price, which is fluctuating, transportation costs, euro/dollar fluctuations and other operating costs as well as the impact of taxes on oil products.  Price differences are an ongoing feature of the market economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">Government policy in relation to energy is strongly focussed on reducing the impact of fossil fuel prices on consumers and business, through the promotion of alternative renewable resources, energy efficiency, security of supply and greater competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">The Government's energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes are aimed at moving Ireland's economy away from reliance on imported, carbon intensive fossil fuels, which display ongoing price volatility.  The objective is to ensure the long term protection of the domestic, commercial and agricultural sectors in the context of energy affordability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106">The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan, published in May 2009 identifies an overall energy savings target of 32,000 GWh to be achieved in 2020, representing approximately €1.6 billion in annual energy cost reductions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1107">Grant aid to move to renewable heating has also been provided in the domestic Greener Homes Programme and the Reheat Programme, allowing householders, businesses and local enterprises to move away from oil fired heating towards more efficient and sustainable forms of heating such as solar, geothermal and biomass heating.</p>
            <p eId="para_1108">In the transport sector, we are supporting a move away from imported oil through the introduction of biofuels into the fuel chain and an electric vehicle programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1109">Following on the Biofuels excise relief programme introduced in 2005, the Biofuel Obligation Scheme is scheduled to commence in July 2010 and will compel fuel suppliers to include 4% biofuels in their overall annual fuel sales.  The National Obligation will incentivise and enable the sustainable growth of the Irish biofuels market and support indigenous biofuel producers, allowing for the displacement of traditional oil products in the transport sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1110">In addition to the Biofuels Obligation Scheme, I have announced a target of 10% of all vehicles to be powered by electricity by 2020, which equates to around 225,000 vehicles.  Electric vehicles are likely to play an important role in reducing our reliance on imported fossil fuels.  The VRT exemption for electric vehicles and the VRT reliefs of up to €2,500 for plug-in hybrid vehicles are already incentivising the roll out of alternative engine technologies.  I have also announced the introduction of a grant scheme for up to 6,000 vehicles over a two year period from January 2011, which will provide grants of up to €5,000 for full battery electric vehicles and up to €2,500 for plug in hybrid electric vehicles.  The grant scheme will be administered by the SEAI and full details will be published in advance of the scheme commencement date of Jan 2011.  Working with ESB, who are rolling out the relevant technology, I have signed agreements with a number of car manufacturers with a view to making early production electric vehicles available to the Irish market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1111">The range and breadth of programmes which have been introduced by the Government demonstrate our commitment to reducing the impact of high fossil fuel prices, enhancing security of supply and ensuring sustainability.</p>

Large Energy Users, IBEC and Forfás have been calling for the introduction of the levy for some time.  The issue was discussed at a Round Table Forum on Energy Costs for Business which took place in Farmleigh in July 2009.  This forum was chaired by my Department and involved the Departments of Finance and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the CER, the energy sector, Large Energy Users, ESRI, Forfás, IBEC, IDA and Enterprise Ireland.  At this forum, large energy users and Forfás called for the introduction of the carbon windfall levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1121">The Government agreed, around the time of the Forum, to my proposal to work to progress legislation to recover carbon windfall gains from electricity generators.  The Government's intention to progress the legislation was flagged by the CER in its prices decision in August last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1122">My Department subsequently met with several electricity generators who wished to discuss their concerns about the potential introduction of a carbon levy.  I also met with some of the generators in question.  In those meetings the generators outlined their concerns and my Department agreed to meet as necessary once the very complex work of drafting a proposed scheme was progressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1123">In addition, shortly before the publication of the proposed legislation on 6th May, my Department met with those generators who would be affected by the introduction of the levy to outline the proposals and to hear their views.</p>

        <b>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Taoiseach</b>
         the amount paid in each calendar year since inception in respect of the e-Cabinet system, in tabular form; the initial outlay for the e-Cabinet system; the nature of the service provided; the person by whom it was provided; if there were tenders sought for each such contract and the successful company or person; when the e-Cabinet system will be reviewed; the approximate number of public sector staff who have access to the system; the number of Ministers who utilise the system; the anticipated future outlay for the e-Cabinet system, the number of Cabinet meetings at which the e-Cabinet system has been used by some or all Cabinet members; the number of meetings at which it has not; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1468">The eCabinet system is in operation across all Government Departments and Ministers' Offices and at Government meetings.  Work on it began in 2002 and it was implemented on a phased basis between 2004 and 2007 at a cost of some €5m.  A breakdown of the costs, including licensing, maintenance, etc. per year, to date in 2010, will be forwarded to the Deputy shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1469">The system electronically supports and enables the administrative processes associated with the preparation and conduct of Government business and the dissemination of Government decisions, and replaces the former paper-based system which involved manual management and distribution of Government memoranda and decisions.  Users at all levels get information more quickly, have more time to reflect on issues and can more readily contribute to proposals under development.  Ministers and senior officials have information about items as they are placed on the Cabinet agenda, with access to the memoranda immediately.</p>
            <p eId="para_1470">The main development partner for the project was the In.vision Research Corporation Inc. (which was bought over by Quark Systems Ltd. in 2008).  In.vision were the proprietors of an XML toolset that was selected for drawdown use by the public service in a public tender competition run by the LGCSB (Local Government Computer Services Board) in consultation with CMOD in the Department of Finance, and the drawdown facility was availed of by my Department for the eCabinet project which is built using the selected toolset.  A small number of additional service providers were also contracted to build the infrastructure and to provide security for the system, using open and restricted (where necessary for security reasons) tendering procedures.  These included Fujitsu Services, Bic Systems (Ireland) Ltd, LAN Communications and Entropy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1471">The system is kept under review and hardware and software upgrades are being implemented during 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472">There are over 6,000 registered users of the system, between Ministers, Ministers of State and civil servants, with different levels of access rights depending on their responsibilities.  All Ministers make use of the eCabinet system and it is and has been available at all meetings held in the Council Chamber in Government Buildings, which account for the vast majority of Cabinet meetings (for cost and security reasons the system functionality is only available for Cabinet meetings at the Cabinet table in the Council Chamber).</p>

            <p eId="para_1485">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1486">I can confirm that my Department received a lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 17 May, 2010.  This claim awaits processing.  In respect of redundancy lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from September/October 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1487">The impact on business of the severe economic circumstances currently pertaining has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the level of Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department.  This has impacted significantly on the capacity to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  On the Redundancy side the scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims in 2009 amounted to 77,001 which represents a threefold increase over the level of claims lodged in 2007 and earlier years.  In 2007, claims received were of the order of 25,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for Redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1489">almost doubling the number of staff through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents; prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours; establishment of a special call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments; better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website; and engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax  liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1490">The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  I should point out that my Department has, in 2009, processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on 2008.  During the period 1 January 2010 to 30 April, 2010, 23,593 claims were received and 27,592 were processed.  In the year to date, inroads have been made on the backlog of claims on hand, which reduced from 41,168 at the end of January to 36,333 at the end of April2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1491">Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.</p>

            <p eId="para_1493">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to both the Redundancy and Insolvency Payments Schemes on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.</p>
            <p eId="para_1494">Table 1 sets out the number of redundancy claims received by my Department in each month from January 2007 to end April 2010 under the Redundancy Payments Scheme.  These figures reflect the number of employees who qualified and applied for statutory redundancy entitlements.  They do not reflect those who lost their jobs with less than two years service in employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1497">In relation to Insolvency Payments, this has resulted in a significant rise in the level of company receiverships and insolvencies, creating an unprecedented increase in the number of claims being submitted to the Insolvency Payments Section of my Department as Table 2 shows.  My officials endeavour to process all claims as quickly as possible and claims are dealt with in order of date of receipt.  A total of 20,172 claims were processed in 2009, which represents an increase in productivity of 108% over 2008, and the Insolvency Payments Section is constantly endeavouring to achieve earlier completion and payment dates.</p>

            <p eId="para_1654">The particular issue referred to by the deputy is a matter for the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1655">The issue of improving access for SMES to public contracts is at the centre of the Governments current drive to eliminate barriers to SMEs access to public contracts. An increased involvement of SMEs into public purchasing will allow SMEs to make the most of their potential for job creation, growth and innovation. Government recognises the important business opportunities that public service contracts represent for business enterprises in the local and national economy and encourages participation to the greatest extent possible. As part of the Governments new strategy for public procurement, significant measures have been introduced which make it easier for small and medium enterprises (SMEs) to bid for public contracts.</p>

            <p eId="para_1658">I propose to take Questions Nos. 90 and 91 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1659">Overall policy responsibility for public procurement is a matter for my colleague the Minister for Finance.  However, specific complaints about individual contracts should be brought to the attention of the relevant Government Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1660">The Competition Authority is the statutory body responsible for the enforcement of competition law in the State.  Section 29(3) of the Competition Act 2002 provides that the Competition Authority is independent in the performance of its functions.  Under section 30(1)(b) of that Act, the Competition Authority is responsible for investigating any breach of the Act.  As investigations are part of the day-to-day operational work of the Authority I have no direct function in the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1661">I understand however that the Competition Authority has received a number of complaints about pre-qualification criteria for public tenders.  For example, a number of businesses have suggested that the level of turnover or indemnity insurance required by a local authority to tender for a contract is too high, disproportionate and anti-competitive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1662">The Competition Authority enforces the Competition Act 2002, which prohibits anti-competitive arrangements (under Section 4) and abuse of a dominant position (under Section 5).   I am advised that for each of the complaints received, the Authority found no evidence of an anti-competitive arrangement or abuse of a dominant position within the meaning of the Competition Act.  Consequently, the Authority cannot take any enforcement action because it does not appear that any breach of competition law has taken place.</p>

            <p eId="para_1672">I understand that the case raised by the Deputy related to an industrial relations dispute, rather than one involving issues of employment rights law. The case was heard before a rights commissioner who issued his decision on 9 May 2008.  The claimant appealed this decision to the Labour Court.  The Labour Court subsequently issued its decision upholding the decision of the rights commissioner.</p>
            <p eId="para_1673">Both the Rights Commissioner Service and the Labour Court are independent statutory bodies that act independently in carrying out their functions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1674">The basic approach to industrial relations in Ireland is one of voluntarism, whereby the law will not seek to impose a solution on the parties to a dispute but will, where appropriate, assist them in arriving at a solution.  The State's role in industrial relations in Ireland has been largely to facilitate the voluntary process through establishing, by legislation, a number of bodies to assist in the resolution of disputes.  These bodies are the Labour Relations Commission, including its Rights Commissioner Service, and the Labour Court.  The State provides the industrial relations dispute settlement machinery, free of charge to assist this process.</p>

            <p eId="para_1677">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1678">I can confirm that my Department received a lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 14 December, 2009.  This claim awaits processing.  In respect of redundancy lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from September/October 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">The impact on business of the severe economic circumstances currently pertaining has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the level of Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department.  This has impacted significantly on the capacity to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  On the Redundancy side the scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims in 2009 amounted to 77,001 which represents a threefold increase over the level of claims lodged in 2007 and earlier years.  In 2007, claims received were of the order of 25,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1680">Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for Redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:</p>
            <p eId="para_1681">almost doubling the number of staff through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;</p>

            <p eId="para_1685">engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1686">The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  I should point out that my Department has, in 2009, processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on 2008.  During the period 1 January 2010 to 30 April, 2010, 23,593 claims were received and 27,592 were processed.  In the year to date, inroads have been made on the backlog of claims on hand, which reduced from 41,168 at the end of January to 36,333 at the end of April 2010.</p>

            <p eId="para_1703">In instances such as this, where the employer does not formally wind the company up but goes into informal insolvency and is unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the Department seeks from the employer evidence of inability to pay the entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting confirmation from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the employer's inability to pay the redundancy entitlements and, requesting the latest set of financial accounts/statement of affairs for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.  If this documentation is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1704">In the present instance, some but not all of the necessary documentation has been provided and my Department is in contact with the employer's accountant in relation to an outstanding issue.  If this is resolved to satisfaction, it should be possible to process the claim for payment shortly thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1705">If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.</p>

            <p eId="para_1710">I propose to take Questions Nos. 99 to 102 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1711">Measuring competitiveness is complex and requires an assessment of the full range of factors which enable firms to improve their productivity levels and compete in international markets.  There are a number of international indices of competitiveness produced by international bodies, each with their own methodological constraints.  The National Competitiveness Council's annual report, "Benchmarking Ireland's Performance", provides a comprehensive assessment of Ireland's competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1712">Taking a narrow view of competitiveness in terms of real effective exchange rates or price and labour costs is only one part of such an assessment.  Table 1 shows labour cost (i.e. average industrial wage) developments since 1999.</p>

The nominal HCI is a nominal effective exchange rate for the Irish economy that reflects, on a trade-weighted basis, movements in the exchange rates vis-à-vis 56 trading partners.  The real HCI (deflated by consumer prices) takes into account relative price changes along with exchange rate movements.  The HCI has been deflated by consumer and producer prices to show the level both would need to fall to reach 1999 levels.</p>

The euro has appreciated against both currencies in the past 10 years despite weakening in recent months.  This means that Irish imports from Britain and the US have become relatively cheaper, while Irish exports have become more expensive to trading partners in the US and UK.  To revert to the level seen on January 1st, 1999, the euro would need to depreciate by 5.1% against the dollar and almost 17% against sterling.</p>

            <p eId="para_2333">I visited the Mid West of the United States from 5th to 9th of April 2010, on a marketing programme organised by IDA Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2334">The programme involved meeting Chairpersons, CEOs and other senior executives of leading companies, across all sectors and in particular in the Life Sciences and Financial Services sectors.  It also involved interviews in the US media, promoting Ireland as a location for foreign direct investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2335">Some of the companies, which I met have substantial and valuable activities in Ireland and those meetings focused on retaining, expanding and further embedding the employment footprint here.  For companies which do not have a presence in Ireland, the focus was to underpin Ireland as the location for their proposed investment activities against intense competition from other locations around the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_2336">Overall the engagement at the meetings was positive, with many companies upbeat in their discussions on expansion and growth strategies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2337">While no specific commitments were made in regard to new investment projects during my visit, I am not surprised at this, as most major FDI projects can involve a lengthy evaluation and decision-making process.  It is often the case following such visits that a considerable number of meetings and discussions will take place between the company and IDA Ireland before the company makes a final decision on location.</p>
            <p eId="para_2338">I am optimistic, however, that new investments and jobs will follow in time, particularly given the positive views which were expressed to me during those meetings.</p>

            <p eId="para_2340">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2341">I can confirm that my Department received a lump sum claim for the individual concerned on 7 September 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2342">In instances such as this, where the employer does not formally wind the company up but goes into informal insolvency and is unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the Department seeks from the employer evidence of inability to pay the entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting confirmation from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the employer's inability to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements and, requesting the latest set of financial accounts/statement of affairs for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.  If this documentation is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.  In the present instance, some but not all of the necessary documentation has been provided and my Department is in contact with the employer's accountant in relation to an outstanding issue.  If this is resolved to satisfaction, it should be possible to process the claim for payment shortly thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2343">If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.</p>

            <p eId="para_2347">My Department processes payroll payments for approximately 1,200 individuals on behalf of the Department, its Offices and a number of agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2348">Under Section 4 of the Payment of Wages Act, 1991, there is an obligation on my Department to provide a statement of wages and deductions to each individual (i.e. a payslip) as soon as may be after payment has been effected.  These payments are made either weekly or fortnightly and my Department issues up to 50,000 payslips per annum in respect of these payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2349">It is not possible to identify all of the individual costs associated with the issuing of payslips.  For example, issuing payslips is just one element of the overall payroll administration carried out by staff of my Department's Salaries Section. Pay and overhead costs associated specifically with the production of payslips by these staff are not disaggregated on my Department's accounting system.  Similarly, payslips are generally delivered as part of the normal in-house postal arrangements in my Department, so no additional cost is incurred in delivering the payslips in these circumstances.  In the relatively small number of cases where payslips are posted through the Post Office system, the cost of posting payslips is included in the general postal costs for my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2350">Other costs related to the issuing of payslips, such as the purchase of special stationery or equipment, arise periodically.  These costs are captured as part of general stationery and equipment costs on my Department's accounting system and it is not feasible to comprehensively disaggregate them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2351">However, my officials have been able to identify that costs of €8,221 and €14,655 were incurred in 2007 and 2008 respectively for payslip stationery.  The supplies purchased in 2008 have not yet been exhausted.</p>
            <p eId="para_2352">As part of a general upgrade of my Department's payroll systems, my officials are currently exploring the introduction of on-line payslips as an alternative to the current printed format.  This project will minimise the time spent in producing and issuing payslips and will therefore reduce the related costs.</p>

            <p eId="para_2354">The Employment Permits Section of my Department processes applications in respect of the different types of employment permits (Green Cards Permits, Work Permits, Spousal/Dependant Permits and Intra-company Transfer Permits).  All applications are processed in line with the Employment Permits Act 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2355">Due to the prioritisation of business needs of my Department, it was necessary to re-deploy a significant number of staff in the Employment Permits Section to the Redundancy Payments area in early 2009 where there is a strong need for additional resources to process payments to those who have lost their jobs.  This has resulted in currently higher processing times for some of the permit types and appeals.  In the priority high skills area of Green Cards and Intra Company Transfers, applications are still being processed within 15 working days.  In relation to Work Permits, Spousal applications and appeals, measures have been put in place to address the current backlog.</p>
            <p eId="para_2356">I can report that significant progress has been made in reducing the backlog in these areas from 3,000 in August 2009 to 2,000 in May 2010. The Employment Permits Section is now processing Work Permit applications received in the first week of March 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2357">I wish to advise the Deputy that a Work Permit application in respect of the person concerned was received in the Employment Permits Section of my Department on the 9th April 2010.  A decision will be due on this application in about 3-4 weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_2361">The Task Force completed its Interim Report, which was presented to the Minister by Mr. Brosnan last July. Since then the Government has been responding to the recommendations under the various headings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2362">Last September, the Tánaiste sent the Task Force a report on responses up to that time. Following completion of a cross-departmental consultation, taking account of Ministers' budgets for 2010, with other Ministers and all relevant Divisions and agencies in my Department, the Tanaiste and Minister of State made detailed Statements to the Dáil on 28 January, 2010, on the issue.

In respect of redundancy lump sum payments paid directly to employees, such as in this instance, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from September/October 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_2374">The impact on business of the severe economic circumstances currently pertaining has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the level of Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department.  This has impacted significantly on the capacity to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge on the Redundancy side is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims in 2009 amounted to 77,001 which represents a threefold increase over the level of claims lodged in 2007 and earlier years.  In 2007, claims received were of the order of 25,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2375">Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for Redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2376">Almost doubling the number of staff through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;</p>
            <p eId="para_2377">Prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</p>

            <p eId="para_2380">Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities, which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2381">The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  I should point out that my Department has, in 2009, processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on 2008.  During the period 1 January 2010 to 30 April, 2010, 23,593 claims were received and 27,592 were processed.  In the year to date, inroads have been made on the backlog of claims on hand, which reduced from 41,168 at the end of January to 36,333 at the end of April 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2382">Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.</p>

          <speech by="#DaraCalleary" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Innovation" eId="spk_433">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_2399">My Department administers the Social Insurance Fund (SIF) in relation to redundancy matters on behalf of the Department of Social Protection.  There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2400">The Statutory Redundancy Payments Scheme is operated strictly in accordance with the provisions of the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967-2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2401">Under the Redundancy Payments Scheme all eligible employees are entitled to a statutory redundancy lump sum payment on being made redundant.  Statutory Redundancy is an employment right, and any employee over the age of 16 who is in insurable employment with the relevant employer for two years prior to the date of termination of the employment, is eligible.  An employee is entitled to two weeks pay for every year of service, plus a bonus week, subject to a maximum weekly ceiling of €600 gross pay.</p>
            <p eId="para_2402">A redundancy situation arises in general where an employee's job no longer exists and he/she is not replaced.  It is up to the employer concerned in the first instance to determine whether or not in fact a redundancy situation obtains.  Application should be submitted to my Department on an RP50 form completed and signed as appropriate by the employer and the employee.  This form can be completed online or downloaded from the Department's website at www.entemp.ie.  In the case of forms submitted online, it is necessary also to submit a signed hardcopy of the form. Disputes arising in relation to statutory redundancy entitlement can be referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) for adjudication.</p>
            <p eId="para_2403">Under the Redundancy Acts, the objective is to ensure that statutory redundancy payments, due to eligible employees on being made redundant, are made in accordance with the legislative provisions.  The legislation places the onus, in the first instance, on the employer to discharge the obligation to pay redundancy entitlement to employees.  On so doing, the employer is entitled, by virtue of the pay related social contributions made to the State, to recover a rebate of 60% of the lump sum redundancy payments paid out to employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_2404">In instances where the employer does not formally wind the company up but goes into informal insolvency and is unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the Department seeks from the employer evidence of inability to pay the entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting confirmation from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the employer's inability to pay the redundancy entitlements and, requesting the latest set of financial accounts/statement of affairs for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.  If this documentation is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy lump sum entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share, which the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_2405">If supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.</p>
            <p eId="para_2406">The impact on business of the severe economic circumstances currently pertaining has resulted in an unprecedented increase in the level of Redundancy Payment claims lodged with my Department.  This has impacted significantly on the capacity to maintain the customer service targets that previously obtained.  The scale of the challenge on the Redundancy side is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims in 2009 amounted to 77,001 which represents a threefold increase over the level of claims lodged in 2007 and earlier years.  In 2007, claims received were of the order of 25,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2407">The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing rebate applications received in November 2009, so that the waiting time is approximately 6 months.  In respect of lump sum payments paid directly to employees in instances where employers are unable to pay the statutory redundancy entitlements, the Section is, in general, processing claims dating from September/October 2009.  In some instances where the necessary supporting documentation for claims is not provided to my Department, or where queries arise, processing of claims can be further delayed until the required documentation is provided and/or outstanding queries are resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_2408">Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for Redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include:</p>
            <p eId="para_2409">almost doubling the number of staff through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents;</p>
            <p eId="para_2410">prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours;</p>
            <p eId="para_2411">establishment of a special call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments;</p>
            <p eId="para_2412">better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website;</p>
            <p eId="para_2413">engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax  liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
            <p eId="para_2414">The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  I should point out that my Department has, in 2009, processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on 2008.  During the period 1 January 2010 to 30 April, 2010, 23,593 claims were received and 27,592 were processed.  In the year to date, inroads have been made on the backlog of claims on hand, which reduced from 41,168 at the end of January to 36,333 at the end of April 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2415">Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation (Deputy Dara Calleary)</from>
            <p eId="para_2467">I am very concerned about the issues raised by the Migrant Rights Centre and strongly condemn any practices by employers that may result in non-compliance with employment rights entitlements or any other mistreatment of employees, including those on employment permits.  I have expressed these concerns directly with representatives of the Migrant Rights Centre when I met them in April 2010.  As I indicated at that meeting, it is the case that Ireland's Employment Rights Legislation establishes the framework of statutory rights applicable to all people working in Ireland whether they are Irish citizens or not.  I would urge all whose employment rights are being breached by an employer or those who know of such exploitation, to contact the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) who will investigate these matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_2468">The Employment Permits Act 2006 sets out in legislation the rules governing employment permits.  One of the main objectives of this Act was to increase the rights and protections afforded to migrant workers and the means to ensure redress in the event of exploitative practices. The Act's provisions give immigrants greater freedom, autonomy and control over their own employment choices by enabling workers for the first time to apply and re-apply for their own permit and allow workers to change their employer after a period of a year and move to another employment in order to take advantage of better conditions or career options.  Last year, my Department issued almost 1,500 employment permits in respect of employees changing to new employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2469">While understanding the concerns expressed, I am equally aware that a properly controlled employment permit system requires that permits be issued to a specific employee for a specific job with a specific employer.  To do otherwise would not only risk abuse of the employment permit system but would make it much more difficult to ensure that employers observed the employment rights of employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_2470">The Employment Permits Act 2006 allows for regular review of Ireland's economic migration policies and my Department keeps these policies under review, in line with the emerging needs of the labour market, on an on-going basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_2473">I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 123 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2474">I have been informed by IDA that from the beginning of 2009 and to date in 2010, there have been a total of 14 site visits by potential investors to Waterford City and County, 10 visits in 2009 and 4 to date in 2010.  Details of the locations of those visits are set out in the tabular statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2475">There have been no immediate investment announcements resulting from these but there can often be a considerable time lag between a site visit and investment an announcement as there are many factors effecting a company's decision as to where to locate.  IDA Ireland introduces a prospective client company to 3 or 4 selected locations, which can meet the company's requirements for skills, labour, site and/or building(s), and infrastructure.  While IDA seeks to influence the selection of location, the final decision on location is taken in all cases by the promoting company.</p>
            <p eId="para_2476">In line with the National Spatial Strategy, IDA's strategy for Waterford is focused on the Gateway City of Waterford and the county town of Dungarvan, and as will be seen from the tabular statement, all of IDA's itineraries have been to there two towns.</p>

            <p eId="para_2554">I announced in the Budget that a carbon tax at a rate €15 per tonne would be introduced on fossil fuels. It should be noted that a carbon tax came into effect on 10 December 2009 in respect of petrol and auto-diesel and from 1 May 2010 to kerosene, marked gas oil (also known as ‘green diesel' or ‘agricultural diesel'), liquid petroleum gas (LPG), fuel oil and natural gas. The application of the tax to coal and commercial peat is subject to a Commencement Order.</p>
            <p eId="para_2555">It is estimated that the carbon tax, inclusive of VAT, will yield approximately €250 million in 2010 and €330 million in a full year. The revenue will, amongst other things, be used to boost energy efficiency, to support rural transport and to alleviate fuel poverty.</p>

            <p eId="para_2619">The Consumer Credit Directive establishes a harmonised legal framework in the European Union for the provision of consumer credit ranging from €200 up to €75,000. (It does not apply to mortgages). It replaces a 1987 Directive (87/102/EEC), which laid down minimum rules for consumer credit arrangements within the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_2620">In consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, my Department is currently preparing the draft Statutory Instrument, which will transpose the Directive into Irish Law.  It is intended that the legislation will be finalised by 11th June, 2010.  The Directive will take effect from that day.</p>
            <p eId="para_2621">I believe that the Directive enhances the strong regulatory regime underpinning consumer protection, and as such, I have decided that credit unions should be subject to its full application.</p>
            <p eId="para_2622">However, following consultation with representatives of the Credit Union movement, I am aware that the credit unions will require some time to upgrade their systems and train staff, so that they can effect compliance with all the requirements of the Directive. Consequently, I have adopted the discretion allowed for under Article 2.5 applying limited provisions of the Directive to them until 11th December 2011, after which date, the full Directive will take effect.</p>

          the amount owed by businesses to the Revenue Commissioners under each tax heading; the age profile of arrears; and the steps being taken by the Revenue Commissioners to engage with business currently struggling to meet their tax liabilities.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2670">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the total amount of tax outstanding at 31 March 2010 was €2,112 m. Of the total outstanding at end March 2010, €669 m is the subject of appeal, leaving €1,443 m available for collection. The table attached shows the age profile of this collectible debt and the breakdown under each tax heading. This amount includes monies owed by both businesses and individuals. The economic and financial environment in which Revenue and its customers operate has been extremely challenging over the last number of years. Notwithstanding the difficult economic, financial and business environment Revenue is clearly focused on securing the taxes and duties due to the Exchequer on a timely basis. This approach is appropriate to ensure the collection of tax as effectively as possible in the current environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2671">I am assured by Revenue that it is aware of the difficulties faced by some taxpayers and businesses in the difficult environment that prevails at the moment. Revenue is conscious of the need to strike the appropriate balance between giving some latitude to viable businesses experiencing short-term difficulties and ensuring timely collection of tax debts. Indeed, Revenue responded to the current problematic environment as it emerged by actively encouraging businesses experiencing particular payment difficulties to proactively engage with them when the issues start to emerge so that an agreed approach to them can be put in place and timely compliance speedily restored. I commend Revenue for the work that it has done in that regard and in the practical support and assistance it has been providing and continues to provide to viable businesses. I am aware that tax practitioners and representative bodies have recognised and welcomed the Revenue efforts in this regard also.</p>
            <p eId="para_2672">I know that Revenue is, when required, fully committed to taking the appropriate measures, including the necessary enforcement action, where a business is not viable or seeks to deliberately evade the obligation to pay what is owed, on time. Aside from the importance of ensuring that debts due are recovered to the greatest extent possible, this also ensures that compliant businesses are not put at a competitive disadvantage. I am fully supportive of Revenue's action in deploying the necessary collection and enforcement measures to address non-compliance in such circumstances.</p>

          the position regarding inheritance tax for a person who has jointly owned a house with their aunt for more than ten years and the entire house has been left to them following the death of the aunt.

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2872">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that for the purposes of Capital Acquisitions Tax (Gift and Inheritance Tax), the relationship between the person who provided the gift or inheritance — the disponer — and the person who received the gift or inheritance — the beneficiary — determines the maximum tax-free threshold — the "group threshold" — below which gift or inheritance tax does not arise. There are, in all, three separate group tax-free thresholds based on the relationship of the beneficiary to the disponer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2873">Group A: €414,799 — applies where the beneficiary is a child (including adopted child, step-child and certain foster children) or minor child of a deceased child of the disponer.  Parents also fall within this threshold where they take an inheritance of an absolute interest from a child.</p>
            <p eId="para_2874">Group B: €41,481 — applies where the beneficiary is a brother, sister, a nephew, a niece, or lineal ancestor or lineal descendant of the disponer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2875">Group C: €20,740 — applies in all other cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_2876">When calculating whether a beneficiary has received benefits in excess of his or her group tax-free threshold, any other gifts and inheritances received by that beneficiary since 5 December 1991 from within the same group are also taken into account. A beneficiary who receives an inheritance from an aunt falls into the group B threshold above. In the present case, where the aunt and the beneficiary jointly owned the house, the beneficiary is treated for inheritance tax purposes as inheriting the half-share of the house owned by the aunt and is not taxed on the full value of the house.  Inheritance tax, at a rate of 25%, would therefore be payable by the beneficiary only on the excess value of the half-share of the house over the Group B tax-free threshold figure of €41,481 (assuming the beneficiary had received no prior gifts and inheritances since 5 December 1991 from within the same group).</p>
            <p eId="para_2877">Separately, in addition to the tax-free group thresholds available to a beneficiary, the Capital Acquisitions Tax code also exempts a gift or inheritance of a dwelling-house, or of a share of a dwelling-house, completely from gift or inheritance tax in certain circumstances. The main conditions attaching to the exemption are that the beneficiary of the dwelling-house must have resided in the dwelling-house for a minimum of three years prior to the gift or inheritance and must not have an interest in any other dwelling-house. In addition, the beneficiary must continue to occupy that dwelling-house as his or her only or main residence for a period of six years from the date of the gift or inheritance. This exemption ensures that what may be the family home for many people will not be the subject of any gift or inheritance tax when it is transferred. The dwelling-house exemption is available to any beneficiary who meets the conditions for the exemption irrespective of whether or not they are related to the disponer of the gift or inheritance and irrespective of the value of the dwelling-house being transferred.</p>

            <p eId="para_2879">The details supplied by the Deputy relate to current campaign by the Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) in relation to amendments to Section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 contained in the Central Bank Reform Bill 2010 and to the transposition by Ireland of the Consumer Credit Directive. Section 35 of the Credit Union Act 1997 imposes limits on credit unions in relation to longer-term lending. The restrictions contained in Section 35 are an important asset and liability instrument which has protected the financial stability of the credit union movement over many years. The matter was considered by my Department following extensive consultation with the two credit union representative bodies — the Irish League of Credit Unions (ILCU) and the Credit Union Development Association (CUDA) — and with the Registrar of Credit Unions. I have decided that, in addition to extending from 20% to 30% the proportion of a credit union loan book that may apply to loans over five years, it is necessary now to give the Registrar of Credit Unions powers to require credit unions to have appropriate liquidity, provisioning and accounting requirements in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2880">The Registrar of Credit Unions will take a balanced and proportionate approach to the implementation of the new Section 35 requirements and has set out for the credit union representative groups transitional arrangements and clarifications on the implementation approach. The Registrar has already indicated that these include transitional arrangements for a 15% provisioning requirement up to 30 September 2011, trial periods, exceptions with regard to top-up loans and relaxation of the 100% provisioning requirement in respect of rescheduled loans which have missed two or more payments. The transitional arrangements as proposed by the Registrar will help to ease the position for credit unions in the current financial year and the next financial year ending in September 2011. They will also allow time for credit unions to adjust to the new regime. While I continue to believe that while the principle of the approach we are taking in the Bill must be adhered to, the Registrar and I are prepared to look at the scope for any further flexibility in relation to the transitional arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2881">As I have indicated previously, there is a balance to be struck between meeting members' needs to reschedule loans and ensuring the stability of the credit union sector overall. We are not seeking to have a credit union sector which is over-regulated. However, we must act now in a prudent and preventative manner. It is in the interests of every credit union in the country that the stability of the sector is safeguarded. The proposals being brought forward in connection with the Bill will achieve this fundamental aim. The effect of the new provisions on credit unions will be closely monitored.</p>
            <p eId="para_2882">The Consumer Credit Directive establishes a harmonised legal framework in the European Union for the provision of consumer credit ranging from €200 up to €75,000. (It does not apply to mortgages). It replaces a 1987 Directive (87/102/EEC), which laid down minimum rules for consumer credit arrangements within the EU. In consultation with the Office of the Attorney General, my Department is currently preparing the draft Statutory Instrument, which will transpose the Directive into Irish Law. It is intended that the legislation will be finalised by 11 June, 2010. The Directive will take effect from that day. I believe that the Directive enhances the strong regulatory regime underpinning consumer protection, and as such, I have decided that credit unions should be subject to its full application.</p>
            <p eId="para_2883">However, following consultation with representatives of the Credit Union movement, I am aware that the credit unions will require some time to upgrade their systems and train staff, so that they can effect compliance with all the requirements of the Directive. Consequently, I have adopted the discretion allowed for under Article 2.5 applying limited provisions of the Directive to them until 11 December 2011, after which date, the full Directive will take effect. Notification of my decision to adopt this discretion was published on my Department's website on 21 May 2010 and the both credit union representative bodies were informed of my decision by e-mail on that date.</p>

This information is taken from tables C4 and C5 of monthly reports produced by the Central Bank which shows loans to and deposits taken from customers, excluding Government and credit institutions. I am assuming that the reference to Irish banks in the Deputy's question comprises of the retail clearing banks and the non-clearing domestic banks. As the Deputy is aware, the Retail Clearing banks are AIB, Bank of Ireland, National Irish Bank and Ulster Bank and some of their subsidiaries. The Non-Clearing domestic banks include ACC Bank plc, Anglo Irish Bank, EBS Building Society, Irish Life and Permanent plc, Irish Nationwide Building Society, KBC Bank Ireland plc and Postbank.</p>

            <p eId="para_3692">The Minister for Finance and Personnel in Northern Ireland Sammy Wilson and I have met on a number of occasions and we discussed matters of mutual interest, including NAMA, the potential for budgetary savings and improved outcomes through North South co-operation and the economic challenges facing both jurisdictions. Indeed, Minister of State Mansergh had a bilateral meeting with Minister Wilson as recently as 20th May last in Belfast.</p>
            <p eId="para_3693">In addition, the Government is in regular contact with its British counterparts including the new Prime Minister and Secretary of State for NI. The North South Ministerial Council also meets regularly in Plenary and Sectoral formats and discusses the significant economic and public finance challenges in each jurisdiction. The next meeting of the North South Ministerial Council Plenary will take place on Monday, 5 July. At that meeting, as is the norm, we will discuss the economic situation, North and South. At the last Plenary meeting of the NSMC in Derry on 14 December, 2009 there was discussion on the scope for future mutually beneficial cooperation in dealing with the economic downturn. I would expect that we will have further discussion on this at the meeting on 5 July.</p>
            <p eId="para_3694">I met the Minister for Finance and Personnel Sammy Wilson at the tenth North South Ministerial Meeting in Special EU Programmes Sectoral Format that was held in my Department on 17th February 2010  I represented the Irish Government and the NI Executive was represented by Minister Wilson, MP, MLA and Minister for Social Development Margaret Richie (just after her election as leader of the SDLP).  The communiqué issued following the meeting is available on the NSMC website at the following:</p>

By way of information, the historical figures the Deputy requests are published each year in the Finance Accounts. The most recent projected figures for 2010 to 2014 were those published in Budget 2010 and are available on the Department of Finance website. It should be noted that the figures in the attached tables are total tax revenue, total net current expenditure and total net capital expenditure and, as such, the expenditure figures contain both the voted and non-voted elements. As the 2009 Finance Accounts have not yet been published, the 2009 figures are taken from the end-December 2009 Exchequer Statement.</p>

            <p eId="para_3782">This is a matter for the Revenue Commissioners who are charged with responsibility for the timely collection and recovery of taxes and duties due to the Exchequer. Where businesses or individuals fail to meet their tax payment obligations on time, then they are liable to interest. The statutory rates of interest charged by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to late payment of tax and underpayment of tax were reduced in the Finance Act 2009. The current daily rates of 0.0219% for most taxes and 0.0274% for fiduciary taxes give respective annualised equivalents of 8% and 10% approximately. Interest on late payment of tax operates not just as a compensation for the Exchequer for the late payment of monies due to it but also supports timely voluntary compliance by levelling the playing field between those who meet their obligations on time and those who pay late. I am satisfied that Revenue's actions in the charging and collection of interest are reasonable having regard to the importance of timely payment of tax.</p>

            <p eId="para_3787">I propose to take Questions Nos. 147 and 178 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3788">Discussion on the issue of how to ensure that the financial sector contribute to the cost of dealing with crises is underway in various fora internationally. In addition to the proposals from the European Commission referred to by the Deputy, which are set out in the Commission's Communication on Bank Resolution Funds, the IMF is also examining this issue, at the request of the G20 and is due to present its final report to the G20 in June this year. There is no particular consensus as yet as to the most appropriate form for a charge to the financial sector. Some countries, including Sweden, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom and France, have also announced various types of charges including a stability fee, a financial crisis responsibility fee and a tax on bonuses.</p>
            <p eId="para_3789">The Commission's Communication sets out the Commission's proposals for the financial sector to contribute to the cost of managing the failure of a bank in the future but does not address the recoupment of costs arising from the current crisis. The Commission supports the establishment of ex ante resolution funds, funded by a levy on the banks to facilitate the managed failure of ailing banks in an orderly manner and suggests that a resolution fund should form part of the toolbox of measures available to Member States in an EU crisis management framework. The Commission is clear that shareholders and creditors must be first to face the consequences of bank failure. It is important to note that an objective of the Commission's proposal, in conjunction with its wider proposals on a crisis management system, is to mitigate the burden on the taxpayer arising from financial crises.</p>
            <p eId="para_3790">The issue of the financial sector contributions to the cost of financial crises has been discussed by Finance Ministers at EU level. The most recent meeting of ECOFIN on 18 May concluded that better mechanisms are needed to ensure that the financial sector bears the cost of resolution measures in a way that equitably reflects its responsibility and with a view to eliminating the need for the use of public funds, whilst preventing further moral hazard. Ministers acknowledged that further work is necessary, at EU and international level, on the design of the arrangements to mitigate systemic risk and better anticipate and defray the costs of a possible crisis, and the Council agreed some overarching principles to guide this work, including the importance of coordination.</p>
            <p eId="para_3791">With respect to the taxation treatment of bank losses, the position is that in general, companies can offset trading losses incurred in an accounting period by carrying those losses forward and using them to reduce trading income arising in a later accounting period. In the case, however, of the banking institutions participating in the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) process, the NAMA Act 2009 inserted a new section 396C into the Taxes Consolidation Act which has the effect of restricting the amount of a participating institution's taxable trading income which can be reduced by losses carried forward, including losses arising from the NAMA process. The legislation limits the amount of trading income of a participating institution and all other participating institutions in the same group against which losses forward may be set off in any accounting period to 50 per cent of such income. The objective is to leave a portion of income in the tax net which would otherwise have been relieved by the use of losses forward. Unused losses can be carried forward indefinitely by companies until they are fully utilised and this remains the position both for institutions involved in the NAMA process and for companies generally.</p>

            <p eId="para_3793">The European Council has taken a number of steps in recent weeks and months to safeguard the financial stability of the euro area. However there is a broad understanding that economic governance within the euro area needs to be improved. To this end, the President of the European Council Herman Van Rompuy has established a Task Force to look more closely at reform. The Task Force — of which I am a member — has met once already and is set to look four main issues: a crisis resolution mechanism for the euro area, addressing macroeconomic imbalances, reinforcing the Stability and Growth Pact, and budgetary coordination. Ministers discussed all issues and the general view was that all avenues for improvements that could be advanced quickly should be the focus of their work. The Task Force will meet next week and the President intends to provide an interim report to the European Council in June. A final report will be made to the European Council in October.</p>

            <p eId="para_3799">The Financial Services Ombudsman was established on a statutory basis as an independent body to deal with complaints from customers of financial services providers.  The Minister for Finance has no involvement in the day to day workings of the Financial Services Ombudsman. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to make any statement in relation to the Deputy's question.</p>
            <p eId="para_3800">The Deputy may wish to note that the latest annual report from the Financial Services Ombudsman (for the year 2008) gives an account of the number of complaints received since the service was set up, the number resolved and closed and the number on hand at end 2008.  However, I am advised by the Financial Services Ombudsman that the commencement of an investigation takes between 12 and 16 weeks once the decision to investigate a case has been taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_3801">I am advised that the reason for this is the increase in the number of new cases which the Ombudsman has received over the past two years along with the changes to the procedures as set down by a ruling of the High Court in June 2008.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3803">The Deputy will be aware that the Finance Act 2010 introduced significant changes in connection with the modernisation and simplification of the probate process and Capital Acquisitions Tax (CAT).  One of the key elements of the change relates to the filing of CAT returns (Forms IT38).  A new simplified paper form has been developed and may be used where the following conditions are met: No relief/exemption/credit is claimed, apart from small gift exemption; The benefit taken is an absolute interest without conditions or restrictions; The property included in the return was taken from only one disponer and is not part of a larger benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_3804">Where any other relief/exemption/credit is being claimed, the return must be filed electronically through Revenue's On-line Service (ROS).  The 2009 Report of the Commission on Taxation recommended that where data on "tax expenditures" is required to facilitate evaluation and cost-benefit analysis, taxpayers availing of the tax reliefs should be required to e-file their tax returns.  The opportunity was taken to implement Commission's recommendation in relation to CAT as part of the modernisation and simplification changes.  Reliefs from CAT can be very significant; for example, agricultural and business property reliefs can reduce the taxable values by 90% and dwelling house relief gives a full exemption.  CAT is also one of the more complex taxes resulting in many calculations and potential adjustments.  Online filing and calculation reduces the scope for error and miscalculation.  The online form is relatively simple and quick to complete as only questions that are pertinent to the return are presented for answers. As information is entered, the system progressively customises the return screens that have to be completed, thus minimising the number of screens and options presented.</p>
            <p eId="para_3805">Returns through ROS may be made by the taxpayer or by a practitioner (for example, a solicitor or accountant) acting on his or her behalf.  Where an individual taxpayer cannot use the simplified paper return form but has genuine capacity difficulties in relation to online filing and where there is no practitioner involved in the process, the individual can contact Revenue directly to discuss their individual circumstances and they will be facilitated as far as possible.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3814">On 25 April 2010, having consulted the Governor of the Central Bank and the Regulatory Authority and having decided that it is required in the public interest to prevent potential serious damage to the financial system in the State and to ensure the continued stability of that system.  I issued directions to the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission to convert part of its €3.5 billion holding of Bank of Ireland preference stock into ordinary stock as part of the capital raising exercise announced by the bank on 26 April.  The details of the transaction are as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3815">Placing/Conversion (Step 1)</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3816">The National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF) has subscribed for 576 million units of ordinary stock. In exchange for this stock the NPRF converted 1,036 million units of preference stock at their issue price of €1.00 into ordinary stock.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3817">Warrant cancellation</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3818">The NPRF has received €491 million in cash in return for the cancellation of the warrants issued in conjunction with the preference stock.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3819">Rights Issue (Step 2)</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3820">The NPRF will participate in the Bank of Ireland rights issue taking up the full allocation to which it is entitled at a price of €0.55 per unit of ordinary stock.  In order to exercise the rights, the NPRF will convert a further 627 million units of its preference stock into ordinary stock.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3821">Fees</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3822">The NPRF will receive €51 million in fees for its participation in the transaction.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3823">Change in dividend rate on preference stock</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_3824">The dividend rate on the remaining preference stock increases from 8.00% to 10.25%.</p>
            <p eId="para_3825">The transaction involves no new investment by the NPRF in Bank of Ireland and is being funded entirely via conversion of preference stock.  Including the cancellation of the warrants issued in conjunction with the preference stock and fees, the NPRF will receive total cash income of €542m from Bank of Ireland for participation in the transaction.</p>
            <p eId="para_3826">On completion of the transaction, the NPRF's directed investment in Bank of Ireland will consist of: 1,900 million units of ordinary stock valued at their current market price (36% of the bank's ordinary stock  in issue including the bonus stock issued to the NPRF in lieu of a cash dividend on the preference stock in February 2010); and 1,837 million units of preference stock held at their issue price of €1.00 paying an annual dividend of 10.25%.</p>
            <p eId="para_3827">The return on the investment comprises dividends received on the ordinary and preference stock, changes in the market value of the ordinary stock and receipts in respect of the cancellation of the warrants and transaction fees.  Bank of Ireland's share price has been volatile since the announcement of the transaction. It is not uncommon for the volatility of a stock to increase during a rights issue period. Additionally, market volatility globally has increased in recent weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_3828">The NPRF Commission will continue to publish information on the overall return to and value of the investments it holds at my direction in credit institutions in its quarterly Performance and Portfolio Updates.</p>
            <p eId="para_3829">As regards the treatment of changes in the value of the NPRF, the contribution of the NPRF to the General Government Balance is made up of the interest and dividends which it earns on its investments, less any costs associated with the administration of the fund.  Any changes in the nominal values of investments held by the NPRF are not considered to be income or expenditure, as they affect the value of the stock of NPRF assets and do not have an impact on the General Government Balance.  The payment to Government of ordinary shares in lieu of a dividend is considered as income in national accounting terms and, therefore, improves the General Government Balance by the same amount as if the Fund had received the dividend payment.</p>

Dividends on preference shares received in the form of ordinary shares are also included.  The investments were made by the Commission for the purposes of bank recapitalisation at the direction of the Minister for Finance under the Investment of the National Pensions Reserve Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2009.  The preference share investments are held at cost. While the preference shares pay a non-cumulative fixed dividend of 8%, income on the preference shares is not recognised until declaration of the dividend by the bank concerned.  The Minister for Finance directed the NPRF Commission on 25 April 2010 to convert part of its preference shareholding in Bank of Ireland into ordinary stock as part of the bank's capital-raising exercise but this is not reflected in the figures above which relate to the position of the NPRF at 31 March 2010.</p>

The figures provided in this reply for monthly VAT receipts are estimates of the amount of VAT yield that would be generated by the volume of clearances of Petrol and Auto Diesel up to the end of each month.  VAT returns can be made monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, half yearly or annually depending on the nature of the registration status of a trader, and this will dictate the point in time when VAT on sales will actually be paid.  It should also be noted that the VAT content of purchases of Auto Diesel is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system.</p>

            <p eId="para_4111">The Financial Regulator has identified the recapitalisation requirement of EBS at €875 million to enable it to meet its regulatory capital requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_4112">A total of €100m of capital was provided on 27 May 2010 in return for the issue to the Minister of special investment shares (SIS) in the society.  The remaining capital requirement of €775 million may be reduced through a liability management exercise as announced today by the Society.  The balance of the capital requirement will be met through a combination of possible private capital investment and, to the extent that private capital investment is not forthcoming in the near term, partly or fully through the issuance of a Promissory Note or Notes from the State to the institution.</p>
            <p eId="para_4113">The use of a Promissory Note (or Notes) would reduce the impact on the Exchequer this year as the promised capital would be paid over a period of ten to fifteen years.</p>
            <p eId="para_4114">The State capital investment ensures that the Society is recapitalised in accordance with the Financial Regulator's requirements, and it supports the financial position of the Society in its continued operations as a going concern, including taking deposits and providing mortgages.  The rights attaching to the SIS investment give the State majority control and economic rights over the Society, including the right to potential dividends if the Society has sufficient distributable reserves to enable payment.  In addition, the proceeds of any future investment in, or sale or merger of, the Society would accrue to the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_4116">Certain concerns were raised in regard to credit flowing to small businesses arising from the Mazars reports and other sources.  Given the key strategic importance of small business to the economy, not least in terms of the numbers employed in the sector, a credit appeal mechanism in the form of an independent Credit Review Office was established in the December 2009 budget.  This was a specific measure to deal with a specific issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_4117">Individual consumers who feel that they have been refused credit on unfair grounds may appeal the decision to their lender.  If they are not satisfied with the outcome they may then take their appeal to the Financial Services Ombudsman. The Financial Services Ombudsman is an independent office established to deal with consumer complaints about their dealings with financial institutions.  The Financial Services Ombudsman will <i>not</i> attempt to evaluate on the decision of the lender but he may examine the case from a <i>procedural</i> point of view.  If procedural flaws are identified, in any given case, the Ombudsman may, for example, instruct the lender to review the decision and to follow the correct procedure.</p>

            <p eId="para_4121">The EU procurement directives provide that public contracts for supplies and services above certain thresholds must be advertised EU-wide and awarded to the most competitive tender in an open and objective process.  The thresholds are currently €125,000 for the Central Government sector and €193,000 for most other authorities.  The aims of the regulations are to promote an open, competitive and non-discriminatory public procurement regime which delivers best value for money.  It would be a breach of the rules for a public body to favour or discriminate against particular candidates on grounds of nationality and there are legal sanctions which may be used against any public body infringing these rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_4122">The Government recognises the important business opportunities that public service contracts represent for business enterprises and encourages participation to the greatest extent possible.  In this regard the Government is fully aware of the difficulties experienced by the small and medium business sector in the current market.  The<b> </b>Cabinet Sub-Committee on Transforming the Public Service recently considered the issues currently facing small businesses in the public procurement market.  In a submission to the Sub-Committee, my Department has given a commitment to reiterate Government policy in this area, to examine current issues and to address them in general guidance to contracting authorities.  It is envisaged that this guidance will be issued in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_4140">The Domicile Levy is charged on an individual</p>
            <p eId="para_4141">who in any year is Irish domiciled and an Irish citizen,</p>

            <p eId="para_4145">The Levy will be charged for 2010 and subsequent years but the payment for each year can be made at any time up to 31 October in the year following the valuation date, which is 31 December of each year.  The first such valuation date will be 31 December 2010 so that the payment of the levy for 2010 can be made at any time up to 31 October 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_4146">As yet, no one has "self-declared" for the domicile levy for the tax year 2010.  This is because it is not possible to establish whether the levy applies to an individual for a particular tax year until after the end of that year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4147">In 2008, some 6,966 Irish income tax returns showed one or both spouses as non-resident.  As many of the non-residents included in this figure are foreign nationals or have a foreign domicile, they would not be subject to the domicile levy.  The equivalent figures for 2009 are not yet available.  Returns for 2009 are due to be filed by 31 October 2010 or, in the case of returns made on ROS, the Revenue Online Service, by mid-November 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4148">While the Domicile Levy is to be charged for the tax year 2010 it is not payable for that year until 2011 with the latest date for payment being 31 October 2011.  Therefore no Levy will be payable in 2010.  As respects the estimated yield in 2011, having regard to the lack of available data, it is not possible to estimate the number of individuals, including individuals who filed Irish income tax returns for the tax year 2008, that this measure will affect; hence it is not possible to estimate the yield.</p>

            <p eId="para_4158">The immediate and the ongoing needs of separated children seeking asylum relating to accommodation, medical and social needs as well as their application for refugee status are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE) in accordance with  Section 8(5)(a) of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) and the Child Care Act, 1991.   When an unaccompanied asylum seeker minor in the care of the HSE reaches 18 years of age  he or she may be referred by the HSE to the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) for transfer to adult accommodation and service provision.  In circumstances where the HSE deem such a person to be particularly vulnerable, the period in HSE care can be extended beyond 18 years of age at the HSE's discretion. Furthermore where  a young person is in the process of completing an educational course the HSE would liaise with RIA to ensure that educational needs are met. A considerable degree of liaison between the HSE and the RIA takes place before that person reaches 18 and is due to be transferred from the former to the latter.</p>

            <p eId="para_4168">With regard to the impact of the European Working Time Directive on services, there is wide spread acceptance that attainment of compliance is good for patient safety.  It is agreed that it serves no good purpose to have over-stretched, over-tired junior doctors treating patients. The use of excessive levels of overtime is not in patients' best interests. The Labour Court, in Recommendation 19559 of June 2009, accepted the HSE's requirements to provide hospital services in a structured way 7 days per week, 24 hours per day and accordingly recommended that NCHDs should undertake to operate 5/7 day working with effect from 1st July 2009. The Labour Court also recommended that the core working hours should run from 8.00 a.m. to 9.00 p.m. Monday to Friday and from 8.00 a.m. to 7.00 p.m. at weekends. These recommendations were accepted by the IMO and the HSE. They are now reflected in the NCHD contract and represent a significant step forward towards achieving EWTD compliance.</p>

In communicating the decision to suspend the bilateral negotiations the Irish Government asked the Vietnamese Government whether it will be possible to proceed with these adoptions.

            <p eId="para_4181">Foster care is the main form of alternative care provided by the Health Service Executive for children in need of care and protection who cannot remain in their own homes.  The provision of foster care is central to child welfare and protection.  The HSE works closely with foster /relative carers and places a very high value on the role they play in the provision of care in a secure and stable family setting.  The Government's Implementation Plan  arising from the  report of the Commission to Inquire into Child abuse provided for the filling of  social work posts currently vacant.   In 2010 additional revenue in excess of €14m has been allocated to the HSE to implement actions in the Governments Ryan Implementation Plan. Included in this funding is a provision for the recruitment of an additional 200 social workers in the current year. The HSE are working to improve services to children in foster care in line with previous HIQA reports and in particular ensuring compliance with the statutory provisions in relation to children in foster/relative care.</p>
            <p eId="para_4182">The Child Care Act, 1991 places a legal obligation on the Health Service Executive (HSE) to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care and protection.  A child is taken into the care of the State only as a last resort where alternative care and welfare services cannot adequately meet the needs of the child and his/her family.  The Child Care Act, 1991 allows for a child at risk to be taken into care on a voluntary basis or pursuant to a court order.  Provisions have also been included in the Act for emergency situations where there is an immediate and serious risk to the health or welfare of the child.</p>
            <p eId="para_4183">The Social Services Inspectorate (SSI) within HIQA currently inspects HSE residential centres, excluding private/voluntary centres, which are inspected by the HSE under section 69 of the Child Care Act, 1991.  The SSI has played a key and important role in the setting of standards, inspecting and ensuring quality services in the area of children's welfare services.  The role of the SSI is key in ensuring and monitoring the safety of children in the care of the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_4186">Given the current economic situation, to move to full statutory implementation of the standards, including regulation and inspection, presents significant challenges at this time.

I can confirm that this organisation is not funded under youth services programmes under my remit. As regards funding under the Comhairle na nÓg Development fund (also under Vote 41), this is allocated to the County/City Development Boards via the Local Authorities on an annual basis to enhance the development of Comhairle na nÓg as a participation structure and mechanism at local level. The application process does not require the Local Authority to provide details of the training organisations they are working with.</p>
            <p eId="para_4206">Obviously, these funds are not the only source of income for Vocational Education Committees or Local Authorities.  Therefore, the funding of such an organisation by Local Authorities or the Vocational Education Committees is a matter for those individual organisations.

            <p eId="para_4214">The Adoption Bill, 2009, is designed to give force of law to the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Inter-country Adoption. The new legislation, which incorporates the provisions of the Hague Convention, is designed to provide a framework to ensure that appropriate procedures have been followed and that all  adoptions are  effected in the best interests of the child.  Future intercountry adoption arrangements will be governed by the terms of the Adoption Bill 2009 when enacted.</p>
            <p eId="para_4215">There is nothing in the provisions of the Adoption Bill 2009, currently before the Houses of the Oireachtas, which will preclude couples/individuals from effecting a valid, Hague standard adoption from Mexico. With regard to ‘independent' adoptions, Part 13 of the Adoption Bill outlines the restrictions on a person in seeking to make arrangements for adoptions.

            <p eId="para_4218">Under the Nursing Homes Support Scheme Act 2009, a person can act on behalf of their spouse in relation to an application for State support in circumstances where their spouse lacks capacity. The person does not need to have an enduring power of attorney or any other form of legal appointment in place in order to do this. This authority is set out in primary legislation; a fact which should be recognised by financial institutions when a person is compiling the documentation required to support an application on behalf of their spouse.</p>
            <p eId="para_4219">The issue of a person obtaining bank statements in respect of their spouse extends far beyond the scope of the Nursing Homes Support Scheme. The requirement to provide evidence of income/assets applies in respect of means-tested schemes generally, including those operated by the Department of Social Protection. To this end, the Deputy may wish to note that the Department of Social Protection provides for the appointment of an agent where a person is unable to manage their own financial affairs. It is likely that anyone who needs assistance applying for the Nursing Homes Support Scheme would already have an agent in place to assist with the collection of their pension and the management of their financial affairs.</p>

Drug intervention programmes which incorporate a treatment referral option for people who come to the attention of the Gardaí and Probation Services is also another important key action.

            <p eId="para_4247">I have responsibility for implementation of the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme which was introduced in January of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4248">The objective of the ECCE scheme is to provide appropriate age related activities and programmes in a formal setting to children, in the year before they commence primary school.  Targeting the pre-school year at a particular age cohort is fundamental to the scheme and requires the setting of minimum and maximum age limits within which children are eligible to participate.  The age range which has been selected extends for almost 17 months, from the age of  3 years 3 months to 4 years 6 months.  In September 2010, children born between 2 February 2006 and 30 June 2007 will be eligible for a free pre-school year place.</p>
            <p eId="para_4249">In setting these limits, account was taken of a number of factors including the differing enrolment policies of primary schools and the fact that the great majority of children commence primary school between the ages of 4 years and 6 months and 5 years and 6 months.  It is accepted that children who commence primary school within two months of reaching their fourth birthday will not be able to benefit from the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_4262">I propose to take Questions Nos. 224 and 225 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4263">The HSE has made significant progress on reconfiguring acute hospital and related services in the Mid West region informed by the Teamwork/Horwath Report and the Health Information and Quality Authority Report on Ennis, which was published in April 2009.  These Reports highlighted the need for changes to be made in the organisation and provision of acute hospital services across the Mid West region as they found services there to be too fragmented, to carry increased risks for patients and staff and to be unsustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_4264">The reconfiguration of services in the Mid-West Region began in early April, 2009.  This involved the cessation of 24-hour Accident and Emergency services at Ennis and Nenagh.  These hospitals now provide an urgent care/minor injuries service for 12 hours a day as part of a regional Accident and Emergency structure.</p>
            <p eId="para_4265">A regional department of surgery has been established in the Mid-West.  All complex acute surgery was centralised to the Mid-Western Regional Hospital, Limerick in October 2009.  Ennis and Nenagh hospitals also now undertake an expanded range of day case surgery and diagnostic work.</p>
            <p eId="para_4266">I am satisfied that the measures being taken by the HSE are necessary and appropriate in order to ensure the provision of safe and effective health services to the people of the Mid West region.</p>
            <p eId="para_4267">As part of the reconfiguration of services in the Mid-West the HSE is currently considering the most appropriate  model for the provision of acute medicine services in the region, including cardiac services.  The HSE is consulting with key stakeholders across the acute hospital and primary and community care service sectors in relation to the development of this model, having regard to factors, such as patient safety.  The HSE's National Director for Quality and Clinical Care and National Clinical Lead for Medicine are working on this process.</p>

            <p eId="para_4296">The Information and Tracing Unit in the Adoption Board provides an advice and referral service for those seeking to trace or to obtain medical or personal information. This unit provides services directly to adoptees, natural mothers and birth families.  It also works closely with the registered adoption societies and the HSE nationwide information and tracing services.  Improvements to this service have been effected by the computerisation of the unique adoption files held by the Board.</p>
            <p eId="para_4297">The National Adoption Contact Register was established in 2005 to assist adopted people and their natural families to make contact with each other, exchange information or state their contact preferences.  They decide, through a range of information and contact options, how they wish to proceed.  Already 440 matches have been made on the Register representing over 900 individuals who have now received a service.  The operation of the Register was reviewed in 2007 and a major upgrading of it has recently been completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4298">The Adoption Board, together with the societies, the HSE and the support groups, developed the "Standardised Framework for the Provision of a National Information and Tracing Service".  This framework was published in November 2007. It sets standards and provides guidance and advice for information and tracing services providers nationally. The standardised Framework is currently being piloted nationally. In relation to Information and Tracing for persons adopted from abroad, the Adoption Board is undertaking a process, with Romanian authorities initially, to determine how best to address the needs of those adopted from abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_4299">Registration of domestic adoptions is governed by Section 22 of the Adoption Act 1952.  Under that provision, an tArd Chláraitheoir (Registrar General) is required to maintain a register of domestic adoptions (i.e. adoptions effected in Ireland, regardless of where the adopted person was born).  The register is called the Adopted Children Register.  An index to the register is maintained and can be searched by any person.  Any person may obtain a copy of any entry in the register.  The legislation also provides for an index linking the birth entry in the register of births (in the case of an Irish-born adopted person) with the entry in the Adopted Children Register.  Information from this index may not be given to any person except by order of a court or the Adoption Board. I am aware that the treatment of adopted persons in this regard differs from the rest of the population but consideration of this issue must take place in the context of the complex legal, ethical and constitutional issues arising from the need to fairly balance the rights of all parties to the adoption process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4300">During the Committee stage debate for the Adoption Bill I indicated my intention to bring forward legislation in this area. In this regard, the policy position is currently being assessed by my Office. Once this process is complete Government approval will be sought to commence the process of preparing legislation.</p>

            <p eId="para_4306">The issues raised in the Final Report are being carefully  considered by the Government.  The Government decided that the matter should be referred to the Senior Official's Group set up previously to discuss this issue so that relevant Departments can consider its implications.  The Attorney General's Office is also considering  the legal and constitutional issues that arise.  The Senior Officials Group will report on these matters shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_4307">The Government is committed to drafting legislation by December 2010 to provide that State employees and staff employed in agencies in receipt of funding from the Exchequer, and who are working with children,  will have a duty to comply with the <i>Children First </i>national guidelines.  My Department is developing legislative proposals in this regard which I will bring to Government for approval.  I am mindful of the issue raised by the Deputy regarding the application of Children First across all organisations and individuals.</p>
            <p eId="para_4308">The Child Care Act, 1991 provides that, in any proceedings under Parts IV and VI of the Act, the court may, if it is satisfied that it is necessary in the interests of the child and in the interests of justice to do so, appoint a guardian <i>ad litem</i> for the child.  My Department is developing legislative proposals in this regard which I will bring to Government for approval.</p>
            <p eId="para_4309">A <i>Guardian ad litem</i> is a representative appointed by the court under the Child Care Act 1991 to represent the views of the child in court.

I have received legal advice which confirms that the obligation contained in Section 45(4) of the Child Care Act 1991 is in substance mandatory.  The legal advice is that the Act creates a statutory power and the HSE, as recipient of this power, must put itself in a position where it can exercise the power should the need arise.  Section 45(4) of the Child Care Act allows me to write to the HSE and instruct it in this or in any other regard.  I intend to do this and will in parallel continue to examine legislative options.  In line with the Government commitment as reflected in the Ryan Implementation Plan funding of €1.0m was set aside by the HSE in its 2010 Service Plan, for the development of aftercare services in 2010.</p>

When an unaccompanied asylum seeker minor in the care of the HSE reaches 18 years of age  he or she may be referred by the HSE to the Reception and Integration Agency (RIA) for transfer to adult accommodation and service provision.  In circumstances where the HSE deem such a person to be particularly vulnerable, the period in HSE care can be extended beyond 18 years of age at the HSE's discretion. Furthermore where  a young person is in the process of completing an educational course the HSE would liaise with RIA to ensure that educational needs are met.

            <p eId="para_4321">As the Deputy is aware, dementia is a most distressing condition both for those suffering from it and their families, and presents a significant and growing challenge to health and social services.  Alzheimer's disease represents about 70% of the cases of dementia.  People are living longer and as a consequence are more likely to develop some form of dementia. While dementia is not solely related to age, the prevalence is higher in older people and increases with age. It is estimated that about 5% of people over 65 years of age have some form of dementia with this figure rising to 20% for people over 80 years of age.  The demographic make–up of Irish Society is changing.  The population is growing older and the number of people aged over 65 is estimated to almost triple over the next 30 years. As I have indicated previously, my Department has started the process of developing a policy on dementia that will support the delivery of long-term care services having regard to future demographic trends and the consequential increase in demand for long-term care. This policy will be developed on the basis of the best evidence available from national and international sources. Officials in my Department are now in discussions with relevant stakeholder groups on the first stage of the process. Finally, I would like to advise the Deputy that the Health Services Executive (HSE) is currently exploring the potential for changes in care pathways for people with dementia, and will make recommendations for the future provision of dementia care across all health and social services. An audit is underway within the HSE of the current specialist dementia care services available both in residential/hospital and community services. This audit will inform future planning and development of services for people with dementia.  The educational needs of staff will also be identified to inform any future staff requirements for working in the area of dementia care. This work will also feed into the overall Dementia Policy formulation.</p>

At a national level, the Deputy will be aware that significant changes took place within the nursing home sector in 2009 resulting in a single system of registration and inspection for all providers, public, private and voluntary, and a single system of financial support.  The net effect of these changes is an assurance to every person in need of care that the same quality standards and the same level of financial State support will apply regardless of which nursing home they choose.   In light of these important changes and in light of service pressures arising from demographic trends, my Department is currently working closely with the HSE to examine long-term capacity, quality, staffing and funding requirements at a national level.</p>

            <p eId="para_4340">Responding to the information needs of the Oireachtas is a priority for my Department and I very much regret that in recent months it has not been possible to provide a substantive response to many Parliamentary Questions due to industrial action. Where Parliamentary Questions have been submitted which concern policy issues which are exclusively the responsibility of my Department, every effort has been made to answer those questions in full. However, a large number of questions submitted to my Department concern operational issues which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive. Staff of the Executive were instructed by their union, IMPACT, that from the beginning of March, they were not to cooperate with any political representations including Parliamentary Questions and Freedom of Information requests. It has not therefore been possible for either my Department or the Executive to provide substantive answers to a large number of Parliamentary Questions and this is likely to be the case until the industrial action has been resolved in full. I am not in a position to comment on how other Government Departments have been affected by industrial action.   All Parliamentary Questions affected by the action have been answered by my Department to the effect that the industrial dispute has prevented the supply of substantive answers, and Deputies have been consistently advised to raise the question again, upon resolution of industrial action, should the matter remain of ongoing concern. This approach was designed to prevent a backlog of questions building up, particularly as a significant proportion of the questions related to cases where the information being sought by the Deputy through the Parliamentary process might, in the circumstances, be obtained by alternative means.  The Department of Health and Children will handle in the region of 6,000 Parliamentary Questions this year, approximately half of which will be referred to the Health Service Executive, either for the provision of information to the Department or for direct reply to the Deputy. A considerable proportion of these will concern personal enquiries on behalf of individuals seeking services from the HSE.  In such cases, the information can also be obtained by addressing the enquiry directly to the relevant service area of the Executive, and where members of the public do so on their own behalf, their enquiries are not affected by the current dispute.   I fully appreciate the frustration of Deputies who are currently unable to obtain information through the usual Parliamentary channels. While alternative access is available for individual cases, Deputies may wish to resubmit, on resolution of the dispute, any questions in respect of wider service, operational and policy issues that have not been answered and are still a cause of concern. My Department and the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive will, when the current industrial action is resolved, continue to assist Deputies as before.</p>

The Health Service Executive has sole operational responsibility for the delivery of health and social services, including those at facilities such as Loughloe House.  As the Deputy is aware this is a former welfare home located in Athlone which shares its site with Day Services for Older Persons for the area.  Loughloe House has been inspected by HIQA. Numerous concerns have been raised in the course of this inspection process both in terms of the physical infrastructure and in relation to management/staffing issues. There are also concerns regarding the Fire Safety Precautions at the home. It must be appreciated that all developments have to be addressed in the light of the current economic and budgetary pressures.  The Executive has been asked to make a rigorous examination of how existing funding might be re-configured or re-allocated to ensure maximum service provision is achieved.  In particular we need to ensure that the highest standard of care will continue to be provided to all residents in a safe and secure environment.</p>

            <p eId="para_4360">The National Child Care Information System (NCCIS) is a Health Service Executive project which has been included in the National Service Plan for 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4361">I share the view of the Ombudsman for Children that access to improved information based on standardised business processes across the child welfare and protection service within the HSE is essential in terms of improving the monitoring, measurement and quality of service delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_4362">In accordance with Government policy a formal peer review process is applied to all major ICT projects in the Irish public sector. Peer review is designed to provide assurance that a project can progress successfully and is carried out at key decision points of a project including, <i>inter alia</i>, the business case stage, request for tender (RFT) and subsequent tender evaluation exercise, project initiation and at key milestones in the project cycle.</p>
            <p eId="para_4363">The business case for the NCCIS was peer reviewed in late 2009.  The project was approved by the Department of Finance to allow it move to the preparation of the RFT.  Preparation of the RFT, including a detailed requirements specification for the ICT system, is almost complete.  Tender documentation will be sent for peer review shortly.  Completion of this review will allow the HSE to advertise nationally and internationally for the NCCIS.</p>
            <p eId="para_4364">The project plan for the NCCIS identifies the need for standardised business processes to be implemented before the ICT system is deployed.  I understand that the standardised processes have now been signed off for national implementation and that a senior official within the HSE has been assigned to the NCCIS project to lead out on implementation.</p>

            <p eId="para_4366">The Deputy will be aware that it was decided that the new registration and inspection regime for designated centres for older people, which commenced on 1 July 2009, would mainly be self-financing.  In this regard the Health Act 2007 provides for the following fees:</p>
            <p eId="para_4367">Applications for registration or renewal of registration under Section 48.  This section states that the applicant shall include with the application the prescribed application fee.</p>
            <p eId="para_4368">An annual fee payable by the registered provider under Section 99</p>
            <p eId="para_4369">A fee for variation or removal of any conditions of the registration under Section 52.</p>
            <p eId="para_4370">A registered provider making an application under this section must include the fee with their application.</p>
            <p eId="para_4371">Following analysis of the types of centres, numbers of places, etc. it was decided to set a registration fee of €500, payable every 3 years by each nursing home together with an annual fee of €190 per place in each registered centre.  It is estimated that the fee will represent an average weekly cost of €3.73 per registered place.  The fees are payable by the registered provider (or in the case of applications for registration by the applicant, who for existing designated centres would normally be the registered provider).  These fees are not due or payable by the resident or their family.</p>
            <p eId="para_4372">The Deputy may be aware that article 28 of the Health Act 2007 (Care and Welfare of Residents in Designated Centres for Older People) Regulations 2009 states that:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4373">"(1) The registered provider shall agree a contract with the resident within one month of the admission of that resident to the designated centre.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4374">(2) Such contract shall deal with the care and welfare of the resident in the designated centre and shall include details of the services to be provided for that resident and the fees to be charged."</p>
            <p eId="para_4375">Therefore, only those fees, including any agreed increases, set out in the contract should be charged by the registered provider to the resident.</p>

That offer did not include certain of the stops sought by the applicants in respect of their proposed service, as these stops were already being served by a previously licensed bus service being operated by Aircoach that connects the locations in question with Dublin Airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_4404">The Patton Flyer operators lodged an appeal in February 2009 against the terms of the offer made by my Department and also sought to add additional stops to the proposed service.  The appeal was considered and a licence offer was made in May 2009, which again excluded those stops which conflicted with the licensed Aircoach service.</p>
            <p eId="para_4405">The Patton Flyer operators wrote to the Department on 19 June 2009 rejecting the licence offer.</p>
            <p eId="para_4406">When the Patton Flyer operators rejected the licence offer the Department moved, in accordance with licensing guidelines, to consider the next application it had on hand, from Aircoach, for a Dalkey-Dublin Airport service.</p>

            <p eId="para_4418">Since 1st December 2009, the development of the DART Underground project is a matter which comes under the remit of the National Transport Authority (NTA).</p>
            <p eId="para_4419">DART Underground and Metro North are the Government's key priority projects for public transport investment in the period ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_4421">Following a request from my Department, the NTA arranged for a presentation by the DART Underground team from Irish Rail to coincide with the monthly meeting on 25 May 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4422">Irish Rail has advised that the change in the DART Underground timetable is driven by practical and technical considerations primarily resulting from—</p>
            <p eId="para_4423">consideration that the railway order application may take  longer than originally planned. This is based on the experience of Metro North.</p>
            <p eId="para_4424">construction and testing  are now estimated to take  longer than earlier projected. This includes allowing for the extension of the project from Heuston to Inchicore and a decision to use 2 tunnel boring machines instead of 4. This change to fewer tunnel boring machines lessens the environmental impact of the project and reduces costs considerably.</p>
            <p eId="para_4425">Irish Rail also advise that these are conservative estimates on timeframe and it is possible that the PPP company may make substantial improvements to this programme by, for example, using innovative techniques. It may also be possible that An Bord Pleanála can reduce the time taken to consider the railway order application, having regard to its experience on Metro North.</p>
            <p eId="para_4426">The Government remains committed to the earliest possible start up date and the speediest possible delivery of this project and will continue to pursue all available opportunities to shorten the delivery timescale.</p>

The publication of such commercially sensitive information prior to the completion of the competitive procurement process would prejudice the State's capacity to derive maximum value for money in respect of this project.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_4510">As the Deputy is aware, the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009, which was commenced last August introduced changes to the procedures for the certification of firearms. The remaining sections of the Criminal Justice Act 2006 relating to firearms licensing were also commenced at that time.  It is important to realise that under the new legislation, arising from both statutes, which created the three year licence and placed additional requirements on applicants, that all applications for Firearm Certificates are regarded as new applications and not renewals.</p>
            <p eId="para_4511">Since 19 November 2008, large calibre handguns have been generally banned. However, persons who already held certificates for large calibre handguns were entitled to apply for a new certificate under the stricter licensing regime.  As the Deputy may be aware, provision is made under the Firearms Acts, as amended, including the provisions of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, 2009 that, before granting a Firearm Certificate to any person, a Superintendent or a Chief Superintendent, as the case may be, shall be satisfied that an applicant:</p>
            <p eId="para_4512">(a) has a good reason for requiring the firearm in respect of which the certificate is applied for, and</p>
            <p eId="para_4513">(b) can be permitted to have in his possession, use, and carry a firearm or ammunition without danger to the public safety or to the peace, and</p>
            <p eId="para_4514">(c) is not a person declared to be disentitled to hold a firearms certificate under the Firearms Acts.</p>
            <p eId="para_4515">These three conditions must be satisfied in respect of every application, thereby ensuring that Firearm Certificates are granted to responsible persons. Additionally, a Chief Superintendent, when considering an application for a Restricted Firearm Certificate, must be satisfied that the applicant has ‘demonstrated that the firearm is the only weapon suitable for the purpose for which it is required'.  The licensing of firearms is an operational matter and each application is judged on its own individual merits and the decision on whether, or not, to grant a Firearm Certificate rests solely with the issuing person.  The decision of the issuing person cannot be fettered in any way and I have no role in the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_4516">Where an issuing person refuses an application for a firearms certificate the reason for such refusal shall be communicated to the applicant, in writing, within three months of the valid application being received. Applicants, who have been refused and are dissatisfied with the decision of an issuing person, have recourse to appeal that decision, within 30 days, to the District Court, in accordance with the provisions of section 43, Criminal Justice Act, 2006 and in some cases the District Court may award an applicant his costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4517">The Garda Authorities have informed me that, since the introduction of the new licensing regime, there have been approx 450 Firearm Certificates granted for handguns to date.  This figure includes both unrestricted and restricted categories but I do not have a precise breakdown at this time. I am also informed that a similar number of applications were refused.  The Deputy may be aware that, in a recent composite judgment,  the Supreme Court upheld the Charlton judgment which I have mentioned before in the House. It also fully endorsed the power of the Superintendent to impose conditions on licences.  Of particular interest was that the Supreme Court held, that in assessing ‘good reason',  that the "reason and the weapon were inseparable", and that " the Superintendent had power to refuse the  firearms certificate in the case for the reason given, namely that he did not believe the firearm in question was a suitable weapon for target practice".</p>

While the project has not advanced to detailed design stage, it is anticipated that the capacity of the new prison will be in the region of 450.

            <p eId="para_4530">As the Deputy may be aware, I published a Review of the Drug Treatment Court on 24th May 2010. This Review found that those offenders who engaged with the treatment and rehabilitation provided have a significantly lower rate of recidivism. However, in order for the project to be more widely effective it requires a greater throughput of offenders as well as greater capacity for research and analysis.  An Advisory Committee, chaired by the Courts Service and comprising of a number of agencies associated with the programme has been established to oversee the ongoing management and operation of the programme and monitor the implementation of the Review's recommendations over the next two years.</p>

Arising from the refusal of his asylum application, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 14 April 2010, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against him.  In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 518 of 2006).  The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State in accordance with these Regulations and this application is under consideration at present.  When consideration of this application has been completed, the person concerned will be notified in writing of the outcome.  In the event that the application for Subsidiary Protection is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before the file is passed to me for decision.

            <p eId="para_4540">The effect of the rule against double jeopardy is that a person cannot be prosecuted for an offence where he or she has already been acquitted or convicted of the offence in question.  In the Criminal Procedure Bill 2009, which has been passed by the Seanad and is now awaiting Committee Stage in Dáil Éireann, I am seeking to modify the rule in two respects by providing that:</p>
            <p eId="para_4541">1. where new and compelling evidence emerges after a person's acquittal; or</p>
            <p eId="para_4542">2. where an acquittal is tainted, for example because of perjury by a witness,</p>
            <p eId="para_4543">the Director of Public Prosecution may apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal for an order quashing the acquittal and ordering a re-trial. The "new and compelling evidence" procedure applies to a list of scheduled offences including murder, while the ‘tainted acquittal' procedure may apply in any case tried on indictment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4544">These provisions will apply only to acquittals arrived at after the commencement of the new legislation. I am advised that to provide otherwise would constitute an interference by the Oireachtas in the administration of justice. It would, in other words, be a breach of the constitutional position on the separation of powers.  The Deputy will find a comprehensive exposition on the Bill as well as on the issues surrounding the modifications to the rule that I am proposing in the statement I made to the House when I introduced the Second Stage debate on 11 February 2010.</p>

All valid applications are dealt with in chronological order as this is deemed to be the fairest to all applicants. The average processing time from application to decision is now at 26 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average, while an element of straight forward cases can be dealt with in less than that timescale.

            <p eId="para_4587">The length of time taken to process each application should not be classified as a delay, as the length of time taken for any application to be decided is purely a function of the time taken to carry out necessary checks.

            <p eId="para_4594">The Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU) provides employment vetting for a large number of organisations in Ireland registered with the Gardaí for this purpose and which employ persons in a full-time, part-time, voluntary or training capacity to positions where they would have substantial, unsupervised access to children and/or vulnerable adults.  The GCVU has managed a substantial increase over recent years in the numbers of vetting applications it receives — 187,864 in 2007; 218,404 in 2008 and 246,194 in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_4595">The processing time for vetting applications fluctuates during the year due to seasonal demands when the volume of applications received from certain sectors can increase, for training placements for example.  Additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad. There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  However, the Gardaí make every effort to reduce this to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the average processing time for valid vetting applications received at the GCVU may vary from four to five weeks in periods of lower demand to up to about 12 weeks at times when demand is particularly high.</p>
            <p eId="para_4596">The allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  An additional five persons were assigned to the Vetting Unit recently, bringing the total to 83 personnel currently assigned to the vetting unit, including six Gardaí and 77 Garda civilian personnel.  A further five additional personnel are being recruited on a temporary basis and it is intended that these persons will commence work shortly.  This represents a very significant increase in the level of personnel assigned to the unit, which stood at only 13 before the current process of development in Garda vetting began in 2005.</p>

I am aware that the Service has undertaken a nationwide review of the numbers and location of venues where District Court business is transacted. In undertaking the review, the Service applied a number of qualitative criteria to each venue including case count, condition of the building, proximity to a suitable venue, number of sittings per annum, etc.  The review is designed to ensure that the best possible service is provided to court users and optimum operating efficiency is achieved through the best possible use being made of court resources, facilities and judicial time. This is particularly important in the context of pressures on public expenditure and reduced funding resources.</p>

            <p eId="para_4605">Ireland actively promotes the message of non-violence on an ongoing basis in its national and international policies. Our commitment to the objectives of Resolution 61271, which we co-sponsored, is clear and profound. Our strong support for the promotion and protection of human rights, our long tradition of participating in UN-mandated peace operations, our leading role internationally in disarmament and non-proliferation issues, our work in the area of conflict resolution and the work of Irish Aid on combating gender-based violence are good examples of areas in which the Government gives practical expression to this commitment.  While commemorative steps relating specifically to 2 October require further consideration, the education and public awareness activity which underpins the Government's work in such areas includes powerful and continuous messages about non-violence as the only basis for achieving progress.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4620">I propose to take Questions Nos. 337 and 339 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4621">I condemn the sinking of the Republic of Korea (ROK) naval vessel "Cheonan" on 26 March and the resulting deaths of forty-six members of its crew. I take this opportunity to extend my condolences, and those of the Government, to the families of the victims and to the Government of the ROK, on their tragic loss.</p>
            <p eId="para_4622">I note with deep concern the findings of the investigation, published on 20 May by the ROK authorities, into the causes of the sinking. This investigation was supported by an international team of specialists, including participants from the US and the UK, and has been described as objective, methodical and scientific. Based on evidence recovered from the scene of the attack, the investigation has concluded that the explosion was caused by a torpedo made in the DPRK and fired from a DPRK submarine.</p>
            <p eId="para_4623">The ROK is to be commended for its restrained and measured response to this unprovoked and heinous attack. I fully support the intention of the Government of the ROK to seek redress through the offices of the UN, and through other non-military means.</p>
            <p eId="para_4624">Since the announcement of the report's findings on 20 May, relations between the ROK and DPRK have deteriorated rapidly. Most recently, the DPRK has announced that it since the announcement of the report's findings on 20 May, relations between the ROK and DPRK have deteriorated rapidly. Most recently, the DPRK has announced that it would cancel an agreement designed to prevent accidental naval skirmishes along the disputed western sea border and it has also announced the severing of all ties with the ROK. It has threatened to engage any ROK vessels which are perceived to be in its territorial waters and has stated that any retaliation for the sinking of the "Cheonan" would lead to "all-out" war. These threats are unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_4625">Ireland will continue to consult closely with EU and other international partners to determine an appropriate response to the findings of the ROK investigation. In this respect, I welcome the statement made on 20 May by the High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, Catherine Ashton, in which she called on all the countries concerned to step up efforts to promote lasting peace and security on the Korean Peninsula. I note also the call made by Foreign Ministers at the EU-ASEAN Ministerial meeting held in Madrid on 26 May that the parties involved should exercise restraint. It is important also to ensure that recent events do not overshadow the ongoing suffering of the people of the DPRK, who face systematic, widespread and grave human rights abuses and endure sustained food insecurity and widespread malnutrition.</p>
            <p eId="para_4626">China is, of course, a key interlocutor for the parties involved and for the international community where the Korean peninsula is concerned. Although it has not yet officially responded to the findings of the South Korean investigation, I very much welcome the fact that the Chinese Government too has called for restraint and dialogue so that the crisis can be defused.</p>
            <p eId="para_4627">The situation on the Korean peninsula is a regular feature of Ireland's bilateral dialogue with China. I discussed the issue, including the "Cheonan" attack, with Foreign Minister Yang during my visit to Beijing last week and the matter was also raised in official level Political Consultations in Beijing on 8 April last.  I can assure Deputies that the Government will continue in its efforts to seek China's support in securing a lasting, peaceful solution in the region.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Deputy Micheál Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4629">The difficult situation of the undocumented Irish in the US and the impact on their families in America and Ireland is a matter of deep concern to the Government. I would urge anybody who might be tempted in the current economic climate to follow in the footsteps of the undocumented to take account of the plight in which they now find themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_4630">Finding a solution for our undocumented citizens in the United States continues to be a Government priority. We are also committed to enhancing our bilateral migration arrangements with the US through the establishment of a reciprocal two year renewable visa scheme, known as the E3 visa, and the further development of the recently agreed working holiday programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4631">The Government, particularly through our Embassy in Washington, continues to work proactively with the US Administration and Congressional leaders to achieve positive progress on this important issue. The status of the undocumented can only be changed by virtue of legislation passed by both Houses of Congress in the US — it is not merely a matter of bilateral engagement between the two Governments. It is clear that this is a challenging political issue in the US and it is also clear that the undocumented can only be provided for through comprehensive immigration reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_4632">During our St Patrick's Day visit to Washington this year, the Taoiseach and I took the opportunity to discuss immigration reform and the undocumented Irish in our meetings with President Obama, Secretary of State Clinton and leading members of Congress. As part of his St. Patrick's Day address, President Obama offered an assurance that his own commitment to comprehensive immigration reform remains unwavering.</p>
            <p eId="para_4633">President Obama has since reiterated this commitment to immigration reform, and has welcomed what he has described as the "strong proposal" for reform presented at the end of April by senior Democratic Senators Harry Reid, Charles Schumer, and Robert Menendez. This proposal includes provision for a path towards legalisation for the undocumented, including the Irish, provided they first admit to having violated US laws, undertake the repayment of taxes and perform community service.  This outline legislation also specifically mentions an E-3 visa arrangement for Irish citizens. Although the proposal is only the first step in a long process, the inclusion of an Irish E3 scheme at this initial stage is an important achievement for the Government and the Irish community.</p>
            <p eId="para_4634">While I am encouraged by these developments and also by the efforts which continue to be made on Capitol Hill to resolve this issue, very considerable political challenges remain, particularly in an election year.  Through the Emigrant Support Programme, we have provided $285,000 to the Irish Lobby for Immigration Reform, since 2006, to assist with their lobbying efforts. In 2009, we also provided $10,000 to the Chicago Celts for Immigration Reform.</p>

            <p eId="para_4642">I propose to take Questions Nos. 342 and 344 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4643">The Deputy will have seen the welcome news that on Saturday President Mutharika granted an unconditional pardon to Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga, after meeting with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. In a press conference announcing the pardon, the President stated that he had taken his decision on humanitarian grounds and that the law itself has not changed.  I have been following the case of Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga since the two men were first arrested. Our Embassy in Lilongwe, along with our EU partners, has been active in raising our concerns about the matter with the Government of Malawi throughout.</p>
            <p eId="para_4644">I want to emphasise in particular our very serious concern and dismay at the arrest, conviction and severe sentence imposed upon these men on account of their sexual orientation. The conviction was contrary to international human rights principles which Malawi has ratified. With our EU partners, we have called on the Government of Malawi to fulfil its commitments to the protection of the human rights of all individuals, irrespective of their sexual orientation. My colleague the Minister of State for Overseas Development, Peter Power, T.D., made a statement to this effect on 20 May and Ireland supports the similar statement made by High Representative Catherine Ashton on 21 May, which also refers to Malawi's commitments and obligations under international human rights law.</p>
            <p eId="para_4645">Malawi is one of the nine Programme Countries where Ireland has a commitment to long term strategic assistance. Our five year country programme focuses on nutrition and food security and support for good governance. These are targeted programmes and we do not provide general budget support. Ireland also supports civil society organisations working in Malawi, including those that engage in human rights work there.</p>
            <p eId="para_4646">We remain in constant contact with our Ambassador in Malawi and our concerns are being fully communicated to the Government of Malawi. The Deputy can be assured that we will continue to coordinate with our EU and international partners on this matter to impress upon the Government of Malawi the need for compliance with its own obligations under international human rights agreements.</p>

            <p eId="para_4648">In February 2010 a technical advisor to the Israeli Interior Ministry made contact with the Department and asked if a meeting could be arranged with the Passport Service to discuss a range of passport technology issues of international interest. The meeting was proposed in the context of a visit by officials of the Israeli Interior Ministry to a number of European countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_4649">The Israeli delegation proposed to present information in respect of the technologies used in the Israeli passport and learn from the experiences of other countries who had developed similar systems. The meetings would also discuss the benefits and pitfalls of the international system for exchanging passport security data. The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Public Key Directory is a system for exchanging data which is subsequently used at border control points to validate the authenticity of passports.  The meeting request was declined.</p>

The collection includes many well known contemporary Irish artists and its value as an entire collection is what makes it so special.  In 1999 and 2008, Bank of Ireland, under Section 1003 of the Taxes Consolidation Act, 1997, donated 21 and 25 Artworks, respectively, to the Irish Museum of Modern Art (IMMA).  These donations were valuable additions to the IMMA and national collection and their donation to one of National Cultural Institutions demonstrates the quality of what Bank of Ireland has succeeded in collecting over the years.</p>
            <p eId="para_4715">While it is a matter, in the first instance, for the Board of Bank of Ireland to manage its assets in an appropriate manner, it is my opinion that this collection should be kept intact if possible.  Bank of Ireland should, of course, give careful consideration to the impact culturally which losing the collection to out of the State would have.  Furthermore, the timing of any placing on the market would have to consider the relative buoyancy and level of the market for Irish art and the potentially negative and displacement impact of a significant volume collection like this coming on that market.  Optimising shareholder value, in which the State now has a very significant interest, must be a paramount consideration too.</p>
            <p eId="para_4716">I have requested my officials to ascertain from the Bank of Ireland its intentions in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_4718">Firstly, I would once again emphasise that stipend payments were paid to students only in respect of time when they were actually present on the course.  Where a student missed classes, the stipend payments payable to him or her were reduced accordingly.  It was also the case that stipend and accommodation payments ceased as soon as a student left the course.  Furthermore, my Department has been advised by the institution responsible for the course concerned that proof of expenses was required from all students.  It is understood that due to the pre-pay nature of most rented accommodation, most students had to pay for their accommodation before commencing the course and claimed the accommodation costs back subsequently.</p>
            <p eId="para_4719">Students who did not complete the course may have been unable to do so for a variety of reasons, ranging from illness or personal circumstances beyond their control, to failing to achieve the required standard.  In such circumstances, the rationale and indeed the fairness of penalising students by seeking the refund of stipends and/or accommodation costs is not clear.</p>

The projects to which the Deputy refers are currently funded under a measure managed by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.

          </question>
          <speech by="#PatCarey" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_636">
            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Pat Carey)</from>
            <p eId="para_4740">The Centre for Effective Services (CES) was developed in recognition of the fact that high quality research and data informs good social policy and that the application of evidence-based policy making can make a real difference in the quality of services delivered, and, ultimately, in the quality of beneficiaries' lives.  At its most basic, the approach is to seek to provide a means to enable projects to access the expertise that they need on a timely and supportive basis, to be focussed on tangible outcomes, and to lend themselves to robust objective evaluation.  The underlying aim is to develop a process whereby programmes and projects can be designed, developed and evaluated on the basis of a ‘what works' pragmatic approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_4741">Against a background of reforms under way by my Department, ongoing concerns to strengthen programme delivery and evaluation, and issues confirmed by a VFM Policy Review of the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme (LDSIP), my Department was eager to access independent international expertise.  Separately, one of the issues with the local/community development programmes operated by my Department had been the difficulty in objectively demonstrating whether our programmes are actually working or not.  This problem is compounded by the concern that, even when the programmes are independently evaluated, there is a relatively small pool of expertise which can be drawn on locally, which can result in a familiarity between potential evaluators and the operators of the programmes.  The close identification of the operators of such programmes with the programmes themselves can make it difficult for detached, objective and critical debate on the overall effectiveness of the programmes, as opposed to their delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_4742">It was in this context that my Department, in consultation with the Office of the Minister of Children (OMC), considered the CES as offering a particular opportunity to support programme redesign, while overcoming the usual constraints of local interests and difficulty in accessing international expertise.  The CES also offered capability to set out tangible, deliverable, qualitative outcomes for the LDSIP/Community Development Programme (CDP) and wider programmes.  In addition, my Department's view was that the CES would be in a position to provide ongoing mentoring on programme efficiency and evaluation over a number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_4743">The concept for the CES grew from an idea formulated initially by Atlantic Philanthropies in the context of the provision of children's services — most notably the early childhood intervention project in Tallaght, Dublin.  The CES was subsequently established as a joint venture between Government and Atlantic Philanthropies.  Accordingly, in 2008 my Department engaged the CES to assist with the redesign of its community development/social inclusion programmes, particularly the LDSIP and CDP.  Key outputs agreed with the CES were the review of the design of both programmes, which, informed by good international practice, would specify outcomes at the outset and provide effective evaluation mechanisms.  It was also agreed that any proposals put forward should facilitate effective evaluation of the performance of individual local delivery structures and allow for either the re-alignment or merger of the two programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4744">Under the agreement signed in October 2008 between my Department and the OMC with the CES, each will provide c€500,000 per annum to the Centre for 5 years.  This amount will be matched by a contribution from Atlantic Philanthropies of c€5m over the period.  The agreement, which ends in 2012, sets out in detail deliverables to be provided over this period to each public body, as well as timelines for progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_4745">The contracted deliverables relating to my own Department include the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_4746">1. Assist the Department with planning for future delivery and development of LDSIP and CDP by collating and making available international evidence of good practice and ‘what works' in similar community-based initiatives, and review the design of the existing programme in the light of this evidence.</p>
            <p eId="para_4747">2. Inform policy and practice relating to LDSIP and CDP with the aim of maximising programme impact and effectiveness within existing funding parameters.</p>
            <p eId="para_4748">3. Promote access to expertise (including international expertise) for developing appropriate evaluation methodologies and measures for the evaluation of local services delivered under the programmes, and make recommendations for subsequent evaluation design(s).</p>
            <p eId="para_4749">4. Assist the Department to build internal and external capacity for evidence-based design and delivery of other related services and programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4750">Given</p>
            <p eId="para_4751">the unique nature of this project as a joint approach between Government and Atlantic Philanthropies, particularly in the context of Government initiatives on children's services;</p>
            <p eId="para_4752">the not-for-profit remit of the CES;</p>
            <p eId="para_4753">the unparalleled access which CES has to international expertise on the design, delivery and evaluation of social programmes; and</p>
            <p eId="para_4754">the significant support available from Atlantic Philanthropies; it was not considered that a competitive tendering arrangement was appropriate in this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_4755">I can assure that Deputy that the CES is not unaccountable.  As already referred to, my Department has a contract with the CES which lists specific deliverables and timelines.  Progress is reported on regularly and all deliverables to date have met the agreed timelines.</p>

            <p eId="para_4779">As the Deputy is aware, the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme and the Community Development Programme were my Department's two main social inclusion/community development programmes.  These came to an end on 31 December last and have been superseded by a new integrated programme, the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP).  A key difference between the new LCDP and its predecessor programmes is the fact that, when fully implemented, it will be delivered nationally on an integrated basis by a reduced number of companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_4780">It is important to note that, despite what is stated by some community development projects (CDPs) and by others, integration does not mean closure of a CDP or the cessation of CDP activities in any given area.  As has been stated previously, any worthwhile community development activity or service delivered under the CDP can continue to be delivered under the new LCDP and by the same staff who currently do this work.  My Department has set out a model involving full integration of CDPs with local development companies (LDCs), but has made it clear that other options can be considered and that it is not a question of ‘one size fits all'.  The only option not acceptable is one that seeks to preserve the status quo: some models proposed by CDPs and other parties in the period since the launch of the LCDP have had to be rejected on that basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_4781">In recent weeks, however, my Department has been able to respond positively to a number of other alternative models put forward by both LDCs and CDPs.  While agreement has not yet been fully finalised in these cases, I am satisfied that the real possibility for agreement exists.  Additional proposals from other CDPs or LDCs are also being considered positively but are less developed at this stage.  I can assure the Deputy that my Department will continue to respond positively to all constructive proposals that it receives.</p>
            <p eId="para_4782">In a full integration situation, all assets and net liabilities would usually transfer by agreement.  However, my Department has made it clear that other arrangements are possible if sought by CDPs or LDCs — for example, the ownership of buildings need not transfer to the LDC.</p>

            <p eId="para_4786">The National Pensions Framework was published on 3 March 2010.  It encompasses all aspects of pensions, from social welfare to private occupational pensions and public sector pension reform.  The aim of the framework is to deliver security, equity, choice and clarity for the individual, the employer and the State.  It also aims to increase pension coverage, particularly among low to middle income groups and to ensure that State support for pensions is equitable and sustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_4787">A technical implementation group has been established to develop the legislative, regulatory and administrative infrastructure required to put the reforms into operation. The group which is chaired by my Department held its first meeting in May 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4788">Recognising that people are living longer and healthier lives, the Government has decided to amend State pension age in three separate stages:</p>
            <p eId="para_4789">In 2014, the State pension (transition) will be abolished.  The effect of this will be to standardise State pension age at 66;</p>
            <p eId="para_4790">In 2021, the State pension age will be set at 67; and</p>
            <p eId="para_4791">Finally, in 2028, State pension age will be set at 68.</p>
            <p eId="para_4792">For those people who wish to postpone drawing down their State pension, arrangements will be put in place to enable them to receive an actuarially increased benefit when they decide to retire.  In addition, for those with contribution shortfalls at pension age, arrangements will be put in place to allow them to receive additional benefit at a later date if they continue to make paid contributions for pension purposes while remaining in work or self-employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4793">Currently, State pension (transition) is paid at age 65 with State pension (contributory) being paid at age 66.  While the standard age at which people retire is currently 65, for those who have had to retire earlier due to illness they may be entitled to illness payments. Others who are unemployed may be entitled to unemployment payments.</p>

It also aims to increase pension coverage, particularly among low to middle income groups and to ensure that State support for pensions is equitable and sustainable.</p>
            <p eId="para_4806">The issue of the marriage bar and how it might have affected women's eligibility for a State pension was one of the most common issues raised in the Green Paper consultation process. The gaps in pension coverage today are partly the result of societal norms which existed through to the 1970s and which, in the case of the marriage bar, required some women to retire from employment when they married.</p>
            <p eId="para_4807">Many Green Paper submissions proposed that the homemaker's scheme should be backdated beyond 1994 to take account of periods of care when women left employment due to the marriage bar.  The main difficulty with this approach is that it would only address the position of women who paid full PRSI contributions during their working lives and would not assist the position of those women, mainly public servants, affected by the marriage bar. The State pension (non-contributory) is available to anyone who has an income need.</p>
            <p eId="para_4808">The Government accepts that, in today's society, policies such as the marriage bar would not be acceptable.  However, it cannot always address issues that have arisen through the shortcomings and inequities in previous decades.</p>
            <p eId="para_4809">While it has been decided not to backdate the homemaker's scheme beyond 1994, however, for new pensioners from 2012, social insurance credits will be awarded to homemakers which will be backdated to 1994.  This will assist many women to achieve a higher rate of state pension in the future.</p>

The Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group under the independent chairmanship of Mr. Hugh Cooney, comprises representatives from my own Department, the Departments of Finance, Taoiseach, Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  In addition, the Group has representatives from the Office of the Financial Regulator, the ESRI, the Irish Banking Federation, the Free Legal Advice Centre and the Law Reform Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_4820">The terms of reference for the Group are based on the Renewed Programme for Government, with an emphasis on protecting the family home. They include a review of the statutory Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears and the recently agreed protocol between the Irish Bankers Federation and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service on debt default, with a view to expanding the options available for dealing with debt situations to avoid foreclosure. In addition, the Group is examining measures adopted in other jurisdictions and considering ways of expanding existing mortgage-support measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_4821">The conclusions and recommendations from the review of the mortgage interest supplement scheme, which is currently being finalised, will inform the work of Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review Group. I understand that the Group will make its report to the Minister for Finance by the end of June.</p>

            <p eId="para_4828">The determination of a person's habitual residence is made in accordance with Section 246 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_4829">If the person is not an Irish or UK national, the first requirement is that they must show that they have a right of residence in the State.  In the case of non-EEA nationals this will be evidenced by their visa or other official form of residence permission.  In the case of EEA nationals, the duration of their right of residence may be restricted if they are not self-supporting, if they have not been employed since arrival here, or if their employment lasted less than 1 year and they have been unable to obtain further employment during the following 6 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_4830">Where the right of residence exists, the deciding officer will consider all the circumstances of the case, including five specified factors which have been derived from European Court of Justice case law and are set out in subsection (4) of Section 246.  These factors are:</p>
            <p eId="para_4831">(a) the length and continuity of residence in the State or in any other particular country;</p>
            <p eId="para_4832">(b) the length and purpose of any absence from the State;</p>
            <p eId="para_4833">(c) the nature and pattern of the person's employment;</p>

            <p eId="para_4835">(e) the future intentions of the person concerned as they appear from all the circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_4836">The evidence required to show that the person satisfies the habitual residence condition, taking the above factors into consideration, will vary according to the particular circumstances of each case.  The application forms for the relevant payments include questions which assist in identifying the cases which require particular examination of this condition.  Each claim is checked to see if sufficient information has been given on the initial claim form to determine whether the condition is satisfied.  If necessary a more detailed enquiry form is given to the claimant to obtain further information.</p>
            <p eId="para_4837">These forms indicate the basic types of evidence required to support the answers given which will depend on the circumstances of the case, and may include details of their residence permit or renewal application, work permit, immigration documents, etc.  Other evidence sought may include details of a spouse or partner's PPS number and employment where relevant.</p>
            <p eId="para_4838">A full disclosure of all the relevant details in completion of these forms will enable the correct decision to be given in each case.</p>

         asked the

         further to Parliamentary Question No. 426 of 18 May 2010, if he will provide in terms of whole time equivalents a breakdown by rank of the members of the Permanent Defence Forces prior to the introduction of the moratorium; if he will further provide the same information relating to those currently employed; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5039">The strength of the Permanent Defence Force as at 31 March 2009 was 10,325 and 9,856 as at 30 April 2010.  A breakdown of these strengths, according to formation and rank, is provided in the tabular statements.</p>
            <p eId="para_5040">As previously advised in my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 426 of 18 May 2010, I am acutely aware of the impact of the moratorium on the Permanent Defence Force, particularly in light of the very high turnover rate that is part of any military organisation.  Within the available resources, the Government is committed to maintaining the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at a level of 10,000 all ranks, for which Government approval has been secured in the context of Budget 2010.  This figure reflects the reductions in personnel recommended in the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5041">Targeted recruitment will be carried out in 2010 to maintain the operational capability of the Defence Forces.  In this regard, advertisements were recently placed for recruitment to the Naval Service and some further recruitment to the Defence Forces is also under consideration in the same context.   In addition, officials from the Department are continuing to engage with the Military Authorities in relation to the review of structures and posts required to meet the operational requirements of the Permanent Defence Force in light of the Government decision to maintain a complement of 10,000 serving personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_5042">I am advised by the military authorities that the Defence Forces retain the capacity to undertake the tasks laid down by Government, both at home and overseas.</p>

The banks are charged for their proportion of the total escorts provided i.e. approximately 78%.  The remainder relates to post office escorts.  The issue of the post office paying for the cash in transit services provided to it is currently being pursued by the Department with An Post.</p>

In recent days the three stones, which make up the monument, have been moved back into their original positions.  Unfortunately, the railing that surrounds the monument may have been damaged beyond repair.  The Department is currently in the process of sourcing a suitable, more appropriate, replacement railing and it is hoped to have this installed in the near future.</p>

The Department's policy states that each zone is the same length of 1,370 metres.  However, in 1998 South Dublin County Council reduced this length by 100 metres for Runway 05.</p>

         the agreement between his European counterparts on the EU’s plan to prolong its financial support for the decommissioning of four blocks of the nuclear power plant at Kozloduy, Bulgaria, until the end of 2013; if the EU will call for stricter financial controls and more investment in energy efficiency by the Bulgarian authorities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5306">Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant is a first generation reactor of Soviet design that was previously identified as posing a major safety risk to human health and the environment. As part of its pre-accession agreement with the EU, Bulgaria agreed to shut down all four reactors at Kozloduy. Units 1 and 2 were shut down at the end of 2003. Units 3 and 4 were shut down immediately prior to Bulgaria's accession to the EU in 2006.     To support preparatory decommissioning activities at Kozloduy, the EU agreed to provide €210 million to Bulgaria in the period 2007-2009, which has now been paid in full. The European Commission confirmed that Bulgaria, for its part, fulfilled its own commitments to the EU in respect of this agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_5307">In 2005 Bulgaria requested additional EU support of €300 million for the period 2010-2013, of which 60% would cover accelerated decommissioning and 40% measures in the energy sector for the purpose of improving security of supply and efficiency measures. Similar agreements were already in place with Slovakia and Lithuania to support their decommissioning activities up to 2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_5308">In October 2009 the European Commission presented its proposal for a Council Regulation for the continuation of support for the decommissioning of Units 1 to 4 of the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant in Bulgaria, known as the ‘Kozloduy Programme'. On 20 May 2010 the European Parliament voted to support an amended version of the proposal. Following further consideration by the Commission, it is understood that a revised proposal will be put to Ministers of all EU Member States for decision at a European Council meeting later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_5361">Information in relation to vacant local authority houses is a Local Authority Service Indicator and reports on these indicators are available on the Local Government Management Services Board's website www.lgmsb.ie. The latest available figures relate to 2008. The 2008 data show a significant improvement (i.e. decrease) in the level of local authority housing stock that is vacant. The 2007 report showed that a total of 5,090 dwellings, excluding those that were subject to major refurbishment programmes, were empty. This represented 4.3% of the total stock of 118,000 dwellings. The 2008 report shows a decrease of 1,231 on the 2007 total — a 24% improvement — bringing the number of vacant units down nationally to 3,859 (3.15%). The performance of local authorities in this regard is comparable with that of other jurisdictions and can also be improved upon. To support further improvement, the Local Government Audit service is finalising a Value for Money study on housing management and maintenance, which will include specific recommendations on how best practice can be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_5362">In addition, in order to achieve energy efficiency improvements, a fund of €20 million was set aside under my Department's Social Housing Investment Programme in 2009 to provide co-funding for the retrofitting of vacant properties, both casual and planned, across local authority housing stock. This retrofitting provision has doubled to €40 million in 2010 and will continue to have a positive impact on the ability of local authorities to deal with vacant stock.</p>
            <p eId="para_5363">Under section 58 of the Housing Act 1966, the management and maintenance of local authority housing stock is a matter for individual authorities. My Department has no information on the estimated loss of revenue to local authorities where units remain vacant.  It is a matter for each local authority to manage its own budget and prioritise its own spending, within the resources available to it, across the range of services it provides. Equally, local authorities must ensure full value for money for the resources invested, and seek the maximum efficiency across their operations.</p>

            <p eId="para_5368">The local authority conservation grants scheme provides grant assistance for the conservation of protected structures i.e. those buildings which are listed in the Record of Protected Structures contained in each local authority development plan. This scheme is administered by the local authorities on behalf of the Department and specific queries on the scheme should be addressed directly to the relevant local authority. It would appear, however, that the new owner of the property could avail of the approved grant once certain conditions are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_5369">A scheme of thatching grants is also administered by my Department. This scheme offers support for necessary works to renew or repair the thatch of existing thatched houses that are structurally sound, are 10 or more years old and will be used on completion of the approved works as a normal place of residence.  This grant is non-transferable and a new owner would need to re-apply for grant funding in his or her own right.  The heritage management grants scheme administered by the Heritage Council, with funding from my Department, includes works to ensure the survival of a heritage building or structure. Information in relation to the scheme is available from the Heritage Council.</p>

            <p eId="para_5375">Currently, a person experiencing noise nuisance may contact their local authority, which may initiate proceedings on grounds of noise nuisance under the Environmental Protection Agency Act, 1992.  This Act also provides for any person, or group of persons, to seek an order in the District Court to have noise giving reasonable cause for annoyance abated.  The procedures involved have been simplified to allow action to be taken without legal representation. A public information leaflet A Guide to the Noise Regulations, outlining the legal avenues available to persons experiencing noise nuisance, is available on my Department's website www.environ.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_5376">Notwithstanding the measures already in place as set out above, the Government is committed to introducing comprehensive legislation to further address noise nuisance. The General Scheme of a Noise Nuisance Bill was approved by the Government in May 2009.  My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, is progressing matters in this regard and the Bill is scheduled for publication later this year.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_5536">I propose to take Questions Nos. 415 and 416 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5537">Ireland will meet its target for the purposes of the Kyoto Protocol through a series of national measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, supplemented as necessary by the purchase of carbon units on the international market. Government policy in this regard is set out in the National Climate Change Strategy 2007-2013.</p>
            <p eId="para_5538">Since 2007, the Government has introduced a number of measures, including the carbon levy, aimed at reducing domestic emissions across the economy.  In addition to ensuring compliance with Kyoto Protocol obligations, these measures constitute important preparations for more stringent emission reduction requirements in the post-2012 period, initially to 2020 but ultimately to 2050.  The planned Climate Change Bill 2010, the Heads of which I intend to publish shortly, will provide a statutory framework for the core national priority of major and continued reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in the context of transition to a low carbon economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5539">The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for greenhouse gas emission projections.  The latest projections in its report Ireland's Greenhouse Gas Emissions Projections 2010-2020 (April 2010) show the distance to target in the Kyoto Protocol commitment period (2008-2012) at 2.5 million tonnes CO<sub>2</sub>e per year, or 12.7 million tonnes for the five year period.   It is significantly lower than the original expectation in the National Climate Change Strategy published in April 2007.  At that time, it was estimated that up to 18 million credits would be required to ensure compliance over the five-year commitment period under the Kyoto Protocol at an estimated cost of €270m.</p>
            <p eId="para_5540">The National Treasury Management Agency, as designated purchasing agency for the State, has, to date, purchased some 5.255m credits at a cost of some €73.7m.  In addition, investments made by my Department in 2006 and 2007 in carbon funds operated by the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank are expected to yield some 3m credits at a projected cost of some €27.6m during the five-year Kyoto Protocol commitment period 2008 — 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_5541">As outlined in the EPA's most recent projections under the National Allocation Plan 2008-2012, the EPA established a New Entrant Set-Aside where allowances were set aside for new entrants coming into the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and for the expansion of existing installations over the 2008-2012 period. It is currently estimated that there will be around 5 million allowances remaining in the New Entrant Set-Aside at the end of the Kyoto period which will be available for the State to use towards Kyoto compliance. Based on these projections, it is likely that the remaining allowances in the New Entrant Set-Aside will cover the remaining ‘gap' of 4.4 Mtonnes of CO<sub>2</sub>e and no further purchase of carbon credits will be needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5542">In the current economic climate, an unusually high degree of uncertainty attaches to all projections.  Requirements to ensure Kyoto compliance are being kept under review and will be revised as necessary in the light of future projections.</p>

            <p eId="para_5544">The Planning Acts and associated Regulations provide for extensive consultation in relation to development at all stages of the planning process.  It is a requirement that a valid application for planning permission must be advertised by site notice and newspaper notice.  The site notice and newspaper notice must state that the planning application may be inspected or purchased at the offices of the planning authority, and that submissions or observations in relation to the application may be made to the authority in writing on payment of the prescribed fee within the 5 week period beginning on the date of the receipt by the planning authority of the application.  A newspaper notice of the proposed development must be published in an approved local or national newspaper.</p>
            <p eId="para_5545">The Planning and Development Act 2000 and the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 provided increased rights for third parties in the planning process.

Furthermore, most planning authorities have guidance available on their websites advising the public on how to go about making a submission or observation.  In addition, the Department has provided funding in 2007, 2008 and 2009 to assist An Taisce in facilitating public participation in forward planning and in carrying out research to support the preparation of submissions to Planning Authorities in relation to their Draft Development Plans, and to support the making of those submissions generally including attending associated meetings and hearings.</p>
            <p eId="para_5550">Since 2007, the Department has provided €210,000 to support this work and is currently reviewing the An Taisce 2010 planning fund application.</p>

            <p eId="para_5555">To the end of quarter 1 2010, my Department has received some 112 applications, comprising 2,801 units, under the Social Housing Leasing Initiative. Of these, 71 applications have been given approval, 25 are under consideration, 12 have been placed on hold and a further 4 refused. In Kerry, 1 application has been given approval with a further application under consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_5556">Applications have been refused when they do not comply with the conditions governing the Social Housing Leasing Initiative. It is essential that the use of the leasing option complies fully with the sustainable communities philosophy at the heart of Government housing policy, as outlined in Delivering Homes Sustaining Communities. Leasing proposals must ensure that accommodation is in a location and of a type that can appropriately meet the needs of persons on local authority housing lists and does not conflict with the overall sustainable communities objective.  The progress made in 2009 will be built on and developed further in the year ahead. It is anticipated that the leasing initiative and the RAS programme will together deliver some 4,000/4,500 units in 2010, accounting for 50% of the total social housing output expected this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_5594">Eligibility generally for the affordable housing schemes is determined on the basis that applicants are in need of housing and cannot afford to purchase a house on the open market. In the case of the Shared Ownership and 1999 affordable housing scheme, single applicants are eligible where their income in the previous tax year was €40,000 or under. In the case of a two income household, the income limit is based on the formula that 2½ times the main income plus once the secondary income does not exceed €100,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_5595">Those with incomes greater than the limits mentioned above may be eligible for affordable housing under Part V of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 — 2008. Eligibility for these purposes is determined on the basis that a person's income is insufficient to meet the mortgage repayments on a house suitable to their needs, by virtue of the fact that the mortgage payments on such accommodation would exceed 35% of the person's income after tax and PRSI.</p>
            <p eId="para_5596">Where a person is selling an affordable home and the clawback amount payable would reduce the proceeds of resale below the initial price actually paid, current legislation provides for the amount of the clawback payable to be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid that result.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy Michael Finneran)</from>
            <p eId="para_5602">I propose to take Questions Nos. 425 to 429, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5603">With regard to social housing maintenance issues generally, under section 58 of the Housing Act 1966 the management and maintenance of the local authority housing stock is a matter for individual authorities, in this case Dublin City Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_5604">Minimum standards for rental accommodation are prescribed in the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, as amended by the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) (Amendment) Regulations 2009, made under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992. With very limited exemptions, these regulations apply to local authority and voluntary housing units, as well as private rented accommodation, and all landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with the regulations. The publication of any report into sewerage matters in the Dolphin's house complex is therefore a matter for the landlord, Dublin City Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_5605">On the more general issue of long-term regeneration my Department is committed to a multi-annual regeneration programme in Dublin City to help improve the lives and conditions of the communities involved. The programme is reviewed on a regular basis with Dublin City Council, including through the biannual Housing Action Plan meetings, with new projects added and additional elements of existing projects advanced, as resources permit. It is a matter for Dublin City Council, in the first instance, to prioritise and manage the advancement of projects within the programme, having regard to its available funding resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_5606">Over the past decade my Department has invested over €100 million in the Dublin City Council inner city flats regeneration programme to improve the accommodation quality of the complexes, as well as to address economic and social issues including anti-social behaviour. Under the 2009 capital programme, my Department provided €12 million for projects at Bridgefoot Street, Queen Street, Lourdes House, and Sean Treacy House. Investment in approved projects at Poplar Row, Lourdes House, and Seán Treacy House is continuing in 2010 with funding of almost €9 million available to substantially complete the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5607">In 2008, due to the changing economic climate, the City Council was not in a position to progress a number of projects under Public Private Partnership (PPP) arrangements. The City Council therefore suspended its PPP programme pending recovery in the market, and established a multi-disciplinary Special Housing Taskforce to examine alternative options for the redevelopment, in particular, of the priority regeneration projects i.e. St Michael's Estate, O'Devaney Gardens and Dominick Street. The Taskforce's initial strategy for the phased development of these estates, incorporating the construction of social housing as Phase 1, was adopted by the City Council in December 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_5608">In support of this process, my Department has liaised closely with Dublin City Council to ensure that the former PPP regeneration projects are considered for inclusion in the national regeneration programme.  In this regard my Department issued approval in 2009 to the City Council to go to tender for phase one of the St. Michael's Estate Project and funding of €3.5 million is available to support the project this year.  Detailed proposals for the future redevelopment of O'Devaney Gardens and Dominick Street are expected from the City Council in 2010/2011 and in the meantime the City Council is continuing its strategy for the detenanting of these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_5609">With regard to specific regeneration proposals for Dolphin House, my Department has not yet received a proposal from Dublin City Council. However, I understand that the City Council has set up a further Taskforce which is examining redevelopment options for the next group of projects, one of which is Dolphin House. The Regeneration Board, established by the City Council, has consultants engaged to work with the Dolphin House residents with a view to developing regeneration solutions that are acceptable to the community and that can be implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_5610">It will be up to Dublin City Council to decide on the type of regeneration proposal that is most appropriate for the area and the means by which the project should be delivered. However, it is open to the Council to prioritise the project in terms of its Social Housing Investment Programme and submit a proposal in the usual way to my Department for project approval and funding from within the authority's annual Social Housing funding allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5611">Finally, my Department continues to work actively with Dublin City Council in connection with its Social Housing Investment Programme and as part of this I support and look forward to the Council's progression of its ambitious regeneration programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_5616">My Department's involvement with the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability relates primarily to the recoupment of a proportion of local authority expenditure on the payment of individual grants.  The grant schemes, introduced in November 2007, are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department together with a 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  The new suite of grants replaced the discontinued Disabled Persons Grant Scheme, the Essential Repairs Grant Scheme and the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme, administered by the Health Service Executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_5617">It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed to each of the various grant measures from within the allocations notified to them by my Department and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within their allocation.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_5646">The Landfill Directive has particular requirements in terms of diversion of biodegradable waste from landfill as well as pre-treatment obligations, and these are set out in Articles 5 and 6(a) of the Directive.  These treatment and diversion obligations restrict the tonnage of biodegradable waste that can be accepted at landfills and the restrictions involved are to be introduced on a phased basis up to 2016.  The diversion obligations of the Landfill Directive for Ireland can be summarised as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_5647">By July 2010, Ireland can only landfill a maximum quantity of 916,000 tonnes,</p>
            <p eId="para_5648">By July 2013, this figure is reduced to 610,000 tonnes, and</p>
            <p eId="para_5649">By July 2016 the figure is further reduced to 427,000 tonnes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5650">In 2008, the latest year for which figures are available, Ireland landfilled 1,196,044 tonnes of biodegradable waste, which leaves a gap to target of some 280,000 tonnes to be achieved to comply with the 2010 target set in the Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_5651">The separate collection and development of outlets for organic waste will play a significant part in meeting the Directive's diversion targets.  The separate kerbside collection of household food and garden waste (in brown bins) has been increasing substantially, doubling from 18,705 tonnes in 2007 to 37,920 tonnes in 2008, with the number of local authority areas where the separate kerbside collection service is provided, by local authority and/or private collectors, increasing from 13 to 16.  In addition, in December 2009, I introduced legislation requiring the separate collection of commercial biodegradable waste; this will become operational from 1 July 2010 and has considerable potential to divert large quantities of food waste from landfill.</p>
            <p eId="para_5652">In the context of the development of a new waste policy framework, in respect of which I expect to issue a policy document for consultation in the coming weeks, and otherwise, a range of measures are being developed in order to underpin further progress towards the improved management of biodegradable municipal waste and to secure compliance with the Landfill Directive.  These include:</p>
            <p eId="para_5653">Greater penetration of separate organic waste collections, possibly supported by further legislative measures;</p>
            <p eId="para_5654">Continued promotion of food waste prevention through the National Waste Prevention Programme initiatives such as StopFoodWaste.ie, Green Business and Green Hospitality Awards; and</p>
            <p eId="para_5655">Encouraging the provision of adequate infrastructure to treat the large quantities of organic (particularly food) waste that must be collected separately and diverted from landfill and developing outlets for the products of such treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5656">In 2009, the Environmental Protection Agency published guidance on municipal waste pre-treatment and, on foot of that guidance, started to review municipal waste landfill licences and attach appropriate pre-treatment licence conditions. This process is now almost complete.  The enforcement of waste restriction obligations at landfills will be a major priority for the EPA in the coming years.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Eamon Ryan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5670">Prior to the commencement of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) a detailed mapping exercise was carried out to help determine those areas that would be included in the scheme and those which, by virtue of being already substantially served by existing broadband suppliers, were to be excluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_5671">EU State aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers operating.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.</p>
            <p eId="para_5672">It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.). The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding for rural broadband initiatives.  My Department is currently progressing the design and implementation of a scheme which would use this funding to address the issue of basic broadband availability to un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_5673">I would like to stress that this scheme will not be available in locations already served by existing service providers.  My Department will be consulting with existing Internet Service Providers to ensure that the scheme does not encroach on their existing customer base and to verify that applicants are in fact unable to obtain a broadband service.</p>
            <p eId="para_5674">In a parallel exercise, there will be a competitive process to engage a service provider who will offer a broadband service to qualified applicants under the scheme. While the exact details have yet to be finalised, I expect that the service offered under this scheme would at least match the service offered under the NBS.  This process will be technology neutral — it will be a matter for the bidders to decide which technical approach they propose in their bids.</p>
            <p eId="para_5675">The proposed scheme is intended to complement the Government's previous broadband intervention initiatives and would, subject to the market responding to the scheme, ensure that the remaining un-served rural premises would able to avail of a broadband service.  This underlines the Government's commitment to the goal of ubiquitous broadband.</p>
            <p eId="para_5676">It is intended to commence the scheme later this year with the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  It is expected that the roll-out phase of the scheme will be carried out during 2011 and 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_5792">I propose to take Questions Nos. 444, 447 and 449 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5793">I recently announced new Renewable Energy Feed In Tariffs (REFIT) for biomass, which will range from 8.5 cent per kilowatt hour to 15 cent per kilowatt hour depending on the technology deployed.  The tariff is payable to the generator.  The technologies supported include Anaerobic Digestion Combined Heat and Power, Biomass Combined Heat and Power and Biomass Combustion, including provision for up to 30% co-firing of biomass in the three peat powered stations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5794">Taken together, these new tariffs will underpin the development of a robust and sustainable biomass supply sector in Ireland by stimulating demand for biomass and build on the measures already in place such as the REHEAT programme and the Energy Crop grant schemes run by the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  These new tariffs will require State Aids clearance by the EU Commission before they can be implemented and my Department will be seeking the requisite Commission clearance as soon as possible noting that the process takes a number of months.</p>
            <p eId="para_5795">My Department, through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) also runs a number of capital grant aid programmes for Combined Heat and Power installations, and for renewable heating installations.  SEAI's Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Programme assists the deployment of small-scale fossil-fired and biomass CHP systems in the industrial, commercial, service and public sectors.  The Biomass CHP Programme provides grant aid for Biomass and Anaerobic Digestion CHP.  Anaerobic Digestion, in particular, offers opportunities for farmers to use animal waste to generate electricity, while also reducing the environmental impact of that waste when spread on the land.</p>

The printing of payslips is part of the overall payroll process and it is not possible to disaggregate the cost for the printing element of the process.  Delivery of payslips to staff who have decided to avail of a printed payslip is via the established internal mail system.  This system incorporates collection and delivery of all items of internal mail of which payslips would be a very minor element.  It is not possible to disaggregate the cost of payslip delivery from overall costs.  A small number of payslips are delivered externally and the cost to my Department is €230 per annum.</p>

            <p eId="para_5802">The provision of broadband services is in the first instance a matter for private sector service providers operating in Ireland's fully liberalised telecommunications market. Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.</p>
            <p eId="para_5803">In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  Prior to the commencement of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS) a detailed mapping exercise was carried out to help determine those areas that would be included in the scheme and those which, by virtue of being already substantially served by existing broadband suppliers, were to be excluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_5804">EU State aid and competition rules govern how states can intervene in areas where there are existing service providers operating.  Accordingly, the NBS is prohibited from providing a service in served areas where to do so would give rise to an unacceptable level of market distortion.  Precise details of the electoral divisions throughout the State that are to be included in the National Broadband Scheme can be viewed on my Department's website www.dcenr.ie Details of the telecommunications service providers operating in county Monaghan can be found at www.callcosts.ie on ComReg's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_5805">It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).</p>
            <p eId="para_5806">The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding and granted State Aid approval for rural broadband initiatives.  My Department is currently progressing the design and implementation of a scheme which would be available to un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.  This work will include the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  It is hoped to commence this scheme in late 2010 and have it completed by 2012.  As the scheme is only at the design stage, there is no application process at this juncture.  Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.</p>

I would add that I have engaged closely with industry and interested parties in a public consultation process and in a series of meetings and workshops to ensure that the legislative proposals have the benefit of their input.</p>

            <p eId="para_5829">I propose to take Questions Nos. 455 and 456 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5830">The provision of broadband services is in the first instance a matter for private sector service providers operating in Ireland's fully liberalised telecommunications market.  Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.</p>
            <p eId="para_5831">In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.  The National Broadband Scheme (NBS) and the Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) are examples of such market intervention.</p>
            <p eId="para_5832">Details of the telecommunications service providers operating on a county by county basis can be found at www.callcosts.ie on ComReg's website.  In addition, my own Department's website www.dcenr.ie carries full details of all of the electoral divisions throughout the country that are included in the NBS.</p>
            <p eId="para_5833">It continues to be a priority of the Government that there will be broadband coverage across the entire country.  However, despite Government and private investment in broadband, I am aware that there continues to be a small percentage of premises throughout the country that will not be capable of receiving broadband services.  This is primarily due to technical and other reasons (suitability of a telephone line, distance from an enabled exchange, no line of sight etc.).  It is therefore not possible to say precisely where these individual premises might be located, except that they will not be in NBS areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_5834">The European Commission has set aside a portion of the European Economic Recovery Programme (EERP) funding and granted State Aid approval for rural broadband initiatives.  My Department is currently progressing the design and implementation of a scheme which would be available to un-served rural premises outside of the NBS areas.  This work will include the identification of premises not capable of receiving broadband.  It is hoped to commence this scheme in late 2010 and have it completed by 2012.  As the scheme is only at the design stage, there is no application process at this juncture.  Information in relation to acceptance of applications and the process of qualification under the scheme will be made available in due course when the scheme is launched.</p>
            <p eId="para_5835">To-date the cost to the Department for Phase I MANs is €76 million and €81 million for Phase II.</p>
            <p eId="para_5836">The total current and capital cost of the full rollout of the NBS has been estimated by "3" at some €223 million, of which a maximum of €79.8 million will be contributed by the Government and the EU.  The Government and the EU contribution to date under the Scheme amounts to some €48 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_5837">In rolling out the NBS, 3 is effectively future-proofing the network by upgrading its 3G network to the latest Nokia Siemens Internet High Speed Packet Access ("I-HSPA") technology.  This is a world first in terms of deployment of such technology.  Its deployment will facilitate a speedy launch of Long Term Evolution ("LTE"), which is expected to enhance significantly the quality and speed of mobile broadband in the coming years. v Effectively, 3's NBS network is LTE ready.</p>
            <p eId="para_5838">I can also confirm that 3's I-HSPA network is designed and dimensioned to ensure that the network delivers the minimum contracted service, or better to all NBS users.  Performance monitoring reports, including customer experience data, confirms this to be the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_5840">Part 8 of the Broadcasting Act 2009 provides the legislative basis for the development of Digital Terrestrial Television (DTT) services in Ireland and for analogue switch off.  Under the provisions of the Broadcasting Act 2009, RTÉ is required to develop a national free to air DTT service which enables the switch off of their analogue television services in 2012.</p>
            <p eId="para_5841">In this regard, I recently signed an Order, SI 85 of 2010, under section 129 of the Broadcasting Act, 2009 requiring RTÉ to launch their DTT service to approximately 90% of the population by 31st October 2010.  I have been informed by RTÉ that they are on target to meet the October launch date and I welcome this development.</p>
            <p eId="para_5842">The 2009 Act also requires RTÉ to provide the full national digital service by the end of 2011 or such date as I may specify.  I have communicated to RTÉ that the date for the provision of a full national DTT service is 31st December 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_5843">The RTÉ digital terrestrial television service is required to provide a digital platform for the existing analogue free to air television services, and provide space for additional public service channels, if required.  In the event of spare capacity it can be used by RTÉ on a commercial basis, to offer carriage to other commercial television channels.</p>

            <p eId="para_5845">The Irish Postal market is due to be liberalised from the 1st of January next year in accordance with the 3rd EU Postal Services Directive.  Following comprehensive consultation with relevant stakeholders, legislation to transpose this Directive has been prepared and will be brought to Government shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_5846">In designing the new regulatory framework, the key principles are the maintenance of a universal postal service and the provision of competitively priced high quality postal services to both business and residential customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5847">In the case of An Post, it is Government policy that An Post remains a strong and viable company, in a position to provide a high quality, nationwide postal service and maintain a nationwide, customer focussed network of post offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_5848">My officials and I meet regularly with An Post management to discus issues of importance to An Post, including the future of the company.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Conor Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5850">As I informed the Deputy in my response to Question Number 347 on 27 April 2010, production of first gas from the Corrib gas field is a matter for the developer, subject to conformity with all statutory consent requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_5851">For the Deputy's information, construction of the Corrib Gas Terminal at Bellanaboy is substantially completed as are the subsea facilities at the Corrib Gas Field.  Last summer the 83 km offshore section of the Corrib gas pipeline was installed.  The developers are engaged in the process of securing a number of statutory consents required for the construction of the onshore section of the Corrib gas pipeline.</p>
            <p eId="para_5852">Completion of the development works by the developer is the principal factor that will determine the date for first gas.  Pending such completion, it is not possible to state a date for when gas from the Corrib gas field will become available.  It is estimated that the Corrib gas field contains about 1 trillion cubic feet of natural gas reserves.</p>
            <p eId="para_5853">I would like to assure the Deputy that proper safety and environmental standards have always been central to my Department's evaluation of the Corrib Gas project.  The implementation of all safety requirements and conditions is of course an obligation of the Developer.  Compliance with safety requirements with respect to planning and other licensing permissions are not a matter in respect of which I have a function.</p>

            <p eId="para_5856">There are an additional 100 wind farms with a total contracted capacity of 1415 MW which have contracted for grid connections which will be built out over the next number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_5857">Detailed information is provided on the number and location of wind farms awaiting approval for access to the grid and the breakdown by county on the EirGrid website.</p>
            <p eId="para_5858">Grid connection offers for projects within the Gate 3 process began to issue in December 2009 and will continue to be issued on a phased basis until mid 2011.</p>
            <p eId="para_5859">In terms of progress in recent years, further information on those contracted to connect to the grid and their target connection date is also available on the EirGrid website.</p>
            <p eId="para_5860">Supervision of the grid connection process and settlement of any disputes arising is vested in the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER).  The CER has operated a group approach to connecting renewable projects to the national grid, which is designed to streamline the connection process in the interests of efficiency and cost effectiveness for developers.  To date, the CER has not required evidence of planning permission to be provided prior to determining that a project will receive a grid connection offer.</p>

            <p eId="para_5882">The National Oil Reserves Agency Limited (NORA) is responsible for ensuring that Ireland meets its EU and International Energy Agency (IEA) obligations to maintain 90 days' oil stocks for use in the event of an oil supply disruption.</p>
            <p eId="para_5883">NORA meets its stock-holding obligations by a combination of wholly-owned stocks and by entering into agreements with third parties in Ireland and other EU Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_5884">NORA currently holds approximately 80 days of Ireland's 90 day stockholding requirements, the balance of which is held by industry.  Of the stocks held by NORA, approximately 45% are held as physical stocks on the island of Ireland, 40% are held as physical stocks abroad, and 15% are held as stock "tickets" (short term contracts to purchase oil in the event of a crisis).</p>
            <p eId="para_5885">NORA's storage capacity in Ireland at present is 666,657 tonnes and holds stocks of Gasoline, Kerosene, Jet Kerosene, Gas Oil and Diesel.  At present the majority of NORA's stocks in Ireland are held at Bantry.  Government policy is to increase the volume of strategic stocks held on the island of Ireland, subject to value for money considerations.  NORA is delivering on this objective through the development of three new locations on the island of Ireland (Ringsend, Tarbert &amp; Kilroot), with facilities for 320,000 tonnes of storage.  NORA is also considering further storage opportunities, with a view to further increasing the level of stocks held on the island.</p>
            <p eId="para_5886">Security of gas supply is a fundamental priority for the Irish economy given its continued importance for power generation.  Given our high level of import dependence over the interconnectors with the UK, gas storage has an important role to play in contributing to enhanced gas security for the island of Ireland.  The Report on an all-Island Common Approach to Gas Storage and LNG reinforces the case for additional storage facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_5887">The existing commercial gas storage facility at Kinsale has the capacity to hold 198 million cubic metres.  Licensed for use by Bord Gáis Éireann, the facility can supply around 50% of residential and SME gas needs for up to 50 days in the event of a gas disruption.</p>
            <p eId="para_5888">The short to medium term prognosis for the security of Ireland's gas supplies is relatively secure in light of the projected relative stability of the UK gas market.  Increased global gas supplies, the growth of LNG and reduced global demand has lead to the IEA projecting a more benign world outlook for the next few years.  Nonetheless the risk of supply disruption should never be discounted and the continuing depletion of North Sea gas supplies means that Ireland will become reliant, over time, on gas supplies from more distant markets.  The impact of the Russia Ukraine dispute on a number of Member States in early 2009 highlighted the issue of gas security of supply for the EU.  The key objective of the proposed EU Regulation on Security of Gas Supply is to ensure that the market meets the gas supply needs of Member States including through commercial gas storage.</p>
            <p eId="para_5889">I welcome the current market interest in developing further commercial gas storage, both in Ireland and in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_5890">My Department is working with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment in Northern Ireland, and the energy Regulators North and South on actions to enhance security of gas supply on the island including the scope for commercial gas storage.</p>
            <p eId="para_5891">The development of the Corrib Gas field would also provide a new source of gas supply which could meet up to 60% of our annual demand in its early years of operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_5892">In addition, the interest in providing liquefied natural gas storage on a commercial basis is also an important development.  Shannon LNG has received planning permission to construct an LNG re-gasification terminal at a site located on the Shannon Estuary.  This facility could potentially provide up to 40% of Ireland's gas.  LNG has the potential to improve Ireland's connectivity to the global gas market, which would be a critical factor in the event of a major supply disruption.</p>

            <p eId="para_5895">The only petroleum discovery that has been declared commercial but has yet to be developed is the Corrib Gas Field.  Construction of the Corrib Gas Terminal at Bellanaboy is almost completed as are the subsea facilities at the Corrib Gas Field.  Last summer the 83 km offshore section of the Corrib gas pipeline was installed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5896">Completion of the development works by the developers, which is subject to conformity with all statutory consent requirements, is the principal factor that will ultimately determine the date for first gas.</p>
            <p eId="para_5897">With regard to non-petroleum minerals, exploration and development is undertaken by private enterprise and regulated under the Minerals Development Acts, 1940 to 1999.  New exploration is continually undertaken as part of my requirements to holders of Prospecting Licences.  While there have been some encouraging results in a number of areas, no new commercially viable deposits of non-petroleum minerals have been discovered in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_5898">Details of Prospecting Licences can be found in the six-monthly reports to the Oireachtas, which I am obliged to lay before the Houses.  The last such report was in respect of the six-month period ended 31 December 2010 which was recently laid before the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_5900">The Digital Hub Development Agency (DHDA) is continuing to work towards its development objectives to grow the Digital Hub.  As I indicated in my reply to a similar question in April, there were, as of early this year, 98 companies operating in the Digital Hub with 664 full time and a further 220 part time employees.  The DHDA continues to promote the identity and brand of the Hub and companies located there have enjoyed notable successes and have gained national and international recognition.  On its educational remit the DHDA has delivered a very successful learning programme, which has provided state-of-the-art digital media education to schools and the wider community in Dublin's inner city.  The DHDA has developed an award-winning community engagement process, the Community Public Private Partnership.</p>
            <p eId="para_5901">The DHDA has reached the point where all of its own available office space has been occupied and has leased office space to meet the requirements of its tenant companies.  An additional 20,000 square feet was recently completed through redevelopment of a building in the Hub in partnership with the OPW.  The Agency had plans for the development of further office space that would have eliminated its reliance on Exchequer funding.  This development is not progressing at present and the Agency is pursuing the matter with the two developers concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_5902">I have initiated a review of the DHDA which is currently underway.  It will, inter alia, focus on the objectives of the Agency, how these have been achieved and set out recommendations for the continuing role of the Agency and its potential role in the delivery of the Government's Smart Economy objectives.</p>

The legislation will amend and consolidate legislation in the area of animal health, particularly to reflect the changed disease status of our animals.  Existing legislation will also be updated to ensure that the welfare of all animals, including non-farm animals, is properly protected and that the penalties for offenders are increased significantly.

As not all applications have yet reached Johnstown Castle, it is not possible to say exactly how many farmers have applied for the scheme.

The enforcement of this Act is the responsibility of the Local Authority in whose functional area the goods are sold.  The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation has responsibility for the Casual Trading Act 1995.  The Local Authority with responsibility for implementing the Control of Horses Act 1996 in the Smithfield area is Dublin City Council.  The Act includes provisions for an authorised person appointed by a local authority or member of An Garda Síochána who suspects that a horse is in pain or acute neglect to direct the owner/keeper to seek veterinary attention for the horse and the Act also empowers a member of An Garda Síochána to seize and detain a horse where there is reasonable cause to suspect that the necessary veterinary attention has not been obtained.  Furthermore with regard to horse welfare issues, the main statutes governing cruelty to all animals, including horses, in this country is the Protection of Animals Acts 1911 and 1965.   Responsibility for pursuing cases under this legislation rests with An Garda Síochána, who may on receipt of a complaint investigate and bring a prosecution against any person alleged to have committed an offence under this Act.</p>

            <p eId="para_5943">Under EU harmonized legislation a series of health and supervisory requirements are applied in the Member States to ensure that animal products are produced to standards that guarantee the safety of food and the protection of human and animal health.  The application of these standards in the Member States is monitored by the FVO (Food &amp; Veterinary Office) of the EU.  It is a requirement that animal products imported from third countries meet standards at least equivalent to those required for production in, and trade between, Member States.  All meat imports must come from third countries or areas of third countries approved for export to the EU and be presented at an approved Border Inspection Post to undergo  documentary, identity and physical checks in accordance with EU requirements.  In order to be approved a third country must: Appear on a list drawn up and updated on the basis of EU audits and guarantees given by the competent authority of the exporting country. Have veterinary controls equivalent to those applicable in the EU, particularly in terms of legislation, hygiene conditions, animal health status, veterinary medicine controls, zoonosis controls and other food law. Have in place a residues programme approved by the European Commission. Products of Animal Origin must be sourced from establishments that have: Standards equivalent to the requirements for EU export establishments. Effective control systems and supervision by the competent authorities. Traceability/labelling in accordance with the systems approved by the FVO and accepted and notified to the EU Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_5944">The EU's FVO carries out assessment of third countries wishing to export animal products to EU and submits for Commission approval those where the responsible authorities can provide appropriate guarantees as regards compliance or equivalence with Community feed and food law and animal health rules.  Third countries and their establishments that are approved to export are audited and inspected by the FVO with regard to these guarantees and reports of the findings of inspections are published on its website.  Where there are concerns with regard to the effectiveness of controls being operated in an approved third country the Commission, in consultation with the Standing Committee on Animal Health and the Food Chain, may introduce specific or additional import control by means of a safeguard measure to ensure the protection of human and animal health.  Safeguard measures limiting or banning the export of animal products from third countries or regions of countries may be implemented where, for example, the conditions of an animal disease outbreak could seriously effect production and trade in animal products in the EU.  I am not aware of any outbreak of BSE in Brazil, nor of any move by the Commission to introduce safeguard measures in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_5950">The Federation of Irish Fishermen (FIF) has made a proposal to my Department concerning a limited sea bass fishery in the Celtic Sea. In the proposal, the FIF have stated that they will take a "precautionary approach to avoid any fishing whatsoever of the Irish inshore stock". The FIF has specifically proposed that vessels would be permitted to land only sea bass caught south of  (51.30'N) in area VII, which is an area approximately 50 KM off the SE coast and adjacent to the SW coast of Ireland, this area extends 375Km south.  The FIF proposal, having regard to the scientific advice that is available on the inshore stock, also provides that all fishing for sea bass should be prohibited inside the Irish 12 mile coastal limit until there is further assessment carried out to determine the state of the stock.</p>
            <p eId="para_5951">Irish vessels are currently precluded from landing sea bass under the Bass (Conservation of Stocks) Regulations 2006 (S.I. No. 230 of 2006) and the Bass (Restriction on Sale) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 367 of 2007). The complete ban for the commercial fishing of sea bass applies to Irish fishing vessels in all areas while the vessels of other EU Member States are permitted to fish for sea bass, other than within Ireland's 6 mile coastal zone where a complete ban applies.</p>
            <p eId="para_5952">I recognise that this is a very complex issue which can have significant local and national impacts aside from commercial fishing, such as angling tourism and marine bio-diversity. Indeed, I am very conscious that a large number of continental and UK anglers visit Ireland every year for the sole purpose of bass fishing.</p>
            <p eId="para_5953">In order to assess the full impacts of the FIF proposal, I have sought and received scientific advice from the Marine Institute. Additionally I have sought and received the advice of the Sea Fisheries Protection Authority in relation to control implications of the proposal, from the perspective of the regulation of such a fishery. Minister Killeen wrote to Minister Lenihan in the Department of Energy, Communications and Natural Resources, who has responsibility for inland fisheries, including bass angling, seeking his views on this proposal and Minister Lenihan has provided those observations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5954">I am currently considering the proposal together with the advice, observations and submissions made to date, in order to determine whether sufficient information is available in order to reach a determination on the matter.</p>

Some 4,641 of their clients were  in receipt of the BTEA Third Level Option in the 2007/08, 6,559 in 2008/09 and  10,351 in the current (2009/10) academic year.  However, not all BTEA  recipients qualify for support under the student grant schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5989">The Deputy will appreciate that many categories of applicants apply for funding  under the maintenance grant schemes. My Department does not collate information specifically on students in receipt of the BTEA allowance only.</p>
            <p eId="para_5990">Students currently in receipt of the BTEA and the maintenance grant will  continue to be eligible for both payments for the duration of their current  course provided they continue to meet the terms and conditions of the schemes.  With effect from the academic year 2010/11, students entering or progressing to  a new course will no longer be eligible to hold the BTEA together with a  student maintenance grant. These students may continue to apply to be assessed to have the cost of the student service charge and any tuition fees paid on their behalf.</p>

            <p eId="para_6011">The Department of Education and Science participated in the work of the National Steering Group on Financial Education established by the Financial Regulator.  The Report of the Group, Improving Financial Capability — a  Multi-stakeholder Approach, was published in July 2009.  The Group also developed a Financial Competency Framework which sets out a comprehensive set of learning outcomes detailing the knowledge skills and competences a financially competent person should have at different stages of their lives.  This can be used as an important resource for those developing educational materials for young people and adults in the field of financial literacy.  The learning outcomes cover Levels 1 to 4 of the National Framework of Qualifications.</p>
            <p eId="para_6012">Aspects of financial literacy are included in the curriculum at present in such areas as Mathematics, Home Economics, Economics, Business and Accounting,  Enterprise Education and the Mathematical Applications within the Leaving  Certificate Applied Programme.  The programmes cover computational skills, using appropriate tools to estimate and measure, to compare value for money, to calculate prices, compound interest, profit and loss, discount, VAT, PRSI, income tax, domestic bills and charges, recording and interpreting financial data, converting into other currencies and solving problems.  Consumer studies, money and banking, housing finance, credit and insurance are also covered.  These areas will be further strengthened to the extent possible in line with ongoing curriculum reform.  In addition, Ireland has participated in the EU  Dolceta programme designed to provide on-line education resources for financial literacy and consumer education.</p>
            <p eId="para_6013">Get Smart with Your Money has been developed by the Financial Regulator as a specific resource for use within Transition Year.

            <p eId="para_6202">My Department is now in the process of identifying what school projects might be eligible for consideration for inclusion in a 4th bundle of PPP schools and the school in question is being considered in that context.</p>
            <p eId="para_6203">The nature of procurement via Public Private Partnership is that a Bundle of school projects is offered to the market together.

            <p eId="para_6204">The indicative timeframe for the delivery of a Bundle of Public Private Partnership schools currently stands at approximately 4 years for the date the Bundle is announced.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Skills (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_6275">The revised annual charges for school transport have been confined to eligible and concessionary post-primary children (€300) and primary children availing of concessionary transport (€200). Charges for school transport continue to be waived in the case of eligible post-primary children where the family is in possession of a valid medical card. Eligible children attending primary schools and children with special needs will still travel free. A maximum family rate of €650 also applies.</p>
            <p eId="para_6276">Bus Éireann which operates the school transport scheme on behalf of my Department confirmed that the overall decrease in the number of students using school transport was approx. 10,000 (or 7%) when compared with the 2008/2009 figure of approx. 135,000 using the service.</p>
            <p eId="para_6277">This decrease occurred at post primary level while the numbers of eligible primary students using the school transport service increased slightly and the numbers of children with special educational needs remained consistent.</p>
            <p eId="para_6278">It is considered that the decrease in the uptake of school transport services at post primary level was due in part to the increased post primary charges in 2009/2010.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Education and Skills (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_6283">From September 2010, as announced in the Budget, all new applicants including mature students, who are in receipt of the Back to Education Allowance for all schemes and the VTOS allowances for those pursuing PLC courses, will be ineligible for student maintenance grants. The cost of the student services charge and any fees payable to colleges will continue to be met, for eligible students, by the Exchequer on their behalf. They should apply to their assessing authority to have their eligibility assessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_6284">Students currently in receipt of the BTEA or VTOS allowances and the maintenance grant will continue to be eligible for both payments for the duration of their current course, provided they continue to meet the terms and conditions of the scheme. Students progressing to a new course, with effect from 2010/11, will no longer be eligible for student maintenance grants but can apply for assistance towards the cost of the student services charge and any fees payable.</p>
            <p eId="para_6285">Students who qualify for maintenance grants will continue to receive substantial grant funding, together with full support for payment of the student service charge. Those on particularly low incomes will also continue to receive a "top-up" in the special rate of maintenance grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_6286">Under the student grant schemes all mature candidates, if approved, are automatically provided with the higher non-adjacent rate of maintenance which, this year, ranges from €810 to €6,355 depending on individual circumstances. The entitlement to the non-adjacent rate applies regardless of how far the college is from the mature candidate's residence and whether or not the candidate is dependent on or independent of his/her parent(s) or guardian(s).</p>
            <p eId="para_6287">There is a growing number of second chance students entering higher education.  The numbers entering higher education from further education have increased substantially in recent years, up from 2.7% of entrants in 2005 to over 10% in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_6288">In addition, revised criteria for the 2010 grant schemes require that the duration of the break in studies required for re-entry as a mature candidate has been increased from one year to three years, providing for greater targeting of support to genuine mature students.</p>
