          <p eId="para_1">All of us in this House will be very saddened at the devastating news that has been visited upon 500 workers at HP Inc. in Leixlip, County Kildare. The loss of such a large number of jobs will obviously, in the first instance, have an extraordinary and devastating impact on the workers and their families. It will have a wider impact on the community and economy of the hinterland around north Kildare. It is clear that the closure of the plant was in the company's plans since last October when it announced that it would cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs globally. The production of personal computers, cartridges and printers is under pressure as a business.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> There is a need for the Government to come to the assistance of the workers and to ensure that there is a comprehensive plan, involving the Department of Social Protection and Enterprise Ireland, in terms of trying to help some workers to set up new businesses, which happened in the past in similar situations. Solas must also be involved in the context of providing return to work and training programmes to equip people for other job opportunities. I ask the Taoiseach to outline what the Minister has in mind regarding a comprehensive response so that the needs of the workers will be attended to immediately and in an effective way.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> It was very unfair and distressing that the workers heard this news through the national media yesterday. I would like assurances from the Taoiseach that no member of the Government or a governmental representative briefed the media in advance of the workers getting a detailed presentation from the company. What happened was unusual because in situations of this nature, companies do not tend to leak such news. They generally meet their workforce in advance to tell them the actual details. I ask the Taoiseach to provide some reassurances on that front. More fundamentally, since the global announcement last October, what steps did the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation take in terms of meeting Hewlett Packard executives? Did the Minister meet them since last October? How many meetings took place?</p>
          <p eId="para_4">Is the Minister or the Government in a position to indicate to the House that future plans at Hewlett Packard are ones that are in the growth areas such as 3D printing etc., and are there opportunities for Ireland from this company into the future? Are the existing jobs in Kildare secure with regard to Hewlett Packard Enterprise and has the Government received guarantees on that? Would the Minister be willing to come to the House to answer questions today on the closure and on such a large loss of jobs?</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_2">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T12:05:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_5">I thank Deputy Martin for raising this important matter. Like him, all our concerns and priorities at the moment are with the workers and their families in HP Inc. Thank God this is not a common occurrence these days where the line of investment into the country continues to remain very strong. I thank the workers for the efforts they have put in over the years since Hewlett Packard came to Leixlip in 1995.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> I can confirm to the Deputy that IDA Ireland has been involved intensely with Hewlett Packard over the last period and the chief executive travelled out specifically to southern California to talk to the HR personnel at Hewlett Packard some time ago. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation spoke to the principals in Hewlett Packard last week but, unfortunately, the company was not turning from the decision it had made. The efforts made over the period by IDA Ireland and the Minister were, in the end, in vain because the company decided that the particular product in HP Inc. was to be discontinued. The Minister will be answering questions here later today.</p>
          <p eId="para_7"> I can confirm to Deputy Martin that Department of Social Protection staff will involve themselves directly with the workforce in the plant but they need to be invited in there. It would mean that workers in the HP Inc. plant would not have to go through the Intreo offices and could deal directly with Department of Social Protection staff who will go to the plant to engage with the workers and advise them of their benefits and rights. I understand that the company intends that there would be an enhanced severance package to employees as well as information about outplacement and support thereafter.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> I have no knowledge of a briefing from any source in Government on this matter. These days, however, it is very hard to know where any information comes from. Privacy does not seem to be considered by everybody anymore. In any event, it is unfortunate that workers heard about this on the national airwaves before they had the opportunity to be informed by the management of the workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> This is a brilliant location, it is a fabulous building and it has multiple uses. It could be sold as a going concern. IDA Ireland and the Minister's efforts will now be to provide an alternative in what is a superb location. I can confirm to the Deputy that the line of investment enquiries into the country is very strong. That does not just help the workforce today. One hopes that with the efforts of IDA Ireland and the Ministers for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Social Protection, we will see to it that in so far as the State can offer it, support will be given and that a replacement will be found in order that people can be retrained in the shortest possible time for this particular location.</p>

          <p eId="para_10">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply but he might clarify further. This is quite a good company. Hewlett Packard employed quite a significant number of people over a long period. That has to be put on the record. The Taoiseach did seem to indicate, however, that the Minister spoke to the company last week. Will the Taoiseach outline when the Minister met the company and how many times she has met the company since last October? There was an announcement last October that the company was going to shed 3,000 to 4,000 jobs globally in a rationalisation programme when it divided the two companies into Hewlett Packard Enterprise and HP Inc.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">Clearly, there were fears for Leixlip as a result of that announcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_12"> Did the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation travel to Palo Alto to meet Hewlett Packard executives between October and last week? If so, will the Taoiseach outline the content of those discussions? Invariably, when one sector of business is under pressure, other opportunities open up for the future. Were any commitments given by HP in this regard? Is the Government, through IDA Ireland, pursuing any particular new areas of investment that could replenish the jobs that have been lost at the HP Inc. plant in Leixlip? It is important we have clarification regarding the efforts the Minister has made in terms of meeting with executives since October to source new activity for the Leixlip plant.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_4">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_13">It is important to say that this has nothing to do with Hewlett Packard Enterprise, which is a separate arm of the HP operation. It has been a totally separate company since November 2015 and it employs more than 2,100 people at its facilities in Cork, Galway and Leixlip. I have visited those plants on a number of occasions. HP Inc. will retain a small sales entity and support presence in Leixlip. It is only some five weeks since it became apparent that HP Inc. was going to shed workers at the Leixlip plant. The chief executive of IDA Ireland travelled to Palo Alto specifically to discuss the decision with senior management. The Minister did not travel to California but did speak to senior management by telephone in recent days. She will answer questions in that regard in the House later. IDA Ireland was intensely involved in identifying the many options that may be considered for Leixlip. It is a fabulous location and a brilliant plant. Unfortunately, the technology and product have fallen out of date with changes that have occurred globally. The Minister will answer questions later and will give the Deputy full information on all of this. IDA Ireland is actively considering alternative options.</p>

        <speech by="#GerryAdams" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T12:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_14">Yesterday, I raised with the Taoiseach the scandal of tens of thousands of patients being omitted from official waiting list numbers published by the National Treatment Purchase Fund, as revealed on the "RTE Investigates" programme on Monday evening. I will return on another day to my party's recommendation for dealing with this emergency. I wish today to raise another shocking case that highlights the utter incompetence of the Government in managing our health service. The Taoiseach will recall the case of Meadhbh McGivern and the failure to transport her for a liver transplant in July 2011. An inquiry was put in place into the circumstances which led to that failure and to examine existing inter-agency arrangements for people requiring emergency transportation for transplant surgery. Among the recommendations of the inquiry was the need for co-ordination of land and air logistics for patients requiring emergency aero-medical transportation on a 24-hour basis and the requirement for staff to be trained appropriately in aero-medical logistics. At the time, in response to a question from me, the Taoiseach expressed his deep regret for what happened to Meadhbh. I understand from an interview by her father that, buíochas le Dia, she is now doing well.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> Fast forward to 22 December last year when Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin was told by the national aero-medical command centre set up after Meadhbh's case that the transportation of priority 1 children for heart and liver transplants could not be guaranteed over the Christmas period. The matter was brought to the direct attention of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris. On 3 January, the hospital was informed that the situation had worsened, that the four-hour timeframe for heart transplants was unlikely to be achievable and that the six-hour timeframe for liver transplants was also in doubt. This affects seven children whose lives are at risk. Their families were not informed of these developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">On 16 January, the hospital was told that the situation will remain unchanged until the end of May this year at the earliest and the Department of Health stated at the time that it will continue to raise the issues with the Department of Defence.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> The Taoiseach is the Minister responsible for the Department of Defence. He also expressed deep regret about how Ms Meadhbh McGivern was treated yet it seems that a key recommendation has not been implemented. These are deeply worrying times for the children and the families concerned. Has the Department of Health raised these issues with the Department of Finance and, if so, will the Taoiseach give us the details of this contact? Has this matter been raised directly with the Taoiseach, in his capacity as Minister for Defence, by the Minister for Health, and what is the Taoiseach proposing to do about it? Will the Taoiseach clarify what contingency plans are in place for the transport of transplant patients?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_6">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T12:15:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_18">I read the letters in respect of this. Within the HSE, the national aeromedical co-ordination centre is responsible for the co-ordination of emergency aeromedical patient transfers to hospitals within Ireland and abroad. As part of that inter-hospital transfer service, the Department of Defence has an agreement with the Department of Health and the HSE for the Air Corps to use its fleet of helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft to transport patients - children or adults - and medical teams between hospitals in Ireland and abroad on an available basis. If a call comes through, Air Corps personnel may be involved in sea rescues or other activities. The service is obviously dependent upon the availability of suitable aircraft and the availability of crews to fly them. When the Air Corps is not available, the HSE has arrangements in place with the Irish Coast Guard or private air operators to provide the inter-hospital transfers.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> The Air Corps has experienced retirements of highly experienced personnel. There is a current shortage of pilots within the Air Corps, which is a central issue, but the Air Corps continues to provide an inter-hospital transfer service, albeit on a reduced basis because of that. It means that out of hours on weekdays, between 6 p.m. and 8 a.m. the following day, the Air Corps does not have air crews standing by for fixed-wing aircraft.</p>
          <p eId="para_20"> As to what happens in the meantime, obviously every effort is being made to address this. There are 28 cadets going through three classes at present under the various stages of training to be pilots and other aircraft personnel but that will only yield results in the medium term. The Minister for Health and the Minister of State with statutory responsibility for health are looking at what options are open now.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> The Department of Defence has always kept the Department of Health aware of this. The fact of the matter is when a call comes that a transplant opportunity is available for a person, they need to know that they will be able to get to the hospital in London, elsewhere in Britain or wherever it might be within the timescale involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> The service that the emergency aeromedical service provides is based in Custume Barracks in Athlone and that continues to operate as normal. That delivers life-saving treatment and rapid aeromedical transport for seriously ill patients throughout the country. Since its inception, it has transported 2,500 patients in this regard. Obviously, because of those unexpected retirements in air traffic control, the availability of Baldonnel as an aerodrome has been reduced. There are a number of other technical options that are being considered. The Minister of Health is meeting the Minister of State at the Department of Defence. We want to get this in such a way that there is a guarantee for people that all of the options can be considered to have a patient transferred within the four-hour timescale involved.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GerryAdams" eId="spk_7">
          <from>Deputy Gerry Adams<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T12:15:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_23">We were told weeks ago that the Minister for Health was meeting the Minister of State at the Department of Defence. It still has not happened. I asked the Taoiseach a clear question. Did the Minister for Health raise this issue directly with the Taoiseach?</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> These children are waiting for transport now. If they got word that there was a transplant, they would not be able to be transported by the Air Corps now.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">The Taoiseach talks about unexpected retirements. Approximately ten retirements are expected in the next year and five have already given notice.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> However, I will come to the crux of the matter. It came in confidential form to our spokesperson on health, Deputy Louise O'Reilly, and it considers the impact of personnel shortages in the Air Corps. The Taoiseach has responsibility for this. The shortages have a direct effect on contingency arrangements for children on the transport list. The current class of pilot cadets will not have been through basic training until next September at the earliest. Then they must undertake further basic training, which can take between one and two years. None of the current class of pilot cadets will be qualified to undertake this type of ambulance mission in 2017 and perhaps into late 2018. With regard to unexpected retirements, not one recommendation in two Department of Defence working group reports on how to retain experienced pilots has been acted on even though the Taoiseach has held that job for the past six years. This is the Taoiseach's direct responsibility, as is the failure to implement the recommendation in Meadhbh McGivern's case.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> These are extremely worrying times for the parents, the children involved and their families. They need clarity on what arrangements are in place. Will the Taoiseach provide clarity? If a family gets word that a transplant is available now, will the Taoiseach outline the contingencies to get the child to where he or she can receive that life-saving operation?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_8">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_28">If a call came now, at 12.20 p.m., the answer is "Yes". The Department of Defence has an agreement with the HSE to supply that transport. However, who knows whether there might be unfortunate circumstances where an air-sea rescue might be taking place at a particular time and helicopters might be involved in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> There are two challenges here. One is a shortage of pilots. Some have retired and some have gone to other employment. We do not have control over that. The second is the air traffic controllers. Given the technology, it is possible to carry out air traffic control from different locations. There are 28 cadets currently in training who will become pilots who are able to fly both fixed-wing aircraft and helicopters. In the meantime, outside the hours I have mentioned, we must use either the Coast Guard, the Custume Barracks emergency aeromedical support or private enterprise. The important matter is that if a call comes for a patient, be they an adult or child, a service will be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> This was brought to my attention at the weekend and I have asked for a report from the Department of Defence. I am the Minister for Defence, but I have given statutory responsibility for many areas in the Department to the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe. He is meeting the Minister for Health and as soon as I have that report-----</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_11">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T12:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_33">The charges that have been laid at the Garda Commissioner's door are incredibly serious. The Government has acknowledged this in making the decision to establish a commission of investigation to be chaired by Mr. Justice Peter Charleton. It is quite unusual for the Government to have made a decision to establish a commission of investigation without consultation with the Opposition parties. We have not been furnished with a copy of Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill's report, even in redacted form, although it was delivered to the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality more than two months ago, nor have we been consulted on the terms of reference for the commission. I do not know if Fianna Fáil, the Taoiseach's partner in Government, has received advance copies but the rest of the Members on the Opposition benches have not. This is not good enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> I presume the Government will make time available for a full debate on the terms of reference but in the meantime, the fact the Garda Commissioner remains on active duty is troubling. I cannot think of another walk of life where, if allegations of this nature had been made against a person in a position of power, he or she would not be placed on administrative leave until the outcome of the investigation is known. This would be true of a school principal or even a shop manager. That it is not true for the head of An Garda Síochána is troubling. In this case the allegations are serious enough to warrant a commission of investigation. While some argument could be made for leaving the Garda Commissioner in place while Mr. Justice O'Neill carried out his initial investigation, I do not believe it is appropriate for as long as the formal commission of investigation is under way.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> This morning a journalist contacted me and told me they had direct knowledge of calls made by the Garda Commissioner to journalists during 2013 and 2014 in the course of which the Commissioner made very serious allegations of sexual crimes having been committed by Sergeant Maurice McCabe. In 2015, the Garda Commissioner oversaw the investigation which examined the call logs of a Garda officer who was under suspicion of leaking material to the media. If it was a fact that the Garda Commissioner was in direct contact with the media making allegations against one of her own officers at around the same time, it would be quite extraordinary. I do not know whether the charges that have been made against the Garda Commissioner are true or not.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">I do not agree. The matter the Deputy has raised is of the most serious import and he understands this. The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, received the report last October from Mr. Justice Iarfhlaith O'Neill on his review of two protected disclosures which deal with matters of privacy, confidentiality and constitutional import. The Tánaiste will lay the order before the House today, as is required in dealing with commissions of investigation and matters of protected disclosure. The report to be published will be what can be published, taking into account those parameters of privacy, confidentiality and constitutional importance. It will be published today on advice received by the Tánaiste. The reason for the commission of investigation is because Mr. Justice O'Neill, in his review, pointed out that the review could not have attempted to establish where the truth lies in respect of the very serious allegations made here.</p>

          <p eId="para_46">Protected disclosures are protected and the law is there for whistleblowers. These are allegations that are vehemently denied by the two people against whom they were made. For this purpose, the Attorney General spoke to the Chief Justice about appointing a judge to deal with it, as the Tánaiste announced yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">There are set procedures that have to be followed. The Government yesterday approved the Tánaiste's recommendations that a commission should be set up, that the draft order which she brought to Government would be approved, that the order would be laid before the House and that the statement of reasons would be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas. With regard to the approving of the appropriate motions, it was agreed that a suitable person should be appointed to conduct the investigation and that the issues are followed in correct sequence in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_48"> What Deputy Howlin said has been commented upon by the Ceann Comhairle in respect of hearsay, and Deputy Howlin has answered that. What is at issue here is a series of allegations the truth of which has not been tested yet, and which I can tell the House are wholly and vehemently denied by those against whom the allegations are made. These are not circumstances where a <i>prima facie </i>case of wrongdoing has been established. Mr. Justice O'Neill makes no findings in regard to anyone. In the case of the Garda Commissioner, as I have consistently stated on many occasions, there has been no finding of any wrongdoing of any kind against her and in those circumstances, she is entitled to our full support and that remains the position.</p>

          <p eId="para_51"> I have not seen the report because the Government has not provided it to us, although it has caused a commission of investigation without any discussion with the Opposition parties, which is most unusual. Everybody is entitled to the presumption of innocence but issues that warrant a full investigation must be fully ventilated and fully investigated. As I said, in the normal course of events, when there serious issues like these that go to the heart of the administration of justice in our State, people will be asked to stand aside, without any predetermination of outcome, until there is a full, fair and complete investigation of all the matters concerned and a determination of the outcome. Our primary duty is to ensure that we restore confidence to An Garda Síochána, which has been battered and bruised by many investigations and allegations. I believe that means we must have decisive and clear action from all sides of this House.</p>

The House will appreciate there is an obligation, including a general constitutional obligation, to protect the good names and reputations of persons who may be the subject of untested allegations and, in that regard, it is not appropriate to comment further. Deputies will have ample opportunity to debate the issues when the motion to approve the draft order is taken in the House. Furthermore, I must caution that the persons who made the protected disclosures are, pending the laying of the draft order before the House, still entitled to have their identities protected in accordance with the Protected Disclosures Act 2014.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">In court in Belfast yesterday, campaigners against political policing won a full hearing into the failure to include Northern Ireland in the Pitchford inquiry into undercover policing in Britain. This comes after the Stormont Minister of Justice officially requested its inclusion. The German Government has written to the British Government seeking the inclusion of the actions of the so-called spy cops in Germany and the Scottish Government has done the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">British undercover police officers were also operating in this State but yet the Irish Government has so far refused to request the inclusion of their activities in that investigation. Why is that? I presume the Taoiseach has heard of Mark Kennedy, who was exposed as a secret member of the national public order intelligence unit. He had multiple intimate relationships with women using his false identity as an environmental activist called Mark Stone. </p>

          <p eId="para_65">It has been raised multiple times in the House. He was in Ireland and it is admitted he was in Ireland on multiple occasions. He participated in the Shell to Sea protests in the Taoiseach's constituency. He organised meetings here in the run-up to the protest in Gleneagles at the G8 in 2005. He was arrested by the Garda in Dublin on 3 May 2004. Sarah Hampton, a US citizen, met Mark Kennedy in Ireland in 2005. On Monday, in a statement read out in Dublin she said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_66">Finding out that Mark was an undercover police officer brought about a deep depression that seemed impossible to navigate, there were times I almost gave up completely. The process of seeking justice on this case has felt at times belittling, intimidating and downright scary. ... I felt I had been raped. I never consented to sleeping with a police officer.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">He had other intimate relationships in Ireland based on a lie and an abuse of power. This political policing targeted at left wing and environmental activists breached their right to privacy in this State, which is enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights. Those affected are seeking answers and justice. Mark Kennedy was not just one bad apple. He was part of a system of political policing and abuse of rights. As well as him, we know of at least three other undercover British police officers who operated in this State - Jim Boyling, Mark Jenners and John Dines. There is a huge number of unanswered questions here. The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality has confirmed the Garda was aware of Mark Kennedy's presence. On what basis and on whose authority did he have permission to operate here? Did the Garda know of other undercover officers? Was anybody convicted of any crimes as a result of any evidence or actions? Fifty-six convictions or prosecutions have been overturned in Britain as a result of his involvement. I have two questions. Can we have the publication of the report commissioned in 2011 by the Garda Commissioner into his activities and can we have a commitment to publish the report that is currently ongoing? Will the Irish Government join with the other countries affected in requesting the extension of the Pitchford inquiry to the actions of these undercover officers in this State?</p>

          <p eId="para_69">I would like a commitment from the Taoiseach that when that meeting takes place, a formal request will be made for the inquiry to be extended to Ireland. It is incomprehensible and unexplainable why that request has not been made unless the Irish Government is saying its protection of British spies in Ireland takes priority over the wish of these people for answers and justice. We have more than enough political policing in this State already without allowing British agents to have a free run here too. There are pictures of Mark Kennedy in Ireland. There are pictures of him with the women affected. There are pictures of him at protests. The idea that has been put in some of the answers by the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality that he was not really operating as a police officer here is not credible. He participated in multiple protests and there is evidence of that. We have the apology, finally granted to Ms Hampton in January, which admits his actions from the point of view of the Metropolitan Police.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">It is very important that the Government would make that request and would also publish all the information it has so far.</p>

The security forces here would be very concerned about agents from an another country operating in this jurisdiction. We have had incidences of that in the past. I would prefer, if I may presume so, to allow the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, on behalf of the Government, to meet the Secretary of State, to have this matter and matters pertaining to it discussed, and for him to issue a statement after that meeting.</p>

          <p eId="para_97">There was an opportunity. We met yesterday afternoon in the Business Committee, and every Whip from every party had the opportunity to state at that stage that the arrangement was not suitable. I have no problem with the time being extended. I was among those who argued it should be longer. There is no problem suspending the debate and continuing it thereafter. I agree that every Deputy in the House should be allowed time to speak, but we do not all have access to Ministers in the same way to those Deputies of whose party the Ministers are members. In this instance, the Deputies who have raised concerns about the arrangement did not raise those concerns at the meeting, which was the appropriate place. However, I do not have a problem with reflecting the arrangement we had decided for the statements on the executive order in the United States. There is no problem, but that impacts on the opportunity made available tomorrow for other Deputies other than party spokespersons to ask questions. If some of that time is taken away, it will impact on the ability of other Deputies to ask questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_106">It is a very serious point. What tends to happen is that in most of the set piece debates, be it on the European Council or any other matter, there might be five or six speakers, with ten or 15 minutes allocated to each, but the bulk of backbenchers in the larger parties are simply not getting opportunities to speak on important issues. The Dáil reform committee needs to deal with this. The system does not have to be strictly d'Hondt. I am not in the business of shutting down smaller parties or anything like that.</p>

          <p eId="para_138">It is a question of fairness. If any Deputies on the opposite side of the House have a difficulty with the mandate of the 50 elected representatives of Fine Gael, I would say they have a problem with democracy. Even beyond tomorrow's debate, there are members of the Fine Gael Parliamentary Party who do not get an opportunity to speak as other parties have outlined. At times when a Minister speaks on behalf of Government, he or she will take a departmental-Government approach. Sometimes, the Fine Gael approach is different and our inability to be able clearly to express that is an affront to democracy. That is why this change needs to happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">The whistleblowers legislation - the Protected Disclosures Act 2014 - lays out clear procedures for Departments to take in respect of protected disclosures. There are three whistleblowers and one in particular made protected disclosures to the Department of Defence and the then Minister, Deputy Coveney, regarding public health concerns at Baldonnel Airport and the workshops at the facility in which people were exposed to toxic chemicals. These were most serious and grave health issues and revelations. The whistleblower concerned was very anxious to ascertain whether the Minister could confirm that he had received his protected disclosure in 2015 and could not get confirmation of that. Indeed he went through the Chief Whip, Deputy Regina Doherty, to get access to the Minister to get him to confirm that he had received the protected disclosure. The texts of his messages to the Chief Whip have been revealed in the <i>Irish Examiner</i>. I pay tribute to Joe Leogue who has written a series of articles on this matter. This is very good investigative journalism.</p>

          <p eId="para_155">I will supply that to the Deputy. The Health and Safety Authority conducted three inspections of the Air Corps premises at Casement Aerodrome in Baldonnel. It focused in particular on the control of occupational hygiene hazards in the workplace, including health surveillance issues. The Health and Safety Authority issued its report of inspection to the Air Corps on 21 October 2016. It listed a number of matters that required attention, including risk assessment, health surveillance, the monitoring of employees' actual exposure to particular hazardous substances and the provision and use of personal protective equipment. I am advised that the military authorities responded in writing to the Health and Safety Authority report on 20 December 2016. They indicated that the Air Corps is fully committed to implementing improved safety measures that will protect workers from potential exposure to chemicals and will ensure risks are as low as reasonably practicable. The Air Corps has implemented an improvement plan that will be conducted over eight phases. The first phase commenced in September 2016 and has a completion date of December 2017. I know that a number of articles were published in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> on 23 and 24 January last.</p>

In this context, the news that 500 jobs are to be lost at the HP Inc. facility in Leixlip is devastating for the local community and for the workers and their families. When did the Government know that this move was to be taken by the company? What action, if any, did the Government take last October when the company announced that it intended to cut between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs globally? What efforts were made to persuade the company not to close? The decision to split the company in two is a device that is used by multinationals to minimise disruption to their profit margins. It has been suggested that these jobs will be transferred overseas. Does the Government know to where these jobs are being relocated? Is the new location within the EU? If so, will the Government investigate whether the EU globalisation fund can be accessed? Can the Taoiseach spell out for the families that are reeling from this morning's news the immediate steps the Government will take to prioritise new investment in this region and to protect the workers' statutory rights?</p>

          <p eId="para_215">I have already referred to this question. The company made this announcement quite some time ago. The Minister has confirmed it has been approximately five to six weeks since it became apparent there would be an impact on the company's workers in Ireland. The chief executive of IDA Ireland travelled to southern California to speak directly to principals in HP Inc. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation spoke with management in HP Inc. in California from here in the past number of days. Every effort is being made to ensure we find an alternative for what is a superb location and plant. In particular, the assistance of the State will be made available to workers and if the Department of Social Protection receives an invitation to visit the plant, its personnel will deal individually with all the workers rather than making them visit Intreo offices. IDA Ireland is already looking at potential options for a replacement facility in that building. I hope that answers the Deputy's questions.</p>

The shortest way to deal with this really important issue on which many parties in the Opposition are focused is to make it part of the social welfare and pensions Bill that will be the Government vehicle. Will the Taoiseach give us a timetable for the publication of the heads of the social welfare and pensions Bill?

Patients are dying through neglect. When will we see some bit of reality or humanity introduced?

          <p eId="para_224">A number of months ago I introduced the Industrial Relations (Right to Access) (Amendment) Bill 2016, which essentially allows trade union representatives to engage with employees in the workplace, which is not a right that trade union representatives have at this point. The Taoiseach is aware of the ongoing dispute between Tesco and some of its employees. Today we heard from the leader of the Mandate trade union, Mr. John Douglas, that there is wholesale intimidation not just of the trade union but also the employees. We need robust protection for workers, not just in Tesco but in all those retail and other sectors populated by people in low-paid jobs who are being exploited and who need protection. Will the Government examine the Bill so that when Sinn Féin initiates debate on it at some stage during Private Members' time, it might be in a position to support it?</p>

Before Christmas, Teagasc made a request to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine for assistance to deal with the backlog of 3,600 young farmers who are seeking places in agricultural colleges to get green certificate qualifications. On top of this, no young farmer got an entitlement from the national reserve in 2016. What are we going to do to assist the young farming community and revitalise this sector?

This is evidence of a realisation that Ireland is one of the leaders in the production of quality food and food of integrity, which we export. These matters are relevant to the Common Agricultural Policy. Teagasc representatives make their views known vociferously. The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister are keen to see that young farmers get every assistance possible to enable them to get into the farming business. The Department also is keen to give them supports to start and to be able to compete and make a career out of it. The matter is under constant review.</p>

          <p eId="para_233">The programme for Government advises that the State will provide next-generation broadband to 85% of the population within two years and 100% within five years. On this basis, can the Taoiseach or the Minister responsible advise the House on the progress to date of the national broadband plan tender? When will the contract be awarded?

          <p eId="para_234">Deputy McLoughlin's question is perfectly valid. Two Ministers are involved, namely, the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment and the Minister with responsibility for rural regeneration. The contract and the tender documentation to which the Deputy refers has been the subject of approximately 3,000 hours of discussion. I gather the process is more than half way through. It will probably be next year before that substantial tender is awarded. The companies involved, SIRO and Eir, as well as other network providers, are continuing to provide broadband to areas under their remit. The issue is receiving a great deal of attention, but it is exceptionally complex and it will take some time.</p>

          <p eId="para_235">Everyone is aware of the situation regarding our poultry industry. An epidemic of bird flu has swept across Europe. Since December, six cases have been reported in Ireland and one particular issue really comes to mind. On 24 December an order was made to the effect that all commercial birds should be kept indoors. The purpose was to protect them from this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> The difficulty is that, under Irish and European legislation, the status of our poultry or commercial birds may be affected after 90 days. Much of our poultry is considered to be either organic or free range. However, if birds are kept indoors for more than 90 days, they lose that status. Many people in the poultry industry are concerned that they will lose that status.</p>

          <p eId="para_244">In the programme for Government there is a commitment to update, as a matter of urgency, the wind farm planning guidelines. That was to happen within three to six months of the programme being published. It did not happen after nine months, we are now much further on and the new guidelines have still not emerged. The current wind farm guidelines are inadequate and outdated. Rural communities feel under siege by the wind farms and the power lines that are supporting them. Many of these wind farms have already been built and others are being actively resisted in the courts at the moment. The Government needs to update the wind farm guidelines to ease the distress being suffered by rural communities. When will these inadequate and outdated guidelines be updated, as promised?</p>

I understand that heads of the Bill were approved in July 2016 and I am told the Bill will ultimately lead to the ratification of the Marrakesh Treaty, which Ireland signed in 2014. This is an important treaty that facilitates access to published works for those who are visually impaired. The ratification of the treaty will end the famine of books and printed literature experienced by that community. My hope is that it will not take as long for this treaty to be ratified as it is taking for the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities.

          <p eId="para_250">The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government spoke this morning about amending and making good the failed voluntary mortgage-to-rent scheme that has been in place for the last number of years with very little, if any, success. He talked about opening the scheme up to private equity funds, giving them the opportunity to buy mortgages and properties in bulk from the banks in order for approved housing bodies or local authorities to rent the properties back to their occupants. It was also mentioned that credit unions would have an opportunity to take part in this scheme. It will be brought forward on a pilot basis which would suggest that there will be no legislation to give effect to it. Surely legislation will be required to give credit unions the opportunity to take part in the scheme, especially considering the amount of funds they have available. They want to invest those funds in the economy and more particularly in housing in order to help people and to give them the opportunity to remain their homes into the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_251">Deputy Cowen raises an important issue. The intention is that those who had the mortgages in the first place should not be displaced and forced out of their homes. We want to find opportunities for them to be able to continue to live in their homes as tenants who would have the opportunity to lease or buy back their homes in the future. I am aware of the progress of this but to be honest, I cannot recall whether legislation is necessary. I will check that and advise the Deputy on it later. It is true that credit unions have a lot of money that they wish to invest in the housing sector.</p>

The Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe, and the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, are working to rectify the problem so that when calls are made they can be answered within the timescale by whatever means so that patients, children or adults can be brought to the hospital where they can receive treatment.</p>

          <p eId="para_290">The programme for Government contains a commitment to implement the national maternity strategy. One of the key elements of that strategy is to make the 20-week anomaly scan available in all maternity facilities. Currently it is only available in six. Alongside this, national guidelines are also due to be published. It is important that these scans are made available so that no parent is left in the situation in which a young mother found herself in Kerry recently. She gave birth to a baby who had a serious heart condition. Her baby was transferred to hospital in Dublin while she had to remain in Kerry.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">Having just given birth she travelled to Dublin to be with her seriously ill baby. When her baby died, and the death was inevitable, she had to strap her child into a car seat to bring her dead baby home. Had she had a 20 week anomaly scan, which is considered fairly basic in most developed countries, that young mother could have made provision to spend the few days that she had with her beautiful baby girl. She could have said goodbye in a decent and dignified way surrounded by her family. When I say that this is important I really do mean it. These scans should be available to every pregnant woman in the State.</p>

Clearly, in every hospital in every location the provision of scans and equipment is part of the process and strategy for the provision of proper facilities for pregnant mothers or other sectors who are involved in hospital treatment. I recall the case referred to by the Deputy and obviously that mother was, and is, very upset. It is a case, I expect, of the facilities and the capacity to provide anomaly scans and that is a process of following procurement and setting out the facilities that are necessary in hospitals and so on.</p>

          <p eId="para_295">I wish to make the same point to the Taoiseach. Our local hospital, the Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar, is also a maternity hospital, and not just for my constituency but also for the midlands. The hospital put a business case to the HSE for it to provide €120,000 in order to ensure the hospital could comply with the national maternity plan. The business case for €120,000 was refused by the HSE just before Christmas. It is not good enough for the Taoiseach to say that this is part of the national maternity plan and that it is his wish and desire. Real action must follow through on that issue. One third of the expectant mothers who present to the hospital in Mullingar are scanned. This means that two thirds of expectant mothers fail to get that scan. It is a priority that should be implemented and rolled out across all maternity hospitals.</p>

          <p eId="para_297">It is not a question on legislation, but I am not sure whether the business plan was turned down because of shortage of money or because of its inadequacy. I remind Deputy Troy that €900 million extra was made available to the health budget for 2017, which now stands at €14.5 billion. This is an important element but it is a small sum in that context. I do not know the details of why the business plan was turned down. Obviously the HSE made its decision in that regard. We can follow it up.</p>

            <p eId="para_312"> The all-island civic dialogue plenary meeting, which I hosted on 2 November, was an important element in the Government's preparations to meet the broad range of challenges posed by Brexit. To strengthen our engagement further the Government launched a series of sectoral all-island dialogue events. Led by Ministers, these sessions provided an invaluable opportunity to hear directly the implications of Brexit in each sector, including on an all-island basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_313"> To date, 11 all-island sectoral dialogues have been hosted by Ministers throughout the country, attended by almost 1,000 industry and civic society representatives from across the island. Dialogues have been held on further education and training, agrifood, education and research, transport and logistics, tourism and hospitality, schools, children and young people, jobs, enterprise and innovation, seafood, energy, and heritage, culture and rural Ireland. Three further all-island sectoral dialogues will take place over the coming weeks on pensions, social welfare rights and social insurance, human rights and the Good Friday Agreement, and on agriculture and forestry. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan and I will host the second session of the all-island civic dialogue in Dublin Castle on Friday 17 February. This will build on the sectoral consultation process and provide a further opportunity for the Government to engage with, and hear the views of, those most directly affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_314"> The Cabinet committee on Brexit last met on 26 January and will continue to meet regularly to deal with Brexit related issues. While a date has not been set for the next meeting, it will take place in the very near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_316">My question relates to the Cabinet committee on Brexit. Further to the point I raised the last time we discussed these matters, has the Taoiseach sought Ireland's participation in the Barnier oversight group? On the last occasion I suggested that because of the unique impact of Brexit on Ireland, we should seek the chairmanship of that oversight group. I understand that the position has now gone to a Belgian civil servant. Does Ireland, at the least, have membership of the oversight group? If we do, who is on that committee to represent us?</p>
            <p eId="para_317"> I understand the Taoiseach is bringing a memo to Government next week on the issue of the Border and Brexit. Will the Taoiseach indicate to the House what exactly is envisaged in this paper and in broad terms what he might be telling the Cabinet? As I have said, the view last week of the frictionless Border as envisaged by the Taoiseach and the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom seems to be unobtainable if one listens to Mr. Lux, the former head of customs within the European Union.</p>

            <p eId="para_318">I will bring a memo to Government about the implications of Brexit, which will go beyond the specific issue raised by Deputy Howlin. We need to look at where our country is headed for the next five, ten and 20 years. That has implications in terms of Cabinet review of capital expenditure. There are the implications of the public consultation under way by the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, about what Ireland will be like in 2040 with an extra one million people, where they will live and work, how they will be transported from place to place and what kind of Ireland we are going to have. On Deputy Howlin's specific question, I will bring a memo to Government on Tuesday. I will make a statement on Wednesday and we will have the second all-island civic dialogue on Friday.

It is very well aware that one of the four priorities mentioned by him is specifically to deal with Northern Ireland and the implications of the current Border situation. I have made this perfectly clear to the British Government. Ireland is not going back to a situation where we have customs posts etc. on the hard Border. I have made the point that this would have serious consequences for us and could, without being any way alarmist about it, bring a return of some things that we do not want to ever see again in this country.</p>

            <p eId="para_325">The sectoral engagements are a very important part of the all-island civic dialogue. Indeed, the Taoiseach used the phrase "all-island" half a dozen times in his response to an Teachta Howlin. However, as far as I know, none of the sectoral meetings has taken place in the North, which is very disappointing. The Taoiseach indicated a meeting would be held in Newry, which I communicated to a lot of people in the town. Instead, the meeting took place in my constituency of Louth. I note an upcoming meeting on human rights and the Good Friday Agreement will take place in Kildare. Why can that meeting not be held in Derry, Enniskillen or Belfast? Why has the Taoiseach taken what is clearly a policy decision not to hold meetings in the North? Will that gap be filled?</p>
            <p eId="para_326"> The British Government White Paper on Brexit was published last week and contains many of the platitudes we have heard from the Taoiseach and Prime Minister May. It even refers to "the strength and support of 65 million people willing us to make it [Brexit] happen". Of course, both the Tory Government and the Taoiseach's Government are ignoring the majority remain vote in the North. The White Paper also claims the devolved Administrations are fully engaged in preparations to leave the EU. Leaving aside our own position in the North, we know from the devolved Administrations in Scotland and Wales this is not the case. When will the Government publish a White Paper setting out its strategy and objectives for the Brexit negotiations? The Taoiseach said he will make a speech on this, but I would like to know when we will see a White Paper.</p>

            <p eId="para_327">As everybody is aware, there is an election coming up in Northern Ireland. I do not want to be accused in any way of interfering with the electoral process by holding meetings throughout the North on the implications of Brexit for the Northern economy and North-South relations. That is a valid concern. There was an intention to hold a meeting in Newry, as the Deputy noted, but it was instead held in Dundalk. I assure the Deputy there is no wish not to have meetings in Northern Ireland, but I do respect there is an election process ongoing there.</p>
            <p eId="para_328"> I pointed out to Deputy Adams last week that at the meeting in Cardiff between the Prime Minister and the devolved assemblies, a plan for Scotland was presented by First Minister Sturgeon and a plan for Wales was presented by First Minister Jones, but no plan was presented for Northern Ireland. The Deputy's party is in the happy position that it does not have any responsibility at the moment because the Executive has collapsed. Instead, he can blame the British Government and the Irish Government, which is what he does.</p>

We do not have any of that now. I hope the Deputy can confirm he will work assiduously with whatever is the result of the Northern Ireland election to have an Assembly and Executive that will quickly work together to present agreed objectives and a plan for Northern Ireland's future beyond Brexit.

            <p eId="para_333">I have three points to make. First, people are effectively seeking to outdo each other in this House, among almost all the political parties, in claiming to be the most opposed to a hard Border. There is a constant exercise in outflanking and claims of being more concerned than anybody else about the impact of Brexit. Should we not, instead of playing politics with all of this, conclude that since nobody wants a return to a hard Border, we will simply put our foot down and say there will be no such return because we will not allow it? Ironically, it is the great internationalists in the European Union who most want to impose a hard Border. Their internationalism ends at the borders of Europe. My internationalism, on the other hand, goes way beyond the borders of Europe, whether in respect of the movement of people or goods. If the Taoiseach is serious about internationalism and democracy, he should say to his EU colleagues that we will not accept the imposition of hard borders or anything else that will impede the free movement of human beings and trade.</p>

            <p eId="para_339">Has the Taoiseach reflected on the potential, in the context of the structure of the peace process and the Belfast Agreement, for the development of a separate strand, among several strands, to deal with the issue of North-South relations on this island? Such a proposal was put forward by a former leader of the Labour Party and Tánaiste at the time, Dick Spring. It would serve the Taoiseach and the Irish position very well given our uniquely intertwined trade and other relationships with the UK and the issues between North and South. Will the Taoiseach consult on this proposal and give it due consideration?</p>
            <p eId="para_340"> Will the Taoiseach confirm that the person representing the Government on the team led by Michel Barnier, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, is a civil servant from the Republic of Ireland? Is that person a diplomat or trade expert, male or female? Will Taoiseach tell us who the person is and what previous position he or she has held in public or other service in this State?</p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T13:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_341">The British White Paper on Brexit that was published last week contains no clear blueprint for EU-UK relations and includes a range of contradictory objectives. However, there is more detail in it than in anything published by our Government thus far in respect of Ireland-UK relations. In an article published yesterday on RTE's website concerning the status of Ireland in the Brexit negotiations, Tony Connelly, drawing on his impressive range of contacts in Brussels, presents a picture that should cause alarms to go off. He says there is widespread acceptance of Ireland's difficult position but also growing annoyance at our failure to make concrete proposals. One source, he states, said: "Ireland has to start proposing solutions." That is exactly what we have been saying in this House in recent months. We appreciate there is a lot of activity going on, particularly at the level of officials, but we have no evidence whatsoever that the Government has developed specific proposals for dealing with the many diverse issues arising, with the only exception, perhaps, being in regard to the common travel area. Does the Government intend to publish a White Paper setting out a coherent set of objectives for the Brexit negotiations?</p>

            <p eId="para_345">The Deputy is the best person to outdo anybody else in here when he gets the chance. I remind him that the agreement between the Irish Government and the British Government is that there be no return to a hard Border or the borders of the past, however one wants to put it. That is an agreed position between the two Governments. Now it is about making it happen. All of this is an outcome of a vote by the UK electorate.</p>
            <p eId="para_346"> Deputy Burton made an important point. We have the all-island sectoral discussions and the first plenary session was assisted by everybody, including most of the political parties. The second plenary will take place on 17 February. Out of that may well come a basis for talking about a specific North-South strand, as referred to by the Deputy. Our economies, North and South, are very much intertwined. The Deputy asked for details of the official who is on the Barnier committee. I do not know the name but I will supply that information to the Deputy.</p>

As I said, the Barnier task force will not make any decisions. That is a function of the European Council, which will oversee that politically. I can confirm to the Deputy that the Barnier task force regards the Border and Northern Ireland as one of its top priorities and is proceeding on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_352"> On Deputy Micheál Martin's point, a raft of detailed options have been gone through in all the sectors I have already mentioned. The point I referred to in response to questions yesterday on the Lancaster House speech made by the British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, where she stated the United Kingdom has "no preconceived position" in respect of the customs union, is a particularly important issue because it will determine the nature of the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union from where Ireland will continue to negotiate. We have agreed on common travel. That also includes welfare, labour and residency issues, and North-South and east- west issues. We have agreed on the fact that one does not have a traditional border there. It is how one makes these things happen that is important.</p>

The committee addresses the climate change challenge in terms of domestic policy and in respect of Ireland's EU and international obligations. In addition, the committee drives the development and delivery of key infrastructure and associated policy, including oversight of relevant commitments in the programme for Government. I chair the Cabinet committee and the membership is comprised of the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality; the Minister for Finance; the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government; the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation; the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment; the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine; the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport; the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs; and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p>

            <p eId="para_369">I thank the Taoiseach for his response.</p>
            <p eId="para_370"> I attended the event of the launch of the national planning framework last week in Maynooth. I agreed with much of what the Taoiseach said about the need for the State to prepare and have a vision for the future, and to start taking the technological changes that are happening and advance them, and be in the lead, and create employment, create prosperity and create a better society in that process, but when it comes to the issue of climate change, nothing is happening in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_371"> The briefing notes on the climate mitigation plan came out last week and there is nothing new in it. There is no ambition.</p>
            <p eId="para_372"> Increasingly, all the analysis internationally is mentioning Ireland as a laggard. We are mentioned in the same breath as Poland. That is how bad it is now, internationally. We are one of only two countries which will not meet their 2020 climate targets. A report last week by the European Union states we will not meet our renewables targets. It will cost us a fortune, not only in fines but in missing out on the economic opportunity.</p>
            <p eId="para_373"> Following the national climate dialogue where the environmental community went to a previous climate meeting and presented a host of innovative initiatives as to how one could get dialogue going, they have heard nothing back. All we hear about is maybe some schools programme and some regional meetings - no ambition.</p>
            <p eId="para_374"> None of what the Taoiseach stated at the launch of the national planning framework about what we need to do is happening on climate. The whole system is effectively saying, "Do nothing, wait ten years and see what happens to the rest of the world and then we might do something." That is a big mistake.</p>

            <p eId="para_375">Deputy Eamon Ryan is wrong here. If the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment had not had his accident, I expect that the dialogue to which we committed following the Deputy's own attendance at the Cabinet sub-committee, which was a useful meeting, would be up and running by now. It is the Minister's intention fully to engage with the groups Deputy Eamon Ryan brought to that meeting to let them have their opportunity to contribute to this.</p>
            <p eId="para_376"> Perhaps the Deputy should meet the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment to have a full appraisal of the extent of what is going on in terms of the agenda and the complex discussions that are taking place about mitigation and reaching our targets, both here and at a Brussels level. I have a wealth of information here which I will not have time to outline for the Deputy now. Perhaps he should have a full appraisal with the Minister and afterwards, if the Deputy feels there are particular issues he wishes to pursue further, we would be happy to work with him.</p>

            <p eId="para_377">Every day we have new evidence of climate change and the detrimental effect it has on our environment and the rejection of all of this evidence by the new US Administration will clearly make the situation worse. The programme for Government refers to climate change being the global challenge of our generation. I appreciate that the Minister had an accident and I wish him well, but this goes before his cycling incident. The fact is the Government has not fulfilled the programme for Government commitment to extensive public consultation to incorporate the land use, infrastructural and economic issues in a long-term transition to a new low-carbon future. Almost a year after the Government was elected, there is still no sign of this. Can the Taoiseach tell us when we will see measures put in place? Can we also get some sense of when the national low-carbon transition and mitigation plan will be published? It was to be published within six months of the new Government being formed. That has not happened. Then there is the big concern that we will not meet our 2020 emission targets or 2030 emission targets. Can the Taoiseach update the Dáil on what is happening to all of these really important and critical issues?</p>

            <p eId="para_382">There is a review on the latter matter under way by the Minister at present and he will report to the House in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_383"> The national dialogue on climate change will gather representatives of civil society to discuss and maximise consensus on climate actions. The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government would hope that there will be a merger between the climate dialogue and the 2040 vision, which, I think, will be necessary. Obviously, it is envisaged that the dialogue will provide a mechanism to allow the mobilisation of strategic citizen and various group actions to address the climate challenges for Ireland. The briefing document, recently published, on the national mitigation programme and the statutory consultation to follow in mid-March are seen as a central part of the dialogue in terms of providing input on and, therefore, the prioritising and implementation of climate change policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_384"> The Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is preparing proposals for the climate change national dialogue. These will come before the next Cabinet committee and will inform members.</p>
            <p eId="para_385"> The national mitigation plan will represent a whole-of-Government approach involving significant cross-departmental involvement that sets out exactly what Ireland is planning to do to further our transition to a low-carbon climate resilient and environmentally sustainable economy and development of Ireland's first statutory national mitigation plan represents a hugely important step in this transition.</p>

            <p eId="para_386">In terms of infrastructure generally, it is clear that there is a broader issue here. The Government does not seem to have any imaginative or creative proposals to deal with the infrastructural bottlenecks and the necessary projects that will be required over the medium term. The previous capital plan was a five-year plan and in the first two years, very little happened because all of the funding was back-loaded to the last two. It got people through a general election. It seems to me that was its sole purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_387"> There is an issue in terms of the volume of funding available to get necessary works done. For example, the children's hospital is now estimated to cost €1 billion. Will that impact on other health infrastructure across the country?</p>
            <p eId="para_388">Will the Taoiseach clarify that? We were sold a pup years ago when Deputy Howlin said that the national lottery was being sold to fund the children's hospital.</p>

The Government has a clear picture of what it wishes to do. The Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance have set out the strategy for the mid-term capital review. The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, has started the national consultation on the vision for the country for 2040. The Deputy raised the Limerick to Cork motorway. That is the reason, on the opening of the European Investment Bank office in Dublin, we wish to consider a series of infrastructure projects such as that motorway-----</p>

Where a stream of income could potentially come from the metro or the Luas that will pay for those long-term, low interest loans from the European Investment Bank, that will provide another opportunity to deal with infrastructure that cannot be dealt with from the Exchequer reserves alone.

            <p eId="para_426">The licence to operate the lottery had to be tendered under European competition law. It was a matter of European law, as was explained in some detail. To get €410 million for it was good. Of that, there was €200 million for the national children's hospital, which was supposed to cost €400 million at the time. The other €200 million was spent on roads and schools, by re-establishing the summer works programme, at a time when we did not have a bob because Deputy Martin and his team had banjaxed the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_427"> I have two questions for the Taoiseach. I listened to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform speaking on national radio this morning. He appeared to indicate that the overshoot in the cost of the national children's hospital is to come from paring across the Government. Is that a fact, or is there to be a significant expansion of the capital programme?</p>

            <p eId="para_431">The Minister for Health will bring his business case to the Cabinet. It is not to be completed until 2021. The Deputy is correct. I distinctly remember him, when he was a Minister, bringing his memorandum to the Cabinet in accordance with proper procedures to deal with the lottery funding being made available to commence that project. Obviously, the capital expenditure review to be carried out in the middle of this year is part of being able to deal with essential projects such as this one. It may well be that in some departmental reflections some additional donations might be made for it-----</p>

This will be the biggest infrastructure project in the country for many years to come and it is not within the range of most construction firms. There will be a fixed price for this and it will be adhered to. I hear quotations just short of €1 billion, having risen from €450 million to €650 million and to €800 million and €900 million. Let us see what the business case states. However, this is one issue that will be dealt with and will proceed.</p>

            <p eId="para_435">A total of 1,578 files or file parts in respect of the year 1986 were transferred by my Department to the National Archives. They were then released for public inspection on 1 January 2017. Eight files were withheld in full.</p>
            <p eId="para_436"> The grounds for withholding records under section 8(4) of the National Archives Act 1986 are that it would be contrary to the public interest; or would or might constitute a breach of statutory duty or a breach of good faith on the grounds that they contain information supplied in confidence; or that it would or might cause distress or danger to living persons on the ground that they contain information about individuals or would or might be likely to lead to an action for damages for defamation.</p>

            <p eId="para_439">It is always intriguing when files are withheld because all of these files are of national interest. With regard to the eight files withheld, can the Taoiseach give an indication, even in broad strokes, of what subject matters they covered? Is the determination made by one official or is there an oversight or appeals system? The default position should be that they be released unless there is a very compelling case otherwise. Third, will the files ever be published? Once a single civil servant makes the determination, is that it for all time? Are they never to be accessible to posterity?</p>

            <p eId="para_440">The evaluation of the files is carried out by designated officials. In determining the release of files a balance must be struck between providing the most complete documentation possible and the section of the Act I mentioned. With regard to Northern Ireland files, it is normal that certain records containing sensitive security or personal information will be retained under section 8(4). After consultation with the National Archives a number of 70 year old files that were previously withheld under section 8(4) were released or are now eligible for release.</p>

I recently wrote to the Taoiseach following revelations that the British army and RUC special branch used waterboarding in the North during the 1970s. This was uncovered when the Pat Finucane Centre revealed that Government papers from London had revealed the use of waterboarding as a torture technique and that it continued after the British Government claimed it had ended. British Government files revealed that the then Taoiseach, Jack Lynch, raised a specific case with the British Prime Minister of the day, Ted Heath.</p>
            <p eId="para_448"> I have asked the Taoiseach to release the Government's minutes. We have only the British Government's version of the meeting. It is obviously in the public interest. Although it happened so long ago, it is an issue of current importance. I also urge the Taoiseach to ensure the Government undertakes a review of files in other Departments dealing with the North to identify any other information which may be available to the Government about the use of torture. Given that the Taoiseach of the day felt strong enough to raise the issue, one wonders what happened afterwards and whether it was pursued. How did the Government of the day and subsequent Governments deal with this important issue?</p>

            <p eId="para_449">It is very good that the State releases archives. It is probably the one centre in a democracy that has the capacity to release comprehensive archives. Not all actors in dramatic situations are in a position to release their archives or are disposed to do so. It is positive. Normally, the release of archives is a smooth operation. During recent years, for some reason, a new practice has emerged whereby it is preceded by an announcement by the Minister that the papers are on their way. It is like a Minister announcing that he or she is confident the sun will shine in the morning. It is a curious practice. It is the only political involvement.</p>
            <p eId="para_450"> The Taoiseach used the phrase "contrary to the public interest". At times, this can be a very subjective assessment. Deputy Brendan Howlin's question is reasonable. Surely, there must be a second opinion, maybe some time later, as to whether it is contrary to the public interest that files that are 70 years old are still not being released. Down through the years, there was a conservative approach in the public service generally to the release of files. To ease the concerns of historians and others who might feel they are missing out on some gems or particularly interesting nuggets of detail and information, a system of second opinion or further examination would be useful in determining whether something is contrary to the public interest or would lead to litigation in the event of archives being published.</p>

            <p eId="para_451">I too raise the interests of future historians and economists. The Central Bank wrote to the Houses asking that we destroy or return all records relating to the banking inquiry. At the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, I expressed the importance that the material be kept somewhere, whether in the Central Bank or the National Archives, to guarantee that in the future when people are looking back, they have access to all the material. Will the Taoiseach, through his Department, check with the Central Bank that it is happening? While I have no problem with the Houses destroying all the records, it is very important that there be a record somewhere, probably in the Central Bank or the Department of Finance, of such material. I am concerned that if we are destroying it, the material should exist somewhere else in archive.</p>

It cannot depend on the decision of one person. I am sure it is the case, and I will confirm this to the Deputies.

I take it that the Administration is following up on the Open Government Partnership initiative and is pursuing the issue of open data. For future archives, it is much more complicated to capture discussions between civil servants that are generated around meetings and interactions between Departments when they are in electronic form. I trust there is a very robust, world standard mechanism for capturing proper Government papers for the future that are now generated in electronic form.</p>

            <p eId="para_460">Since the beginning of the year, the leaking of reports has generated anxiety among staff and passengers who rely on Bus Éireann buses. Then, we realised that the Minister's predecessor was furnished with a cost-saving report more than 12 months ago. During that 12 months no action was taken by the Minister or his predecessor. One full year during which efficiencies could have been introduced has been wasted. What happened during the year and what does the Minister intend to do to ensure the viability and sustainability of Bus Éireann?</p>

            <p eId="para_461">I thank the Deputy for his question. Regarding the industrial relations issues at Bus Éireann, I have been clear in my calls for discussions between the two relevant parties, the management and trade unions, to commence immediately. I do not doubt that those discussions will be difficult.</p>
            <p eId="para_462">However, it is obvious that they must occur. As I clarified to the joint Oireachtas committee last week, I am of the view that those discussions should commence on the basis of no preconditions from both sides. If uncertainty exists in that context, then I would urge both parties to clarify their positions.</p>
            <p eId="para_463"> I can inform the Deputy there was no such report submitted to my Department in January 2016. As I previously informed the Deputy, during the course of 2016, Bus Éireann management worked on developing a business plan to address the loss-making situation in its commercial Expressway business. Several drafts of Bus Éireann's proposals were presented to my Department and NewERA – my Department's financial advisers – and were discussed during 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_464"> This type of interaction is entirely in line with the code of practice requirements regarding the preparation of business or strategic plans by a State body. As outlined in the code, the responsibility for the preparation, finalisation and adoption of such plans rests with the board of the relevant body, with an opportunity allowed for departmental consideration of draft proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_465"> It is incorrect to state that my Department rejected plans developed by the company. Those discussions between my Department and Bus Éireann did, however, highlight some critical shortcomings that existed in the draft proposals as presented. As the Deputy is aware, these shortcomings relate to the commercial rationale, financing, implementation, sensitivity and risk analysis, and the necessity to consider both state-aid and competition law interactions.</p>
            <p eId="para_466">

            </p>
            <p eId="para_467"> The Deputy is also aware that, in September 2016, the board of the company commissioned independent consultants, Grant Thornton, to review the company's proposals as developed during the year and to advise the board. Unsurprisingly, that review by the independent consultants for the board found similar shortcomings with the proposals as those identified previously when the proposals were considered by the Department and NewERA. The review also made recommendations to the board about an approach to finding a way forward. Therefore, arising from the board's consideration of the Grant Thornton advice, the company has now embarked upon developing a new plan to address the company's loss-making situation and restore it to a sustainable future, and the company aims to have this plan in a few weeks.</p>

            <p eId="para_468">I am shocked that the Minister now claims there was no report because he confirmed there was a report at a meeting of the Oireachtas committee last week. In fact, at this morning's meeting of the committee, I got a sense of hope, particularly in light of the fact that the Minister said he had checked the grammar and spell-checked the report of the RSA. It is Deputy Ross's duty as Minister to hold the board to account. I hope he will bring that level of authority to the board of Bus Éireann and hold it to account and get it to instruct the new CEO to enter negotiations without any preconditions, good, bad or indifferent.</p>
            <p eId="para_469"> I also hope the Minister will realise that it is not just the pay and conditions of the workers that are targeted to be slashed in the attempt to turn this company around. There has to be monumental structural change within Bus Éireann, of which the Minister is the sole shareholder and on which he has a major influence in terms of what structural changes and efficiencies can be derived.</p>

            <p eId="para_470">I thank Deputy Troy for his remarks. I think he misunderstood me. I will reread what I said as I do not think he heard it. I stated, "there was no such report submitted to my Department in January 2016". Many proposals were made and many reports were submitted at the time. Many reports were made to Bus Éireann management. There was no such report made to me in 2016. I did have proposals submitted to me for comment and observation but there was no report to me at the time in question. As the Deputy will know, NewERA did examine the situation and report to me. I also consistently had reports from the board.</p>
            <p eId="para_471"> The idea that I am not holding the board accountable is absurd. The board has been trotting up and down to my office - or the chairman certainly has been doing so. I have been in constant communication with people from Bus Éireann. I have met the new chief executive on at least two occasions already. The board - as would be the case with any such board - is being held to account by me, as the shareholder. Let there be no doubt about that.</p>

If so, what was their reply? What level of discussions has the Minister had? I accept that, in industrial relations terms, he cannot get involved personally. However, he can get involved is in the whole restructuring of Bus Éireann. What information has the new CEO brought to the Minister's attention in terms of how he intends to restructure Bus Éireann? Will there be any loss of rural services? Any proposal that comes from the CEO through the board to restructure Bus Éireann must be ratified by the Minister, as the shareholder. Does the Minister agree with that?</p>

The chair will, hopefully, have negotiations with the unions in the time to come. I talked to the chair, I asked him to be accountable for his stewardship and I asked him about his plans. The Deputy asked whether I told him there should be no preconditions. I have told him that publicly. It is an absurd question. I have said quite publicly to both the chairman and the unions to come to the table without preconditions. I do not need a quiet meeting on the side to tell them that.

            <p eId="para_478">The Deputy is aware of my stated and consistent position in this regard. I am fully aware of the problems faced by Bus Éireann and I am acutely sensitive to the fact 20 February is an important day in the calendar for Bus Éireann and its staff and workforce, to which the Deputy referred. The company must address the financial losses it incurs as a result of its loss-making Expressway services. Those services are commercial and receive no taxpayer funding, and the Deputy is aware of the reasons those services cannot receive taxpayer funding. The issues which must be addressed are internal to the company and are a matter for resolution between it and its employees.</p>

As I clarified to Deputy Munster last week, I am of the view that those discussions should commence on the basis of no preconditions from both sides and, if uncertainty exists, then I would urge both parties to clarify their positions.  Discussions can be facilitated by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and/or the Labour Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_480"> During last week's debates in the Dáil and at the joint Oireachtas committee, I clearly outlined the actions I am taking, such as ensuring adequately funded public transport services, as budgetary resources allow, assuring rural Ireland that the National Transport Authority will ensure continued public transport connectivity, and reviewing, in co-operation with the Minister for Social Protection, how best to ensure a sustainable funding model for the free travel scheme. In regard to this latter point, the Deputy will recall my clear statement to the joint Oireachtas committee last week that this in no way involves reducing the availability of free travel passes for senior citizens. The free travel scheme is an important scheme to which we remain totally committed.</p>

I asked the Minister to meet with all the stakeholders - the Department, the NTA, Bus Éireann and the unions - and he repeatedly refused. The letter that went out was deliberate, targeted and provocative. The Minister is asking the workers to accept up to a 30% cut in their average pay and for their current contracts to be changed completely. We all know the workers did not create this crisis. The most annoying and frustrating thing of all is that not once did either the Government or the NTA ever admit the real reason for this crisis. That was bad policy, poor decision making and gross underfunding. The Minister cannot be taken with any degree of seriousness until he publicly admits that was the cause of this crisis. I am asking the Minister, because he knows the chaos that lies ahead, to not play with words. We all know there were preconditions.

I ask her not to say I am asking the workers in the company to accept 30% cuts. I am asking nothing; I am making no comment on the demands of either side. The Deputy knows that and everybody else knows that. At this stage, I ask only that the unions and the management come together and talk without preconditions and to put me on one side or the other is wrong. I am not going to be drawn into this dispute on either side. The reason has been totally and utterly clear. For someone to come into this House and say I am asking something the management is asking is incorrect because I am not. It is wrong. I am not saying it is wilfully wrong but it is wrong.

            <p eId="para_485">To play this out as an industrial relations dispute is morally wrong to say the least. As I said earlier, the Minister was repeatedly asked for engagement of all the stakeholders and he repeatedly refused. I do not know if it has actually dawned on the Minister the chaos that will ensue on 20 February. Workers, commuters, college-goers, tourists and people right across the board, including those with hospital appointments, will be affected. The unions have said they will talk without preconditions. If the contents of the letter that was sent out are not preconditions, I do not know what is. It was an ultimatum where the workers were singularly targeted. There was no admission of bad policy. Until such time as the CEO of Bus Éireann agrees to meet the workers and set aside those inflammatory preconditions, programme or suggestions - whatever the Minister wants to call it - the management of Bus Éireann, the Minister and the Government will have to take direct responsibility for the chaos that ensues. The unions were blue in the face asking the Minister to engage with them even prior to this letter. It is still a game of playing with words. No preconditions my backside. What worker in their right mind would agree to a 30% cut when they did not cause the crisis?</p>

            <p eId="para_486">I cannot spell it out more clearly. Both sides have used those words. The Deputy is saying she does not believe one but she believes the other. I happen to believe both; I think they both genuinely mean what they say about this. I think this will lead to them talking at some stage. If people, either on the union or management side, have said what they want prior to coming together that is fair enough, but let them come to the table with a clean sheet. Let them come together and say what their position is. It will then be in the public arena and one cannot withdraw what one has said in the public arena. Before they sit down there should be no preconditions in the sense there is nothing to stop them coming to the table. That is all we are looking for. It is very simple. I can castigate either side for making demands in advance because it does not help the industrial relations situation. I will not do that because that is what has happened. Let them get down and talk to the Labour Court or the WRC now and forget about what they said in the past. It does not really matter. Much of this is just positioning.</p>

            <p eId="para_489">Following a review of the business case for the DART underground project and the recommendation of the NTA following that review, the Government decided in September 2015 not to activate the compulsory purchase order powers of the railway order for the project and, instead, to seek a new railway order for a lower-cost revised scheme. The NTA identified that the DART underground project could be redesigned to provide a lower-cost technical solution for the project, while retaining the required rail connectivity. That decision was informed by the fact that the business case for the DART underground project indicated that the tunnel was not economically justified on its own in the absence of the larger DART expansion programme. The DART expansion programme includes the tunnel link plus the extension of DART services to Drogheda, Maynooth and Hazelhatch, and has an overall cost in the region of €4 billion. Due to constraints on funding, not all elements of the DART expansion programme can be progressed during the lifetime of the current capital plan. Funding has been allocated for the extension of the DART to Balbriggan and for work on the redesign of the tunnel. Other elements of the programme will be considered in the context of the review of the capital plan this year. The NTA has commenced work on the redesign of the tunnel in collaboration with Irish Rail and will progress this redesign work in line with available funding. Currently a study to re-examine tunnel size options is nearing completion and the NTA will shortly commence an assessment of the optimum tie-in arrangements between the tunnel and the existing surface tracks on the Kildare line. Other work is also ongoing in respect of tunnel variants. That decision to prepare a lower-cost solution for the project remains valid and the NTA, together with Irish Rail, is committed to developing a more affordable project. The work previously undertaken on the project will have value when the redesigned project proceeds. I am informed by the NTA that all of the tunnel options under consideration at this stage envisage an underground station for the DART underground at or near to the existing Pearse Street station. </p>

            <p eId="para_490">We all agree massive challenges face the transport network here in the capital city. The DART underground has huge economic benefits that reach far beyond the greater Dublin area. It will link our southern and western rail lines with the DART and our eastern and northern rail lines and will more than double the capacity on the Maynooth and Kildare route, which will enable more frequent and reliable integrated rail service. It is a very worthwhile project. It must be acknowledged that €44 million has already been expended on securing the original rail order, which has been gone since September 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_491"> The Minister said he still considers the need for the station at Pearse Street. Why then has the proposed site for the Pearse Street station been sold to Rail Investments Limited? How will we continue to have the site, which the Minister, in his reply, stated will be necessary? How will that station be located in a site in which the State has sold its interest? </p>

I could write to the chief executive officer of Iarnród Éireann but he might reply more quickly to the Minister. That is not good enough. I would like to know how a situation could arise where the Minister said that this remains to be part of the overall vision for the DART underground, yet the location and the siting has been sold.

            <p eId="para_494"> The Minister said work on the redesign of the underground by way of a lower cost solution is progressing. When will that work be completed and when will it be at an advanced stage?</p>
            <p eId="para_495"> Has the Minister made any application to the Juncker fund, the €500 billion fund that is available from Europe for large-scale infrastructural projects, which is available at a reduced interest rate and would be of major benefit to a scheme such as the DART underground?</p>

            <p eId="para_496">I will try to update the Deputy on what is happening. In September 2015, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, recommended that the tunnel element of the DART expansion programme should not proceed as currently designed but should be redesigned, as recommended, to provide a lower cost technical solution. This project will cost in the order of €4 billion. It has to be designed and delivered in a way that best ensures cost effectiveness for the taxpayer and the State. Proceeding with the redesign of the tunnel element is the appropriate course of action in light of the NTMA's recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_497"> The new programme for Government includes a commitment to invest €3.6 billion across the lifetime of the capital plan, 2016-2022, to enable a number of transport projects to proceed and to fund additional capacity to meet existing and future commuter needs. The capital plan provides for the commencement of a multi-phase DART expansion programme, as recommended under the National Transport Authority's Transport Strategy for the Greater Dublin Area 2016-2034. The DART underground project, as currently designed, will not proceed but will instead be redesigned to provide for a more cost-effective tunnel. Funding has been provided under the capital plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_500">I thank the Deputy for his question. As he will note from our encounters here and at the Oireachtas joint committee, the responses I have been making on this matter have been consistent and fairly clear. The company is losing money and those losses must be addressed. The losses arise primarily as a result of the poor performance of its commercial Expressway services, services which do not, and indeed cannot, receive any taxpayer funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_501"> I have been equally clear in my calls for discussions to commence immediately between the two relevant parties, as I have done today in my answers to two other questions on the same subject. As I clarified to the Deputy last week, those discussions should commence on the basis of no preconditions from both sides, and if uncertainty exists as regards that basis, I urge both parties to clarify their positions.</p>
            <p eId="para_502"> On the issue of the subsidisation of public transport, the Deputy is aware that subsidies are only provided for socially necessary but financially unviable services and are not available for commercial services. I am committed towards increasing the level of taxpayer funding for public transport services as budgetary resources allow. That commitment is evidenced by the 11% increase secured in budget 2017, and I will be seeking to increase taxpayer funding of public transport services further in budget 2018.</p>
            <p eId="para_503"> Bus Éireann operates approximately 230 of these socially necessary but financially unviable services. These services operate in every county in the State, and last year around 32 million people travelled on such a service. I also note that in 2016, Bus Éireann received €40.8 million for the provision of those services, which represented a 21% increase when compared with 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_504">
              <i> Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_505"> However, any increase in funding provided must demonstrate to the taxpayer the value for money achieved and, in that regard, the National Transport Authority has an important role to play in its monitoring and enforcement of service levels and quality under the public services contracts entered into with operators.</p>

            <p eId="para_506">The Minister is the sole shareholder in Bus Éireann. We are 12 days away from a national bus strike which could spill over into a national public transport strike. The Minister said the same sterile mantras 12 days ago that he has repeated in the Dáil today. Will he be saying them in 12 days' time when a national bus strike will kick off? We need more than that.</p>
            <p eId="para_507"> I understand there is a village in his constituency called "Stepaside". It strikes me as apt because he seems to want to step aside from this entire controversy. He seems to be willing to allow Mr. Hernan to provoke a strike by demanding cuts of up to €8,000 for some workers. He seems to be willing, for the sake of €9 million, to put at risk the future of a company whose workers pay €59 million to the Exchequer in payroll taxes every year. Is he prepared to put aside the sterile mantras and the play-acting here in the House and act to deal with this crisis?</p>

            <p eId="para_508">To address the Deputy's supplementary on the subvention first, he will be aware that the subsidy in past two years increased and it is my intention to increase it even further in the coming years. I have no wish to see any loss of services to people throughout the country who need that subvention and connectivity. That particularly applies to rural Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_509"> I do not see what Stepaside has to do with this particular argument but somehow the Deputy has managed to include it in a way which I still cannot follow, but well done, it is to his credit. "No" is the answer to his question. I will not be intervening in an industrial relations dispute. How often does he have to ask me that question for me to give him the same answer? I am not going to be drawn in. I am not going to be producing the State's chequebook under any circumstances. That is not my role as a shareholder. It would be the worst move I could make.</p>

            <p eId="para_510">Bus Éireann now runs its Cork-Dublin services along the motorway. The towns that lost out between Portlaoise and Cashel are now served by private operators who are paid €440,000 a year for that work. Bus Éireann services from Dublin to Galway and Dublin to Waterford do not travel only on the motorway. If they travelled exclusively on it, it would cost the State between €2 million and €2.5 million every year to have the towns that would lose out serviced by private operators. Is the Minister prepared to recognise fully the social value of the work done by Bus Éireann and support payment in full for services performed by Bus Éireann in towns such as these?</p>

            <p eId="para_511">Deputy Barry accused me of repeating the same mantra. He is more repetitive than I am. It is quite extraordinary and that is quite an achievement. He has managed to bring Stepaside into it and has repeated the mantra as frequently as I have. That is pretty good going.</p>
            <p eId="para_512"> The answer to his question is the same as the one I have given him previously. Intervention is a matter for the National Transport Authority on detailed routes. It is not a matter for me. I am not going to intervene in any way, direct or indirect, in this dispute, which could draw me into a situation whereby I would be implicated in paying more money, producing more money or actually getting involved. The nitty-gritty of this is up to two parties and it will remain with two parties. It does not matter how often the Deputy asks me the same question in this House, he will get the same answer.</p>

            <p eId="para_515">I certainly cannot say the same thing to Deputy Clare Daly as I said to Deputy Barry. At least she takes a different angle in respect of the matter. I will not do what she would like me to do. I understand that people maintain that one person's precondition is another person's statement prior to getting down to talks. What I will do is ask both parties to be realistic and request that they not play with words or interpret one or the other's statements as preconditions. They know and I know that they will have to talk without preconditions sooner or later. To ensure that they are under no illusions, I say to them this: they are on their own on this one. They must behave like grown-ups, get in there and settle it. The machinery of the State is available. I will make it available to them 24-7 to resolve this problem, which, as many people eloquently outlined just recently, will cause untold damage, harm and hardship to many innocent travellers, innocent people in rural communities, the workforce and others. I will make that machinery available but I will not be proactive in policy areas in this situation.</p>

            <p eId="para_516">The reality is that workers at Bus Éireann provide 40,000 services per week. They have had to endure essentially a pay freeze since 2009, when they were actually promised a pay increase of 6%. I note the Minister's statement that nobody should go into these talks with preconditions, but the reality is that Bus Éireann management has said that much of the savings it seeks will come off the back of the workforce. I wish to talk to the Minister about this workforce through the eyes of one of my constituents. He says that he is paid €624 per week, gross, for a 39-hour week. However, anybody employed after him is only paid €539. Some working days are in excess of 12 hours, rarely all of it paid time. There can be unpaid breaks of up to two hours and 45 minutes during the day. These could be well away from the home depot. They work about nine Sundays in every 14 shifts, which is a concern in terms of rest times, bringing back buses and so on. To unilaterally impose cuts on what are already hard-pressed working conditions is unacceptable. While I note the Minister's statement that good sense should prevail, is there anything he thinks he could do to facilitate some type of forum? He says the industrial machinery is there but it is not adequate to get over this notion of preconditions, which is seriously unhelpful.</p>

            <p eId="para_517">Perhaps I can be helpful in some ways. I accept that, in policy terms, the Government has a role as the shareholder. I have said this before and I will say it again if it is at all helpful: I will not, prior to this dispute being settled, assemble a forum because it would only become dragged into the dispute. However, I make it quite clear that once the industrial relations dispute is over, I am very happy to meet all the stakeholders to discuss what they maintain are the policy issues, which are undoubtedly felt deeply, with which many people have sympathy and to which the stakeholders allude so often. I will not do so during the dispute, but afterwards.</p>

            <p eId="para_518">I think that will be absolutely necessary. The backdrop to the current crisis and the cuts that are set to be imposed on workers is, in part, a result of the reduction in the public service obligation, PSO, subvention, one of the key reasons Bus Éireann has run into problems. While the Minister has said openly that he does not believe either party should be involved in going into this immediate crisis with preconditions - I think all of us would echo that - they need to get together and try to sort it out. In the longer term, we absolutely need a forum to provide a platform that will ensure some sort of long-term vision and plan for all our public transport which can be put in place without the constant threat to the wages and conditions of bus workers, who are pretty much hard up against it. They do not live luxurious lifestyles or anything like that, and the prospect for them and their families of this crisis is not helpful. I think the longer-term facilitation would be welcome, but in the meantime the Minister could and should do what he can in the face of the immediate crisis.</p>

            <p eId="para_519">Let me make this clear. It probably would be helpful. I am not sure of the merits of it but I am prepared to give it a try. I am certainly not, as some people would portray me, in any way opposed to meeting the unions. I am very happy to meet them but not in the midst of an industrial dispute for reasons to which I have already alluded. Let me make it clear to them again that they should come along, we should meet, they should go to the WRC or the Labour Court tomorrow, meet the management and settle their problems. I will meet them the day after and will get all the stakeholders together if they so wish and we will discuss those other issues which are not pertinent to the industrial dispute. If that helps, that is fine. I will be interested in their response.</p>

            <p eId="para_523"> Proposals to deliver an upgraded route linking Dundalk to Sligo, taking in Cavan, involve linking elements of the national road network and regional roads along as direct a route as possible. Essentially, the route involves upgrade or realignment works on the regional routes from Dundalk to Cavan and on national routes from Cavan to Sligo. The latter would involve a route that passes through Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_524"> Regarding the national element, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, I have responsibility for overall policy and funding regarding the national roads programme. The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2015, in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_525"> As regards the regional road aspect of the proposal, the improvement and maintenance of regional and local roads in its area is a statutory function of local authorities in accordance with the provisions of section 13 of the Roads Act 1993.  Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources, supplemented by State road grants.</p>
            <p eId="para_526"> The capital plan published in September 2015 provides for the gradual build-up in expenditure on the maintenance and improvement of the road network over a seven-year period. The bulk of the money involved is scheduled to be spent on maintenance of the road network with some limited investment in new projects.  My Department has provided funding to Cavan County Council, acting as lead authority with Monaghan and Louth county councils, with over €2 million in the period 2007 to 2014 to progress the regional road element of the project to preliminary design.  At an estimated cost of €150 million, unfortunately, it was not possible to include the east-west link in the capital plan.</p>

            <p eId="para_527">In my area of east Cavan, there is a high level of industry. We have Abbott, Lakeland Dairies and Cartons, all of which are hugely dependent on good road infrastructure. The Minister talked about the local authorities and Revenue going to them. My own local authority has been down significant funds over the past years. I take account of the fact that the Minister is new to his position and that this is not his fault. However, the local authority is down at least 50% in the investment that has been made by Revenue into our local authority. Therefore, the money is not currently with the local authority. The N3 has brought great benefits to Cavan and the surrounding area. It has opened up Bailieborough, Kingscourt, Virginia and Cavan town.</p>
            <p eId="para_528">The access has been of huge economic benefit. This new east-west link, if it was to progress, would offer huge benefits also to west Cavan. Not too long ago I attended a committee meeting at which we discussed the exodus of young people and business from west Cavan because of the lack of infrastructure such as roads. This is an opportunity for the Minister.</p>

            <p eId="para_529">I see the Deputy's point but it goes back to funding. That is the problem and a compelling case has to be made if anything of that nature is to qualify for funding. I would very much like to help the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_530"> The National Roads Authority procured consultants in 2001 to carry out a strategic study of the development of an east-west link road. The consultants were to report on the merits and demerits, if any, of such a route with a recommendation for a preferred route corridor or corridors. The report concluded that an east-west link route was viable and justified and concluded the most feasible solution was to make use as much as possible of the existing network of roads. The stated objectives of the project were to address the deficiency in the transport network in the region and help connect the local population to the gateway town of Dundalk, the hub town of Cavan and the key transport corridors. These objectives were highly laudable, to reduce the travel times and improve access to regional, national and international markets as well as education, employment and other services and to deliver an improved road network in a cost-effective manner while minimising adverse environmental impact.</p>

            <p eId="para_531">This is important infrastructure and, as the Minister said, the cost it would incur would be approximately €150 million. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, recently announced €2 billion in additional capital spending. Would the Minister put in some representation for us in Cavan-Monaghan because we are fed up being left behind when it comes to roads, a very basic piece of transport network? We do not have railway or the broadband we would like to have. We depend solely on the road infrastructure in our area. We have wonderful indigenous business and small and medium enterprises in that area. People rely on their own resources to establish businesses and provide employment. The only way we can encourage and harness that is by having the infrastructure we need. I urge the Minister to do anything he can to bring further investment into Cavan-Monaghan, particularly with this east-west corridor that is so badly needed.</p>

            <p eId="para_533">The Minister rightly referred to the strategic study undertaken in the early 2000s that identified the potential of the route and the need for it to run through Sligo, Manorhamilton, Enniskillen, Belturbet, Cavan and Cootehill. In the meantime, the Cavan and Belturbet bypasses were constructed. They are integral parts of this route. In 2009, Cavan County Council, as the lead local authority, along with Monaghan and Louth county councils, appointed consultants with specific reference to the part of the route relating to Cavan, Cootehill, Shercock, Carrickmacross and Dundalk. Substantial money has already been spent on planning and design.</p>
            <p eId="para_534"> We will all go around in circles attending meetings about Brexit and the challenges it poses. The Minister needs funding to bring infrastructure up to a standard, particularly in the Border region where, for historical reasons, there was under-investment due to the Troubles on our doorstep. If our industries are to have any chance of remaining competitive with the particular challenges facing us in the Border area due to Brexit, we need modern infrastructure. People will ask what the Government should do in advance of Brexit. One thing it should do is make additional investment in necessary infrastructure to try to assist enterprises that already exist and create very valuable employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_535">I thank Deputies Niamh Smyth and Brendan Smith for their special pleading, which is perfectly legitimate. This is what happens all the time, particularly in respect of roads. I do not want to give them any encouragement because the constraints on the purse are so huge but I understand the real problems in the Border areas, particularly in the light of Brexit. The Deputies have made a good case but, as I said, there is no provision in the capital plan for the east-west scheme. It is open to individual local authorities to progress the upgrade of sections of the route from their own resources. While the Deputies might query whether this project will be considered in the capital plan review in light of Brexit there are no proposals at present to do so given that the overall funding available under the review is limited to €2.65 billion across all sectors. The most that can be said is that while available funding is not sufficient to address all the demands for improvement schemes, including schemes such as the east-west link by the end of the capital plan period, capital funding for the road network is expected to be back up to the levels needed to support maintenance and improvement works. At that stage there will be more scope to consider projects such as the east-west link on a phased basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_537">This question relates to previous ones regarding the transposition of EU Directive 598/2014 on airport noise, a measure put forward, ironically, to benefit communities afflicted by airport noise but which is being met by the communities around Dublin Airport with some concern because the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, plans to use this vehicle to overturn the existing conditions which will restrict night time flights on the new runway. Where do matter stand regarding the statutory instrument or primary legislation that will be necessary to give effect to this?</p>

            <p eId="para_538">On 22 September last, I announced details of the manner in which EU Regulation 598/2014, on the establishment of rules and procedures with regard to the introduction of noise-related operating restrictions is to be implemented in Ireland. As I explained previously, this will require the introduction of a statutory instrument, which will see the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, as the designated competent authority to oversee the shift towards a more prescriptive approach to noise management at Dublin Airport, in line with European and international civil aviation standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_539"> Before the IAA as competent authority makes any decision about noise-related operating restrictions at the airport, there will be an obligation for full public consultation and all stakeholders will be able to give their views. The IAA will have to organise consultation processes, including with local residents and local businesses, in a timely, substantive, open and transparent manner. All interested parties will be given at least three months to submit comments every time a change in the operation restrictions is proposed.</p>
            <p eId="para_540"> All obligations concerning environmental impact assessments will be met in relation to the impacts of airport noise. There will also be extensive collaboration with relevant stakeholders including An Bord Pleanála, the Environmental Protection Agency, the relevant planning authority, the airport operator and the air navigation service provider.</p>
            <p eId="para_541"> Officials in my Department are currently engaged with the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel in order to finalise the details relating to the statutory instrument which will transpose EU Regulation 598/2014. This is a complex area of work and one which requires a great deal of consideration with the aim of achieving an efficient and comprehensive regulatory regime for noise management at airports. The timing and extent of the primary legislation required will be guided by the advice received by Attorney General's Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_542"> Given that legislation on this topic will be of interest to the House, especially to Deputies living in the vicinity of Dublin Airport, I intend, as previously offered, to present my plans for any primary legislation to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport, at the earliest possible opportunity.</p>

            <p eId="para_543">We are running in circles to stand still because my question was when might that happen and I am still none the wiser. The Minister laid great emphasis on the delivery of a statutory instrument to deliver these changes. In the final part of his reply, however, he referred to primary legislation. When we raised this matter previously, primary legislation was deemed to be required. When we inquired about the position in recent months, we were informed that the Attorney General was examining it. I am not sure about the Attorney General's productivity output but the Minister should ask her to get a move on because the people in the area are seriously concerned. Kevin Toland from the DAA addressed a conference last week and made it abundantly clear that the intention is to overturn the two conditions to restrict night-time flights contained in the planning permission relating to the new runway.</p>
            <p eId="para_544">That is a no-go area for residents, who want to know what power their elected representatives will have to make an input into this process before it is handed over to the Irish Aviation Authority. I am still none the wiser. When will the statutory instrument be considered by the joint committee? Can we say with certainty that primary legislation will be needed as well?</p>

            <p eId="para_545">The Deputy has a point about the delay. I regret the delay, which has arisen because the legal aspects of this matter are being looked at. I said I hoped to have it done by the end of the year. It is now five or six weeks late. I suppose in some ways it is indicative of the fact that the Office of the Attorney General is determined to ensure the rights of the people represented by Deputy Clare Daly are not infringed and are protected. I have always been determined to ensure the State monopoly does not ride roughshod over the rights of anyone, particularly the residents to whom the Deputy has referred. I hope this delay will be ended very shortly. I asked about it in preparation for Deputy Daly's question when I learned it was coming up. Primary legislation will be needed to alter the Planning and Development Acts to allow An Bord Pleanála and the Irish Aviation Authority to work together at the airport in future. It is not a major issue. I think there will be a statutory instrument. The legislation is not as urgent as the statutory instrument. When both of them come through, I will bring them to the House or the joint committee.</p>

            <p eId="para_546">I am glad the Minister has recognised that the residents are facing huge uncertainty. It strikes me, not for the first time, that we might need a new Attorney General and a bit of an improvement on the homework brigade. The Minister has repeatedly given a commitment that the rights of the local community will not be reduced by the DAA. He has said there will be a consultative forum with the Irish Aviation Authority in the transposition of this directive. I wonder whether the forum group that represents the broad scale of the residents' groups in the area might be given a seat on the board or around the table during the consultation process. The Minister and all the local representatives have previously met members of the combined St. Margaret's group. Is he aware that the residents are having great difficulty in getting the daa to deliver on some of the homes that need to be bought out? I know the Minister has repeatedly put on the record his commitment to consultation with the local community. We are looking for some indication that this will be followed through in the statutory instrument and the primary legislation. Once that is in, the residents will be able to kiss goodbye to any form of autonomy or say.</p>

Will primary legislation be required as well? It appears from the programme of legislation due before the Oireachtas, as published at the start of every session, that primary legislation in this regard is promised for later this year. I share Deputy Daly's concern about the need to ensure there is due process for the residents who live in close proximity to the airport. However, there is also an urgent need to get the second runway at Dublin Airport, which is critical infrastructure, commenced and built in the interests of economic development and tourism. It is regrettable that the Minister is not in a position to give a more concrete reply regarding what is needed and when it will be implemented.</p>

            <p eId="para_549">Deputy Troy is right when he says there is a need for urgency. We need to get the second runway going because the airport is running at close to full capacity and could be running over capacity if we are not very careful. While I absolutely accept the need for urgency, I emphasise that there are conflicting rights here. Obviously, the Irish nation has the right to have a fully working economy and needs an airport that is working at capacity for those purposes. Residents also have rights, however, for example with regard to the noise issues. The delays in this regard have been caused by those conflicting rights. I assure the House that I understand the urgency in this regard. I am aware of it on a daily basis. I have made it quite clear that primary legislation will be introduced in alteration of the Planning and Development Acts to regularise the relationship between An Bord Pleanála and the Irish Aviation Authority. There will almost certainly be a statutory instrument as well. We are waiting to hear from the Attorney General on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_550"> Deputy Daly has proposed the novel idea that consumers and activists who are not part of the great and the good in these State monopolies should automatically be parachuted from on high onto State boards. Although I have made a suggestion in my new plan for appointments to State boards, I am not making any promises in this regard. I think there is a case for allowing ordinary consumers who use these services of organisations like the DAA and the Road Safety Authority, or are involved in a different way in these areas, to be put on the boards of such bodies. Vacancies on the board of the DAA will come up shortly. I will consider advertising in public for the users of these services to get involved. I am not making any promises with regard to political activists. I am not sure that would necessarily be-----</p>

            <p eId="para_558">I understand the director of the Road Safety Authority, RSA, was in the House this morning. Since 2013, the authority has been responsible for administering driving licences through the National Driver Licence Service, NDLS. According to figures that were released in 2015, approximately 96% of drivers who are disqualified in court do not surrender their licences. <i>The Irish Times</i> recently reported on RSA figures that show "there are almost 8,000 drivers on Ireland’s roads who have multiple concurrent disqualifications on their licences but continue to flout the law by driving". I have asked the Minister about this matter previously. As he knows, it was the subject of an amendment I tried to move during the recent debate on the Road Traffic Bill 2016. The information technology systems used by the courts, the RSA and the Garda need to be closely aligned if we are to eliminate the huge lacuna in information on driving licences that seems to exist at present. This is a particular problem for the Garda.</p>

            <p eId="para_559">I thank Deputy Broughan for his important question, which relates to an issue that needs to be addressed. I think the failure to co-ordinate information sufficiently is having an adverse effect on road safety. The licensing master plan that is to be introduced, as the Deputy knows, will assist in the fight against road deaths. The RSA is the licensing authority with responsibility for the NDLS, which commenced operation on 29 October 2013.  Some 556,439 driver licence applications were received in 2016.  The NDLS is an umbrella entity that encompasses three independent contractors - a front office, a back office and a card producer - which deliver distinct services resulting in the production of the plastic card licence.  The presence of three separate entities adds to the complexity of the service. Handover issues among the three entities can lead to challenges in managing the NDLS contracts. These challenges were managed in 2016 and as a result, there is now a more streamlined approach between the three entities.</p>
            <p eId="para_560"> The penalty points system for driving offences was introduced in Ireland on 31 October 2002. Penalty point offences are recorded on a driving licence record if an individual is convicted of a driving offence that attracts penalty points. In the case of a fixed-charge notice for an alleged offence that attracts penalty points, the driver can opt to pay the fine rather than having the matter referred to the courts. Penalty points are endorsed on a driver record by the Department's national vehicle driver file, which is the record of fact for driving licences, on the direction of An Garda Síochána or the courts.  When notification is received from An Post or the Courts Service, the appropriate points are recorded on the driving licence record.</p>
            <p eId="para_561">Since the introduction of the penalty points system, there have been two primary reasons penalty points cannot be applied. These are that the penalty point offence record received from the Garda or Courts Service did not include a valid driver number or the offenders were the holders of foreign driving licences.</p>

The criminal justice working group recommended that integration of the vehicle and driver database components of the national vehicle and driver file, NVDF, system to assist with an optimum allocation of penalty points. It was proposed to create a system to link driving licence holders with one or more vehicles through an NVDF master licence record, MLR. The MLR programme team is investigating the options for populating the MLR electronically at various stages of the vehicle life cycle, including vehicle registration, motor tax renewal, insurance renewal and change of ownership.</p>

There could be several recorded dates of birth for a person and different addresses. Unlike the Police Service of Northern Ireland, we do not have roadside hand-held devices.</p>
            <p eId="para_565"> I also asked the Minister about the process whereby the Road Safety Authority, RSA, and An Garda Síochána work together to establish the validity of a driving licence number and the number of inquiries received by the RSA. I notice the information sent by the Minister indicates there were just 1,268 Garda inquiries to the RSA in 2014, 1,425 in 2015 and 1,712 in 2016 and January 2017. As the Minister knows, these seem to be very low numbers considering the number of speeding cases before the courts around the country between January 2015 and October 2016, which yielded 14,572 convictions but just 6,165 had their licences recorded. There is a lacuna. I note this morning the Minister indicated he would introduce three or four new pieces of legislation. Why does he not address this issue once and for all? We could have done it in the road traffic Bill but we did not. I urge the Minister to take action. We must have a very clear stream of information.</p>

            <p eId="para_566">We intend to address the issue in legislation this year. Although I probably will not be around for it, I have an ambition to introduce a master licence record of a very sophisticated nature. Maybe it will not be this year. Information on that will be available and checkable on one record or computer system. That will include vehicles, drivers, licences, insurance, tax, national car tax and all those elements in order that they can be compared immediately. The Deputy knows one of the current problems is even the vehicle and driver element do not talk to each other, which makes detection very difficult for gardaí. I see no reason for this somewhat antediluvian system, which obstructs detection and prevention of accidents and fatalities, not being amalgamated into one driver file. It is my ambition to do that and the Deputy would share that view.</p>

            <p eId="para_567">I welcome the Minister's comments and he brought forward the road traffic Bill. We are also discussing the section 44 issue in the Courts (No. 2) Bill at the moment. There is a major deficit of information. I asked the Road Safety Authority about the information for when drivers informed it of a change of address or other change of details to the ten-year driving licence. I am still waiting for that. In the UK the legislation has a fine of up to £1,000 for failing to inform the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency of a change of address. There are major actions that could be taken via legislation or statutory instrument to progress this. I have asked many times if the RSA has successfully undertaken a matching exercise to match a conviction with a specific driving licence when a licence number was not recorded in court on conviction. I have been waiting for that information for the past number of months. It is a critical area if we are to make an impact on the horrendous figures for last year, when 188 people died on the roads.</p>

            <p eId="para_574">Thank you. There are many holes that need to be plugged. It is quite staggering how the records on insurance - who is insured or not - are a shambles. As I am sure the Deputy is aware, under a system abandoned in 2014, people were coming up in the automatic number plate recognition system as being uninsured when they had just changed insurance companies. Perhaps that is one of the reasons we have such a huge estimate for the number of uninsured people in the country. Perhaps it is correct but the figure was 150,000 at one stage. That may be a result of the fact that the collection of information is so flawed. The Deputy mentioned people changing addresses and that we do not know where people live in certain circumstances. That could be addressed and we will address it with a great deal of urgency not just in legislation but also by encouraging the various State agencies in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_576">Towards a National Planning Framework is an excellent document that identifies a number of elements, including the importance of the transition to a low-carbon society. It mentions a number of cities, including Galway, which could be exemplars of low-carbon living through more sustainable mobility and energy efficiency. In this context I ask the Minister to make a statement about the intolerable position in Galway, which has 96,000 vehicles at any given peak time. That is rising by 2,000 vehicles daily.</p>

            <p eId="para_577">I thank Deputy Connolly for her question. As Minister, I have responsibility for policy and funding relating to public transport. Traffic management in Galway and other cities is the responsibility of the relevant local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_578"> I am advised by the National Transport Authority, NTA, that a transport strategy for Galway city was prepared by the National Transport Authority in partnership with Galway City Council and Galway County Council during 2016. That transport strategy set out an overall framework for the development of transport infrastructure and services in Galway city and its environs over a 20-year period. The strategy has been included in the new city development plan, which was adopted by the city council and came into force on 7 January 2017. I understand the transport strategy sets out the ambition for a vibrant city centre with through traffic rerouted around the central core area and improved pedestrian and cycling facilities. It also provides for an enhanced bus network, the development of park and ride sites at suitable locations and the construction of the Galway city outer bypass. Overall, the strategy represents a coherent and integrated set of proposals aimed at addressing the transport needs of the city and its surrounding areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_579"> With regard to congestion issues at Parkmore, I am told that Galway City Council, funded through the NTA under my Department's regional cities grant programme, has appointed a design team to examine options for possible short-term actions to address access into the business park, in addition to identifying a longer-term solution. Proposals for short-term interventions will be identified and assessed by the council by the end of February. Depending on the funding implications, I understand it may be possible to commence some of the smaller measures during 2017. It will be later in 2017 before the longer-term proposals are available. The funding requirement for the longer-term proposals is likely to be significant, and this will have to be examined in the overall budgetary context.</p>

            <p eId="para_580">I am disappointed with the answer as the Minister has a very important role in climate change mitigation measures. There is a proposal in Galway to go ahead with a project that will cost €600 million for 16.5 km of road that cannot be built in the near future. The outer bypass has already hit a cul-de-sac and we are going down a second one. We are failing in Galway and we need Government direction to say these projects are not complying with Government policy on sustainable development and a transition to a low-carbon economy. In the long and short term, it will cost the Government money. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has pointed this out and the Stern report from way back in 2006 also pointed it out.</p>
            <p eId="para_581">It is really time to show leadership. This is a golden opportunity for Galway to lead the way with sustainable transport. In my view, that is light rail, but I am open to bus transport or a combination of same. We need leadership from the Government on this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_582">The N6 Galway city ring road is a component of the Galway transport strategy. It is being managed by Galway County Council on behalf of the city and county councils. The proposed N6 Galway city road comprises 11.8 km of dual carriageway between the existing N6 at Coolagh to the existing Ballymoneen Road and then continues as a single carriageway.</p>
            <p eId="para_583"> The planning and route selection process for the N6 started in 2014 following the successful legal challenge related to the interpretation of the habitats directive of the earlier An Bord Pleanála decision. The scheme business case is under preparation by Galway County Council for submission to this Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. In view of the successful legal challenge to the previous scheme on environmental grounds, confirmation across departments of support for the project is likely to be sought once the business case and cost benefit analysis have been assessed. For a project of this scale, the requirements in the public spending code and the Department's capital appraisal framework mean that Government sign-off on the project will be required.</p>

            <p eId="para_584">I am unsure whether the Minister is aware of it, but the road he is referring to cannot be built within the coming five to seven years, even with the best will in the world. The road covers 16.5 km at a colossal price of €590 million, in addition to the €40 million already spent.</p>
            <p eId="para_585"> The proposed road project has now frozen two thirds of the 18 ha of residential zoned land bought at the height of the Celtic tiger. Two thirds of the 18 hectares of land purchased by Galway City Council is now frozen in a city with a major housing crisis. All of this is being done for a road that will lead to increased emissions rates and is not in compliance with Government policy to transition to low carbon.</p>
            <p eId="para_586"> I appeal to the Minister to show vision for Galway city and to lead the way in sustainable transport. Even if the road was the solution, it cannot be built in the near future. We need to lift 96,000 vehicles off the road in addition to the congestion at Parkmore. Over 6,000 people are employed there and approximately the same number of cars emerge from the industrial estate at peak times every day. This is directly as a result of bad planning.</p>

            <p eId="para_597">I thank Deputy Kelly for tabling this topical, useful and relevant question. The cost of the recruitment process is a matter for the organisation in question. In this case, the National Tourism Development Authority, Fáilte Ireland, did not require or seek my approval for costs associated with the recruitment of the new chief executive officer. This is a matter for the authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_598"> I will set out some background. The consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform to fill the chief executive post was sought by my Department with sanction being received early in 2016. This sanction was subject to a number of conditions, including the condition that the filling of the post be by means of an open competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_599"> The legislation underpinning the authority does not require it to use the Public Appointments Service for this. Likewise, the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, recently revised, does not require PAS to be used.</p>
            <p eId="para_600"> Following consideration by the authority, it was decided to undertake the recruitment process through a private recruitment firm rather than through the Public Appointments Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_601"> The authority has assured me that the search and selection processes undertaken were robust and thorough. Moreover, it has assured me that all candidates went through the same rigorous transparent process and were dealt with in a fair manner.</p>

Actually, it was done in April and the Minister took up office in May. I would have expected that someone who chased these issues from the seats above not so long ago would have stopped this process and ensured that the PAS was used.</p>
            <p eId="para_607"> I have several questions for the Minister. Was it a good use of taxpayer money to waste €58,000, seeing as the authority could have used PAS? Does the Minister expect all the agencies under his Department to use PAS in future? Will the Minister oblige those agencies to save taxpayer money by using PAS? Will Fáilte Ireland be using PAS in future? Under the process signed off by the Department, why did the Minister not have confidence in anyone from his Department, for example, the Secretary General or the relevant assistant secretary, both of whom I know and support? Did the Minister not have sufficient confidence in these people to allow them to sit on the interview panel?</p>

            <p eId="para_608">Of course the authority could have used the Public Appointments Service. Fáilte Ireland was perfectly at liberty to do so. However, the authority is also at liberty to go outside PAS. It is not necessarily always the right course to go through PAS. If an organisation is looking for a particular type of person, it could use an agency specialising in that area.</p>
            <p eId="para_609"> We leave these things to the agencies. That is the point. That is why we have a board and chairman. That set-up allows the authority to make these selections. The board, chaired by Michael Cawley, in whom I have great confidence, decided that it wanted to go to an outside recruitment company. It is perfectly legitimate for the board to make that decision. The board knows it will cost money from the budget. The board may take the view that it represents value for money. If that is the view of the board, then I am satisfied that it can proceed in that way. PAS exists for a specific purpose. It is to be used in the vast majority of cases, although not all cases. It is a matter of discretion for the chairman in respect of what route he goes. That is fine.</p>

            <p eId="para_610">I would appreciate if the Minister answered the questioned I asked. He did not say he has confidence in PAS.</p>
            <p eId="para_611"> I raised this issue previously. At the time, the Minister had not even met representatives from Fáilte Ireland. It took the Minister six months or so to meet representatives from Fáilte Ireland. Under the Acts, the authority has to get the Minister to sign off on the chief executive and the procedure. Fáilte Ireland brought this to the Minister but he had not even met representatives from Fáilte Ireland at that stage. I do not have confidence in the process conducted.</p>
            <p eId="para_612">Fáilte Ireland is actually advertising positions on PAS now. It seems to have changed its belief system in terms of how it goes about recruitment, which is very interesting. </p>
            <p eId="para_613"> As a former journalist and a former Opposition Member, Deputy Ross would have waxed lyrical about the waste of money that is going on here. Ultimately, Fáilte Ireland is funded by the taxpayer and it is wasting €58,000 on a recruitment process that can be done professionally and as well, if not better, by PAS. Does the Minister have confidence in PAS? Will it be used by the other agencies or is the Minister going to continue to allow the waste of taxpayers' money when we have a perfectly good process that is used by almost everyone else in the public system?</p>

I have absolutely no reason not to put them in positions of authority and responsibility and I will continue to do so, where it is appropriate. I also have full confidence in PAS. That said, it is case of horses for courses. In some instances, it is useful while, in others, it is more appropriate to go elsewhere. I have full confidence in the chairman of Fáilte Ireland as well. Indeed, I have full confidence in everybody the Deputy has mentioned so far. To suggest that I am, undermining these systems in some way is incorrect. All I am saying, very simply-----</p>

            <p eId="para_619">39. <b>Deputy Mick Barry</b> asked the <b>Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport</b> his views on the impact of President Trump's executive order banning refugee entry and the entry of persons from seven named states into the United States on the pre-clearance service at Dublin and Shannon airports; the practical co-operation authorities here would have to provide to facilitate such entry refusals; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_620">My question relates to the executive order in the US and the travel ban. This might seem to be less of a burning issue now in light of the federal court's decision to strike down the order. However, the question still stands and I would like the Minister to answer it, particularly given El Presidente's determination to get his way. The fact that he has tilted the numbers on the US Supreme Court means that this may well become a very live issue again quite soon. I ask the Minister to reply in that light.</p>

            <p eId="para_621">I thank Deputy Barry for his question. I do not think it is irrelevant; it is a good question. I strongly disagree with the policy recently announced by President Trump to temporarily ban travel to the US by nationals of certain countries. As Deputy Barry knows, there is currently a suspension in place for this executive order, which is the subject of an appeal at a US federal appeals court, the outcome of which is awaited.</p>
            <p eId="para_622"> The pre-clearance facilities at Dublin and Shannon airports are within Irish jurisdiction and the laws of Ireland apply at all times. This is expressly confirmed at Article II(5) of the pre-clearance agreement. Given the fact that US law does not apply, provision is made at Article II(6) of the agreement to confirm that passengers who wish to avail of pre-clearance do so on condition that they recognise and consent to the right of the US to grant or refuse pre-clearance in accordance with its laws.</p>
            <p eId="para_623"> No Irish official has any role in determining eligibility of admission to the United States at the pre-clearance facilities in Dublin and Shannon airports.</p>
            <p eId="para_624"> If a person is refused leave to board a US-bound flight, the person then becomes the responsibility of An Garda Síochána, which deals with them in line with Irish law and in accordance with the full human rights protections that apply. A refusal at US pre-clearance has no impact on the rights available to refugees or persons seeking asylum in Ireland. If they apply for asylum they will be dealt with in the normal way or if they wish to return to their point of origin, they will be facilitated. These are issues for Irish immigration authorities in which US officials have no role. It should also be noted that my Department does not have responsibility for policy relating to international refugees.</p>

            <p eId="para_625">I ask the Minister to detail the number of people - beyond the one individual about whom we already know- who were stopped at the pre-clearance facilities in our airports. How do the Irish authorities become involved when such a decision is made? The Minister has been among the most vocal, if not the most vocal, of all Cabinet members in his disapproval of El Presidente. Uniquely among Cabinet Ministers, he opposed the Taoiseach paying the latter a visit on St. Patrick's Day. The credibility of his call on the Taoiseach would be greatly enhanced if he indicated his willingness to take decisive action to end the pre-clearance facilities at Dublin and Shannon should such a blatant Islamophobic arrangement be put in place again. Such a move might be hailed internationally and seen in the same light as the decision of the Speaker of the House of Commons, Mr. John Bercow, not to give permission for President Trump to address the British Houses of Parliament. Would the Minister be prepared to consider making such a stand?</p>

            <p eId="para_626">No, I would not. The two issues are not related, I am afraid. In terms of the stand I took, I was determined that my views would be known, not so much about the executive order made by Trump, of which I thoroughly disapprove, but about the issue of torture. I found it difficult to accept that we should give any kind of credence to a US President who had approved of torture. To me, it is uncivilised and barbaric.</p>

            <p eId="para_627">I note that the radical left councillors on Dublin City Council attempted to have an emergency motion debated on Monday night last. Unfortunately, they were ruled out of order. The motion proposed that Dublin be declared a sanctuary city in solidarity with the sanctuary cities across the US, where the local authorities have indicated that they will not co-operate with racist, anti-migrant measures and have run the risk of federal de-funding. Dublin being a sanctuary city would mean, in practice, that refugees and migrants who have no status in Ireland and who are blocked at our airports would be taken care of here. This is something that the Minister should raise with his ministerial colleagues as a matter of urgency. Would the Minister be prepared to do so?</p>

            <p eId="para_629">The Taoiseach indicated last week that he had commissioned a review of the operation of pre-clearance at Dublin and Shannon airports. I understand that this is not an issue for the Irish authorities. How pre-clearance operates at both Shannon and Dublin airports is an issue for the US authorities. In that context, has the review been shelved? The pre-clearance facilities at both Shannon and Dublin airports are of major economic benefit to this country. Any threat to cease the operation of pre-clearance would harm this country, our citizens and the passengers who use both airports.</p>

            <p eId="para_630">I will respond to Deputy Troy's question first. A review was undertaken, with responsibility spread across three Departments, namely, that for which I have responsibility and the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Justice and Equality. As we speak, the findings are being collated in the Department of Justice and Equality and the review will be in the Taoiseach's office by the end of the week. The review went ahead because issues were raised by members of Deputy Mick Barry's party which have to be addressed, including: questions on how pre-clearance operates; the rights of various people who fly into Dublin airport but are refused pre-clearance; in which jurisdiction such people then stand and whose laws apply to them; and the rights of An Garda Síochána. There are all sorts of complicated issues that are being addressed. The review will be on the Taoiseach's desk by the weekend.</p>

            <from>Deputy Frank O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_635">This Topical Issue matter is about the long, outstanding waiting lists for orthodontic treatment. It is regrettable that each time I face somebody from the Department of Health, it is on an issue of long, outstanding waiting lists or on difficulty with the service in general, which is a shame. We know that this subject was very well captured in the recent documentary on RTE, especially around the waiting lists. I spoke in the Chamber a few months ago about the waiting lists for adult spinal surgery being completely unacceptable, as are the associated problems for persons whose treatment is regarded as urgent. After 18 months they are still waiting for their procedure. The disappointing element is that a number of months on there is no change in that situation, despite the promises and commitment given in the House on that occasion a number of months ago. We must get real about bringing solutions to deliver where there are recognised problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_636"> I have a number of cases from my constituency of Kildare North and from speaking with my colleagues in other constituencies where the orthodontic waiting lists are going out of control. I have examples with me of cases of people who were seen back in 2013 and 2014. They were recognised at that stage as being very urgent. Here we are three years on, and in some cases four years on, and these people are still on a waiting list with no date for treatment or surgery for whatever work needs to be carried out regarding their orthodontic problems. That is completely unacceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_637"> I know the Minister of State will probably agree with me, and the Department and Ministers do agree with me and my colleagues in the House when we say it is unacceptable. The Minister for Health said after the "RTE Investigates" documentary programme that he was "ashamed" and "heartbroken", and I am sure he does feel that, but those words are of little use or of any assistance to the people on these waiting lists. There are teenagers on the waiting lists, adolescents who may be in the middle of State mock exams and heading into their leaving certificate or junior certificate exams. They may be trying to plan to go away and work for the summer but their lives are on hold because they do not know if and when they are going to get this important and very necessary treatment that has been suggested after a diagnosis by professionals. That is wrong. It leads to all sorts of problems such as social issues, and in some cases bullying. In one case, one of my constituents is reluctant to go to school because of the difficulties and problems they face. It is completely unacceptable three and four years on from when they were first diagnosed in a consultation and treatment was prescribed that it has not been carried out.</p>
            <p eId="para_638"> I note that from the same documentary programme the HSE has acknowledged that it hopes to have waiting lists down to a maximum of 18 months by the end of June 2017. Given that this is just four and a half months away, how realistic is this hope? I have a number of cases with me right now that have not yet received a date for treatment. Is that an opportune response by the HSE or is it a real response to the waiting lists? Can I tell my constituents and their families that they are going to have an appointment and their treatment will be carried out before the end of June 2017? That is what it comes down to. We must see results and we have to get outcomes. We can no longer speak about the issues. We must see delivery and the public has to see an improvement and a better service. Four years is not acceptable to be on a waiting list for any treatment.</p>

            <p eId="para_639">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. I also thank Deputy O'Rourke for raising this matter and for giving me an opportunity to update the House on the position on orthognathic surgery in St. James's Hospital as advised to me by the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_640"> Orthognathic surgery, or corrective jaw surgery, is performed by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon to correct a wide range of minor and major skeletal and dental irregularities, including the misalignment of jaws and teeth. The HSE has advised that joint orthodontic surgical clinics were provided previously in St. Columcille’s Hospital, Loughlinstown and in St. James's oral and maxillofacial surgery unit each month. Due to the resignation of the consultant orthodontist at St. Columcille’s Hospital, Loughlinstown in 2014, however, it is regrettable that it has not been possible to continue the joint clinics between the two hospitals as before. The HSE has advised me that all patients under treatment in St. Columcille’s Hospital prior to 2014 have continued their surgical and orthodontic treatment in St. James’s Hospital. The HSE has also advised that, while consultant manpower, theatre and bed capacity issues have also arisen in the St. James's oral and maxillofacial surgery unit over this period, the hospital has maintained its levels of orthognathic surgery over the past 12 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_641"> The HSE has advised that it is working to progress the recruitment and appointment of a replacement consultant orthodontist at St. Columcille’s Hospital. The HSE has further advised that St. James’s Hospital has been working with the national clinical adviser to the HSE acute hospital division and with the HSE primary care division to agree a pathway of care to allow increased access to orthognathic surgery to meet demand. As part of these discussions, the recruitment of two oral and maxillofacial surgery consultant posts with a specific remit for orthognathic surgery has been identified as a priority. The HSE has advised that a decision on the first of these posts is expected in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_642"> St. James’s Hospital is part of the Dublin Midlands Hospitals Group. Any proposals for St. James’s to develop the orthognathic surgery service further will need to be considered in the context of how the role of the hospital can best contribute as part of the Dublin Midlands Hospitals Group and with regard to resources available.</p>
            <p eId="para_643"> On the waiting list for orthognathic surgery in St. James’s, as the Deputy is aware, reducing waiting times for the longest waiting patients is one of this Government's key priorities. Consequently, budget 2017 allocated €20 million to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, rising to €55 million in 2018. Among other things, the HSE is developing a 2017 waiting list action plan for inpatient day case procedures to ensure no patient is waiting more than 15 months by the end of October, as the Deputy said. A similar plan is being developed for outpatient appointments. I expect that the details of both plans will be available in the coming weeks.</p>

            <from>Deputy Frank O'Rourke<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T15:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_644">I thank the Minister of State. An area of concern in dealing with the waiting lists is the lack of resources and the infrastructure or supports not being in place. When we see that a consultant resigned and took up a post outside the country nearly three years ago and this position has not been filled, I believe we could all accept that this situation is not good enough. One must query the commitment to the process and the seriousness of dealing with these unacceptable waiting times and waiting lists. A waiting time of 18 months is borderline but three and four years is completely unacceptable for people to wait for much-needed prescribed treatment. These are not recommendations by me or others. These are made by consultants who are trained and qualified in this area. They recommend these treatments be carried out under the heading "urgent".</p>
            <p eId="para_645"> I am concerned that the Minister of State in her reply did not give definite timelines or commitments as to when these waiting lists will be reduced. When will the three or four cases that I have with me today be adequately and fully dealt with? It is very important for these families and for the people involved. We need to get real commitments. I am quite happy to give details of these cases to the Minister of State after this engagement, if she wishes, to try to have the cases prioritised, because the wait is not at all good enough. I accept there is the National Treatment Purchase Fund. Are we going to say that the fund should deal with these lists? Are the people in my constituency who have been waiting three or four years going to be dealt with in the next couple of months? That is what they need to hear. I hope the Minister of State can come back to me with real commitments and timelines to give these people some hope.</p>
            <p eId="para_646"> Before I conclude, if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle could indulge me for a moment, today has been a very poor day in my constituency of Kildare North. I know this topic is not related to my Topical Issue matter but there are around 500 job losses.</p>

            <p eId="para_655">The Beacon South Quarter development was built between 2005 and 2014 and comprises approximately 600 apartments and several commercial buildings. Built by Paddy Shovlin and Landmark Enterprises, it was a celebrated development during the Celtic tiger years. Unfortunately, we are now seeing the legacy of Fianna Fáil in government in the discovery by residents that their homes contain many structural defects. An EGM notice was issued by the management company to residents on 13 January seeking payment of €1 million in regard to water ingress and €9 million to rectify fire compliance issues. They are facing this bill through no fault of their own. The EGM called by the management company and the agent, Aramark Property, last Monday seems somewhat contrived in that the Statute of Limitations that was mentioned by the chair of the management company, Simon Coyle, has expired. Given that the first issues in regard to leakages and so on were discovered in 2010, it seems very convenient that payment of €10 million is now being sought.</p>
            <p eId="para_656"> The situation is extremely distressing and upsetting for the residents, who are already paying significant management fees of somewhere between €800 and €1,500 per year and simply cannot pay such large amounts. It is not yet known how the bill will be divided up between the units and how much each home owner will have to pay. Moreover, there is no transparency in regard to the tendering process and residents have no way of knowing if they are getting best value for money or if they will face further costs down the line.</p>
            <p eId="para_657"> I am asking the Government to assist the residents in finding a fair resolution to this matter. We have seen similar issues at the Longboat Quay and Priory Hall developments. I compliment the Government on introducing new building regulations in 2014 but, as they are not retrospective, they are of no assistance to the residents in my constituency. The Beacon South Quarter owners and residents group is doing a lot of work behind the scenes to assist the residents, and another EGM is due to take place in a month's time. Will the Minister use his political capital with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, to see whether an equitable solution can be devised in collaboration with all of the parties, including Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council? It should be noted that Clúid, the largest non-profit housing association in the country, owns 58 apartments in block B1 and is looking at a fire safety bill of €540,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_658"> The State cannot completely wash its hands of this. I am not necessarily saying the Exchequer should foot the bill, but the Government should assist these people in a context where the regulations are not retrospective. Will the Minister consider the possibility of offsetting their substantial bills against tax, similar to what is done under the first-time buyer's scheme, or perhaps offering a VAT rebate on these essential works, as we do in respect of home renovations? We must address this matter urgently and I ask the Minister to act without delay to see what he can do.</p>

            <p eId="para_659">Before inviting the Minister of State to respond, I point out that Deputy Madigan mentioned a builder by name, which is not the norm.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government (Deputy Damien English)<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_660">I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue which is understandably causing great distress for owners and residents at Beacon South Quarter. In general, building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, namely, the home owner, the builder and the developer and-or its respective insurers, structural guarantee or warranty scheme. In this regard, it is incumbent on the parties responsible for poor workmanship and-or the supply of defective materials to face up to their responsibilities and take appropriate action to provide remedies for affected home owners.</p>
            <p eId="para_661"> It is important to clarify that my Department has no statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, including residential apartments, nor does it have a budget for such matters. I am not aware of any grants or State supports that have general application in such circumstances. Accordingly, the Department is not in a position to provide financial assistance towards the costs of remedial works that may be required where defects are identified in private developments. However, I certainly will raise the possibility of a tax rebate, as the Deputy suggested, with the Minister for Finance. It is something the residents should pursue in conjunction with the county council.</p>
            <p eId="para_662"> Under the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2014, primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the building regulations rests with the designers, builders and owners of buildings. Enforcement of the regulations is a matter for the 31 local building control authorities which have extensive powers of inspection and investigation under the Acts. Neither I nor my Department has any role in regard to enforcement matters and cannot interfere in individual cases. In response to the many building failures that have emerged over the past decade, my Department introduced the Building Control (Amendment) Regulations 2014 which provide for greater accountability in respect of compliance with building regulations in the form of statutory certification of design and construction by registered construction professionals, lodgment of compliance documentation, mandatory inspections during construction, and validation and registration of certificates.</p>
            <p eId="para_663"> As the Minister, Deputy Coveney, informed the House two weeks ago, a new building control Bill is a priority for this Dáil term. That legislation will place the Construction Industry Register Ireland on a statutory footing and provide in law for the registration of builders, contractors and specialist subcontractors. We hope to bring the general scheme of the Bill to Cabinet by the end of February.</p>
            <p eId="para_664"> However, I realise this will not resolve the problems immediately facing the owners and residents of Beacon South Quarter. The issues that have emerged are a matter for the receiver to the developer, the owners and residents and their management company to resolve collaboratively or through such other avenues they consider appropriate. I hope the problems that have emerged can be brought to a successful resolution for all concerned. I am sorry we cannot offer greater help on this matter, but it is not a role of the Department to do so. However, I will talk to the local authority to see if there is any advice that can be offered to the residents. In addition, as I said, I will discuss the possibility of a tax rebate with the Minister for Finance. However, it is important that the residents and all involved should make their own case in this regard.</p>

            <from>Deputy Josepha Madigan<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_665">I thank the Minister of State for his response and his undertaking to discuss the possibility of a tax rebate with the Minister for Finance and to communicate with the local authority on the matter. However, I do not accept the Government cannot intervene on the basis that it is a matter only for the contracting parties. Government involvement would greatly facilitate productive negotiations and a workable solution. Such an intervention would not be unheard of. In fact, it has been done before. It would greatly help the residents, many of whom have no experience in terms of how to proceed and how to find a solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_666"> I ask the Minister of State for further clarity in this regard. I urge him to come back to me in early course on the question of tax breaks. This is an urgent issue. The building control regulations introduced in 2014 were very welcome but are of absolutely no use to the Beacon South Quarter residents. I am pleading with the Government to facilitate a discussion with Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. There is also the fact that the National Asset Management Agency had a role in this when it sold block B1 to Clúid. The State cannot simply wash its hands of facilitating a workable solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">The Beacon South Quarter residents would appreciate any kind of assistance at this stage.</p>

            <from>Deputy Damien English<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_668">I again thank Deputy Madigan for raising the issue. It is certainly not a case of us washing our hands and if I could identify an area where we could help, it is something we would look at. I certainly will raise the issue with Clúid housing association, as we have responsibility for it. Deputy Madigan mentioned NAMA as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_669"> The Department does not have any statutory role in resolving defects in privately owned buildings, and these are privately owned buildings. Apart from the statutory powers, we do not even have a budget for this matter. Building defects are matters for resolution between the contracting parties involved, which is the home owner, the builder, the developer, their respective insurers, and the structural guarantee or warranty scheme in relation to Homebond, Premier Guarantee or whichever company is involved. These are issues that need to be resolved at that level.</p>
            <p eId="para_670"> Certainly, I will raise the issue. As the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, is not here today, I will bring the matter Deputy Madigan has raised to his attention and see if there is any line of hope there as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_671"> I believe there are avenues open to the groups in the situation and they need to lead the residents through all the proper procedures there. The Department does not have the statutory power to intervene.</p>
            <p eId="para_672"> The primary responsibility for compliance with the requirements of the building regulations rests with the designers, the builders and the owners of the buildings. All of those are stakeholders and all have involvement in this. I believe the residents need to work this out through the system involving all of those stakeholders.</p>
            <p eId="para_673"> Enforcement of the building regulations is a matter for the 31 local authorities, one of which Deputy Madigan identified here today. The local authorities have extensive powers of inspection and investigation as well.</p>
            <p eId="para_674"> The issues are a matter for the receiver to the developer in this case and the owners or the residents and the management company to resolve. I would hope, maybe, through the AGM or other methods, that there can be communication to resolve this issue with all those players together. There should be scope to do that.</p>
            <p eId="para_675"> Where problems cannot be resolved through dialogue or through mediation, it may be necessary to explore other courses of action. No doubt the residents and all involved will look at that too. I will talk to colleagues in the Department to see if there is any other information that we can provide from other cases that might be of assistance but I want to make clear that we do not have a statutory role to be able to intervene here to help.</p>

            <p eId="para_676">The next Topical Issue, in the names of Deputies Lawless, Quinlivan, Ruth Coppinger and Heydon, is to the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation about the announcement of Hewlett Packard and the future of this facility at Leixlip. Each Deputy, in that order, will have three minutes to make an initial statement, the Minister will have four minutes and then Deputies will have one minute each for a supplementary question. I call Deputy Lawless.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JamesLawless" eId="spk_496">
            <from>Deputy James Lawless<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_677">I come to the Chamber today directly from Leixlip where I was at Hewlett Packard for most of the morning talking to workers, talking to staff and talking to the various management who were available on site. I was disappointed to note I was the only Oireachtas Member on site. There were no Government representatives present. There is a scrum to get into job announcements and I was disappointed to see the same approach is not taken to job cuts.</p>
            <p eId="para_678"> As the Minister should be aware, this is a devastating blow to Kildare, to the local economy of north Kildare and to the areas of Leixlip, Maynooth, Celbridge, Naas and the wider hinterland. This is one of the key employers in north Kildare along with Intel, Pfizer, Kerry Foods and others and 500 job losses is a huge hammer blow to those workers and their families and to the wider local economy. As the House will be aware, for every ten jobs generated by FDI another seven are generated as a spin-off. No doubt the local economy will begin to suffer as well. Everything that can be done has to be done to support those workers to begin that process of retraining and re-skilling, if that is required, to support them and put the facilities of the State at their disposal. I would be interested in knowing what package is on the table in terms of supports for those workers, everything from social protection through to retraining through such support services.</p>
            <p eId="para_679"> The writing was on the wall for this one for some time. The restructuring - it was at HP at global level - was announced in November 2015 of HP Inc. and HP Enterprise. It was well understood globally that 3,000 to 4,000 jobs would be cut. If that was not enough of a signal, the CEO of Hewlett Packard globally, Ms Meg Whitman, speaking at the Davos forum last month, made an announcement, which made world headlines but, perhaps, not the Minister's attention, that jobs and humans would be put out of business by robots and automation. Advanced manufacturing is heading in this direction. That was a fairly strong signal and I would have thought the Department and the Minister would have engaged, even at that late stage, given the number of signals that had been given, given the presence of HP in Ireland and given its critical importance not only to the local Kildare economy and those workers but to the wider national economy and our economic model.</p>
            <p eId="para_680"> I want to ask the Minister what engagement she had with HP management. Did the Minister meet them in Ireland? Did she meet them elsewhere, for example, in the United States? If not, why? What contacts had the Minister or her office this week, this month and over the past 12 months, in light of the announcement of November 2015? Given HP's significant footprint in Ireland, did the Minister take immediate steps to engage with the company? If so, could the Minister elaborate on those? What steps are now being taken, in terms of mitigation?</p>
            <p eId="para_681"> It strikes me this has happened previously. As the Minister will be aware, I represent north Kildare. Intel went through the exact same process approximately a year ago. Once can be forgiven, twice is careless. It is unforgivable. What kind of mitigation plan has the Government? What kind of crisis management is in place? Unfortunately, these situations occur. We need to be prepared for them. We need to have more than we are doing. What is being done?</p>

          <speech by="#MauriceQuinlivan" eId="spk_497">
            <from>Deputy Maurice Quinlivan<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_682">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for taking this discussion. It is important that he has allowed four of us to speak.</p>
            <p eId="para_683"> First, my thoughts are with the workers and their families. It is a stressful time for them, some of whom are struggling with mortgages and the daily bills they will have to pay. I spoke to a number of those workers today and they are shattered by the reality of what has hit them with the number of job losses.</p>
            <p eId="para_684"> Whereas HP Inc. announced in October that it would be cutting 3,000 to 4,000 jobs globally over the next three years, nobody expected that 500 workers would be told today that they will lose their jobs in Leixlip. The scale of job losses announced today has been truly shocking.</p>
            <p eId="para_685"> The loss of these 500 jobs at the HP Inc. factory in Leixlip will be a major devastating blow, not only to the town but to the surrounding area of Kildare and in west Dublin where many of the workers also live. The area needs to be given priority by IDA Ireland. Education and training courses should be made available for the workforce to help them find alternative employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_686"> HP, as the Minister will be aware, has been a major employer in Leixlip since 1995. The loss of these jobs will clearly be a major blow to that area. The site remains and it must be used for alternative employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_687"> Since HP announced it would be cutting 3,000 to 4,000 jobs globally over the next three years, questions must be asked about what has happened in the intervening period. As the company has clearly stated that it will invest in new market opportunities, we need to know today from the Minister where the jobs are going to? It is also critical that new investment is secured for this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_688"> The company has also indicated that jobs will be transferred abroad. If possible - I do not see why not - we should start to access the EU globalisation fund as early as possible. The Minister must ensure that the particular opportunity of funding from the EU globalisation fund is not wasted, as was the case with previous large-scale job losses in the State. My city of Limerick is a case in point, where we experienced a devastating loss of jobs in Dell in 2009. It was a textbook case of how it should not be done. If funding is accessible, the Minister should start leveraging it today.</p>
            <p eId="para_689"> Those who have lost their jobs must be given access to proper education and training courses to help them find alternative employment. It is clearly a stressful time for them and their families, as many will struggle to pay their mortgages and pay their daily bills.</p>
            <p eId="para_690"> I want specifically to ask the Minister if she briefed Cabinet on the expected scale of losses because some of her Cabinet colleagues seem to be in shock at the number of jobs losses that have been announced today. Rumour was floating around for a number of weeks or months or, as Deputy Lawless referred to, probably longer, that these jobs were precarious and they could be lost. I want to know did the Minister raise this at Cabinet. Did the Minister raise it at the Cabinet meeting this week? When has she raised it at Cabinet?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#RuthCoppinger" eId="spk_498">
            <from>Deputy Ruth Coppinger<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_691">Five hundred workers and their families had to find out through the media, the television etc. that their jobs had been lost. These workers are from Kildare and west Dublin and many are from my constituency and other Dublin constituencies and around Leinster in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_692"> What this brings centre stage again is the massive unique dependency of this country on American-owned foreign direct investment to create employment and the lack of any native industrial policy. As a result, 20 out of 25 companies listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange as companies in Ireland are not Irish companies, 40 American companies account for two thirds of the value of Irish exports and one in five private sector jobs is now IDA Ireland supported through foreign direct investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_693"> Hewlett Packard is also one of the top two technology companies being investigated in the US Senate for tax avoidance on a massive scale. Obviously, much of this is connected with Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_694">In total, 100% of its cash reserves are kept out of America, which is even more than in the case of Microsoft or Apple. Loans from its companies abroad subsidise its US operations. The Minister says she has daily contact with the IDA, so perhaps she can answer my questions about the largesse Hewlett Packard has enjoyed from the Irish State and the Irish taxpayer since it came here. How much grant aid has Hewlett Packard received since it located here? How many higher capital and employment grants for locating outside Dublin, for which there is a higher rate, has it received from the IDA? What level of corporation tax is Hewlett Packard paying in this country, when its workers are paying PRSI, pension contributions and so forth? How many high-level Hewlett Packard executives were given State appointments by Fine Gael or the Labour Party in recent years? The reason I ask that question is that in February 2012 Hewlett Packard and the IDA announced 150 Hewlett Packard jobs supported by the IDA in Galway and Leixlip. How many of these jobs were given IDA grants to bring them to this country in the first place? Even if they were not, Hewlett Packard is getting huge assistance from the State for other jobs. In April 2011, another 50 jobs in the cloud services innovation centre in Galway were supported by the IDA.</p>
            <p eId="para_695"> Hewlett Packard is high on the IDA's list of companies that got grants in 2015. It got the third highest amount of IDA grant aid in 1997. Its profits were $2.7 billion last year. There is no need for these workers to suffer in this way. Many of the company's top executives have been feted by the Irish establishment, as well as receiving appointments within the IDA and in many other places.</p>

            <from>Deputy Martin Heydon<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T16:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_696">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this important Topical Issue for discussion and for giving me the opportunity to speak on it. I represent Kildare South and while HP Inc. is located in the north of the county, today is a significant blow for all of County Kildare and the adjoining counties where a number of the workers come from. It should be put on the record that although we are discussing HP Inc. now, the jobs in the Hewlett Packard Enterprise element remain secure. That is very important and I urge the Minister to continue to engage with Hewlett Packard in the future to ensure everything can be done to keep the other approximately 1,500 important jobs on site. I acknowledge the supports the Government has provided to the research and development sector in recent years to grow that sector, a reason those jobs remain. Today, my thoughts are with the employees and their families but also with the workers and families in the many businesses in Kildare whose business, or a large amount of it, depends on the spin-off industry and economic activity that happens in this plant.</p>
            <p eId="para_697"> I wish to focus on the supports the State will provide now. The IDA has a significant role to play. A fine site will become available, unfortunately, and I expect no stone to be left unturned to find an alternative economic activity and employment opportunity for it. Kildare sometimes suffers from a perception of affluence. There is a belief that because Kildare has a great deal of foreign direct investment and is located beside Dublin it is fine. I challenge that myth. We have challenges in Kildare and some of them come from being so close to such a large economy as Dublin's. The Minister must ensure there is not a sense that jobs will come to Kildare because of where it is. No stone can be left unturned to ensure these jobs are replaced by other high level jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_698"> Another State support is the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board, ETB, which is ready to support the staff if they require re-training. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund provides support when 500 jobs are lost in an area. I ask the Minister to work closely with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, whose Department would make the application to Europe for this support funding. The European Globalisation Adjustment Fund will help staff who need to re-train and will provide approximately 60% of the funding towards that support to the staff who are losing their jobs today and over the coming year. We should seek to tap into that important support if at all possible. The education and training board will support that.</p>

            <p eId="para_699">I thank Deputies Lawless, Quinlivan, Coppinger and Heydon for raising this issue. Today's announcement by HP Inc. is very disappointing and distressing for the 500 employees of the company and for Leixlip and County Kildare. My immediate thoughts are with the workers and their families. Many of these men and women have been with this company for a long time, which makes this news even more difficult.</p>
            <p eId="para_700"> The Government and IDA Ireland have done everything possible to avert this decision. I have had contact with HP Inc.’s senior management. The IDA has been in intensive daily engagement with the company. Strong proposals were put forward to try to ensure the continuing presence of the business in Leixlip. Unfortunately, it did not prove possible for HP Inc. to change course. The decision formed part of a wider global restructuring process - a commercial decision which was irreversible. This is a company-specific issue where HP Inc. is consolidating its core business.</p>
            <p eId="para_701"> I wish to make it clear that the decision by HP Inc. is purely a commercial one taken by the company. The company’s senior management has been adamant about this. It has nothing to do with Brexit, the new US Administration, lreland’s competitiveness or any other wider economic or geopolitical factor. Unfortunately, as we know from past experience in Ireland, global companies sometimes undertake strategic restructurings which involve the loss of jobs, as in this case.</p>
            <p eId="para_702"> In conclusion, I emphasise that I am committed to working with my Oireachtas colleagues in response to this.</p>
          </speech>

            <p eId="para_703">I am very disappointed with the Minister's response. The only thing I will credit the Minister with is her commitment to working with her Oireachtas colleagues and I look forward to meeting her later this evening at the meeting with Members of the Oireachtas from County Kildare.</p>
            <p eId="para_704"> Apart from that, I cannot find much else to welcome in the Minister's statement. There are no specifics about the support package. There is no commitment to a support package and I do not know what is available in terms of social protection, training and reskilling. We need contact points and dedicated personnel assigned to that. There is no mitigation plan in place. HP Inc. is unfortunate to be the receiver of bad news today. The Minister has mentioned other factors, such as President Trump and Brexit, which do not affect HP Inc. but they might affect other firms. What mitigation or crisis management plan is in place for the future? We had the issue with Intel a year ago, the announcement about HP Inc. today and it might be some other company this year or next year. Is any kind of plan being put together? We need this fast.</p>
            <p eId="para_705"> I hate to say this but the last time the Minister visited County Kildare she invited members of the council to a photograph opportunity. The time for photograph opportunities is gone. It is time for action.</p>

Tonight, 500 workers and their families will go to bed with little or no assurance from what the Minister and the Taoiseach have said today. I asked the Minister specific questions. One of them was whether she had briefed the Cabinet about this. The Taoiseach appeared to know about it five weeks ago, but the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, was quoted in <i>The Irish Times</i> this morning and he did not appear to realise the scale of what had happened. He seemed shocked at the number that was announced.</p>
            <p eId="para_707"> The Minister also did not answer some of my other questions. It is important that whatever State aid is given to workers from the Department of Social Protection is accessible, so they can get it when they need it, and is not tortuous and complex to access, as it can be sometimes. Every effort must be made by the IDA to source a replacement industry for the area to deal with the jobs vacuum that will be left. Will the Minister confirm that she will seek access to funding from the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund as early as possible on behalf of the workers? Can she confirm that the workers will get proper and decent redundancy payments?</p>

            <p eId="para_708">Will the Minister even make a pretence of trying to answer any of the questions we submit for the Topical Issue debate? She arrived with a prepared script and did not bother to respond to any of the questions put to her. I asked about the State grants that are still being provided. The situation is reminiscent of the line from the song "Ordinary Man", by the Kildare singer, Christy Moore, "He still drives a car and smokes his cigar...".</p>
            <p eId="para_709">The people who run Hewlett Packard are in receipt of massive incomes which have increased dramatically, and some of them are playing leading roles in State appointments. Lionel Alexander, vice president and managing director of Hewlett Packard, served on the board of the IDA from 2009 to date. He has only just been listed as formerly of that board. Last September, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, appointed him to the board of the Institute of Technology Tralee. In September 2013, Deputy Burton appointed the managing director of Hewlett Packard Ireland, Martin Murphy, as chair of the Labour Market Council to drive the Pathways to Work programme to get people back to work. Instead of more IDA supports, corporate welfare and tax write-downs that cost the taxpayer, can we, for a change, use public investment to create jobs and develop our own native industrial policy rather than continuing this type of corporate welfare?</p>

            <p eId="para_711"> It is a key week for business in Kildare given that both North Kildare Chamber of Commerce and South Kildare Chamber of Commerce will hold EGMs during which their members will consider a proposal to merge. I implore both chambers to grasp the opportunity and to see what happened today as a key example of why Kildare would be much better served by one united, countywide chamber of commerce that could tap into all the resources of Kildare County Council, the education and training boards, ETBs, and all the key Departments and have one united voice.

From today, the IDA is marketing the HP Inc. site in Leixlip to interested buyers. Intreo is ready to accept an invitation from HP Inc. to allow a team to work with its employees on the Leixlip campus or in an alternative location.

Information will be given on the options and assistance available regarding returning to work, short-term enterprise allowance and training and education options. It will involve the Money Advice &amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, and other bodies, as appropriate.

HP Inc. has received €62.3 million in grant assistance since its operations were established in Ireland. The IDA will recover any moneys outstanding from the company in line with the legal arrangements in place between the IDA and HP Inc. The total amount that will be reimbursed to the IDA will be approximately €3.9 million. I was asked about the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund. We have contacted the Department of Education and Skills, which has agreed to explore it. Certain criteria apply. It is for companies that make people redundant within four months. In this case, it is 12 months, therefore it will be a difficult case to make, but we will explore it.</p>

          <p eId="para_728">I welcome the Minister, Deputy Naughten, and I hope he is semi-recovered, at the very least.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> We are very pleased to bring this Bill before the House today. The Bill is short because it is deliberately focused. Of course, while we know there is a range of measures to be addressed in the media area, we believe this group of points must be prioritised as a matter of urgency. In the first instance, there is a major problem in that there is a lack of any kind of a database which details exactly who owns what on the media landscape in Ireland. This applies across all platforms, including the digital, broadcast and print media, and it urgently needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> The regulatory measures cannot just be about box ticking. There will either be regulation that works or there will not, and it is obvious it is not currently working. The regulations have been found wanting at the first ask, which surely indicates the need for urgent change. The regulations were introduced in 2015 and set a maximum figure of 20% for a significant interest test, and anything above that was deemed to pose a threat to the public interest. The issue is a topical one at present, not least because of the proliferation of fake news and fears for the objectivity of the press internationally. It is also topical at home because we are in the process of a public consultation in the context of the proposed acquisition of the Celtic Media group by Independent News and Media, the dominant print media company in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> The issue is not new. It is important in a much wider context and has been unsuccessfully handled for decades due to Government inaction on the issue of media plurality. In its plainest definition, media plurality is defined as ensuring there is a diversity of opinion available across media outlets and preventing any one media owner or voice having too much influence over public opinion and the political agenda. Many issues were raised at the communications committee yesterday, an important one being the sustainability of titles if this merger does not go ahead. However, what of sustainability if the merger does go ahead? We know employment practices and working conditions have changed dramatically at INM, with significant functions being outsourced to the UK, resulting in job losses here. For example, there was a loss of 16 jobs in the print setting function and the work of photographers will be used across a number of titles, which will reduce the amount of work they get and the sustainability of their employment. Of course, the recent example of the treatment of the INM pensioners shows the position of workers' rights within that company. In addition, this business model puts pressure on the viability of neighbouring titles, which will ultimately further reduce diversity.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> Plurality is not simply defined by plurality of opinions. It is also defined as diversity of persons with control of a media business so as to mitigate against one news provider becoming so powerful that it exerts too great an influence on the opinion-forming of citizens and of the political agenda. It is accepted that the media has a crucial role in the creation and sustainability of well formed and healthy democracies. One of the safest ways to protect against fake news or partisan reporting is to do everything in our power to protect the diversity of ownership on the media landscape.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> As I said, it is not a new issue. As far back as 1973 the National Union of Journalists expressed concerns regarding media plurality. While there have been various flashpoints over the years, effectively, nothing has changed. There is an ever-increasing concentration of ownership in the hands of a smaller and smaller number of entities. The most obvious of these flashpoints was in 1996, when a commission on the newspaper industry in Ireland was established following the <i>Irish Press</i> group closure. In a reply in December of that year, following the report of the commission, Deputy Richard Bruton, who was the Minister with responsibility at the time, said: "The social, political and cultural role of the indigenous newspaper industry which distinguishes it from other industries consists primarily in its duty and in its ability to reflect a sense of national identity in an informative, integrative but also critical fashion." The report of the commission itself warned: "any further reduction of titles or increase in the concentration of ownership in the indigenous newspaper industry could severely curtail the diversity required to maintain a vigorous democracy." That was 21 years ago and those points appear to have been forgotten, as we watch the ownership of the media become concentrated in fewer and fewer hands.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> Even within our public broadcaster, the informative, integrative and critical element can all too often be questioned. We know that RTE dominates the broadcast media in Ireland, yet there are legitimate concerns as to how panels are chosen, the diversity of opinion and even issues such as the gender make-up of programmes. Of course, there are some superb journalists working in the industry and there are fantastic examples of good journalism being practised here.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">This week there was the "RTE Investigates" documentary. There have been superb pieces of work by journalists such as Peter Murtagh in <i>The Irish Times</i>, Justine McCarthy in <i>The Sunday Times</i> online, Tom Lyons in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> and Paul Melia in the <i>Irish Independent</i>. I could go on naming people. It is important not to let the bigger concerns regarding diversity cast a shadow over the work of individual journalists who continue to provide impartial and objective journalism. However, we cannot ignore the very clear warning signs heralded by many of those journalists working in the industry. Eoghan Harris, in a notable example, wrote a piece in the <i>Sunday Independent </i>explaining why he felt he could not write anything on the Siteserv scandal in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>. Sam Smyth wrote in his <i>Mail on Sunday</i> column that when the management changed in Today FM, management instructed him not to discuss the Moriarty tribunal or the mobile phone licence which had been won by the station's new owner. Anne Harris claimed she came under pressure for her editorial line while editing the <i>Sunday Independent</i>. Those warning signs are easy to address with a very simple move by the Government to make it clear that nobody who already exerts too great an influence in media ownership outlets will be allowed to increase that influence and, where it has proven to be too great an influence, it will take the necessary steps to rectify that situation in the public interest. Regulation is vital and Government most certainly has a regulatory role. The Ryanair-Aer Lingus share issue was one pretty good example. The intention of the recently introduced rent regulations capping increases at 4% is correct, although the system is flawed. It is in the public interest and satisfies the public interest test.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> The business model for the newspaper industry in the early part of the 2000s relied heavily on the construction and property sector for advertisement. That model was unsustainable for the media industry in the same way as it was unsustainable for the economy and Irish society. The construction sector effectively became the paymasters. It is not fake news; it is a fact to say that the same construction and property sector was one of Fianna Fáil’s biggest funders. When election time came, funding came out to play, giving Fianna Fáil the opportunity to run huge advertisements in the local and national media. It effectively gave that party a competitive advantage and further contributed to the proliferation of groupthink that was so evident during the boom and ensuing crash. I am reminded of a quote by the former Fianna Fáil Minister for Defence, Paddy Power, who was very funny and could always find a way of capturing something. He might not appreciate me rehashing something he said. I might even be quoting from the wrong piece of scripture because I am not particularly <i>au fait</i> with it. I think he said it was about St. Paul on the road from Damascus. He repeated this over and over again, "Lord, make me pure but not just yet." I can hear him saying it even now. He might have been describing Fianna Fáil, which continually says it wants to be principled but it is really a hostage to pragmatism. If Fianna Fáil Deputies agree with the principle of media plurality, they have to vote in favour of this Bill. If they disagree, they should vote against it but they should not insult us by abstaining. The Second Stage debate is the debate on the principle. Committee Stage is where we make the amendments. We have supported legislation that Fianna Fáil has put forward on that very basis, where we have concerns. We are perfectly willing to accept amendments. We hope this Bill gives the Government the opportunity to make the simple declaration of intent with regards to protecting media plurality in Ireland. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RoisinShortall" eId="spk_519">
          <from>Deputy Róisín Shortall<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T17:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_737">I too wish the Minister well in his recovery. As my colleague, Deputy Catherine Murphy, has said, the issue of concern about media ownership is nothing new. The concentration of ownership of the media in Ireland has been a constant point of concern. The NUJ has been raising this issue over a period of approximately 40 years and it has been a feature of the political agenda since the mid-1990s and rightly so because we should be concerned about it. The protection of a free and pluralistic media is a key component of a functioning democracy. This principle is enshrined in the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. While some progress has been made in addressing the matter in recent years, our media markets remain among the most concentrated in the OECD. Recent research conducted on behalf of the EU Commission found that our media plurality is at high risk of an over-concentration of ownership. This is specifically due to an absence of clear legal barriers and any kinds of thresholds of maximum media ownership. I believe all sides of the House will acknowledge that Deputy Murphy has done very important and Trojan work on this issue. The aim is to progress the Bill she has brought before the House this afternoon. That does not necessarily mean that everybody has to agree with every word in it but need merely to accept the principle underpinning the legislation and on that basis, we are seeking support for the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> As it stands, responsibility for this area is divided between the BAI, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. However, it is the Minister who has the final say on the approval of media mergers. The Bill does not interfere with this distribution of power in any way. It extends the remit of the Minister and provides far greater scope to the Minister’s regulatory function on existing media arrangements. While the BAI and CCPC play a key advisory role, neither their remit nor skillsets are necessarily aligned with the important public interest. We have seen them adopt a strictly economic approach in the past. For example, as Dr. Roderick Flynn has noted, during its discussions of Communicorp’s 2008 acquisition of Emap’s radio holdings, the CCPC’s predecessor, the Competition Authority, exclusively focused on the potential impact on the radio advertising market. Consideration of the 9% holding by Communicorp's owner in Independent News and Media was explicitly excluded on the ground that the newspaper advertising market was entirely separate to the radio advertising market.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> With this in mind, the centrality of the public interest within the provisions of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 was a positive step forward. The Act grants the Minister the authority to draw up guidelines on media mergers and to outline the criteria against which their potential impact is to be judged. Crucially, it also gives specific consideration to ensuring diversity of ownership in defence of the public interest. The current guidelines set 20% shareholding in a media business as the upper limit for a significant interest and a potential threat to the public good. However, transactions have taken place in the past which exceed this threshold. The Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom cites the lack of a legally specified maximum threshold on cross-media ownership as a point of concern in Ireland. Furthermore, it suggests that decisions taken prior to the introduction of the 2014 Act have facilitated a concentration of media across the print and radio sector in particular. As a result we must consider how we can rebalance this situation to protect the public good. In the age of fake news and alternative facts, never has protecting a free and diverse media been of greater public importance. This is not to say there is necessarily some nefarious intent behind all such mergers and acquisitions. For the organisations involved, the economic logic of expanding their reach is sound. Reproducing or repurposing existing content costs a fraction of its initial production. Businesses seeking to take advantage of economies of scale is the natural result of a poorly regulated market. That has to be accepted. </p>
          <p eId="para_740"> The impact of this behaviour has the potential to be hugely damaging. If allowed to continue unabated, the number of media platforms may remain constant but the scope of the views represented within them may become increasingly limited. We know all too well about the impact that a lack of dissenting views can have. In the years leading up to the economic crash, for example, the property bubble was often ignored or even denied outright. All too often the narrative of a soft landing was put forward. However, it is important that we do not solely judge the impact of concentrated ownership on the editorial line of a platform alone. We must also be cognisant of its influence on the resulting business model.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> The attitude of media owners to the importance of quality journalism plays a key role in determining their output. Increasingly the public interest value of output plays second fiddle to viral content generation and advertorial pieces. Reduced public service content and editorial resources inherently lead to less coverage of public bodies, local authorities and the Parliament. This content, which may have little value in attracting revenue, plays a vital role in holding those in positions of power to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> If the marketplace of ideas is to survive, it is vital that we ensure there is space for alternative interpretations to be expressed. We cannot allow a small group of companies to dominate the media across all its platforms. We believe that to achieve this, media mergers must be assessed on their cumulative influence across all aspects. The Bill proposes that we accomplish this by amending section 28A of the 2002 Act to include consideration of the combined digital reach across its platforms. While the Minister may currently give consideration to these factors when assessing a potential merger, placing this provision on a legal footing puts beyond any doubt the need to assess media companies on the sum total of their influence. To allow the current situation to continue unchallenged is to do a disservice to the public, and allows a clear threat to a fundamental pillar of our democracy to stand. The importance of a free and pluralistic media cannot be overstated.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> This Bill from the Social Democrats is limited in its scope but it clearly sets down a marker which should be supported by Members on all sides of this House because we know that the importance of a free and pluralistic media is central to our survival as an open and free parliamentary democracy. I therefore urge Members on all sides of the House to support the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_745">I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the Members for their kind words.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> I thank Deputies Catherine Murphy and Shortall for facilitating this debate on media plurality as I believe a strong and pluralistic media is at the heart of a free and open democracy. An important tool in protecting and supporting media plurality is the current media merger regime established under the Competition Act 2002, as amended. This process provides for the assessment of proposed mergers and acquisitions which qualify as a media merger under the Act. During this process, a proposed transaction is first assessed by the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, on competition grounds. Should the CCPC clear the transaction to proceed, it is then referred to me to conduct an initial assessment of the likely impact of the transaction on plurality in the media in the State. In making my initial assessment, I must have regard to the relevant criteria provided for in the Act, the guidelines on media mergers prepared by my Department and the notification material provided by the parties, among other matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> Following my assessment, I have the option to allow the transaction to proceed, to allow it to proceed with conditions, or to refer the transaction to the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland for a phase two or full media merger examination. In those cases that are referred for a phase two examination, the authority must make a recommendation whether the merger should be allowed to proceed, whether it should be allowed to proceed with conditions, or whether it should not be allowed to proceed. I must then make a final decision on whether the merger should be allowed to proceed, whether it should be allowed to proceed with conditions, or whether it should not be allowed to proceed. Many of the terms used to conduct these assessments are defined in section 28A of the 2002 Act and these definitions are of crucial importance to ensuring the effective operation of the assessment process.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> Turning to the Bill, I want to address the second amendment first, as it raises a number of serious concerns. The main issue here is the proposed power to retrospectively break up media businesses. Serious concerns have been raised regarding the location of the proposed amendment to section 28L of the principal Act, which provides for the guidelines on media mergers. I am advised that such a power would require primary legislation and, as such, the location of the proposed amendment is therefore inappropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> On the subject of retrospective action, in the current legislation the Oireachtas has not provided for powers to retrospectively examine, review or intervene in past media mergers from a media plurality perspective because to do so would raise significant constitutional issues. </p>
          <p eId="para_750"> One of the difficulties that would require to be balanced is the right to private property, as enumerated as a fundamental right in Article 43 of Bunreacht Na hÉireann. While provision is made for the Oireachtas to regulate private property rights, interfering with these rights on an <i>ex post facto</i> basis raises a myriad of legal complexities, including the potential for compensation, none of which is addressed in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_751"> Another difficulty is giving a Minister the power to break up an existing media business if its share of a media sector or across media sectors exceeds a certain threshold. The latter is not defined in the Bill. One of the consequences of the proposed use of a definite threshold is that, as one media business fails, another media business could, by default, find itself above the thresholds set, and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment would have the power to break up that business. Furthermore this proposal directly interferes with the freedom of the media. What media business would criticise the Government if the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment had the power to break it up at any time? This level of uncertainty and risk is not conducive to a healthy media sector and could lead to a situation where media businesses could close because investors were afraid to invest, which - despite the good intentions behind the Bill - would damage media plurality.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> I want to briefly turn to the first amendment, which is redundant because "reach" is already defined in this section as "the proportion of a population or audience that consumes any part of the output of a media business in a given period" and this definition encompasses any "reach" associated with a media business, whether digital or analogue. Furthermore, if we were to delete other appropriate measures, it would weaken the legislation as it would restrict my ability as Minister for Communications, Climate Action and the Environment to use other metrics for measuring diversity of ownership as they become available.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> I want to address an issue Deputy Catherine Murphy highlighted. She said that no database exists of the ownership of media, but that is not the case. A database of ownership is contained in the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland's Report on Ownership and Control of Media Businesses in Ireland 2012-2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_754"> I have said previously that there is an issue with respect to how we support quality journalism. We need to consider having a broad debate on journalism and content, because it is important that we have content on which people can rely. So-called "fake news" is an issue that came up in the US presidential elections. It was an issue that I addressed at a debate in Dublin a month prior to it raising its head during the US presidential election. It is something that is a big challenge in this technological time but there is no viable way of legislating to prevent it.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">Investment in quality journalism, I believe, is the only way. This may be through supporting journalists individually through bursaries or it may be that one would support some kind of public service remit across journalism, whether in print or broadcast. I have no fixed view on it but, as Deputy Murphy knows, I have asked the members of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment to consider these complexities surrounding the funding of quality journalism and come forward with their suggestions. I look forward to hearing their proposals in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_756"> The public has respected institutions such as our national newspapers. As with our national broadcasters, it is important that this trust remains. It needs to be supported and this broader debate is taking place on my instigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_757"> Finally, I believe the current regime to assess media mergers is working well. The matters and criteria which I must take into account when conducting an initial assessment, and which the BAI must take into account when conducting its full assessment, ensure that I, as Minister, can make a decision which protects media plurality in the State. I do not intend to make any amendments to the current system, especially amendments which, I am advised, are legally unsound, despite the Deputies' best intentions. For these very important reasons, I oppose the Media Ownership Bill 2017. Despite the good intention, I therefore recommend that the Bill be opposed.</p>

          <from>Deputy Timmy Dooley<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_758">I too rise to show Fianna Fáil's recognition of the sentiment behind the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> I wish to address some of the comments Deputy Catherine Murphy made about the decision we have taken to take an abstentionist position on the Bill. It is clear that our party believes strongly in a free, independent and pluralist media landscape. The State has been served exceptionally well in the main by the media generally across the State and through the generations. We have great concerns that the media might be controlled or dominated by a small group of people. This would not be in the best interest of the State and the question as to how to deal with it has bedevilled a number of Administrations over the years.</p>
          <p eId="para_760"> In Ireland, the Competition and Consumer Protection Act requires that new media mergers be assessed to ensure they are in the public interest and will not result in socially undesirable levels of ownership and its concentration. However, the Bill seeks to extend this by making it possible to retroactively address ownership concentration. This presents significant legal and financial issues. It is for this reason that we will abstain on the Bill. I do not wish to be unkind to Deputy Catherine Murphy but, while the intention behind the Bill is worthy and is recognised by me and my party in that regard, the means by which she seeks to execute it are such that it would be difficult to amend the Bill on Committee or any other Stage. I do not see a foundation on which one could amend the Bill. The nub of the legislation Deputy Murphy presents is retroactive in nature and, while I am no legal expert, it would be news to me if that principle existed in Irish law. To the best of my knowledge, it does not. Over successive issues that have arisen over the years, various Attorneys General have found that the enactment of such a law, or of laws generally within that space which seek to address retroactively a matter of concern, is not in line with the Constitution. From what the Minister has said, it seems to me that this also is the advice available to him. For this reason alone, I do not think the Bill is the vehicle by which we should seek to address an issue of importance. The fact that we will not vote against it should make clear that we believe very much in the principle Deputy Murphy seeks to highlight. Had she sought to take a different strategy and in the same Private Members' time sought to address the matter by bringing a statement or motion to the House, rather than seeking to raise the matter through the enactment of legislation, I believe we would have found more common cause.</p>
          <p eId="para_761"> Fianna Fáil recognises there are issues with media ownership in Ireland being too concentrated. We believe in a diverse and independent media and support steps to ensure it is delivered. However, as I said, I believe the Bill as is is unfit for purpose and has the potential to be unconstitutional. I am not qualified to tell the Deputy for sure that it is but it is clear there would be real issues there. As I said, there are significant legal concerns associated with creating legislation that is retrospective. There is also the potential for financial issues. I think there would be the question of compensation if, as the Minister has stated, he was empowered or minded to break up certain entities in a manner done at a point at which legislation was taken to be retroactive. Divesting individuals of their media property rights could require the State to pay out hundreds of millions of euro to affected parties. I acknowledge the Deputy's bona fides and I do not think she would want this to happen as an unintended consequence of any such legislation. For these reasons, the Fianna Fáil Party will abstain on the substantive issue of the Bill. However, in principle, we are happy to work with Deputy Catherine Murphy and others in this House who believe there is a necessity to protect this media landscape on the broad, independent and pluralist foundation on which it finds itself. We also recognise, however, that in a time of such flux and change, the very significant changes occurring to print and to digital media in particular, even apart from the broadcast media, pose very significant challenges and have the potential to allow for an over-concentration in one ownership rather than the broadly-based approach I think every right-thinking person in this House wants. We are happy to work with Deputy Murphy and others to try to find an appropriate solution to this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_762">I too commend the Deputies on their Bill before us. Its intention is worthy and the issue affects many regional newspapers like <i>The Anglo-Celt</i> in County Cavan, the <i>Westmeath Examiner</i> and others, which will be hugely affected by what may happen in the future. There is no doubt but that the print media are certainly under pressure in the context of their importance and integrity in journalism. They are hugely important. With Twitter, the digital media, Facebook and all other such media forums and outlets, true and worthy media and storytelling are hugely important. Technology has moved forward so quickly that the print media find themselves under a new type of pressure, which must be addressed. However, Fianna Fáil will abstain on the Bill. We will work with those involved in journalism in our regional newspapers on what we can do to find a way forward so that there is security in those local jobs and that the independence and integrity of the media are forthright and of paramount importance in all of this.</p>

        <speech by="#LisaChambers" eId="spk_524">
          <from>Deputy Lisa Chambers<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T17:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_763">I join my colleagues in welcoming the broad intent of the Bill. I understand why the Deputies have proposed this legislation. While its intention is good, we must consider the impact the legislation will have. We agree that media plurality is vitally important for a number of reasons. We know we must ensure that we have a diverse media and that it is independent and can provide the public service it has provided for many years. This public service, providing news and information in detail to the public, allows us to have a properly functioning democracy, something we all value, particularly those in this House as parliamentarians. Every day we see democracy in action. We see the work the Parliament does and know the vital role the media play.</p>
          <p eId="para_764"> However, we must also ask ourselves why this merger is taking place in the first place. Many small news publications are struggling to come to terms with the changes happening in the media today.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">One of those publications is one of my local papers, <i>The</i>
						<i>Connaught Telegraph</i>. It provides a very good news service which means a great deal to the community, but there are several jobs at stake as well. We cannot forget that people are employed in several of the publications which are the subject of this merger. The media is changing. While I do not think this Bill is constitutional or will solve the problem, it starts the conversation and allows us talk about the changes in media and how we want to address those. It also raises the question of what the State should do to help with that change and ensure we have a vibrant, functioning media that continues to provide a public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> I share the Deputies' concerns as I do those expressed by many Deputies and media commentators as to the potential for one or more individuals to have too much influence over or ownership of our media. I fully appreciate the challenges and the difficulties this could bring to our democracy and country and want to address this issue. We have probably let the ball drop on this matter and it has probably progressed too far for us to address what happened in the past. I want to work with them to address the issue but we cannot ignore the fact that retrospective law is bad law. I know the Deputies have put forward the public interest argument. If, however, we take it on this issue, where do we stop? Retrospective law means that something which is fine today will be illegal tomorrow. As citizens we must ensure we know the laws we operate within daily. If I do something today that I believe is legal and am told tomorrow that it is not, this presents an array of difficulties and challenges and we should not get into that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> Deputy Catherine Murphy said that Fianna Fáil is a hostage to pragmatism. Being pragmatic means doing things sensibly and realistically. I hope and always aspire to be pragmatic in my work as a legislator. We have to be because the laws we pass affect the citizens outside this House. Being pragmatic, realistic and sensible about how we do our work should be the cornerstone of how we legislate.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> I disagree that we can address concerns raised here today on Committee Stage because amendments will never address the unconstitutional issues this Bill presents. The Deputies have failed to address adequately the serious constitutional concerns raised in the House. This was brought to their attention prior to today's debate. As Deputy Dooley pointed out, they have also failed to address the serious financial implications of this Bill for the Exchequer were it to be passed. These are serious concerns that deserve to be addressed and I do not see how they can be addressed on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_769"> The talk about fake news and recent campaigns in other democracies have brought this issue to the fore, but we cannot react irrationally. We must maintain a properly functioning democracy. We must work to ensure all our legislation is properly passed and scrutinised and that we consider the implications of that legislation post enactment. The Deputies have failed to consider properly the implications for the jobs of the individuals concerned in, and the communities served by, all those titles subject to this merger.</p>
          <p eId="para_770"> While I join my colleagues in commending the intention behind the Bill and sharing the Deputies' concern about media ownership in this country, and while I agree with Deputy Dooley that we need to work together to address this issue, the Minister was correct when he spoke about the need to resource our media and journalists properly. In recent years journalists do not appear to have time to be journalists. The push and the demand is to get news out immediately. It can often be at the expense of verifying whether the information is correct. This is a broader issue that we as a Parliament need to address seriously because it is spiralling out of control. While I appreciate the concern in respect of this merger, one of the good things that bringing this Bill to the House has done is to highlight the question of how to protect a properly functioning media to ensure we have a properly functioning democracy. Fianna Fáil will abstain on this Bill for the clear reason that we support the intention behind the Bill but we cannot support its unconstitutional aspects, knowing it is bad law and will not address the issues the Deputies seek to address.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eugene Murphy<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_771">First, I should declare my involvement in the media. I worked as a presenter and producer with Shannonside-Northern Sound for 20 years. I also presented a programme on Irish television for a period agus uair amháin bhí mé ag obair do TG4 ar chlár ceoil. I was also a local correspondent with the <i>Longford Leader</i>. I have a major interest in this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> Like my colleagues, I acknowledge Deputy Catherine Murphy and Deputy Shortall bringing this to the House and giving us an opportunity to discuss something very important. We should focus on this continually because we do not want our media to be controlled by a few. Media are very important in this country because the first radio broadcast took place on 24 April 1916, the time of the Easter Rising. Since then, there has been a huge expansion of media, print, broadcasting, film and Internet. According to a survey, 85% of Irish people consistently and daily listen to national, regional or local radio. Fianna Fáil introduced local radio in 1989. Prior to that there was pirate radio. Commercial radio was not allowed. That brave decision opened up regional and local media. It was a very good decision. Local media cover stories well and make sure all issues of concern are aired or printed. That is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> The importance of media plurality is recognised through the new regime established by the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014. That Act introduced a new media merger system. Decisions on individual media merger cases are now officially the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment. At the time Deputy Bruton referred to it as the ultimate decision, whether a media merger is in the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission will determine if a merger has taken place and should be allowed go ahead on competition grounds. That happened not too long ago under the 2014 Act. Maybe in the future we will need to review those Acts to ensure the plurality exists. I am a protector of and advocate for free media, ensuring it is not owned by a few outlets or powerful individuals. I do not think the people would ever allow that to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_775"> There has been a lot of talk in the debate about fake news. It is amazing that, although many of us do not like the policies of the man who introduced that, Mr. Trump, we are all talking about fake news. It is interesting that it has been brought into the debate. It is important to acknowledge the very good journalists in the print media and on radio and television in this country who have exposed many situations that needed to be exposed. The Deputies should not come to the view that because we are abstaining on this Bill it is a bad thing. It is obvious to us that there are parts of the Bill which we would agree with and we would work with the Deputies to improve them.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">We fully support what they are trying to do in the Bill in relation to plurality. It is very important we keep a focus on that. As my colleagues, Deputies Timmy Dooley, Niamh Smyth and Lisa Chambers, have pointed out, there could be constitutional issues with this legislation. As a party, we do not feel we can support it at this stage. Therefore, like my colleagues I will be abstaining.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianStanley" eId="spk_526">
          <from>Deputy Brian Stanley<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T17:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_777">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. The issue we are discussing goes to the heart of how society is organised, who calls the shots and who does and does not have influence. Although we have some very good journalists in this country, I do not think anybody could deny with a straight face that some people have a dominant degree of power, control and influence or that a strict ideological line is peddled in certain sections of the media week in, week out. We welcome the introduction of this Bill. We will support it and vote in favour of it. The current rules with regard to media monopolies in Ireland can stop future monopolisation but cannot deal with the current status of media monopolies in Ireland. This Bill is important, given that Independent News and Media is attempting to expand its ownership empire by purchasing the Celtic Media Group. This would give it an additional seven regional titles across five counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_778"> In October of last year, a report on the concentration of media ownership in Ireland was launched by KRW Law and Doughty Street Chambers, having been commissioned by my party colleague, Lynn Boylan, MEP. The report highlights a number of concerns regarding the development of a media monopoly in this country. Ireland currently has one of the most concentrated media markets in any democracy. The report correctly points out that media plurality is an essential component of a well-functioning democratic society. It is dangerous to have Ireland's media market dominated by the State broadcaster and one individual. The difference is that the State broadcaster has a public broadcasting role. We saw that in action on Monday night when "RTE Investigates" did good work to highlight the plight of those who are living on waiting lists. Our media landscape is potentially on the verge of a further loss of diversity, depending on the decision on the proposed purchase by Independent News and Media of the Celtic Media Group. I urge the Minister to prevent this from happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_779"> In March of last year, the state of media ownership in Ireland was heavily criticised in a report conducted on behalf of the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom by Dr. Roderick Flynn of Dublin City University. The importance of media plurality was recognised in the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 which ensures nobody will be able to acquire a share of more than 20% in a particular section of the media. However, it contains no mechanism for adjusting the <i>status quo</i> where one individual or body already controls such a high level of media ownership. The provisions of the Act are confined to new entrants into the market. It is disingenuous to suggest there is no possible way of addressing this situation. This dismissal is challenged in the report which acknowledges that there are constitutional issues in Ireland with regard to retrospective legislation. I heard the possibility of change being dismissed again today by politicians who lack the will to take this issue seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_780"> Article 43.2.1° of the Constitution, which relates to private property rights, sets out that, "The State recognises, however, that the exercise of the rights mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this Article ought, in civil society, to be regulated by the principles of social justice." Article 43.2.2° states, "The State, accordingly, may as occasion requires delimit by law the exercise of the said rights with a view to reconciling their exercise with the exigencies of the common good." There we have it. That is the Constitution. Therefore, these rights to private property are qualified by rights that must have regard to the principles of social justice and the common good. What issue of the common good could be more important than free expression, by which I mean giving all sections of society an opportunity to enjoy fair coverage, to express their views and to receive accurate information? I believe there is nothing in the Constitution that would restrict the Government from taking action on the concentration of media ownership. If there is, we could have a referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_781"> It occurred to me as the discussion was developing here today that since I was first elected to this House six years ago, I have developed a pain in the back of my neck from listening to nonsense about unconstitutionality every time we go to do something. When the Labour Party and Fine Gael went into government together in 2011, they made a big commitment to do something about upward-only commercial rents, but each time the issue came up there was a suggestion that there might be a constitutional issue. They said they could not take action because private property rights were protected in the Constitution. We have had referendums in this country on important issues. Depending on where one stands politically, one might agree that we have also had referendums on not-so important issues. Even if we feel the constitutional position in this regard is not sound, we can always have a referendum on it. The next time a referendum is due, we could print one more ballot paper to enable the people to make a decision on this matter. The people are sovereign. We should stop using the Constitution as a reason for doing nothing. We are supposed to be living in some kind of a republic. If it is a republic, the people are sovereign. We should get on with it and stop using the Constitution as an excuse every time this issue comes up.</p>
          <p eId="para_782"> The lack of media plurality is having a damaging effect on our democracy. Legal threats against the Oireachtas and Members of the Oireachtas are being carried out at the moment in an attempt to prevent us from discussing legitimate concerns about the banking affairs of Mr. Denis O'Brien with the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation. Given that the bank in question was owned by the State, surely all of its activities are in the public interest. In this light, it is simply untenable that the purchase of the Celtic Media Group by Independent News and Media, which would add more regional and local titles to the vast empire controlled by Mr. O'Brien, will be allowed to go ahead unchecked. According to the KRW Law report I mentioned at the outset, the extent of Mr. O’Brien’s media ownership, combined with his willingness to use the State’s restrictive libel laws, creates a "perfect storm which threatens news plurality and undermines the media’s ability to perform its watchdog function". This is evident in the way the media has attacked and misrepresented those who want to create a more equal and fair society. The evidence is there. One can see it when one opens certain newspapers. Any objective examination of the newspapers in question will see where the balance of coverage is.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> When I raised this issue with the chief executive of Independent News and Media at an Oireachtas committee meeting yesterday, he said that left-wing views are carried throughout his newspaper. That is not the case. Those who buy a certain newspaper have to go to the back page before they find the Gene Kerrigan column. Week after week, the newspaper in question runs page after page of articles attacking the party I represent. It churns out partial and false information as part of its anti-Sinn Féin rants. That is the best way I could describe it. It is all about consolidating the financial position and the wealth of the people who own these titles, which I would describe as viewspapers rather than newspapers. These people push certain views every week and every day to consolidate and hold onto their positions. Mr. O'Brien launched an all-out attack on the KRW Law report when it was published because he does not want any criticism or examination of the dominance of Independent News and Media.</p>
          <p eId="para_784"> The Government does not seem to be taking the issue of media plurality seriously. It should be getting more attention at a time when media moguls and people who own sections of the media are running to the courts to try to silence Members of the Oireachtas. The report I mentioned earlier recommends that the Government should establish a cross-disciplinary commission of inquiry to work with the Council of Europe's recently appointed committee of experts on media pluralism and transparency of media ownership to provide accurate information and expert analysis on the position in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">A commission of inquiry has also been requested by the National Union of Journalists, which has done good work over the years in this regard. The Government should take these recommendations on board and establish this inquiry to protect Ireland's media market and ensure diversity of opinion is heard into the future. We have reached a point where those with vast wealth also have vast influence. In the case of Mr. Denis O'Brien, it goes much further, as along with having the vast influence, he has a dominant position within the media industry which is responsible for conveying news and information to the nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> We are meant to be in a republic and for any individual or small group to have such power and influence over this vital industry is very damaging for democracy. It cannot be tolerated in a State that calls itself a republic. People of all views and none should have their views published.</p>

          <p eId="para_788">The Anti-Austerity Alliance will be supporting this Bill on media ownership. We believe the concentration of media in the hands of a small number of rich, ideologically driven people has been the trend in this country since the foundation of the State and before it. The example springs to mind of Mr. William Martin Murphy, who begged for the blood of Mr. James Connolly in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, and Mr. Eamon de Valera, who launched the <i>Irish Press</i> as a vehicle for the Fianna Fáil Party. We now have Mr. Denis O'Brien, with a majority share in Independent News and Media, INM, after wresting it from the hands of the former billionaire, Mr. Tony O'Reilly, trying to purchase Celtic Media. Another billionaire, Mr. Rupert Murdoch, recently increased Newscorp's stake in the Irish media with the purchase of a number of radio stations to sit alongside his newspapers.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> Reports conducted by the European University Institute have ranked Ireland as having a high risk to media freedom, measured at 74%, because of concentration of ownership. They claim, correctly, a lack of media plurality, which is put at 54%. The position was summed up well by the socialist, Leon Trotsky, who spoke of the division of labour among the owners of the press. The gutter press told lies nine times out of ten and the quality press told the truth nine times out of ten to make the lie more effective. Despite the battles between the billionaires to own more of the media, one factor unites all their titles, which is a hatred of the left and the working class if it threatens their interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_790"> I can give some examples from recent times in this country. On 18 November 2014, the <i>Daily Mail</i> had the headline of "Democrats who believe in mob rule" after the Jobstown water charge protest, accompanied by pictures of Deputies Ruth Coppinger and Paul Murphy. "Democracy under attack", stated the <i>Sunday Independent</i> the following week, again after the water charge protests. The media latched on to the peaceful sit-down protest in Jobstown, with quotes like "Pure thuggery", "mob rule", "fascist intimidation led by people with no interest in democracy", "a violent element hijacked the protest" and "hooligans". All these were an attempt to damage and divide the biggest working class movement in decades on the issue of the water charges and ensure those charges stuck.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> In recent weeks, right-wing ideologues like Mr. David Quinn have freely denounced Deputy Paul Murphy and the Jobstown Not Guilty defendants as having engaged in "street battles". Deputy Murphy and his co-accused have been found guilty in the press before a trial has even occurred. Apparently, in the name of democracy, a climate has been created in which a 17 year old boy could be found guilty of false imprisonment and a major attack on the right to protest could be launched, with a democratically elected Deputy potentially being removed from his position at the behest of a judge. Defendants could face years behind bars for protesting. The Jobstown Not Guilty campaign will ramp up in the next two months before the trial and it will bring out what really happened on the day and at the protest, as distinct from what we are hearing in the millionaire-owned press.</p>

          <p eId="para_792">Some of the other Deputies have mentioned that in 2015, it was reported that Ireland is exposed to a high risk because of its concentration of media ownership. According to findings of a report from the European University Institute Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom, we are at risk. Deputies in Sinn Féin referred to the report commissioned by Ms Lynn Boylan, MEP, which indicates Ireland has one of the most concentrated media markets of any democracy, with the two main controlling entities being RTE, the State broadcaster, and an individual businessman, Mr. Denis O'Brien. Along with the ownership of Communicorp and his shareholding in INM, Mr. O'Brien's "litigious profligacy", as it is termed in the report, in other words, his tendency to sue - the report details 12 lawsuits he has taken against Irish media outlets and personnel in the past six years - is noted. He is listed among the 200 most well-off billionaires in the world. His company, Communicorp, has 40 radio stations across Europe, including two main stations in Ireland, Newstalk and Today FM. He is the largest shareholder in Independent News and Media.</p>
          <p eId="para_793"> I have sat through a number of lectures in recent days on the committee. I note the Minister is not here now and he was not present when we had these discussions. We were repeatedly told that media plurality and diversity would not be threatened by the further amalgamation of media involving Mr. O'Brien and INM. I find it ironic that Ms Boylan's serious and significant report was covered widely by the likes of the <i>The Sunday Business Post</i> and <i>The Irish Times</i>, to name but two newspapers, but practically ignored by the Independent News and Media group.</p>
          <p eId="para_794"> I am not for one moment suggesting that media concentration means Mr. O'Brien or his solicitor will ring an editor or columnist in the <i>Meath Chronicle</i> or any such paper, but without any direct instruction or suggestion, there is what is called in the trade a chill effect. This means one knows, as a journalist or columnist, that to say or write something would not be in one's interest. For anybody to suggest otherwise is pure nonsense.</p>
          <p eId="para_795"> Some people hold the romantic idea there was once a golden era in the newspaper and media industry when we held everybody to account. I do not hold that idea and, like Deputy Barry, I believe the majority of the media has always been on the side of the rich and powerful and against ordinary workers and protestors. We have never had papers siding with protest movements and people power movements that try to deliver change. However, we must be aware that a concentration of the power of the media in the hands of very wealthy people is a very regressive step for the future of democracy in the country. It is farcical when a Deputy in this Chamber who was the subject of an investigation has been sitting on a committee to examine this robustly. I am referring, of course, to Deputy Lowry.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> I support those who have moved the Bill and thank them for doing so. There may be elements that require amendment but we will support it because it is an attempt to deal with an extraordinary position regarding the plurality of the media. This is not just a business matter and it is a question of fairness, democracy, transparency and access to media.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_797">We have always been aware of the impact and power of the concentration of media in certain companies. The Ceann Comhairle will remember that in 1997, when we went out on that fateful election day, the <i>Irish Independent</i> had the headline "Payback time", which was directed against the outgoing Fine Gael and Labour Government. In the run-up to the 2007 election, we saw the rapprochement between the then Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and the Independent group of newspapers, which also provided a fortunate background to his going to sleep as a defeated Taoiseach and waking as a continuing Taoiseach in that election.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> In the report from Ms Lynn Boylan, MEP, she references the Media Reform Coalition report in the UK, which indicates a clear concentration because of three newspaper groups controlling 71% of the newspapers bought in the UK.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">I remember the 1992 election in the UK in particular. <i>The Sunday Times</i>, which is part of the Times Group, printed the famous headline urging people to hold their noses and vote Tory after 18 disgraceful years of a reactionary Conservative Government. Of course, following the efforts of Mr. Blair and his triangulation policies or strategy, News International changed course in the run-up to 1992 and began to support the Blairite approach. Unfortunately or fortunately, some years later News International changed tack again. In the past two UK elections, we have seen relentless assaults on the UK Labour Party. We have also seen the relentless campaign by the Conservative newspaper cartel and media platforms. They advocated against the European Union with all manner of spurious scares and claims. Undoubtedly, this formed the backdrop to the concerns of the British people over developments in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> I warmly congratulate Deputies Catherine Murphy and Shortall and the Social Democrats on the work they have done in respect of the Media Ownership Bill and for bringing it before the House today. Deputy Catherine Murphy has had a long interest in the question of media concentration. Her interest began long before the Siteserv issue arose in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> The intention behind the Bill is to protect the plurality of the Irish media landscape, which is a critical foundation stone for a democratic society. It would allow for the amendment of the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 and enable the provisions to be applied retrospectively. The Social Democrats Bill is an attempt to ensure that the 20% public interest test that applies to any media merger now could be applied retrospectively to any individual with more than a 20% interest in media platforms.</p>
          <p eId="para_802"> I listened to the Minister's speech earlier. I am unsure as to what he is doing or whether he will do anything. The position is weak in this area. The Competition Act 2002, the Broadcasting Act 2009 and the Competition and Consumer Protection Act 2014 do not seem to be performing properly on the basis of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland report on ownership and control of media businesses in Ireland for 2012-14. Lynn Boylan, MEP, commissioned a subsequent study, entitled Report on the Concentration of Media Ownership in Ireland. The report clearly showed we are high on the scale. We are not exactly at the level of Russia, Turkey or Saudi Arabia. However, we are certainly up on the scale and there is considerable concentration of ownership. The report also references the report in the UK which showed that concentration was at 71%.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> As others have said, the media landscape is changing dramatically and there has been an incredible change in how people are accessing daily news. Hard copy newspapers are effectively dying as more and more of us read freely online. We have seen how the millennial generation tend to eschew buying newspapers. They access the news on free sites or else access free articles in newspapers that are trying to migrate onto websites. Online news sites include Google, Yahoo, those of our newspapers, <i>TheJournal.ie</i>, <i>BreakingNews.ie</i>, <i>Huffington Post</i> and Mediapart in France. These sites are being used by people and are accessed using smart phones by people on daily commutes. The newspaper culture seems to be disappearing. Some sites require subscription but it is difficult to get the generation that has become used to free news to begin to pay for it now. The current newspaper groups have a major advantage in trying to migrate from the hard-copy newspapers to the digital platform. They have a considerable head start over the rest of us who might decide to establish online news sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> Having said that, media ownership remains concentrated. Indeed, Irish media has always been concentrated. Other speakers have referred to the same chorus every year on budget policy. Most articles advocate for cuts in spending and staying the fiscal course. Many supported the blanket bank guarantee. Historically, the <i>Irish Independent</i> was fiercely and bitterly opposed to Independence. <i>The Irish Times</i> represented the old Unionist ruling class. Indeed, Eamon de Valera and his colleagues had to try to establish their newspaper platform, the <i>Irish Press</i>. Like many others, I greatly regretted the demise of the <i>Irish Press</i> because we lost a fourth essential voice.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> Of course, local radio has been a major success. However, efforts to launch serious competition to RTE television and radio on a national level, with TV3 and UTV Ireland, have been poor enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_806"> We have seen the continual growth of the power of Independent News and Media. This brings us to the main purpose of today's Bill, that is, to protect both diversity of ownership and control of media businesses in the State and the plurality of the media. It is not healthy for the principals of one group to have extraordinary control of the hard copy newspaper industry and, at the same time, control of a swathe of radio news sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_807"> I referred earlier to the report commissioned by Lynn Boylan, MEP, which provided some invaluable figures for Ireland and the UK. It refers to us scoring 0.7 on the scale from zero to 1, where 1 represents total concentration of media power. We have seen in the past how people have spoken with one voice. Previously, I tried relentlessly to raise the issue of pyrite problems and problems with building in this House. It was a long time before the two major newspaper groups, Independent News and Media and <i>The Irish Times</i> took up the story. For years, they offered extensive property supplements, with nice cosy write-ups about developers' plans and so on. Indeed, they are back at it again. The property supplements are in one section but they are funding the newspapers. Then there is the editorial side. Some of the famous journalists include Stephen Collins, Pat Leahy and John Downing. There is little evidence of them writing articles about the influence of the property industry on the newspapers and what happened to our country in 2009. I warmly support the Social Democrats Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_808">Concerns around media ownership have been doing the rounds since 1999. At the time the report of the Council of Ministers adopted recommendations on measures to promote media plurality.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> Radio stations such as Tipp FM and Tipp Mid West Radio are my local stations. Deputy Eugene Murphy, who has just left the Chamber, was a voice of local radio for many years. I compliment his party - I was a member of the party at the time – on setting up local radio on a statutory footing in 1989. There were many pirate radio and community radio stations at the time. We still have wonderful community radio in Tipperary, for example, Tipp Mid West Radio. I compliment the station on the exposure it gives all of us, including myself. Some people complain about it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_811">No, I never did any broadcasting but I try to get my message out to the media. I do other types of casting but not broadcasting.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> The recommendation presented measures which member states could take in six areas. These included: ownership; regulation of new communications; technologies and services for digital broadcasting; content; editorial responsibility; and public service broadcasting and support measures for the media. All of these areas remain of significant concern. Little if anything has been done at Government level to protect consumers and citizens from the bias that inevitably emerges when the media, in all its forms, are controlled by people of one dominant ideology. We have heard much of that in the debate this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> Of course, the Internet and social media have changed the landscape considerably. I salute websites such as <i>TipperaryTimes.ie</i>, run by Paddy Ryan, a Templemore man, as well as <i>AgriLand.ie</i> and similar sites. They are doing what the media should be doing at certain times in exposing situations. I salute RTE as well. We bash the station often enough. The "RTE Investigates" programme on Monday night offered an excellent exposé of the shocking scandal, cover-up, massaging of the figures and deception over waiting lists. I compliment those involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> It is now possible, by and large, to express views and opinions that would never have seen the light of day in the printed press 20 years ago. This brings with it challenges and opportunities. We have seen that. We have heard debates in recent days about abuse at Facebook and what goes on in Facebook. People are more informed than ever before. They have the opportunity to hold the Government to account in a manner that would once have been inconceivable.</p>
          <p eId="para_815"> Monopolies are seldom, if ever, a good idea. The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is toothless and useless and has no effect in any area. We have seen that in many big business areas. Given how important the media are to a functioning democracy, it is even more important that the public view is not shaped by a media monopoly, be it that of Mr. O'Brien or anyone else.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">I recall that Denis O'Brien had three daughters fine but was troubled by all the fellas who were coming to court them. Members might remember the song, "O'Brien had no place to go" which was played on a lot of local radio stations, including Deputy Catherine Murphy's local station, I am sure. We are talking here about a different Denis O'Brien, however. </p>
          <p eId="para_817"> There is wholesale avoidance of covering the banks and vulture funds that are evicting people every day of the week, as well as what is going on in the courts. That is hardly getting a syllable in the media. Why? It is because of all of the advertisements and the property pages, as Deputy Broughan said earlier. That is not democracy. That is not decent media. I occupied a bank one day with a family from Wexford who got an awful beating by thugs on the road. I was weak from doing interviews with every media outlet, including RTE, but not a syllable appeared anywhere because a big public relations firm marched in and all of the media outlets were threatened with advertisements being pulled if they mentioned a word about it. That is despicable in a democracy but that is what is going. It should not be allowed to happen. </p>
          <p eId="para_818"> It is often said that if we do not read the newspapers, we are uninformed but if we do read them, we are misinformed. That is a fact. The issue of President Trump and how he was elected was mentioned earlier. The media were not very kind to him but people saw through what was going on there. President Trump spoke about fake news and there certainly is a lot of fake news out there. In my native county, a monopoly is buying up every parcel of land that can be bought. Coolmore is a wonderful group in the equine industry, in terms of its prowess and the employment it provides. However, it is the new landlord in Tipperary, the new Cromwell. The only media outlet that will print any words that I utter here on the matter is <i>AgriLand.ie</i>. None of the other newspapers want to touch it because Coolmore is a big, fancy company and it is neither sexy nor proper to criticise it. They mix in the same circles and there is huge sponsorship at stake. That is a denial of what is going on. Families are being destroyed but the media are not interested. It is disgraceful. It was covered on Tipperary Mid West Radio, to be fair. We have good newspapers in Tipperary, including <i>South Tipp Today,</i> the <i>Nationalist and Munster Advertiser, </i>for which the journalist Eamonn Lacey works, and <i>The Munster Express. </i>These are local papers which report local news, thankfully. The national newspapers, however, are not interested which is a pity. There are a lot of very good journalists out there and I am not blaming them for not covering evictions or the occupation of Allsop's, for example. I am blaming the editorial staff. The journalists are interested and come along but when their stories are ready to go, they are pulled because of advertising. Money decides what is printed in newspapers and that has no place in a modern democracy. </p>
          <p eId="para_819"> This Bill is an effort to address the problem. I am surprised at Fianna Fáil. We might organise a training course for it on how to vote because it seems that it will be abstaining again tonight. There are three voting buttons in here and perhaps they are confused. </p>
          <p eId="para_820"> We are where we are with the media. There is some open and honest reporting by journalists but at editorial level, that is not happening. I have seen that in so many areas. I have seen it with the cartels in the concrete industry in the context of Roadstone but there has not been a syllable about that either. The media will not criticise cartels like that because they are too powerful. Advertisements and money are more important than the true stories. Deputy Broughan referred earlier to the pyrite issue and for years attempts were made to raise that but it was not covered because certain cement people were too powerful. The small people have been driven out of that industry. We have met small suppliers at Oireachtas committees who told us that the Competition Authority stood idly by and told them that it did not have enough resources to investigate. We have the same situation now with companies buying up other companies. The Competition Authority approves the takeover but they are only taking companies over to close them down so that they will have a monopoly in the market. That is bordering on corruption. I will not say that we have a lazy, inept and lethargic media because we do not; we have good journalists. I know many of them and they work hard but editorial staff are bought and kept and they are not fair or democratic. They have a duty to report issues like those I have just mentioned but they are taboo. So many people have horror stories to tell about bullying, intimidation and evictions and about their fear but there is not a syllable in the newspapers about it. In terms of the Citizens' Assembly and the pro-life argument, again there is a huge media bias against the ordinary people of Ireland who have views they are entitled to express. They want to express them but they are not catered for.</p>

          <from>Deputy Eamon Ryan<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_821">I am very happy to support the Bill presented by the Social Democrats and to have the chance to consider the wider issue of media ownership in our society. The main intention of the Bill is very rational, sensible and reasonable, that is, to take into account a changing, evolving and more digital media world. In a digital world, broadcasters and publishers are acting across a whole range of different platforms and it makes sense to amend our legislation to recognise that reality and to give the existing Competition Acts tools to consider the cross-media ownership issue. That is the central intent of the Bill and I find it hard to understand how people would argue against that. It seems to be a rational description of the reality we face. We all agree on the benefits of media plurality. Therefore, it makes eminent sense to assess media ownership across different platforms and the extent of media reach is one of the key metrics in determining whether there is sufficient competition. </p>
          <p eId="para_822"> That case was well presented yesterday at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment. That committee, under the 2014 competition legislation, was charged with the task of recommending to the Minister a perspective on the proposed merger between Independent News and Media, INM, and Celtic Media, a smaller grouping of newspapers in counties Cavan, Monaghan, Westmeath and Meath, as well as other publishing endeavours across the country. If one just looked at it as a straightforward newsprint media merger, the case would be reasonably strong because there is no overlap between where INM currently has newspapers and where Celtic Media has a presence. However, I articulated my concern at the hearings yesterday, as did all of the academics present and the National Union of Journalists, NUJ, that if one uses the spectrum of cross-media ownership, the picture is different. The owner of Communicorp, for example, is also the largest shareholder in INM and there is a real concern about crossover. The idea of the owner of Newstalk radio and other local and national stations, which also has a significant interest in some of the main national newspaper titles as well as local newspaper titles, having ownership of more local newspapers raises real concerns. It raises concerns for me. We have not reached a conclusion as a committee. We will divide on the issue, I would imagine but my advice to the Minister would be to exercise caution and to seek to protect media plurality by recognising that cross-media ownership is a real issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_823"> The presentations from the management in both INM and Celtic Media were very good. I do not dispute the integrity or the professionalism of the people in either company. One comment from the Celtic Media management really struck me. The company is obviously trying to survive in a changing media world. It is trying to develop a digital media presence because, as the Bill before us recognises, digital reach is a critical factor in the evolving media evolution that is taking place. Some local newspapers produce very good digital output but Celtic Media has found that, as good as it is, its digital output is a cost stream rather than a revenue stream. </p>
          <p eId="para_824"> We must consider what is happening in the media world and in the ownership of media in this country and acknowledge that a large amount of the money generated is now going to international organisations that have huge power. It is not just the media outlets. Sky is cleaning up in terms of being able to get huge amounts of money from subscriptions without having to engage in any additional production of local news here, for example. It does some production for its overseas business, which is welcome, but it does not provide local news content. It is also able to insert advertising with very little regulation and no charge. It carries RTE services at very low transmission costs and is able to benefit tremendously from that. Similarly, cable companies like Liberty Global are able to make very significant revenue here. The transmission companies are benefitting and generating huge revenue. </p>
          <p eId="para_825">That has added to the kind of competition that local indigenous media companies are facing because there are companies such as the hugely successful and popular Netflix that often uses subscription revenue streams to provide content. It is very hard to compete against these types of companies because the quality is very good and they are international organisations. </p>
          <p eId="para_826"> To make it more difficult for local media companies, there are companies like Google and Facebook that take something like €300 million a year in advertising from the Irish market. Increasingly pertinent questions are asked of companies such as Facebook as to whether they are publishing companies or just technology platforms or whether they have editorial responsibility for the stories that are shared on their networks. This increasingly complex digital media world we are in is, more than anything else, characterised by a large number of significant and powerful international companies and a dwindling advertising pie for indigenous companies. </p>
          <p eId="para_827"> It is the same for print, radio or broadcast companies. RTE is in crisis, as is TG4 and I would say that TV3 is also having a tough time in that advertising market but it has survived, thank God. Local radio stations are in real difficulty, as are our local and national print newspapers. We have a problem. The words used in the committee yesterday were that there was a fire across the media world in the State at the moment. As public policy makers, we have a duty of care in the public interest to protect those companies, to protect local content and local journalism and to create the potential for local stories to be told and content created.</p>
          <p eId="para_828"> I was taken by one of Deputy Lowry's comments at the committee yesterday. He said that "When it comes to the crunch this is about business..." My retort to him was that no, for me when it comes to the crunch it must be decided on the basis of the public interest. As difficult and as challenging as the media environment is nationally, I do not believe the solution can be just a conglomeration of all the local news media sources into a small number of national media companies that might compete or survive in that competitive world against all those international companies. This Bill is correct in looking to protect diversity of ownership and plurality of opinion. It is a cornerstone of democracy and we have an intrinsic interest, maybe more than anyone else, in this issue because we realise that for people to participate in a democracy, the presence of a free, varied and impartial press is critical to the health of that democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_829"> The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment has started a public consultation process on the funding of public service broadcasting but I believe we can and should widen it out. We will hold a forum on the future funding of public service broadcasting. The technology companies, the radio stations, the newsprint people, the academics and the advertising people must be brought into it to try to understand what is going on here and how can we achieve that dual objective of maintaining Ireland as a centre for innovation in digital services and technology, while at the same time maintaining the State's proud and long tradition of good quality, independent journalism and plurality of media ownership and of public service broadcasting. RTE is not competing with just a number of other Irish independent media organisations; in a sense they are all competing for some of the advertising and other revenues that increasingly is going to large international platforms rather than to the Irish media industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_830"> I am conscious that the Minister has today come out with statements on digital social networks and how he is going to manage bad behaviour and so on. I welcome that, as do we all. Some of the characteristics of the social networks are very uncertain, but I believe the Minister has to be careful in how he defines what that behaviour is and in understanding one of the first principles we apply in this evolving digital media world before we start legislating at the tail end in restricting communications one way or the other. It is just a word of caution from one of the news stories I heard today. One of the first principles that we adhere to is the plurality of media ownership. This Bill supports that principle; we support the Bill and commend our colleagues in the Social Democrats on using this opportunity to present it.</p>

          <p eId="para_831">I will begin my closing statement by echoing the earlier statement by the Minister, Deputy Naughten, which is that any debate on media plurality is to be welcomed. A robust and pluralistic media is vital to the democratic process and to the daily lives of the Irish people. I thank all the Deputies who have participated in the debate. I share the Minister’s concerns about the proposed amendments to the Competition Act 2002 contained in this Bill. The Minister, Deputy Naughten, set out in his opening statement the reasons why both amendments are legally unsound.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> I will focus my contribution on the stated focus of this Bill, which is to provide the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment with the power to take retrospective action against media businesses that exceed certain thresholds of ownership within a media sector and across media sectors. The impetus for the current regime for media mergers arose from the recognition of the importance of an open and transparent media and the acceptance that the evaluation of media mergers needed to include an assessment of the impact on media plurality in addition to the standard competition assessment that applies to mergers in other parts of the economy. The matter was debated in great depth during the passage of the 2014 legislation as befits a topic as important as this and the issue of retrospection was also debated at that time. As stated by Dr. Roderick Flynn at the recent Newsocracy conference on media plurality, held in Dublin last Tuesday, ownership is one factor which must be considered when addressing media plurality in the State but there are others which must also be considered. Dr. Flynn’s upcoming report for the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom in Europe will point to risks he has identified around diversity of content, as well as the access of women and minorities to the media. These issues are also among the criteria and factors which must be considered by the Minister, which include but are not limited to, ownership and control, governance and editorial management and content, including diversity of content.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> Section 28D of the Competition Act 2002 sets out all of the issues which the Minister must consider in making his initial assessment. It is only when all of these factors have been considered individually and collectively that the Minister can come to a conclusion as to whether a proposed transaction is a matter for concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> Ireland’s media landscape is unique due to our size and location on the edge of Europe, our linguistic heritage and our membership of the European Union. As a result of these issues there are real constraints on the power of the State to ensure a pluralistic media, and changes which occur internationally can have a considerable effect here. The current regime seeks to take account of these issues, and provide a responsive, and to a certain extent future-proofed, process for protecting media plurality.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> I agree with the Minister, Deputy Naughten, that the current regime to assess media mergers is working well. The matters and criteria which he must take into account when conducting an initial assessment, and which the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland must take into account when conducting a full assessment, ensure that he, as Minister, can make a decision which protects media plurality in the State. The amendments proposed by the Deputies are legally unsound and would have serious negative consequences for an industry in which revenues are decreasing or static at best. These are the important reasons that I am opposing the Media Ownership Bill 2017. I therefore recommend that this Bill be opposed.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_536">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T18:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_836">It must be said that when we talk of the media as an industry, and when we look at industries that produce widgets or whatever, we must realise the media is a very different industry. The importance of this was recognised in Article 40.6.1° of the Constitution under fundamental freedoms which says "The education of public opinion being, however, a matter of such grave import to the common good, the State shall endeavour to ensure that organs of public opinion, such as the radio, the press, the cinema ... " and it goes on. Obviously this predated television, digital platforms etc. but they could equally be applied. The media must be seen as different because it is a different industry. It is an industry with a central public importance. The former Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Keane, in a Supreme Court ruling he made on any measure which challenges the right to private property - and private property comes under a different article of the Constitution - stated that it must be rationally connected to an objective of sufficient importance to warrant interference.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">I accept that view but, as I said, it is different when it comes to the media. There is a public interest test to be met, which would have failed in respect of the Celtic Media Group merger if the regulations were working. I absolutely dispute they are working well, because all the evidence points to the opposite. The media are one of the basic democratic pillars of our society. The Minister said that under current legislation, the Oireachtas has not provided for powers to examine, review or intervene retrospectively in past mergers. In fact, the Celtic Media Group merger suggests those powers do not even extend to future mergers, given the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission's willingness to allow the merger to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> The Minister dismissed the provision in our Bill which seeks to recognise the digital platforms within which media operate by claiming existing legislation already encompasses that issue. The 2014 Act refers in the context of media ownership to "the market share of those media businesses as measured by listenership, readership, reach or other appropriate measures". Our argument is that it is necessary to refer specifically to digital media, digital reach and multimedia platforms due to their major role in how media are consumed. To dismiss that requirement is an oversight.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> The database on media ownership to which the Minister referred details only the titles that fall under particular entities. It does not show the full shareholdings of each media business. The point I am making is that one cannot possibly measure media ownership if it is not counted and documented. How is the Minister measuring the process such that he can say it is working well? I do not see how it can be working well if we do not have something by which to measure it. We cannot have a silo-based approach in regard to the media. Oversight must be done across all platforms if we are to have a true picture of reach and influence.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> Deputy Dooley said the media have served us well. One of the main conclusions after the crash was that we had an issue of groupthink in the media. The advertising revenue that more or less became the basis of the business model for the survival of the media at that point was a major influence in terms of the type of coverage that was given on issues and the dismissal of alternative views. The media lost the diversity that was needed to challenge the view, for example, that the property sector was not overheating. If one does not accept that 20% is the threshold above which the concentration of media ownership is a problem, does one propose it should be 30% or 40%? Will the same issues arise every time there is a merger and will it essentially come down to a choice between jobs and diversity? There must be something more to it if we are to protect this fundamental element of our democracy. We all know our democracy is not perfect but there are some very good aspects to what we do have. Diversity of media is something we have been identified as being at high risk of not retaining. When we identify such a risk and see that what is happening is not in the public interest, it is incumbent on us to take action. A succession of failings has led us to this point and there is every chance the situation will get worse. I am very unhappy with the description of the oversight process as working well.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> There are other issues to consider concerning the media that are beyond the scope of this Bill. The content that is provided to the media and the way politics operates, for instance, are important factors. The Government is very much responsible for much of the media manipulation we are seeing in respect of political reporting. The handling of opportunities for the media to engage with the Taoiseach is a good example of this. I have heard from several political correspondents that the Government press officer will often choose who is entitled to ask questions. It is not up to that individual to choose. It should be a matter for the press corps itself. It is a fair criticism to observe that many public figures on the international stage make themselves much more accessible to the media than the Taoiseach does.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> In other words, it is not just about media mergers but also about how we treat members of the media and whether we value them as part of the democratic process. If we do, there must be engagement and transparency so that people can do their job. Everybody in this House knows that trying to get answers to parliamentary questions is hit and miss. It very much depends on the particular Department or Minister whether one will get a comprehensive response. People, including parliamentarians and the media, cannot do their jobs when there is that approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> The focus in our Bill is on media ownership and diversity, but there is a lot more we need to put right. To give another example, consideration should be given to reviewing the defamation laws and imposing limitations in respect of the taking of libel cases. When we have people with very deep pockets potentially putting a title out of business by virtue of a successful action in the courts, it goes beyond the question of protecting a person's good name. Ordinary citizens do not have the pockets to take that type of case. These are some of the issues that need to be addressed into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_844"> As I said, I do not know what measure the Minister is using when he says the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission is working well. In fact, it is a completely opaque process with no transparency as to how decisions are made. The advisory panel is chosen from a small pool of media professionals in Ireland, but the reality is that we live in a small country and this is a relatively small industry. Sometimes it is necessary to look to external expertise to have a fair assessment of where we stand. Deputies Dooley and Lisa Chambers spoke in platitudes about supporting the principle of the Bill. The problem is that if we keep making excuses every time we breach the threshold, when do we get to the point of principle where it is acknowledged we are at risk and where diversity trumps the other arguments? I am disappointed the Government is not supporting the Bill and Fianna Fáil is abstaining. I welcome the comments by others in support of the Bill. I hope the debate has been fruitful in at least identifying the very serious problems that need to be addressed, but I am sorry they will not be addressed at this time.</p>

          <p eId="para_848">I will start again because I got cut off last night after a couple of minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_849"> My party will be supporting the Bill as it will positively impact on the efficiency of court administration and will free up Garda resources for much-needed operational deployment.</p>
          <p eId="para_850"> Under the current fixed-charge-notice system, those alleged to have committed a relevant road traffic offence are issued with a fixed-charge notice. Currently, fixed-charge notices are issued and printed on behalf of An Garda Síochána and payment of fines is made through An Post with the notice stipulating that the relevant fine must be paid within a period of 28 days and the relevant penalty points accepted. Where the fine is not paid within the initial 28-day period, the fixed-charge notice provides for a further 28 days within which payment of the original fine plus 50% may be made. Failure to pay a fine within the 56-day period, that is, the 28 days plus the further 28 days, will result in the automatic issuing of a summons requiring the alleged offender to appear in court. It should be noted that this process does not require a member of An Garda Síochána to apply for the summons to be issued; the summons is triggered automatically by non-payment of the fixed-charge fine. It is estimated that 7,500 cases are dismissed annually on this ground alone. Between January and August of last year, there were 118,000 fixed-penalty notices issued for speeding and since January 2013, nearly 150,000 drivers were not convicted for various reasons, including not being served with a summons at the correct address or claiming to have never received a fixed-charge notice in the post. This not only means that the fine was not paid but, arguably more importantly, also that the relevant penalty points were not applied.</p>
          <p eId="para_851"> Under this Bill, the second fixed charge will provide a third and final option for the payment of the fine - the original fine plus 100%. For those who opt to pay, payment must be made not later than seven days before the date specified in the summons as the date on which the charge is to be heard by the court.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> The issue of motorists going to court and claiming that they never received the fixed-charge notice in the first place has been a long-standing source of frustration for many District Court judges. I note, in particular, the comments from Judge Patrick Durcan in Ennis District Court who has been quoted at length in the media criticising speeding motorists who are allegedly willing to perjure themselves in the witness box when giving sworn evidence that they did not receive a fixed-charge-penalty notice for speeding. In one case, a defendant before his court was detected speeding at 133 km/h in a 120 km/h zone on a motorway. The judge refused to accept that the gentleman in question did not receive the fixed-charge notice and he fined him €750 and banned him from driving for a year. The judge also requested that the Garda inspector refer the evidence to the DPP as a result of the alleged perjury committed which he referred to in the court as a "pack of lies." In his own court, the judge ended up being obliged to dismiss 15 cases in one day where all the motorists suspected of speeding stated that they did not receive a fixed-penalty notice in the post. One can understand the frustration of judges in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> Of course, we can have all the legislation we want on the Statute Book to address this matter but it will be of little use if there are not dedicated resources available to ensure these laws are enforced. In December 2013, there were 804 gardaí in the traffic corps. This dropped to 742 in 2014. In 2015, the number dropped further to 716 and by November of last year, there were 674 members of the Garda traffic corps. While I do not believe there is a correlation equal to causation, it is certainly something which has to be taken into account. If we are bringing in additional legislation and decreasing the resources available to the Garda, one outcome will be the question of who will issue and monitor the fines. In fairness, the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, has stated that the traffic corps will increase by 10% this year but that will still not result in the numbers increasing to where they were previously before the economic crash. I note the Minister has put on record that her ultimate goal is to get back to that level. We understand it will not happen overnight. It will take a number of years. We certainly welcome the commitment from the Tánaiste that it will increase by 10% this year. We hope that she is proven correct in that regard because as long as the number of gardaí in the traffic corps remains an issue, the issue of enforcement will also remain an issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_854"> The State has been aware of significant weaknesses in the fixed-charge-notice systems for some years, as far back as 2013 when the Comptroller and Auditor General flagged up that one traffic offender in five was able to avoid penalties and suggested that it needed to be urgently addressed. Unfortunately, the Government did not urgently address it and we are addressing it now.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> My party will support the Bill. We hope that it will prevent the practice of people arriving to court stating they did not get their notice in the post. Furthermore, we are hopeful that it will act as a deterrent to motorists speeding in the first place because that is what we must address. The Bill is to address motorists who claim that they did not get the fixed-charge notice but we cannot forget that we must provide deterrents to the act of speeding in the first place. We need to reach a point where motorists are not being issued fixed-charge notices to start with. In that light, we would urge the Tánaiste to look at the issues of road safety, traffic policing and penalties in a holistic manner. I note the Tánaiste has done that in the past and will continue to do so. Hopefully, this time next year we will be looking at a reduction in the number of fixed-charge-penalty notices being issued, as well as closing this particular loophole. For that reason, we will be supporting the Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_541">
          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T18:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_856">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak briefly on this important Bill before us today, the Courts (No. 2) Bill 2016. It is sponsored by the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald, and I understand that it is a collaborative effort with the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. It will allow for the commencement at long last of section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, the third payment option, which I have been calling for in this House for a long number of years. Indeed, I have replies to parliamentary questions on it dating back to 2012 from the previous Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr. Alan Shatter, and the then Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar. At the time, the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, stated that his officials were in consultation with the relevant stakeholders, including the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda, regarding the commencement of section 44 of the 2010 Act, and that he expected to receive an update on those consultations shortly - that was four and a half years ago. The Minister, Deputy Varadkar, undertook to immediately commence section 44 as soon as the Department of Justice and Equality advised that the technical and administrative measures are resolved. Here we are, four and a half years later.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> In 2013, I received a similar reply from the former Minister, Mr. Shatter. He referred to a working group on this area. The working group in question is the criminal justice (fixed-charge-processing system) working group, which was set up to examine the serious failings in the processing of fixed charge notices and application of penalty points for road traffic offences. Currently, if a person is convicted of a fixed-charge offence, he or she is issued with a fixed-charge notice indicating the detail of the offence or offences and giving him or her 28 days to pay the specified fine. A further payment period of 28 days is then permitted with a 50% increase in the fine amount - a total of 56 days to pay - if the fixed-charge notice remains unpaid.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> The Bill before us finally provides the legislative framework to allow for the commencement of section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 2010, also known as the third payment option. This will provide motorists with a third and final opportunity to pay the fixed charge plus 100% extra and, therefore, to avoid a court appearance. The third fixed-charge notice, FCN, most importantly, will be issued alongside the summons for the court appearance, thereby putting a stop to the practice of those incurring FCNs attending court and claiming that the FCNs were never received. This practice generally culminated in the case being thrown out, no fine paid and no penalty points being applied to the licence. This practice is widespread and, legally, there seems to be little that a judge can do but accept the word of the person before him or her, meaning that tens of thousands of fixed-charge offences were thrown out of the courts each year.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> This short Bill will amend section 1 of the Courts (No. 3) Act 1986. Section 2 of the Courts (No. 2) Bill 2016 inserts a subsection into section 1 of the 1986 Act, making six amendments in the administrative procedures of printing and issuing summonses.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Paragraph (a) of subsection 2(a) provides for information sharing to allow a print-service provider print a summons and fixed charge notice. Paragraph (b) allows for the processing of batches of summonses and paragraphs (c), (d), (e) and (f) make provisions for the definitions around the effecting of the summons and true copies of the summons. Section 3 of today’s Bill deals specifically with the issuing of a summons to a member of An Garda Síochána when he or she has allegedly committed a road traffic offence. A summons to a garda will no longer have to be signed by a judge as is currently the case under section 88(3) of the Courts of Justice Act 1924.</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> I warmly welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy passage through the House. However, I will use the opportunity of this debate to raise five or six closely related matters, which I hope the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality will address. The Departments of Justice and Equality and Transport, Tourism and Sport must work closely together to administer road traffic law. On 3 November last, I tabled a parliamentary question on the wording of the summons to inform persons of the legal requirement to present their driving licence to the court and the penalties for failing to do so. This is section 22 of the Road Traffic Act 2002. The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality replied on the issue but the matter still has not been effectively addressed. When will this be rectified? The enforcement of section 22 remains a huge issue in our road safety legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_862"> In November 2015, Judge Marie Keane dismissed the 21 cases before her for the offence of failing to produce their licences in court and ruled that the summonses were "fundamentally flawed", because a person who comes before the court is entitled to know the consequences that flow from not having produced their licence. What has been done since this ruling to correct the wording on the summonses so that the Garda can begin to prosecute again? In November 2015 a reply from the Tánaiste stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_863">I am informed by the Garda authorities that in the first instance an offence wording is created by An Garda Síochána. Following approval by the DPP the approval details are forwarded to the Courts Service for offence coding, and returned to An Garda Síochána for uploading onto the Garda Pulse System. This then allows a member of An Garda Síochána to apply for a summons by inputting the specific offence code assigned to the particular offence in respect of which they are creating the summons for.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">It is a complicated system.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> It is now 15 months since Judge Keane’s ruling and despite many promises of an "urgent report" I have not received an update. In a reply to a parliamentary question on 15 November 2016 the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_866">Insofar as the wording of the relevant summonses is concerned, An Garda Síochána is engaging with the prosecution authorities in relation to these issues, which I understand are complex ones, and not necessarily related solely to the wording of summonses. As the Deputy will be aware, I have asked An Garda Síochána for an urgent report in this regard. In addition, the wording on the summonses and other related matters are being considered by the Fixed Charge Processing Group which is jointly chaired by my Department and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">What is the outcome of this consideration by the group on this matter? </p>
          <p eId="para_868"> It is the responsibility of An Garda Síochána to serve summonses. Figures from replies to parliamentary questions show that this is not being done in 37% to 85% of traffic cases across the country. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality must work together on this ineffective system and try to find solutions. It is difficult to understand how the reasons put forward by An Garda Síochána could account for the figures. I will offer some random examples. In Manorhamilton it is 85%. It is a small area where most people are likely to be known to each other and to the gardaí and where the residents are unlikely to live in multi-occupancy dwellings inaccessible to gardaí. The non-serving rate is 67% in Skibbereen and 62% in Ballaghaderreen in County Roscommon. The reason provided to me in a reply to a parliamentary question on 15 November 2016, in which I requested information on speeding summonses, was: </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_869">The figures provided by the Courts Service indicate that a significant percentage of cases are struck out for non-service. My officials are seeking clarification from the Courts Service and An Garda Síochána as to the reason for this figure being at this level. It should however be noted in this respect that a working group [yet another working group] was established by An Garda Síochána to examine how the rate of summons serving can be improved and to regularly monitor the level of summons service throughout the country. While this group has reported improvements in the rate of successful service of summons, challenges remain in relation to effecting service of summons in certain circumstances, relating to such matters as inaccurate address data, persons moving address, or living in multi-occupancy dwellings or other settings which make service difficult. In addition, certain persons will take steps to evade service.</p>
          <p eId="para_870"> In the period from January 2015 to October 2016 there were 66,771 offences for speeding listed in courts across the country. Of these, there were just 14,572 convictions, which is just over 20%. Of those convictions only 6,165 had their licences recorded, which is 42%, 2,923 were dismissed, 30,618 were classified as "strike out not served", equating to 45% or almost half, and 676 received the court poor box, which is technically illegal. The total number of 48,745 means that 73% of offences listed resulted in non-conviction.</p>
          <p eId="para_871"> The third matter I wish to raise relating to the performance of the Department of Justice and Equality in respect of road traffic law concerns figures released by the Road Safety Authority, RSA, which show that 96% of drivers disqualified in court in 2015 did not surrender their licences. The figures were provided to the great campaigning road safety group PARC - Promoting Awareness Responsibility and Care on our roads. Susan Gray and her colleagues in PARC have done much work to bring forward road safety issues in the House. Recent figures released by the RSA to <i>The Irish Times </i>showed that almost 8,000 drivers who have multiple concurrent disqualifications on their licences continue to flout the law by driving. These are drivers who were ordered off our roads for drink driving or causing death or serious injury or both. <i>The Irish Times </i>also reported that banned drivers are responsible for the deaths of between 11 and 14 other drivers every year. We already know that 521 drivers were disqualified at the time they were convicted of dangerous driving causing death or serious injury in the period from January 2013 to March 2015. To date, PARC and I have failed to establish how many of those drivers were already disqualified at the time they caused death or serious injury or both. Perhaps that is another matter the Minister could progress urgently.</p>
          <p eId="para_872"> The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, has always been a thoughtful and assiduous Member of the House and is equally so as a Minister of State. There appear to be huge lacunae in road traffic law enforcement and administration which must be resolved. I mentioned to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport earlier today that he had promised four legislative measures relating to his responsibility for road traffic law. Perhaps it is time to have a consolidated Bill. It is something on which the Government could work. I tabled a parliamentary question for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, in which I requested the full report on the research the RSA had carried out on the 8,000 figure I mentioned earlier. The Minister replied:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_873">I am aware of the Road Safety Authority (RSA) research indicating that there may be as many as 8,000 disqualified drivers on our roads, and that a number of them have been responsible for fatal or major collisions in recent years. My Department has been advised by the RSA that this research was not the subject of a formal report, and the RSA research included the use of data provided by the National Vehicle and Driver File to the RSA. ... I would point out that under new powers provided to the Gardaí under the Road Traffic Act 2014, the Gardaí (since June 2015) can now arrest drivers who are detected driving while disqualified.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> Another issue is the fact that gardaí have informed PARC representatives that occasionally when they try to check an individual on the Garda PULSE computer system, it is not possible to identify the correct person. They say this is due to the fact that there could be several recorded dates of birth for that person and differing addresses. This results in multiple PULSE identifications and they say that it is not possible for gardaí to be confident they are identifying the correct person. What is being done to identify multiple identifications on the Garda PULSE computer system? Is the Minister sure that the PULSE system is fit for purpose? We have not supported An Garda Síochána sufficiently regarding IT structures in the computer and Internet age. The Minister of State will recall that it was not long ago when he and I were attempting to contact our local Garda headquarters and we were unable to e-mail them. It is only in the last few years that we have been able to e-mail our local superintendent or chief superintendent.</p>
          <p eId="para_875"> I also recently requested an update on the drink driving cases which were affected by the issuing of Garda reports in both Irish and English, but I have been informed that the information I requested cannot be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">However, the Tánaiste told me that the matter was determined by Mr. Justice Noonan at the High Court on 21 September 2015 and the Garda Síochána sought to have all cases where this issue had relevance before the courts at the time adjourned pending an appeal of the High Court decision. In certain cases, the presiding judge did not accede to that request and the matter was struck out or dismissed. The Tánaiste also informed me that “following the judgement by Edwards J., at the Court of Appeal on 10 May 2016, all district officers liaised with the respective law officers in so far as the cases in their districts were affected by the outcome of these proceedings to ensure that all cases affected by this issue, which have not been finalised, are brought back before the courts." It would be useful if the Tánaiste were able to come here and give us an update on this serious matter, which has led to another major gap in people owning up to their responsibilities regarding infractions of road traffic law.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> Before Christmas, we had a very good discussion in the House, in which Deputy Jonathan O'Brien and others participated, on the Road Traffic Bill 2016. Most people still feel more emphasis needs to be put on learner drivers. I have recently been asking questions about this and have been trying to determine the extent of the problem with unaccompanied learner drivers being involved in fatal and serious road traffic collisions. At the beginning of this year, I received a reply to a parliamentary question from the Tánaiste informing me that the number of fatal traffic collisions involving unaccompanied learner drivers was seven in 2012, four in 2013, eight in 2014, 16 in 2015 and seven up to 29 November 2016. The number of unaccompanied learner drivers involved in serious road traffic collisions was 22 in 2012, ten in 2013, 32 in 2014, 24 in 2015 and 24 up to 29 of November 2016. We also had a long discussion about insurance of cars being driven by learner drivers during the lengthy discussions on the Road Traffic Bill. I hope the changes in the law will move towards eliminating this scourge and the numbers of deaths and serious injuries being caused by unaccompanied learner drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_878"> I would like the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality to urgently examine a number of provisions, such as addressing the wording of summons and the timeframe to have changes completed, for those to be issued along with the fixed-charge notice, but also for those to allow prosecutions under section 22 of the Road Traffic Act 2002 to recommence. They could be included in the Bill, if the Tánaiste were to take swift and decisive action. I would also like to see a provision stating that where the licence or permit is produced on conviction, all the details specified in the licence or learner permit, including the licence number, must be forwarded by the court to the national vehicle and driver file, NVDF, and the Road Safety Authority, RSA, within five working days, including all of the names and contact details of the persons who failed to produce their licences on conviction. I tried to put it into the Road Traffic Act before Christmas. For this, we would need a direct or electronic link between prosecutions as recorded on the Courts Service's criminal case tracking system, CCTS, and the fixed-charge notice originally issued by the Garda Síochána. We need stronger penalties for those who do not surrender their licences and improved follow-up procedures to ensure that proper tracking is taking place of licences and the endorsements received on the licences.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> Last year, we were all very disappointed that the number of deaths on Irish roads increased so significantly to 188. Deputies on all sides made huge efforts to reform road traffic law during the previous decade and a half. We brought the numbers down from the horrendous levels that used to apply in the 1960s and 1970s. Still, last year 188 families were totally devastated and thousands of families have members who were seriously injured. We must take a very proactive approach. The Government, particularly the Tánaiste and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, could make a significant contribution, if they wished, perhaps by consolidating road traffic law and having the courage to bring a consolidated Bill before the House. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T19:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_880">I, too, am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill. Deputy Broughan has been pursuing it like a dog with a bone for years and I commend him on his efforts. There are many inadequacies in the system and that should not be the case. While the Bill is trying to deal with them, we must consider other areas. The Minister is examining enforcement and the wording of summonses. We get a so-called clever or industrious solicitor or barrister. I mean no disrespect to my good colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan, in his new job here. We hear there is a good fellow in Mallow or a great fellow in Tipperary and that either one is able to deal with it. They come at enormous cost. Sometimes they produce the goods by holding up whoever is acting on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP. Our legal representatives have a role to play in respect of road safety. They sure do. It is not a case of defending the indefensible. They must have some moral standing and know that right is right and wrong is wrong. It does not mean that a person is clever or ingenious if they can get somebody off the hook for a heinous crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> According to the figures, last year was shocking in terms of what happened on our roads. The variations in the failures to serve summonses in different areas throughout the country beggars belief. I am not trying to single out any gardaí for any reason. It is difficult now. At one time, we all knew everybody who lived in our communities, as the Minister of State would know, given that he comes from a rural constituency. This has vastly changed and we do not know where people reside. It is very difficult. During the past 15 months, batches of summonses were not delivered. The figures were quoted by others. It is amazing to see. How can one area be so good?</p>
          <p eId="para_882"> The PULSE system is not up to standard. The severe lack of investment in the Garda Síochána regarding numbers and, above all, equipment, during the past ten years is taking its toll. Several Garda stations in my area have no PULSE system and scarcely any Internet coverage. We can keep the Garda stations open and I am a great advocate that there is no replacement for the garda on the beat, <i>in situ</i>, in the station. Gardaí get to know the people. There is an excellent garda, Niall O'Halloran, in my area. He has got in there in the past few years and has got to know the people. He attends matches in the area and is involved in young people's sport. He is also involved with the community alert and text alert systems and people know him. There is no replacement for that. Gardaí from 20 miles away who arrive in a squad car will not get the same co-operation from people. Like the parish priest, if one stands in people's kitchens, one will have a full chapel. They must get down and meet the people, and they must be allowed to do it. There is no point appointing a token garda responsible for districts and the community alert person if he or she is not left there but is always pulled back into the town. While I know they are needed there, country people are also entitled to their service.</p>
          <p eId="para_883"> Use of the poor box in courts has been criticised. It is at the discretion of the justices. Many very needy organisations benefit greatly from it and would have been in fierce trouble over the years if they had not. Practice varied in different court areas, depending on who was sitting. That is fine. They are entitled to make the decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> I cannot believe the figures supplied to PARC on the number of licences that were not surrendered by people who were put off the roads. What kind of court system and lack of communication is there? If a person is put off the road, I would have thought his or her licence would have to be proffered there and then in court. I am delighted PARC does such good work. This is a major area. It is shocking that people are driving without licences, particularly as this means that they have no insurance either.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">Deputy Broughan mentioned the figures on those involved in serious and fatal accidents who have been banned from driving. I believe those people should never be let on the roads again because they are so reckless to have driven without a licence or insurance. I accept that a driver has to have a licence to get insurance but there must be some follow-up. </p>
          <p eId="para_886"> Modern IT systems allow for cross-compliance in agriculture, as the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is aware, and in everything else too. The figures show there is one garda for every 300 people and one agricultural official for every 30 people, so there are a lot more agricultural officials. The Minister of State is wincing but those figures stand up, although they might have changed in recent years. We need a modern, up-to-date system linking the courts, the Garda PULSE system and Garda patrol cars. Some of the newer traffic corps vehicles have high-spec equipment, but only very few. More are needed, particularly given the huge increase in the level of crime and the number of burglaries. Gardaí need to be able to check cars using cameras. I have seen how well these cameras work and how they can tell if a car has passed its NCT and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_887"> I support the Minister, Deputy Ross, in dealing with the many road safety issues. In some areas, however, he is looking in the wrong place. One fatality is one too many, and to have had 188 last year on the roads is appalling. However, it is not all down to one issue; there are several factors at work. The Rural Independent Group had a debate two weeks ago on the standard of the roads and the deterioration of their surfaces. Although we have had a very good winter, the weather was inclement recently and I heard appeals to drivers on RTE radio to be careful because of the damage to the road surfaces. That is also a huge issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_888"> We need to deal with the law preventing the cutting of hedges, which is pure nonsense. To quote Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, there is no bird foolish enough to nest on the side of the road where there are lorries passing, so they go well into the fields to nest. I am involved with the Association of Farm Contractors Ireland and we have been lobbying for years to allow the hedges to be cut. We discussed this in the talks on the programme for Government last year but, lo and behold, we have to get permission from the county council. Why can we not just have permission in the interests of road safety and of saving lives? When a tractor is coming out of a field, it is probably 7 ft. out of the field before the cab is out and it could be 10 ft. if there is an implement on the front of the tractor. There could be 5 ft. of scrub and bush that is nothing but rubbish. If it is cut clean, the birds would have plenty of time to mate and hatch in the fields. I am all for our bird species but it is ridiculous how the Wildlife Acts are directly impeding road safety. It is contradictory as well as being unsafe and unwise. Farmers will cut the hedges.</p>
          <p eId="para_889"> There is also legislation governing tree felling. Every landowner should be instructed to cut the trees. The councils are like a dog in a manger; they will not cut them themselves and they will not instruct the farmers. In spite of the change in legislation, we have to get permission from the council to allow us to cut them.</p>
          <p eId="para_890"> The Minister, Deputy Ross, has to examine many areas of road safety. It is not as simple as pointing to speed or to country drivers because there are many factors. While I am not against speed cameras, the figures released by the Department of Justice and Equality in August 2016 revealed that the State spent almost €88 million on the enforcement of private speed vans in the space of five years. I see these vans as a money-collecting and money-making operation, although that is not a criticism. I had occasion to contact one of the vans recently when I was contacted because a van was close to a wake that was taking place. I knocked on the van door and made my point to the man, and he left because it was a huge local funeral and people were distressed at the idea of him being there. In fairness, that is the only interaction I have had with them. Thankfully, I have not received any fines as it turns out I am not a fast driver. However, I never see them in the places where there are fatal accidents. I have appealed to the Garda to put up checkpoints and speed cameras at serious bends and dangerous stretches of road but it has not happened. They are put in trick-of-the-loop places and the vans are sitting in the towns in 80 km/h, 60 km/h and 50 km/h zones. Quite honestly, drivers do not know where they are and they are getting fooled.</p>
          <p eId="para_891"> The figures show the State paid the private safety camera operators the phenomenal sum of €87,951,268 from the time they were deployed in 2010 to 22 July last year, while they recouped just €32,689,120 in fines during that same time. What if that money was invested in the Garda? Those figures need to be seriously examined, given the hardship imposed on people driving to work and so on. While I am not condoning speeding, where drivers are a couple of kilometres per hour over the limit in 80 km/h, 60 km/h and 50 km/h zones, there should be some latitude, particularly as the signage is not great.</p>
          <p eId="para_892"> There has been recent investment, including in CLÁR areas, which I welcome. For example, flashing lights and signs telling drivers their speed are located on the edges of villages and towns. This is very effective and the new schemes mean the community can be involved in erecting these signs, which can be moved around as needed. This is very important. There is no doubting the impact of the safety camera regime on reducing road fatalities and accidents, particularly in areas that have been blighted by these incidents over the years, and I am not suggesting that they be removed entirely. Accountability is needed, however, given the amount of taxpayers' money required to run them, the amount of money coming back in and the question of who is making the profits. As I said, I seriously question where they are located. I am sure the Minister of State has seen them located in silly places whereas, in places where there have been multiple fatalities, I am told it is too dangerous for the cameras to be located. It can be dangerous but there are areas where a safe location can be found, such as at Duggan's bends near Cahir, but for some reason they are not located there.</p>
          <p eId="para_893"> In each year from 2012 to 2015 it cost the State more than €17 million to maintain the contract, with a cost of almost €16 million in 2011. These contracts are ridiculous and not fit for purpose but they are lucrative. While I welcome the issues of road safety raised in this debate, we need to do more. For the period from 2010 to date, revenue generated from the safety camera contract has totalled more than €32 million, despite all the millions pumped in. This means that there is just more than €54 million in the difference between the operation of the contract and the revenue that it creates. We need a much more detailed conversation about how the money might be better spent, in particular in terms of robustly resourcing the Garda traffic corps.</p>
          <p eId="para_894"> I want to salute the Garda traffic corps, which operates under Inspector Eddie Golden in my area of Tipperary. I know many of its members, who work hard and who have got involved in visiting schools and visiting farmers on mart days. They have open nights and open days and they have met with the Association of Farm Contractors Ireland. They have discussed changes to many pieces of legislation, which has been very beneficial. I have learned much from them, such as the correct towing of trailers, the correct axle weights and so on. We cannot get enough of that. What we badly need is a programme for transition-year students. I have seen an excellent programme in the Abbey school in Tipperary town, where the students take lessons on a track around a field. This gives them great confidence and is money well spent, given they are the drivers of tomorrow. They need to be educated differently from the way we were educated because the roads are so busy now. No one is taking account of the ten-fold multiplication in the volume of traffic in recent years. While it is never mentioned, it is a huge issue. We need to have those training courses and we need the traffic corps and ordinary gardaí visiting the schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_895"> I am disappointed the Bill has not addressed the issue of pedestrians being killed on the roads. When it is dark, no one can see them. It is frightening but I come across it every winter. When a person is driving along the road, they see something and they might get time to swerve or they might not. It should be compulsory to wear reflective jackets in the winter months. We need to be creative in this regard. I am sure the RSA spends a lot of money producing these jackets but we have to produce reflective jackets that young people will wear.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">We see them wearing all kinds of things now, especially at Christmas, with flashing lights on gansies and rudaí mar sin. We see all kinds of creative writing, different branding and different T-shirts made with all kinds of equipment. Why can we not be creative in order that it will be cool to wear this because it is vital? I often see kids getting off school buses. Thank God, the evenings are bright now but before and since Christmas, I see kids getting off buses and alighting onto the road. It is black and they do not seem to understand. They have big heavy schools bags. They struggle across the road with the weight of them. They cannot even run with them. That is another area that has to be addressed. Why can we not have school bags with flashing lights? We can have them on everything. As they can be bought in shops to wear as armbands, why can they not be a compulsory part of school uniform or school fleeces? They can be nice and trendy and cool to wear and they will be safe. Surely road safety is more important than any uniform.</p>
          <p eId="para_897"> There is trauma for a driver when he or she hits somebody like that. There is trauma for the person who is hit but for the driver also, who is totally innocent and unable to avoid the accident because somebody walked in front of him or her in the road wearing black clothes. The Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, and his officials in the RSA need to focus on that issue also. They need to get down and dirty and go out and consult in the communities. They should consult the students. They can be very creative. They could have competitions as we often have in our community LEP group. Every year we have a community LEP competition, the young people make Christmas cards, and the ideas that come up are just fascinating. They must be consulted and engaged with. There must be areas for the tests they do. They are very good. The RSA and the Garda do them.</p>
          <p eId="para_898"> There have been startling revelations about the impact of an accident and the importance of wearing a safety belt if a person crashes. We are not fully aware of it ourselves. We should support the traffic corps and give it more resources and power. The investment in speed vans needs to be examined. They are a bit of a money making racket and are not in areas they should be. I am not blaming the people who operate them. They have a job to do. It is very lonely. There have been attacks on a number of them when there should not have been. It is a very lonely job sitting there for hours in those vans. I often thought there was nobody in them but there is.</p>
          <p eId="para_899"> We need to take an holistic approach. We need to have more co-operation between the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Courts Service. It is pretty efficient at handing out repossession orders and everything else when it suits, but how can there not be basic tracking for licenses? If one is disqualified from driving, one's licence should be handed up that day. If not, An Garda Síochána should be empowered to collect it within so many days. There must be a system like that. They have spent so much time collecting fines. That is a pure farce because there should be some other way of collecting a fine rather than wasting Garda time doing it. We should be efficient and let gardaí concentrate on road safety and dealing with criminals. That is what they are if they have been banned and have caused a serious accident or fatality when driving while banned.</p>
          <p eId="para_900"> There will need to be connectivity here, especially in the areas I mentioned. Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí. The young people will learn. Many people have criticised young drivers who drive with L-plates without a qualified driver. It is not always possible. I am not condoning it but we should get some other system. The way it is going in rural Ireland, we will have fewer buses and trains. I have to credit some insurance companies such as Aviva and others that offer certain discounts if one does tests with them. Young people go out and get the car and the provisional licence, do the theory test, do all the lessons, pass the test, put up their N-plates, drive and then go for insurance but the cost is sky-rocketing. The insurance companies must be brought to heel. They are not respecting the young people who do all that with enormous cost to their parents and enormous interest, passion and courage themselves. They learn how to drive, get their licence and celebrate, which is great, then put up their N-plates and cannot get insurance or are penalised with policies of €8,000, €9,000 or €10,000. It is just not fair. If they go off and do some mad things like break speed limits and crash, then we should penalise them but when they have their certificates and their training, which is more than we got when we started driving, and they have it recorded and have their N-plates up, they should not be screwed the way they are for insurance. Their parents cannot afford it. Where will the money come from in the country? They have to go to college. They have to go to Mass. They have to go to games. We do not have the DART or Luas or what they have in Dublin. The Road Safety Authority needs to focus on many other areas, with the Department of Justice and Equality to deal with this problem holistically, not pigeon-holing people and blaming them unnecessarily.</p>

        <speech by="#DavidStanton" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice_and_Equality" eId="spk_543">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy David Stanton)<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T19:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_901">On behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality who regrets that, owing to other official commitments, she cannot be here, I thank Deputies for their exchange of views and observations on the Courts (No. 2) Bill 2016. The broad political support that Members have given to this technically important Bill is also very much appreciated.</p>
          <p eId="para_902"> I also express my appreciation of the wider road safety and compliance concerns that have been raised during the discussion. They also need to be addressed, including in terms of the human cost and in the wider context of road safety and the Road Traffic Acts. Deputy Thomas P. Broughan listed five specific areas of concern. I will bring them to the attention of the Minister and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport. I listened very carefully to what the three Deputies who spoke had to say. I am quite impressed. I encourage all Deputies to continue pressing and thank Deputies who encourage road safety and have raised issues like this here and in committees. It is very important that this continues. I encourage Deputies to do this. As the last speaker said, we should continue to work to improve safety on the roads and reduce the numbers of deaths and injuries. That is crucially important and I thank Deputies for it. I will also inform the Tánaiste of Deputy Thomas P. Broughan's ongoing concerns, in particular. </p>
          <p eId="para_903"> Those concerns do not fall within the scope of this discrete, focused Bill but nevertheless it is a Bill which will technically underpin the enforcement of the wider road safety regime. For present purposes, our debate has been a further step towards enabling the introduction of the proposed new third payment option under a dual strategy, namely, the amendment for technical reasons under today’s Bill of section 1 of the Courts (No. 3) Act 1986, which deals with the issue of summonses for offences as a matter of administrative procedure and the commencement, once the proposed technical amendments set out in the Courts (No. 2) Bill have been made, of section 44 of the Road Traffic Act 2010 by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, in order that the third payment option can be put into practical effect. </p>
          <p eId="para_904"> The operative date for these changes, for which the necessary IT infrastructure has been put in place, is 1 June 2017. Hence the need to have the framework of this supporting Bill firmly in place before then. While the initial 2013 estimate of the number of cases that may be at issue under this reform initiative was at the 7,500 mark, it is now understood from the Courts Service that in more recent terms it would estimate this figure to be around 2,000 cases per year. It has been emphasised in providing this latest figure that it is very much an estimated one on account of the variety of approaches being taken at judicial level to such cases and the fact that the relevant figures fluctuate from court to court and from year to year. However, as Members will appreciate, there is no room for complacency and I am confident that the Courts (No. 2) Bill 2016 will provide the technical basis upon which to address an ongoing gap in the system whereby persons may otherwise continue to try to circumvent the law, a fixed charge and penalty points. </p>
          <p eId="para_905"> The benefits anticipated from the Courts (No. 2) Bill and the subsequent introduction of the third payment option include the following: an increase in instances of detected road traffic infringements resulting in penalty points; a reduction in the number of cases coming to court, thereby saving time for the Courts Service and An Garda Síochána; an increase in the number of persons taking up the first or second payment options; and improved service for members of the public who do not receive or overlook to pay an original fixed-charge notice. Deputies will agree it is also important to remember we are not just addressing a legal technicality in this instance. We are also being fairer to the majority of drivers on our roads who behave within the law every day. By the same token, the introduction of the third payment option is a key component in a series of ongoing measures to improve the operation of the fixed-charge processing system under the overall aegis of the Government's Road Safety Strategy 2013-2020. In this spirit, with the Tánaiste, I look forward to our ongoing debate of the Courts (No. 2) Bill 2016 as it progresses through its forthcoming Stages, including Committee Stage in the Dáil when, as the Tánaiste explained yesterday, the Government will bring forward an amendment to section 3. </p>

          <p eId="para_910">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."  I am very pleased to present the Bill to the House. It is a relatively short Bill which focuses specifically on commitments on bail in the programme for Government. The programme for Government commits to the preparation and fast-tracking of legislation aimed at providing for stricter bail terms for repeat serious offenders, strengthening Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail, increasing the use of curfews and introducing electronic tagging for those on bail where requested by the Garda. These are important objectives which should command support in the House and which will increase protection for the public and victims of crime but which can be achieved while also respecting the rights of those facing criminal charges. They form part of a wider programme of criminal law reform which includes, for example, legislation that had the full support of the House, the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act and the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill which was published in recent weeks and has yet to be brought into the House. </p>
          <p eId="para_911"> In that regard, I also inform Members that it is my intention to seek Government approval for a legislative proposal to allow An Garda Síochána, on a statutory basis, to detain intoxicated persons in Garda stations where they are considered to be a danger to themselves or others. Obviously, we are backing up this legislative reform with sustained investment in Garda resources which a recovering economy is enabling us to do. Deputies are very familiar with the programme of investment that has been taking place and also with the increase in Garda numbers. By 2021 the Garda workforce should comprise a total of 21,000 personnel, to include 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians. We are investing €330 million, including €205 million under the capital plan, in much needed Garda information and communications technology, ICT, infrastructure between 2016 and 2021. There is a good deal of catching up to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_912"> Operation Thor which was launched in November 2015 has led to a sharp decline in the rate of burglary crime, with the most recent Central Statistics Office, CSO, crime figures showing a decrease of 31% in the number of burglaries for the 12 months ending 30 September 2016. I acknowledge that one crime is one too many. If one has been the victim of a burglary, it is certainly one crime too many. There has been a drop in the number of burglaries, as well as welcome reductions in other categories of property crime, including theft, the rate for which is down by 14.6%, while the rate for robbery is down by 11.1%. Overall, nine out of the 14 crime categories in the CSO classification showed a decrease. I have spoken on other occasions about the ongoing work we are doing with the CSO and the work being done within An Garda Síochána to make sure the statistics provided are as robust as possible. That is greatly helped by the investment in ICT infrastructure.</p>
          <p eId="para_913"> I will turn to the provisions of the Bill and outline what is proposed. Section 2 expands the factors which a court may take into account in refusing bail where this is reasonably considered to be necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by the person concerned. Currently, one of these factors is previous convictions of the accused. Section 2 specifically provides that a court may take into account the extent to which the number and frequency of previous convictions of the accused person for serious offences indicate persistent serious offending by him or her. It also enables a court to take into account the nature and likelihood of any danger to the life or personal safety of any person or danger to the community that may be presented by the release on bail of a person charged with an offence punishable by ten years imprisonment or more, in other words, a very serious offence. The decision to refuse bail will, of course, always be a matter for the court. However, these additional factors which I believe will be extremely helpful and which the court may take into account will constitute significantly strengthened guidance from the Legislature on the factors relevant to decisions on the granting or refusal of bail.</p>
          <p eId="para_914"> Section 3 expands the number of conditions which may be set by a court in granting bail. A court has general discretion to attach conditions to bail, but section 6 of the Bail Act 1997 also lists specific conditions that may be set such as having to reside in a particular place, to report to a particular Garda station, to surrender a passport, to refrain from going to certain places and to refrain from having contact with certain people. Three new specific conditions are being added to this list in section 3, namely, to refrain from direct or indirect contact with the victim of the alleged offence or any member of his or her family, to refrain from driving a vehicle where the person is charged with a serious driving offence and to observe a night-time curfew, whereby the person on bail could be required to stay in a specified place between 9 p.m. and 6 a.m. the following morning. These conditions are very important in terms of personal safety and very much based on the direct experience An Garda Síochána in managing various offences and cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_915"> Section 3 also provides for the arrest without warrant of a person on bail in carefully defined circumstances which respect the constitutional rights of persons facing criminal charges. The Garda already has, under section 6 of the Bail Act 1997, a power to arrest a person on bail who is about to contravene a condition of bail but only on a warrant of arrest issued by the court. There are legal constraints on the extent to which the law on arresting a person on bail can be extended beyond this. Section 3 contains a limited but important power of arrest without warrant of a person on bail who is contravening a condition of bail and where the arresting garda considers arrest to be necessary to prevent harm to, interference with or intimidation of the victim of the alleged offence, a witness to the alleged offence, or any person with whom the person on bail is not permitted to contact as a condition of bail. This is very much in line with the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill that we will be introducing in which we consider this very much from the victim's perspective or lens and in terms of providing for his or her safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_916"> Section 4 deals with electronic monitoring. The Bail Act 1997 was amended in 2007 to permit a court granting bail to make it a condition of bail that the person’s movements be monitored electronically. This provision has not been brought into force largely because of concerns about how best to operate a system of electronic monitoring in a way that is sustainable and targeted. Section 4 amends the existing uncommenced provision by linking electronic monitoring with an application by the prosecution. The objective is to ensure, as far as possible, electronic monitoring is used in bail cases on a consistent and sustainable basis and that it is focused on those cases where it will prove most effective. In that regard, in parallel with the passage of the Bill, a working group has been established to identify how best this provision might be operated, including the categories of offences or offenders most suitable for electronic monitoring and the making of contractual arrangements for the provision of the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_917"> Section 5 introduces an important new provision regarding the evidence a court may hear when deciding on an application for bail. It will enable a court, on application by a garda, to hear evidence from the victim of the alleged offence as to the likelihood of direct, indirect or attempted interference by the accused with the victim or a member of his or her family and as to the nature and seriousness of any danger to any person that may be presented by the release of the accused on bail. The section also provides that such evidence, where the victim is a child under the age of 14 years or a person with a mental disability, may be given on the victim’s behalf by another person such as a parent or guardian or a family member.</p>
          <p eId="para_918"> Section 6 requires a court to give reasons for its decision to grant or refuse bail or impose conditions of bail. Deputies and members of the public often raise this issue and ask why was such a person was given bail. The objective of this provision is to promote the greatest possible transparency in the hearing of bail applications and the greatest possible understanding of decisions of the courts. This is a very important provision in people having an increased understanding of why and how courts make decisions in different cases. These are clear and focused provisions which will enhance the powers of courts in deciding whether to grant bail and which will improve the legitimate control which they may exercise over those granted bail. They will enhance the protection of victims of crime and those at risk of crime, while respecting the rights of those accused of crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">As I said at the beginning of my contribution, the balances are very important. We have been very careful to be extremely conscious of the rights of the victims, as well as those accused of crime. There must be a balance. The provisions of the Bill strike the right balance in improving the law on bail. I hope they will get support across the House. I look forward to hearing the views and comments of everybody taking part in the debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOCallaghan" eId="spk_547">
          <from>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T19:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_920">In 1966, a man called Roger O'Callaghan was charged with a number of criminal offences, including larceny, breaking and entering, malicious damage and assaulting a member of An Garda Síochána. He was remanded in custody by An Garda Síochána. He sought bail and when he went to the High Court, he was refused bail. One of the grounds on which he was refused bail was that the court ruled there was a serious risk he would commit further offences while on bail. He then appealed the matter to the Supreme Court, as he was entitled to do. When the matter came before the Supreme Court, it delivered a very significant judgment entitled People (AG) <i>v</i>. O'Callaghan. In that decision, the Supreme Court ruled that bail could not be refused on grounds that an accused might commit further offences while on bail. The court at the time, including Chief Justice Ó Dálaigh and Mr. Justice Walsh, ruled that the reason this could not be a ground was that it was a form of what they said was preventive justice, which at that time, they said, was unknown to our legal system and contrary to the true purpose of bail.</p>
          <p eId="para_921"> That was in 1966. The law, however, changed in respect of this matter in 1996, some 30 years after that decision, because the people decided in the referendum on the 16th amendment to the Constitution to change the law in respect of the grounds upon which bail could be granted. The article that was inserted into the Constitution, Article 40.4.6°, states: "Provision may be made by law for the refusal of bail by a court to a person charged with a serious offence where it is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person." Members may recall that in advance of that referendum in 1996, there was a very full and considered debate. People were on either side of the debate but, ultimately, the people decided, as they were entitled to do, that the law should be changed. The law is now as I have outlined. The provision in Article 40.4.6° may come within the categorisation of what Chief Justice Ó Dálaigh referred to as preventive justice, but so be it. The people decided to change the law in 1996 and that is what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_922"> The law that was introduced on foot of that amendment to the Constitution was the Bail Act 1997, which the Bill going through the Dáil at present seeks to amend. The Bail Act 1997 expressly provides in section 2: "Where an application for bail is made by a person charged with a serious offence, a court may refuse the application if the court is satisfied that such refusal is reasonably considered necessary to prevent the commission of a serious offence by that person", The section continues to outline the factors that may be taken into account by a court when exercising that jurisdiction. It is proposed in the legislation before the House to amend section 2 by adding further sections to it and to amend other sections of the Bail Act 1997. I will turn to them presently, but it is important to identify some core principles in respect of the contentious issue of bail. I wish to put forward a number of principles.</p>
          <p eId="para_923"> First, since people are presumed innocent until proven guilty, the assumption should be that bail is granted. This is because no one is convicted and guilty of an offence until he or she goes through due process and is convicted by the courts. The second principle I wish to refer to is that most offences for which people are prosecuted are summary offences. Bail is not an issue in respect of these offences. Third, bail is sought where people are remanded in custody for what are referred to as serious indictable offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_924"> Fourth, in most applications, bail is granted with conditions, and a significant factor for a court in determining whether to grant bail is the attitude of An Garda Síochána to the application for bail. A court will not be completely subservient in any way to the attitude of An Garda Síochána, but this is one of the factors taken into account. </p>
          <p eId="para_925"> Fifth, those who are granted bail sometimes have conditions applied to their grant of bail. These conditions have a particular purpose, that is, restraining the person from interfering with witnesses, fleeing the jurisdiction or committing further offences. I welcome the fact that in this legislation, some of the conditions will be extended and some of the grounds on which bail can be granted will include the introduction and application of electronic monitoring. Some people may think this is an oppressive interference in the rights of individuals. However, when one considers the alternative is that these individuals may likely be remanded in custody, we must recognise that it provides them with a lesser of two evils. Rather than being remanded in custody pending their trial, they have electronic monitoring attached to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_926"> Sixth, unfortunately, we still have significant examples in this country of people committing crimes on bail. The logic or incentive as to why people would commit crimes on bail is that they know a serious prosecution may be coming down the line for which they may be likely to receive a custodial sentence. In effect, they may say there is no deterrent to their committing other offences since in all likelihood the sentences they would receive would run concurrently with the former prosecution. This is sometimes referred to as anecdotal evidence. However, there is in fact actual statistical evidence in respect of this matter. I commend our colleague, Deputy Noel Grealish, on getting information from the Central Statistics Office on criminal offences that have been committed by people on bail. I will outline these statistics as a seventh relevant principle. We know from figures provided by the Central Statistics Office in 2016 that 89 people were killed, 123 kidnappings were conducted and 237 sexual offences were committed in the past ten years by people who were out on bail.</p>
          <p eId="para_927"> It would be remiss of us not to record in this House the examples of five individuals who were killed by people who were on bail. I do this not for any sensationalist reason but because it is appropriate we recognise there is a basis for seeking to strengthen the bail laws. It is not simply in order to appease some unjustifiable concern or some concern that is not based on facts. We know that Sylvia Roche Kelly, a mother who was killed in a Limerick hotel room in December 2007, was killed by a man who was on bail for two crimes at the time. One of those crimes was the assault of a female taxi driver; the other was for the false imprisonment of a child. We know that Garda Tony Golden who gave his life while working as a member of An Garda Síochána was shot dead at a house in Omeath, in the Acting Chairman's constituency, in October 2015 by a man who was on bail at the time. We know that the Swiss student Manuela Riedo who was raped and killed in 2007 was killed by a man who was on bail at the time for a violent assault against his ex-girlfriend and who is now serving life sentences. We know that a man called Paul Kelly was killed in April 2007 by a Dublin man who was out on bail and had 26 previous convictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">We know that a man called John McManus was killed in February 2009 by a man who was out on bail. I cannot be sure, or assure the House, that those five individuals would be alive today if the persons had not been out on bail but it is relevant to our debate and to whether our bail laws should be strengthened that they were killed by persons who were out on bail.</p>
          <p eId="para_929"> We had a good discussion at the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality this morning about penal policy and reform. There was universal agreement there and I am sure there would be here that there are probably too many people in jail. There are many in jail for non-violent offences such as a failure to pay fines. That is an area we need to examine as policy and law makers. There are also people for whom prison is absolutely necessary. There is unfortunately no other appropriate punishment for people who are extremely violent, who are involved in sexual assaults and who are a threat to the community. That does not mean that once people are imprisoned we do not seek to rehabilitate, assist and transform them. Our society needs to be protected from people who are violent or dangerous. I hope we do not get into a stereotypical analysis of bail as though this is an issue where civil libertarians are on one side and those who say lock them up are on the other. I would have thought the consensus in Ireland is that we would like to have fewer people in our jails. People who are a threat to the community, however, need unfortunately to be put behind bars. There are circumstances where people out on bail have committed offences and the court should refuse bail if it believes those individuals are likely to commit a serious offence while out on bail. </p>
          <p eId="para_930"> The proposal in the Bill to amend section 2 of the Bail Act 1997 is not as significant as it would appear. In fact, section 2(2)(a) to (f), inclusive, and section 2(2)(f)(i) are already in the 1997 Act while subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) are being added. Subparagraph (ii) provides that the following matters can be taken into account when a court is deciding whether to grant bail, namely, "the extent to which the number and frequency of any previous convictions of the accused person for serious offences indicate persistent serious offending by the accused person,". If the previous convictions indicate somebody continually breaks the law in respect of serious offences that should be taken as a ground for refusing a grant of bail. Paragraph (iii) states "the nature and likelihood of any danger to the life or personal safety of any person or danger to the community that may be presented by the release on bail of a person charged with an offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of 10 years or by a more severe penalty". It is appropriate to put into the law the fact that a court is entitled to take into account the "life or personal safety of any person" or persons in the community who may be affected or threatened by the release on bail of a person charged with a serious offence. Bail is necessary and granted in certain circumstances. </p>
          <p eId="para_931"> The unusual situation is where individuals are remanded in custody but there are circumstances where that must happen. For instance, knowing of the gangland killings in this city in the past year or 18 months, it is untenable to suggest that individuals arrested because they are suspected of being involved in those criminal acts would be granted bail until such time as their trial came up. They would abscond and may commit further offences. It would be appropriate to try to ensure that criminal trials get on as quickly as possible. There has been an improvement. Serious criminal trials can come to prosecution within a year or 18 months. It is important from the point of view of the community and the accused that those trials are expedited. </p>
          <p eId="para_932"> Another proposed change in the legislation is provided for in section 3, that the accused person may as a condition be required to refrain from having contact with a person and from driving a mechanically propelled vehicle. These conditions come with a benefit to the accused. If they are set the accused is not remanded in custody but gains the benefit of bail.</p>
          <p eId="para_933"> Section 5 refers to the ability of the court to hear a complainant give evidence in bail applications. That is an unusual procedure. It permits a court that is considering a bail application to hear from the person who alleges that he or she is the victim of the crime. Of course, at that stage, the crime has not been established since the accused has not had a trial and been convicted. Notwithstanding that, it is appropriate that there are circumstances where a court can hear from a complainant in respect of a bail application by a person who he or she believes may continue to be a threat when he or she gets out. I know that the Acting Chairman, Deputy Declan Breathnach, has a particular interest in this area. He raised the issue of our bail laws with me because of specific crimes in County Louth. He was very anxious that legislation would be introduced to strengthen the bail laws. The Bill brought before this House today constitutes a strengthening of our bail laws and targets individuals who may be categorised as persistent offenders or individuals who have long previous records in respect of convictions. It is not a threat to our civil liberties. Courts will always seek to vindicate and protect the rights of the individual who appears before them. They are fully aware that individuals accused of criminal offences are innocent before the law. They will listen and take into account applications for bail and the instinct of a court will be to grant bail. There are, however, circumstances where individuals should not be granted bail because of the threat they pose to commit future offences within the jurisdiction. We agreed to do that in 1996 when we amended the Constitution. This legislation is an appropriate consequence of that amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JonathanOBrien" eId="spk_548">
          <from>Deputy Jonathan O'Brien<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T20:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_934">We welcome the opportunity to discuss this Bill and will support its passage to Committee Stage. We have some observations on some sections. I do not think anyone would oppose reviewing and where possible, strengthening, our bail laws, always on the premise that people are innocent until proven guilty and that the incarceration of any individual who has not been found guilty shall be used as a last resort.</p>
          <p eId="para_935"> Section 2(2)(f)(ii) expands the factors which a court may take into account when refusing bail to include "the extent to which the number and frequency of any previous convictions of the accused person for serious offences indicate persistent serious offending by the accused person,". As Deputy Jim O'Callaghan pointed out, the only difference from the 1997 Act is in section 2(2)(f)(ii) and (iii). Section 2(2)(f)(iii) states that "the nature and likelihood of any danger to the life or personal safety of any person or danger to the community that may be presented by the release on bail of a person charged with an offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of 10 years or by a more severe penalty". </p>
          <p eId="para_936">Would that include a danger to the life of the individual in question? I presume the person referred to in the Minister's proposal regarding: "...the nature and likelihood of any danger to the life or personal safety of any person or danger to the community", is a witness or the alleged victim. I suggest that there could also be a danger to the life of the person who is charged with the offence. I wonder how that fits in with this section of the Bill. Is the offender covered?</p>
          <p eId="para_937"> Section 3 proposes to increase the range of conditions that may be attached to bail to include prohibiting contact by the accused with the victim or his or her family. This section will also allow a garda to arrest the accused without a warrant if it is believed that such an arrest is necessary to prevent a victim of an offence or a witness from being harmed, interfered with or intimidated. I have one observation in that regard. Section 6(1)(b)(viii) of the Bail Act 1997 provides that: "the accused person shall be at a specified place between specified times during the period commencing at 9.00 p.m. on each day and ending at 6.00 a.m. on each following day." I presume there is some discretion in the setting of such curfews, for example, in the case of a person who is in employment and needs to work beyond 9 p.m. If there is no such discretion, perhaps the Minister might give me the relevant information.</p>
          <p eId="para_938"> I will return later in my contribution to section 4 of the Bill, which allows for electronic monitoring to be made a condition of a bail application, because I would like to make a couple of observations on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_939"> Section 5 allows a court that is considering a bail application to hear evidence from the victim of the offence as to the likelihood of interference by the accused with him or her or a member of his or her family. That is very straightforward.</p>
          <p eId="para_940"> We welcome section 6 which requires the court to give reasons for granting or refusing bail and for imposing any restrictions on bail, because it will give bail decisions a sense of openness and accountability. We are certainly very supportive of this proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_941"> We know that at past hearings of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, the Garda Inspectorate has raised concerns about people who breach their bail conditions and thereby cause An Garda Síochána to have to seek warrants to arrest them. We welcome the amendments in this regard in the Bill before the House. We have to be careful to ensure checks and balances are put in place. We cannot have gardaí going around arresting people without warrants willy-nilly. I know that is not the case. People need to be reassured that some checks and balances are being provided for.</p>
          <p eId="para_942"> I recognise that the levels of crime committed by people who are on bail are not insignificant. It is important for us to look at any review of our bail policy in a rounded manner, rather than simply basing our policy on some of the crude and sensationalist headlines we have seen in the past. I know that is not what is happening. Any changes in the bail regime will be based on the evidence and data needed to strengthen them.</p>
          <p eId="para_943"> I would like to pick up on the point made by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan about the timely manner of trials. If a person is denied his or her liberty by the refusal of bail, there is an onus on us to proceed to trial as quickly as possible. As such a person must be seen as innocent until proven guilty, it is important that we proceed to trial in a very timely manner. That should always be one of our key objectives.</p>
          <p eId="para_944"> I am sure the Minister is aware that my party's position has consistently been that because the legal system is premised on the fundamental principle that a person is innocent until proven guilty, we do not believe someone should be sent to jail unless a court declares his or her guilt. Therefore, people have a general right not to be imprisoned before trial. This means the right to bail should be protected. However, we recognise that this right is not unlimited. It is not unreasonable for a court to have the power to set bail conditions providing that bail can be withdrawn if those conditions are broken, or even the power to refuse bail in certain circumstances; for example, if the accused is a genuine flight risk or if there is a risk of the accused interfering with a witness. There may be exceptional cases in which the nature of the crime is such that the withholding of bail can be justified in the name of public safety. I refer, for example, to serial crimes of extreme violence with multiple victims. We recognise that the granting of bail to detained persons, particularly in cases of violent sexual offences, can be problematic for the victims of such crimes. We believe judges should take these concerns into account when they are setting bail conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_945"> It should be noted that the presumption in favour of bail is a fundamental human right. It is protected by Article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which provides that: "everyone arrested or detained .... shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release pending trial", and that: "release may be conditioned by guarantees to appear for trial". Article 9.3 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights guarantees that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_946">Anyone arrested or detained on a criminal charge shall be brought promptly before a judge or other officer authorized by law to exercise judicial power and shall be entitled to trial within a reasonable time or to release. It shall not be the general rule that persons awaiting trial shall be detained in custody, but release may be subject to guarantees to appear for trial.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">I have mentioned both of these international agreements as a way of pointing out that human rights issues arise in the context of this legislation. The importance of being brought before a court in a speedy manner, which has been touched on by me and Deputy Jim O'Callaghan in our contributions, is central in both cases. We believe the general presumption in favour of bail should not be interfered with.</p>
          <p eId="para_948"> According to the International Centre for Prison Studies, pre-trial detainees account for between 13% and 15% of the prison population in the State. While there is clearly a need for some defendants to be held on remand to ensure they stand trial, excessive use of bail refusal can result in higher costs to the Exchequer and can have an impact on the right to liberty and the presumption of innocence.</p>
          <p eId="para_949"> The difficulty with what is being proposed by the Minister is that the criteria under which a person can be refused bail are simply being widened without anything meaningful being done to ensure people can comply with their bail obligations. Refusing bail should really be a measure of last resort when the State has exercised all other options. I do not think human rights law, as set down in the European Convention on Human Rights, is reflected in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_950"> There has been very little comprehensive public debate about bail provisions in the State since the bail referendum of 1996, notwithstanding the fact that these issues are sometimes raised in a sensational manner on the airwaves and in print media. I empathise absolutely with those who are aggrieved when they or their families are the victims of crimes perpetrated by people who have been out on bail. One of the bases on which the 1996 bail referendum was run was that it would reduce crime. I think it is fair to say this contention did not come to pass. The broadening of bail laws in 1996 did not reduce crime in the way that was hoped. It simply put more pressure on the prison system by allowing people to remain in prison without having gone through a trial and been found guilty.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">We want to see the human rights framework at the core of the justice system. We do not disagree with any review of bail policy, but it should also be recognised that some prisoners have experienced inordinate and lengthy periods on remand in custody while awaiting trial. The lack of monitoring is something that must be addressed in this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_952"> We have some concerns about section 4, which provides for electronic monitoring of persons on bail. We support non-custodial alternatives for appropriate offenders, but we are opposed to the use of electronic monitoring as an alternative to custody. I welcome the Minister's indication that a working group has been established to examine how this provision might be operated, including the categories of offences and offenders. We await the outcome. Electronic monitoring is often seen as a cheap alternative to the cost of custody and it can be used to allay public fears about protection. However, the claims made for electronic tagging are questionable at best and the issue also raises some human rights concerns, particularly infringements on the right to privacy.</p>
          <p eId="para_953"> International evidence clearly repudiates the supervisory, rehabilitative and cost-effectiveness aspects of tagging. A report by Napo, the association representing probation service staff in Britain, examined the use of electronic monitoring for both curfew orders and offenders on early release. It concluded that it cost twice as much to tag an offender electronically as it does to supervise them on conditions by a member of the probation service. The Minister mentioned the possibility of contracting electronic tagging to security companies and this report indicates that security companies administering the electronic tagging schemes in the United Kingdom do not routinely follow up violations by individual offenders. The report concluded that electronic tagging did not reduce reoffending.</p>
          <p eId="para_954"> We will examine section 4 very closely and, as I stated, we are opposed to the use of electronic tagging; therefore, we have another concern that this Bill does not include any statutory provision for bail supports. That should form a crucial part of any discussion on bail and pre-trial detention. Without bail supports to offer interventions such as drug treatment or mental health support, given the chaotic nature of lives, the accused may find it difficult to adhere to bail conditions that may be imposed. The most effective way to improve compliance with bail conditions, particularly where the accused has a chaotic life and complex personal challenges, lies in the provision of bail supports and services that allow the accused to remain within the community and address offending-related behaviour in a familiar environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_955"> We welcome the decision to include a section requiring the court to give reasons for bail decisions but there is still possible overuse of bail conditions, particularly where they are not relevant to the circumstances or risk of offending by the accused. For example, the new section 2(<i>f</i>)(i) in the 1997 Act would allow for consideration of whether a person is a drug user is a most glaring example. I know this is in existing legislation and it will not be changed. Why is it that being a drug user is considered by the State to be indicative of a criminal predisposition? If someone is a drug user with addiction issues, why does the State believe refusing bail and keeping the accused in a prison system ill-equipped to address his or her needs would be better than allowing the accused to access some detox programmes? That goes to the argument of moving to a public health model and away from the automatic criminalisation of drug users.</p>
          <p eId="para_956"> The core of the justice system should be the protection of the presumption of innocence and bail. We will allow the Bill to go forward to Committee Stage, but we have some real concerns, particularly about section 4. We will put amendments to some of the other sections and if we were to vote on the legislation as presented, we would find it very difficult to give our support to it. We are hopeful that during the course of its passage through the Oireachtas, some of our concerns, particularly around bail supports, could be taken on board in order that we will be able to give our support at the final stages of its passage.</p>

          <from>Deputy Clare Daly<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T20:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_957">I may share some time with Deputy Mick Wallace if there is some remaining. I will make a few brief points. </p>
          <p eId="para_958"> The Bill gives more power to the Garda and prosecutors when it comes to bail and it allows more grounds for a court to refuse bail. It attaches extra conditions to a grant of bail, including, as Deputies have alluded to, curfews and electronic tagging. If Ireland is to move to a position with fewer people in prison, which I and many Deputies support, the creation of new reasons for courts to refuse bail and giving more power to the Garda in regard to bail, including allowing gardaí to arrest someone on bail without a warrant because a garda believes the person is about to break any of his or her bail conditions, will not get us to a point where we stop locking up people. It will not get us to a point where we can deal effectively with offending behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_959"> This is the second bail Bill that we have seen in the House in just over a year, with the previous Government having introduced the Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Bill in September 2015. That made it less likely that burglars and repeat burglars would get bail. As we stated at the time, it was a bit of an electioneering stunt, with an eye to the rural base that was being blighted by rural crime at the time, instead of being a serious and considered attempt to deal with our bail laws. I see this Bill somewhat in the same context. This Bill goes further and it may, in part, be a reaction to the high media profile given to the number of people who commit further crimes while on bail. That is an issue but I warn against following the lead of sensationalist media coverage that highlights crime to sell newspapers but does not deal with reality or the evidence base around these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_960"> What the media fails to concentrate on is Ireland's very high recidivism rates, particularly for certain crimes, as we dealt with this morning in the justice committee meeting. The recidivism rate for burglary is 69%, meaning that 69% of people who go to prison for burglary come out to commit another burglary. We can look at it another way in taking in the number of people committing crimes while on bail; our recidivism rates are really two sides of the same coin in this respect. If the people on bail who commit crimes had been thrown straight into prison instead, they would come out to commit more crimes anyway because our criminal justice policy does not put enough emphasis on supports and rehabilitation. In that sense, we solve nothing by making it harder for people to get bail or sending them to prison, which is in essence the same thing. We may cause more problems, as was again highlighted this morning when we heard of the massive overcrowding in a number of our prisons, including Cloverhill and all the women's prisons. There are other serious issues, such as half the prison population sharing cells, and nearly half the prisoners do not having access to private toilet facilities. There are 30 acutely psychotic individuals in prisons awaiting transfer to the Central Mental Hospital. These people will still have conditions on their release if they do not get the treatment they are seeking and need.</p>
          <p eId="para_961"> There have been a number of high-profile and tragic cases where individuals on bail have committed serious crimes. For example, an individual on bail killed Mr. Shane O'Farrell. He was a Lithuanian whose name I could not even pronounce. There is also the case of Mr. Jerry McGrath who murdered Ms Sylvia Roche Kelly while on bail as a result of assaulting a female taxi driver nine months before. That case was referred to by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">While this Bill may be, in part, a reaction to such cases, I do not believe the provisions would prevent a recurrence of those tragedies, since it is not clear that the provisions would have applied in either the case of Shane O'Farrell or Sylvia Roche Kelly. This is because the key causes were the withholding of information from the court by gardaí coupled with Garda incompetence and negligence. They were the real reasons. The problem was not with our bail laws. The judge was not given accurate information by the gardaí. The existing bail laws could have dealt with that problem. Unfortunately, this Bill does not address that issue. Deputy Jim O'Callaghan has dealt with the case of Sylvia Roche Kelly, but it is well known that Garda error, incompetence and negligence were responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_963"> The proposed section 9A of the 1997 Act would allow An Garda Síochána to make an application to the court for the person against whom an offence is alleged to have been committed to present evidence as to the likelihood that the accused might try to intimidate that person or her family or any witnesses and to inform the court as to the nature and seriousness of any danger to any person that may be presented by the release of the accused person on bail. Allowing alleged victims of crime to tell the court about the danger an accused person might present to them or to the public is perhaps a step forward and something we need to consider. I am keen for the possibility to be explored rather than simply relying on the gardaí to give the evidence. However, the power to permit a member of the public to make the case would still rest with the Garda, since the Garda would have to make the application to the courts. Therefore, I am unsure whether the issue is entirely addressed by the Bill, as it stands.</p>
          <p eId="para_964"> Similarly, the proposed amendments to section 2 of the 1997 Act would empower the court to take into account persistent offending and the likelihood of any danger to the community presented by someone released on bail. However, this would apply only if the person in question is charged with a serious offence and it would depend on gardaí informing the court of the history of the accused. Again, we come back to the reliability of Garda evidence in court. The Bill does not address that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_965"> Research by the Irish Penal Reform Trust has found that monitoring of bail conditions by the Garda is extremely patchy. One interviewee said that in 40% of his applications to revoke bail, the conditions were not being monitored properly. If potentially dangerous people are given bail with conditions attached, we will have a problem if the Garda is not monitoring them. If we change the law, it will not address that situation. The solution is not to impose conditions on others who are not dangerous. The presumption of a right to bail always should be the starting point. The role of the Garda is not addressed in this Bill. That is the key point.</p>
          <p eId="para_966"> An important point was made by the barrister Paul Anthony McDermott. He has made the point that the greatest problem with bail in Ireland is that judges have to carry out bail hearings within two or three minutes because of the number of cases on their lists. This Bill would add extra conditionality to bail, for example, with curfews and electronic tagging. These would be accompanied by serious infringements, even though they are being put forward in the context of an alternative to incarceration. Complex issues arise around these conditions and in the context of a court system where decisions on bail are made in the space of two or three minutes, they are potentially seriously unhelpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_967"> Deputy Jonathan O'Brien made a particular point. The Irish Penal Reform Trust has strongly recommended to the Minister that the Bill should include the provision of bail services and supports aimed at the prevention of offending on bail, ensuring appearance at court and reducing remand to custody to the absolute minimum. These recommendations have not been included in the Bill, sadly, but they should be included. Without the inclusion of these recommendations, the Bill comes across somewhat more in the spirit of criminal justice policy as a suite of punitive measure rather than an effort to genuinely prevent crime from taking place. All the evidence shows that taking a punitive approach to reducing crime does not work. As it is with people in prison, so it is with people on bail. Bail supports have been proven to reduce reoffending. If we want to reduce reoffending - we do - then it would be far more effective to put in place bail supports than the measures proposed in this Bill. Bail supports would give the person an opportunity to address the offending behaviour. In a programme of supervised bail supports in Scotland, 80% of those involved in the programme went on to avoid a custodial sentence. The Irish Penal Reform Trust has stated the most effective way to improve compliance with bail conditions, especially where the accused person has a chaotic life and complex personal challenges, lies in the provision of bail supports and services that allow the accused to remain within his or her community and address offending behaviour in a familiar environment. Bail supports include bail information schemes, bail support and supervision schemes, remand fostering, bail hostels, mentoring and bail reviews on custodial remand. All of these measures have been found to be especially useful in reducing reoffending and dealing with support for younger people, people with addictions, people with mental illness, women and people with unstable lives. Since the Bill does not make such provisions, it simply provides the courts with more grounds to refuse bail, in some ways, as well as more latitude to impose onerous conditions on people put on bail.</p>
          <p eId="para_968"> The evidence shows that judges have a tendency to adopt a <i>pro forma</i> approach to conditions, imposing a long list of the same conditions on everyone they release on bail, regardless of the circumstances of those involved, the crime and the likelihood of offending. In the light of the new and onerous conditions in this Bill, including the controversial ideas of tags and curfews, it is likely that these measures will be imposed on the majority of people released on bail regardless of whether the measures are necessary or proportionate. The evidence for this comes from the review of 91 cases in 2015. The review found that in every case the same list of bail conditions was imposed despite the fact that the offences involved included everything from minor matters by first-time offenders to charges of murder and numerous property offences in between. It makes no sense whatsoever that the conditions would be so uniform. There was, and still is, an opportunity – if the Bill passes Second Stage – to nudge the courts towards imposing individualised bail conditions. That is what we should aim for. We are far more likely to prevent offences being committed if judges were to adopt an individual approach, taking into account the circumstances of the accused, the offences with which he or she has been charged and the objections raised. Judges would then attach only such conditions as are strictly necessary and proportionate. I imagine the Minister will tell us that is exactly what the Judiciary will do. Sadly, the reality is that the Judiciary does the opposite. Increased costs and administration will be involved in tagging people. Obviously, it is cheaper to tag an offender than to put him or her in prison, but it is cheaper again to have these people out on bail with proper supports. It is not only cheaper; it is about ensuring a reduction in the number of people who reoffend. This is not about money, it is about the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_969"> The issue of remand is linked. We need to use this opportunity to remind ourselves that there is no statutory maximum duration of remand detention. This means that people can, and sometimes are, detained on bail for longer than the maximum sentence, with remand being used in lieu of short sentences. This is utterly unacceptable. Approximately 15% of all prisoners in Ireland are on remand; they have not been convicted of a crime. They are in prison because they have not been granted bail and this needs to be addressed. We need to reduce the numbers on remand. On average, anything upwards of 520 remand prisoners are being held at a cost of €100,000 per day. This is the cost simply to house these people in our prisons. Clearly, reducing the number of people on remand is what we should be aiming for. In part, this could be done by speeding up and unlocking some of the logjams in the courts system in order that people do not have to wait so long for a hearing. It is not necessarily about making the conditions more difficult for the accused to get bail.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">The broader reasons people end up before the courts need to be addressed. There are many issues that need to be teased out in the Bill. We probably will not oppose its progression to Committee Stage, but it will need a radical overhaul before we will able to support it.</p>

        <speech by="#MickWallace" eId="spk_550">
          <from>Deputy Mick Wallace<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T20:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_971">I will make a few general points, many of which were discussed this morning at the meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality. We are very interested in how the prison system works and will visit prisons all over the island, North and South. The most striking aspect when one visit prisons on a regular basis and meets prisoners and staff is the realisation that prisons do not work as they do not do what they are supposed to do. The idea is that if people do something bad, bold or illegal, we put them in a place of detention in the hope that, first, we will prevent them from reoffending. The plan is that they will not do it again after being dealt with by the prison system. Obviously, however, we know that this is not actually happening. We all agree that, in theory, prison is a punishment, but it is not. The reality is that in many cases it is a punishment in terms of how things are done. Rather than being tougher on individuals, which is popular, partially because of how poorly the media deal with these issues, we should be providing greater support to help them. The vast majority of people in prison come from underprivileged backgrounds and broken families and had troubled childhoods. They need help, but the way we set about dealing with them when they arrive in prison is not based on a philosophy of "let us help these people." It is a case of detaining rather than rehabilitating them. Given that the rate of recidivism is so high and many people do not benefit from the experience of being in prison and reoffend often, surely we should be asking if we could do something different. It is not rocket science. Helping people to make use of their time in prison to give them a different perspective would be money well spent. It is scary that we are paying €70,000 per year to keep a prisoner in jail and actually making him or her worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_972"> There are so many aspects of the prison system that we need to examine. There are many people in prison who should not be there. We talked this morning about the crazy number of people committed to prison for the non-payment of fines. We had the privilege of being committed for not paying a fine for what had happened at Shannon Airport, but the prison did not actually have room for us. As the prisons were full, they were not even able to keep us overnight. </p>
          <p eId="para_973"> I completely disagree with the proposal that there be electronic tagging, but I certainly agree with making people do community work rather than keeping them in custody at crazy expense to the State. However, I do not see any serious effort on the part of the State to create the structures and facilities needed to make community service a reality. A lot of thought must be put into how we do it. We do not have the required structures in place. I know that approximately 2,000 people undertook some form of community service last year, but with the proper structures in place, a lot more could do such work rather than being locked up.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MattieMcGrath" eId="spk_551">
          <from>Deputy Mattie McGrath<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T20:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_974">I am pleased to be able to speak to the Bail (Amendment) Bill 2016, the publication of which is timely. I thank the Minister for meeting the Save Our Community group in Tipperary on two occasions. One meeting took place before the general election and in fairness to the Minister when we asked her to meet it again, she kept her commitment and did so. It is a wonderful group and I salute its members who are deeply concerned about crime levels in their community and the sense of fear that pervades the mid-Tipperary area in particular but which is replicated all over the country. They have shown leadership on the issue. There is an old adage that where Tipperary leads, Ireland follows. I am proud to reflect it.</p>
          <p eId="para_975"> Many of the provisions included in the Bill have been sought widely. About a year and a half ago I attended a public meeting which was attended by almost 2,000 people. A committee was set up and its members have done great work, not just on crime related issues. As I said during an earlier debate today, they organised a farm safety engagement day in conjunction with An Garda Síochána and other agencies, including the Road Safety Authority. It was held on the farm of the chairman of the committee, Mr. Robert O'Shea, and proved very beneficial for those who use agricultural machinery, contractors and so on, as well as gardaí. All parties learned and gained an understanding of each other's point of view. There is a need for further community engagement of that type.</p>
          <p eId="para_976"> The Bill includes four main provisions. It provides for stricter bail terms for repeat and serious offenders; the strengthening of Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail; increasing the use of curfews and introducing electronic tagging for persons on bail, when requested by An Garda Síochána. I have no problem with any of these provisions. They are all needed, although we must be very careful on the last one. I am very disappointed, however, that the Bill does not include a fifth provision, namely, a reduction in the level of access to free legal aid. I hope I am not frightening off my good colleague and member of the Law Library, Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, but the free legal aid scheme has become an industry for certain solicitors and barristers. Without diminishing anyone's rights, there must be a balance in how many times a person can receive free legal aid and how many times the taxpayer can be expected to pay for it. There has to be a limit. It is a joke to see people being given free legal aid time and again. To be honest, it is just farcical. The scheme is widely abused, while victims have to pay for their experience through the trauma caused. This is especially true in the case of serious crimes. I have no problem with people being given free legal aid once, twice or even three times, but it should be a case of three strikes and they are out. It cannot be revolving such that people will continually be given free legal aid. As I said, the figures are published every year and for some law firms, it is a huge business. I know that Deputy Jim O'Callaghan will say lawyers have to live, as do barristers, doctors and other professionals. That is true, but year after year, one sees the same names of solicitors on the list of those receiving free legal aid scheme fees. The system is being abused. As I said, I have no problem with people being given free legal aid up to three times, but after that, it should not be available. It is a pity the issue is not dealt with in the Bill. Perhaps the Minister has good reasons for not doing so and, if so, I would like to hear what they are. The provision of free legal aid was one of the issues of concern for the Save Our Community group in Tipperary. </p>
          <p eId="para_977"> A previous speaker said judges did not have enough time to deal with bail hearings properly and that such hearings often lasted for only three or four minutes.</p>
          <p eId="para_978">That, however, is not the victim's or the Director of Public Prosecution's problem, it is the State's problem. We have set up a new Court of Appeal. It cannot hear criminal cases, which I opposed at the time, and I said I did not see any direction for it. Last week when we debated the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015 we said that in two years' time there would be a review of it, and possibly a three year review. I saw no provision for a review in the Court of Appeal Bill. There was no clarification on the number of cases this new court would hear or how it would deal with the backlog. The system is archaic and justice delayed is justice denied. We need accountability from our good colleagues in the court. I strongly supported the demands of the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, but the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, rejected them, quite robustly, as well as a chapter on public disclosure for our judges, especially when hearing cases against financial institutions. That was necessary. I am not trying to be critical of judges. I will not go into it here, but the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, knows what I am talking about, as she knows what the Minister, Deputy Shane Ross's Bill is all about. I support his Bill and I am delighted that he seems to have got it through the Cabinet.</p>
          <p eId="para_979"> Enough time must be allowed and this must not be rushed. A decision on bail, which is rushed, is not fair on the victim. I am not saying that perpetrators should be taken in and the key should be thrown away; I am not one of those merchants. I am, however, sick and tired of the bonds. The ordinary people who I represent live in fear in their homes. </p>
          <p eId="para_980"> There is also the issue of cutbacks in An Garda Síochána. I thank the Minister for the five new gardaí for Clonmel but we are still way behind in garda numbers because we lost so many. I thank the chief superintendent there and all the superintendents in Tipperary for the work they do with their teams with the limited resources they have. I deal with superintendents William Leahy and Pat O'Connor in Tipperary town and our new superintendent in Cahir. Of course, gardaí make mistakes; the man that never made a mistake never made anything. We should place more emphasis on restorative justice. There was a good project in Nenagh, which was needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_981"> Figures are being quoted in this debate about the number of repeat convictions, especially for burglaries. The vast majority of those repeat offenders are getting free legal aid. We are supporting and feeding the industry and it should not be allowed to carry on. Restorative justice is very important because in a different situation one of us, or someone in our family, could become involved in crime and end up not being able to see one's grandchildren.</p>
          <p eId="para_982"> There must be more use of the juvenile liaison officer system, a very good system which I have supported. Earlier it was suggested the court poor box would be gotten rid of. That is a very important, too. People can get hit hard in their pockets, often for motoring offences, and they must pay a nice sum to a very decent and well-meaning charity through the poor box. It gets them thinking and it is good for the charity and for the people who gain from it. In a way, that is restorative justice also.</p>
          <p eId="para_983"> Reference was made to professional development for judges. If a judge is appointed he or she is a judge for life, unless he or she is impeached but, thankfully, that has seldom happened. We need a measure, such as professional development courses, because, like everything else, the law is evolving. I am sure the Minister, if she was honest with us - I am not saying she is dishonest - would say she has learned a lot since she joined her Department of which she was not aware before. I admit this too. I do not have an infinite pot of knowledge to deal with situations. Situations are complex and crimes are changing all the time, such as Internet crime and cyber-crime and what we see unfolding before us with the international trade in people. It is very different now from what it was 20 years ago; therefore, judges need to be brought up to speed. I am not being critical of any one judge, but this is badly needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_984"> There was discussion around Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail and reference was made to a person who was disqualified from driving for a serious road offence but was still driving while out on bail. That person should not be allowed to drive again. As I said, there needs to be more connectivity with the courts. The courts administrative system must be brought up to speed. It is well able to deal with certain issues. </p>
          <p eId="para_985"> I asked a parliamentary question today, and received a reply from the Minister, about county registrars sitting as judge and jury in cases of home repossessions. I asked about the qualifications they have, who appointed them and under what Act but I received a vague enough answer. I believe it would be more appropriate to leave that work to judges and leave the registrars to look after the administration of fines, etc. The fines should not have to be collected by An Garda Síochána. Gardaí have too much to do to be going around begging people to pay their fines, especially for litter offences. As Deputy Mick Wallace said, those fines should be dealt with differently or by way of restorative justice. These people should be out doing community service. We should not have the wasteful situation of a garda using his or her time going back ten to 20 times to get a fine paid, eventually taking the person to prison where there is no room, so they are sent home again and the fine is wiped away. I have seen cases where an unfortunate businessman gets into trouble even though he does his best, and this happens to young people, in particular. The person is brought to the small claims court and is sentenced to jail to serve time. The bill, however, is still there and the person can be brought to court again. However, in the case of others brought before the courts in respect of other charges, once they turn up, sign in and sign out, they are left off and the charge is wiped away. Reform is needed in that area also.</p>
          <p eId="para_986"> I support the increased use of curfews, especially nighttime curfews because we cannot have certain people intimidating whole communities. There is a boldness and blatantness to their actions and they need to be under curfew.</p>
          <p eId="para_987"> Even my wife will not agree with me on the issue of tagging, but I must raise it. The Garda and superintendent Pat O'Connor have studied electronic tagging and I am sure the Minister and her officials are aware of it. I am not comparing humans to animals but in Scotland there was a study that used electronic tags on badgers to help combat bovine TB. The tags enabled the tracing of the badgers through the land and the checking of times. It shows how easy it would be for one person to monitor a person's movement rather than having gardaí, with limited resources, following people who are out on bail. There is no hope of them being able to do that. I am not a lock them up and throw away the key merchant, but we must defend our communities. Will the Minister tell us where the victims' rights charter comes into this? The unfortunate victims must become foremost in our minds. </p>
          <p eId="para_988"> I compliment gardaí on how they dealt with an atrocious attack on a young family in Tipperary in the dead of night. It was a most heinous crime and thanks to the good work of An Garda Síochána in detecting the persons, they have been convicted. Thankfully, the woman was able to dial 999 that night and throw her phone under the bed in order that those in the Garda station could hear her screams for help. Butchery, horror and savagery were inflicted by people who were out on bail and who had committed numerous crimes. We saw their scoffing behaviour towards media and others as they were led away in chains from the court house having been sentenced. These people must be taken off the streets and dealt with severely. The family who were the victims in that case will never recover from that kind of a trauma. How could they? A person's home is his or her castle and theirs was invaded.</p>
          <p eId="para_989"> Burglaries, breaches of property and terrorising communities must stop. The Bail (Amendment) Bill 2016 is very welcome as is the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill 2015. We need this legislation because it will save so much time, especially Garda time which we do not have. It enables people to sit in the Garda stations and monitor people, without prying or being peeping Toms, and ensure the safety of the community and law-abiding people who pay their water charges and their bills and who try to rear their families and do the best they can for themselves. They are getting tired of this. People are being pushed too much in one direction. There are certain aspects of the Bill that the Minister has said form part of a programme of criminal law reform, which includes, for example, the Criminal Justice (Burglary of the Dwellings) Act 2015 and the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016, published in recent days. I welcome that, but the Criminal Justice (Victims of Crime) Bill 2016 is not strong enough on victims' rights. Under the Constitution people are entitled to go about their daily work without fear or being hindered. It is a major disappointment that there is not some curtailment of the access to free legal aid. I wonder if the law lobby and the lawyers had a big influence on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_990"> Section 3 expands the number of conditions which may be set out by a court granting bail. Three new specific conditions are being added to the list. The first condition is that the person must refrain from direct or indirect contact with the victim of the alleged offence or any member of his or her family. This is vital as the victim must be protected. It is bad enough that the crime was committed, but if someone is being charged, the victim must be free from intimidation.</p>
          <p eId="para_991"> The second condition is that a person charged with a serious driving offence must refrain from driving. This issue was discussed earlier tonight in our debate on the Courts (No. 2) Bill 2016. Certainly, that must be a taboo. The third condition is that an accused may be made to observe a night-time curfew, which means he or she could be required to stay in a specific place from 9 p.m. each night until 6 a.m. the following morning, and longer in the winter time when it is dark from 5 p.m. until 8 a.m.</p>
          <p eId="para_992"> Section 4 deals with electronic monitoring. The Bail Act 1997 was amended in 2007 to permit a court granting bail to make it a condition of bail that the person's movements are monitored electronically. That provision has not been brought into force, largely because of concerns about how best to operate a system of electronic monitoring in a way that is sustainable and targeted. Section 4 amends the existing non-commenced provision by linking electronic monitoring to an application by the prosecution. It is a scandal that this provision has been in law since 1997 but was never implemented. Why are we pussy-footing around on this issue? People, young and old, must be protected. We cannot have marauding gangs intimidating people in their homes. Nor can we have third forces - the Minister knows what I am talking about - of repossession agents moving about in the dead of night. These people, too, should also be taken off the streets. We have An Garda Síochána, a noble force that always served the people well, and the Army available as back-up if needed. We do not need a third force acting on behalf of receivers and vulture funds. That is not the country for which the men of 1916 fought. Michael Collins, Liam Lynch and others fought for the right of Irish people to go about their business free and unencumbered - paying their taxes, certainly, but not being cowed into submission by bankers and receivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_993"> The county registrars are having to take on a lot of responsibility. Why are they holding up these cases and giving the Minister a watery reply? Justice must be done and must be seen to be done. It is incredible that this provision was introduced in 1997 but has never been invoked. Who is being protected? The cartels in the legal industry must be rooted out. There are many good solicitors and barristers, but they have a very strong lobby. Some of them arrived in force into the audio-visual room last week. Every time we went into or out of LH 2000, they were there to meet and greet us. That is fine and how things work, but perhaps they are worried we have woken up to what is going on in the industry and are wising up on the cost of insurance, difficulties with claims and so on. We must stop this carry-on and serve the people we were elected to serve.</p>
          <p eId="para_994"> Section 6 requires a court to give reasons for a decision to grant or refuse bail or to impose conditions of bail. The purpose of this provision is to provide the greatest possible transparency in hearing bail applications and the greatest possible understanding of the decision of the court. Again, this is vital in terms of transparency. One of the court cases I attended involved an unfortunate woman who was evicted from her home by bankers and receivers. I salute the kindness of the prison officers who brought her in a car from Cork Prison. She was going to go in as a lay litigant but then a barrister decided to take on her case. However, he was not allowed to represent her. I was at the back of the court and could not hear what the judge was mumbling. I moved up to the front and we asked the judge to speak up because nobody could hear what was going on. That poor frightened woman, God bless her, could not stand, never mind speak. She was treated with disgusting disdain in the Four Courts. It is not good enough that a frightened woman who had been through the traumatic experience of being in jail, having never committed a crime in her life, should be insulted in that way by a newly appointed judge. Incidentally, that judge had a lot of connections to this House and had given advice on the disbandment of town councils and the merging of the two county councils in Tipperary.</p>
          <p eId="para_995"> We must have transparency, truthfulness and honesty in all these matters. I support many of the measures in this Bill. I am not one of the do-good brigade who refuses to support things. I am for fairness, justice and respect for all citizens, including prisoners. I have called for reforms in the justice system and the broader use of restorative justice and community justice. However, repeat offenders can get legal aid, continue to offend and continue to get legal aid. It is an industry. If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is a duck. This effective industry is disgusting to the ordinary person who is paying his or her taxes. Legal aid does not come cheap. Ordinary people have to pay their own legal bills and that service does not come cheap either. The courts need more reform. There should be no space for courts to treat unfortunate family home owners in the way they are being dealt with in the Four Courts, down the road from this House. We know the history of the Four Courts and what happened there during the fight for freedom and democracy. When this Bill is passed, as I hope it will be, we must ensure there are no provisions that are not enacted, as happened on the last occasion, for nine, ten or 12 years. It must be debated and amended. We are entrusted by the people to do that and we must be responsible because we will have to face them before too long. We must give the necessary powers to the Garda to make our streets, roads and homes safer places in which to live.</p>

          <p eId="para_997">To put this Bill in context, it represents the most significant change to bail law and procedure since 1997 and is a welcome overhaul of the legislation in this area. The 16th amendment to the Constitution which was passed in 1997 allowed a court to refuse bail in the case of a serious offence, namely, an offence carrying a potential prison sentence of five years or more. Before that constitutional amendment, it had been found unconstitutional to deny somebody bail on the basis that he or she might commit an offence while on bail. In practice, this meant criminals who knew they were going to prison for a long time could choose to go on a crime spree in order to provide for their families while they were inside and because the consequences were less severe given they were going to jail in any case. The amendment was passed by 75% of voters.</p>
          <p eId="para_998"> This form of preventive detention was found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in the 1966 case to which Deputy Jim O'Callaghan referred. The court found in that instance that bail could be refused on a number of specified grounds, including for reasons such as the seriousness of the charge, the sentence likely to be imposed and a prisoner's failure to answer charges. Those grounds are still taken into account in our bail law, under section 2 of the Bail Act 1997. In fact, section 2 is treated more seriously than the O'Callaghan grounds due to the presumption of innocence. Where an application to refuse bail is made, the court must be cleared and gardaí must give their reasons in writing. The Criminal Justice Act 2007 introduced an amendment allowing a Garda superintendent to give evidence, as grounds for refusing bail, of his or her opinion that an accused would commit a serious offence while out on bail.</p>
          <p eId="para_999"> The Bill before us this evening amends section 2 of the 1997 Act to allow for more factors to be taken into account when considering an application for refusal of bail. The courts may now take into account the fact that the accused is a drug addict, the extent to which the number and frequency of any previous convictions of the accused for serious offences indicates a pattern of persistent serious offending, and the likelihood of any danger to any person or to the community that may present as a result of the release on bail of a person charged with an offence punishable by imprisonment for a term of ten years for more. The latter is presumably to deal with the gangland criminals who terrorise communities, as well as to prevent witness interference.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000"> Section 3 of the Bill provides for the amendment of section 6 of the Bail Act to allow for further bail conditions to be imposed on an accused. The new conditions include preventing the person from having any contact, direct or indirect, with the injured party or his or her family without leave of the court, preventing the person from driving where he or she is charged with a serious offence relating to driving, and new provisions regarding the imposition of a curfew. The curfew and no-contact conditions have been relied upon by our courts for years without controversy. Indeed, the practice in regard to the curfew is even stronger than what is in the legislation as judges frequently give gardaí the power to call upon the accused at home to ensure that he or she is abiding by the curfew.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001"> Another condition that might be utilised is a mobile telephone condition whereby the accused must obtain a telephone, give the number to the Garda and be obliged to have it on his or her person, charged and contactable at all times. This is a commonly used condition which should be included in the Bill, unless there is some difficulty with forcing people to get telephones. As most people have one these days in any case, perhaps an amendment might stipulate that accused persons must provide a number at which they may be contacted at any time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1002"> Section 6 of the 1997 Act is further amended to allow gardaí to arrest without a warrant a person who is breaching his or her bail conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">They can even arrest someone to prevent harm, intimidation or interference to a victim or witness. I believe this is positive progress. The Bill also gives victims of crime the ability to give evidence of any dangers they face if the accused is released on bail or if they are likely to be interfered with, and family members can give evidence on behalf of children and the mentally disordered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004"> A further section amends section 9 of the Bail Act 1997 in order that the court is required to give reasons when it grants or refuses bail or varies bail conditions. As a general rule, courts are required to give reasons for all their decisions. In many bail applications, the Garda does not have an objection to bail and this requirement may lead to a waste of court time. It may result in some sneaky judicial reviews or <i>habeus corpus</i> applications by unscrupulous practitioners, but it might also be seen in some quarters as the Government putting undue pressure on judges in relation to bail. Bail is one of the areas, with sentencing, where judges come under most pressure from the public. On the other hand, the Bill might draw support from members of the public who feel that too many accused are getting bail. We can look at this on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005"> It is worth noting also - this was alluded to earlier - that there is a lot of overcrowding in the prisons. If the aim is to stop accused people getting bail, then there had better be places to put them. Some prisons are releasing prisoners early to make room for those who have been refused bail. It is not ideal to have guilty persons being released from prison to make room for innocent ones. This is a particular problem in the case of female prisoners. The Dóchas Centre does not have much space and many female offenders are released early, particularly where they have not been convicted of violent offences. We also must be cognisant of that aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006"> The Minister mentioned electronic tagging and a working group in that regard. I welcome that such tagging will be used to monitor those on bail. This was introduced in the 2007 legislation but it has not been introduced in practice for those on bail. It has, however, been introduced in practice for those who are on temporary release from custody, although not many people are aware that it has already been introduced in this way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007"> The recent Criminal Justice (Burglary of Dwellings) Act 2015 which also was alluded to earlier allows for bail to be refused to someone charged with burglary where he or she had previously been convicted of burglary or was facing two or more charges of burglary. The idea was to stop persistent burglars and recidivism, as was mentioned. The Minister told the Dáil a large proportion of domestic burglaries were committed by serial offenders. Figures from the Garda analysis service indicate that 75% of property offences were committed by 25% of offenders. In my view, similar style bail refusals should be allowed for other persistent offenders, including perhaps drugs dealers, sex offenders or domestic violence offenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008"> I welcome the Bill, although I would like an assurance from the Minister that the legislation's effects have been taken into account. As I said, if bail is granted on fewer occasions, there will be more pressure on the already overcrowded prison services and we need to be cognisant of that fact. The points raised by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien in relation to rehabilitation resources for drug addicts must be taken into account also. Deputy Clare Daly mentioned the courts system and the resources in that regard. These all are interlinked. Overall, I very much welcome the Bill and look forward to it proceeding to Committee Stage.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T21:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1009">I welcome the opportunity to participate in today's debate. I very much welcome the Bail (Amendment) Bill 2016 because its measures are badly needed. The amendments include that a court can take into account persistent serious offending by an accused and the likelihood of any danger to a person or the community if an accused was granted bail, and the strengthening of Garda powers to deal with breaches of bail conditions. The expansion of the range of conditions that may be attached to bail include prohibiting contact by an accused with a complainant or a member of the complainant's family, prohibiting an accused from driving where the offence charged is a serious road traffic offence, and the imposition of a night-time curfew. The Bill will also enable electronic monitoring to be made a condition of bail if required, the hearing of evidence from a complainant regarding the possibility of interference by an accused with the complainant or a member of the complainant's family, and also a court having to give reasons for granting or refusing bail and for imposing any conditions in respect of bail.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010"> It is only right and proper that persistent offenders are dealt with in an appropriate manner and if it means that they are refused bail, then that is what is needed. Too often we read about the same offenders repeatedly committing crimes while on bail. Why should we, as a society, accept this? It is simply not right that criminals can be let out on bail to commit crimes. It is happening far too often that those out on bail believe they can go back to their criminal ways because the necessary deterrents are not there at present. The Bill before us will, I believe, be a first major step in putting in place deterrents that will once and for all stop criminals from committing crimes while on bail. It is welcome that we will now be able refuse bail to persistent offenders. Why should persistent offenders think they are entitled to bail? I strongly believe that the courts should adopt a zero tolerance policy when this legislation is passed. Offenders should be left in no doubt that should they offend while on bail, they will have no second chance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011"> I also warmly welcome the expansion and strengthening of conditions that may be attached to bail. It is welcome that an accused can be prohibited from contacting a complainant or a family member of the complainant and I look forward to seeing this rigorously enforced. Too often we have seen witnesses being subjected to abuse and threats which in some cases has led to cases collapsing. It is simply unacceptable that this has happened in the past and is happening even today. We must at all times protect complainants from interference by the accused.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012"> Many people have raised concerns about the measures to be implemented, particularly in relation to electronic monitoring, but it is quite simple. If electronic monitoring is needed to protect society from criminals, it should be used. There can be no hiding place for criminals and we should provide the courts with every available option to ensure that these criminals cannot commit criminal acts, especially when they are out on bail. Other measures in the Bill that I welcome include the fact that a court can now hear evidence from a complainant if he or she feels that he or she will be interfered with by the accused.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013"> When the Bill is enacted, I hope the courts will fully implement the measures included in it. There should be complete openness and transparency in the way the courts will implement these measures. I do not want to see courts in some areas treating defendants differently. We should ensure that the measures are implemented uniformly across the country. It is important that there is not only openness and transparency in the implementation of these measures, but also fairness. In this regard, I welcome the fact that the courts will have to give detailed reasons for the decision to either grant or refuse bail and the imposition of any condition on bail. This measure, I believe, will create an open, transparent and fair system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014"> I welcome the Bill. It is badly needed and will benefit complainants, their families and the wider community. It will also act as a serious deterrent to criminals who at present think they can do whatever they like while on bail. This must never be accepted and these criminals must be shown that should they wish to continue their criminal ways, they will have a price to pay. I expect that once the Bill is passed, the courts will use their new powers to deter criminals from committing crimes while on bail.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)<recordedTime time="2017-02-08T21:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1015">I thank all the Deputies for the thoughtful contributions we have heard from all sides of the House. It is clear that there is a deep interest in this area from a number of different perspectives. As Deputy Josepha Madigan said, these all are interconnected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016"> I will make a number of points about penal policy in general. Many of the comments were about our penal policy and the approach we should take. Given that the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality heard from the Irish Penal Reform Trust this morning, that is an extremely topical issue. There is no binary choice between enhancing the law on bail to protect the public against serious crime and ensuring that prison is only used in appropriate cases. The two objectives are perfectly consistent. Deputy Jim O'Callaghan made that point and I agree with him. That is central.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017"> There have been massive improvements in prison accommodation and significant investment, for example, in single cell accommodation and access to sanitation. There have been massive changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018"> The other point of which Deputies are aware - I believe it was debated by the last justice committee - concerns the very important penal policy review carried out. It is a roadmap in ensuring we will limit imprisonment to those who absolutely should be there and that we will work to support those who can be rehabilitated. There are a number of initiatives being taken in that regard. In fact, there has never been such a good relationship between the Probation Service and the Irish Prison Service. That was unheard of a number of years ago, but they now work closely together. There are many good initiatives, including youth diversion and Garda diversion programmes, the joint agency response to crime, JARC, and the newly established programmes to identify and work with serious offenders to ensure they receive the multifaceted support they need. The question of support while on bail is one to which we can return.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019"> On the payment of fines, there is legislation in place in that regard. The courts are working on the IT part and it will change the situation of individuals going into prison for the non-payment of fines. We have largely dealt with that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020"> To return to the question of support while on bail, the courts can impose bail conditions such as requiring a person to attend particular services. We are focusing increasingly on community service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021"> Deputy Jonathan O'Brien made the point that human rights were at the centre of this issue. I agree, but the bail laws already fully respect the rights of an accused person under the Constitution and the European Convention on Human Rights. The Bill enhances the laws on bail while fully respecting those rights which must be central. Every Member would agree with the Deputy on that point. </p>
          <p eId="para_1022"> The Deputy also spoke about electronic tagging and monitoring. During the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, the justice committee expressed the view that the use of electronic monitoring was an acceptable alternative to pre-trial detention but recommended that it not be used excessively. That is the key point. The aim of the provision included in the Bill is that it will be used appropriately. It is worth noting that the Bill will limit the use of electronic monitoring to cases in which the prosecution applies for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023"> Deputy Mattie McGrath spoke about the provision of free legal aid. The granting of such aid is a matter for the courts. There is a serious constitutional issue relating to the right to be represented. If a person was not represented, there would be no cases before the courts and it would be in contravention of every international right. I am, however, examining some elements of the scheme. Perhaps where it is proved that people have resources, they might make a further contribution. If, however, no free legal aid was to be given, many criminal prosecutions would be frustrated, something none of us would wish for either.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024"> Deputies have concerns about different sections of the Bill. Deputy Jonathan O'Brien asked whether the inclusion of the provision in section 2 was meant to protect the offender or the safety of others.</p>
