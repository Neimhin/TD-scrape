          <p eId="para_5">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">I refer the Deputies to my oral reply of 14 May 2003 and written reply from last Tuesday, 18 November 2003, on this issue. While the position is unchanged, I am happy to outline the procedures again for the information of the House. The Gulfstream IV Government jet is part of the ministerial air transport service which is provided by the Air Corps to facilitate members of the Government in fulfilling their official engagements at home and abroad. Use of the service requires my approval. Requests for the use of the service are made by Ministers' private secretaries to my office and are dealt with, in the first instance, by the staff of my office. Requests are examined by my staff with regard to the need and purpose of travel, the destination and other logistical details. Any necessary clarification or further information is sought at this point. All screened requests are then submitted to me for approval. Once approved, all operational matters are settled directly between the Minister in question and the Department of Defence or the Air Corps.</p>

          <p eId="para_7">I understand one take-off and landing of a jet constitutes what is known as a cycle and that the more of these that take place, the more wear and tear the jet accumulates. I am told there were 243 short-hop flights between Dublin Airport and Baldonnel in the past five years. That is an extraordinary number of short flights. I am sure the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, will advise the Taoiseach in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">Will the Taoiseach explain why the Government jet, Gulfstream IV, undertook 243 cycles between Dublin Airport and Baldonnel? Is my information in this regard correct? Will the new Learjet be delivered by the end of 2003, gold taps or not? I respect that the Taoiseach and Cabinet will take on onerous responsibilities on 1 January and that it will be necessary to transfer members of the Government to official meetings throughout Europe. Will the Government buy or lease the new jet? Is it an economic or super-duper model?</p>

          <p eId="para_12">The number of flights made by Gulfsteam IV between Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel, and Dublin Airport in each of the past five years, excluding 2003 as we do not have those figures, were, in reverse order, nine, 15, 30, 31 and 28. The figures for Dublin Airport to Baldonnel were 17, 14, 31, 32 and 36. The number of flights involved is relatively small. Each mission may consist of a number of flights. For example, a mission might be Baldonnel-New York-Washington-Baldonnel. There are also flights to Dublin Airport. There were nine missions in 2002 and 15 the previous year.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">The new Learjet is being purchased at a cost of €8.4 million. The Minister for Defence has answered many question on that since September. The new jet is a Learjet 45. It is a nine seater light business jet which will transport us to most European destinations. The Beechcraft, which is now 23 years old, still works. Most of its flights are within the country. It can travel further although I am not too sure how many people would wish to travel further in it.</p>

      the costs incurred by his Department in respect of the Moriarty tribunal.

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_71">I propose to take Questions Nos. 5 to 8, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">The costs met by my Department in respect of the Moriarty tribunal since its establishment in October 1997 to the end of October 2003 amount to €14,406,811. Of this amount, €10,690,167 has been paid in fees to counsel for the tribunal and €3,716,644 in administration costs. As regards estimated future liabilities for costs, it is impossible to predict what costs may be awarded and to whom by the sole member of the tribunal. The annual running cost of the tribunal is under €4 million. Future costs will depend on the duration of the tribunal.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_73">On what basis has the estimated cost of the Moriarty tribunal risen by 183% for next year, from €3.6 million to €10.3 million for 2004? This figure must be approved by the Department of the Taoiseach on the basis of an understanding of what the projected costs might be.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">Is the Taoiseach satisfied that the Moriarty tribunal continues to work within the remit given to it by the Oireachtas? What is the cost of a day's public hearings of the tribunal as against a day's hearings held in private? Arising from a number of recent newspaper articles, it appears that much of what is being conducted in public could be done in private without loss of relevant information to the public.</p>

          <p eId="para_75">As the Deputy knows, the sole member must make a decision on costs. That decision is to be made this year and will apply to next year, which is why we have made provision for costs, although we do not yet know what the costs will be.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_77">Yes, they could. It depends on who is awarded or refused costs. The position in regard to previous tribunals is that practically everyone has been awarded costs. It is on that basis that the provision has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_78">The cost difference between public and private sessions of the tribunal is irrelevant because, as Deputy Kenny pointed out, a lot of the tribunal's work is being carried out during private confidential sessions, but the rates are more or less the same. Therefore, there is no saving in that regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_85">I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach could supply that information. It appears that, if every interested party must be represented in public session, the cost is running at an enormous amount per day of public session. When does the Taoiseach envisage that the Moriarty tribunal might conclude its business? The sole member has commented about the progress being made and matters being discovered. The tribunal was established to inquire into the integrity of the process and the question as to whether there was interference in respect of a licence being allocated.</p>

          <p eId="para_89">Does the Taoiseach not agree that it is an obscenity that each senior counsel at the Moriarty tribunal receives a daily fee of €2,500? In the consultation paper published by the Law Reform Commission last March, it was indicated that the fee for counsel in respect of court cases was calculated in terms of the preparation work, the briefing fee and a daily fee for attendance in each court case. Is it not unacceptable that the same calculation has been applied to attendance and performance at tribunals? Court cases, in the main, last for days or weeks—</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_76">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_91">I have a number of questions. Court cases, in the main, last for days or weeks, whereas tribunals can last for years. Does the Taoiseach agree with the Law Reform Commission's expressed view that a new formula for the calculation of fees payable to senior counsel at the Moriarty and other tribunals, which recognises the fact that people have guaranteed work for an excessive period of months or even years, needs to be found and that the formula employed is wholly inapplicable? Is the Taoiseach considering introducing legislation to address the exorbitant charges that are placed against the public coffers, through the tribunals, by those offering their legal expertise?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_77">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_92">On Deputy Kenny's question on the time involved, the answer is that I do not know. It will take as long as it takes. No estimate has been made in terms of how long the tribunal will take.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">I am conscious of the view expressed by the Law Reform Commission. The Minister for Finance and the Attorney General have given the commission's paper careful consideration to see if its recommendations could be incorporated into the workings of current or future tribunals. If tribunals remain in place for a long period, substantial costs are incurred by the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">The other side of that argument, which is put forward by those concerned, is that people who participate in tribunals are obliged to remain away from their practices and private work. If they are involved with a tribunal for a number of years, it takes a corresponding period for them to restore their private practice. If we want the best people to participate as counsel at the tribunals, this is the cost that must be paid. It is generally accepted that those involved at the tribunals are experienced individuals. If these people were involved in normal practice, they would earn these or perhaps even higher rates of pay. That is what we are told and that is the factual position.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_96">Aside from the Law Reform Commission consultation paper on public inquiries, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has brought investigation legislation before the House, it is on Second Stage, which deals with running the tribunals in a different way. This is designed to ensure there is a faster and more extensive way to deal with these issues. The Oireachtas made provision that the terms of reference on these matters would be open and, until the tribunals have concluded all the business under their remits, that is the way they will proceed.</p>

          <p eId="para_100">The House has agreed terms of reference for the various tribunals – we are discussing the Moriarty tribunal. They must undertake their work and report back to the House. That is the task we have given them. We must resource them and await the reports ultimately.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_101">My question specifically related to the Bill published by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last summer. He left everyone in the House and outside under the impression it would be speedily enacted. I do not see it anywhere on the schedule. Has the Government changed its mind about the contents or the efficacy of the Bill or is the Government rethinking it? Are there circumstances where the Government would move to foreshorten the Moriarty tribunal or any of the other tribunals? For example, in respect of the planning tribunal, one hears about filing cabinets full of allegations from Donegal, Meath, Cork, Galway and Leitrim. There must be 30 years' work in that.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_103">I agree with you this time, a Cheann Comhairle. The Taoiseach gets the gist of what I am seeking to ask him. Will opportunities be presented to the House when interim reports from the tribunals are made to the House? Does the Taoiseach foresee circumstances where the Government will put a recommendation to the Oireachtas in respect of any of the tribunals or does he envisage, for example, that the Moriarty tribunal will move on from Dublin in due course around the rest of the coastline? Where will this end?</p>

        <speech by="#RoryOHanlon" as="#Ceann_Comhairle" eId="spk_87">
          <from>An Ceann Comhairle</from>
          <p eId="para_104">Perhaps the Deputy could table a question to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on those issues.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_88">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_105">It is not the Government's intention that this legislation will replace the work currently going on but we still want to have it passed because, in line with any new investigation or examination, we see the legislation as the more effective way of doing it. That is our view and I hope it is passed soon. It is well worth passing the legislation. I do not want it to be seen as taking over the role of the Moriarty tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">With regard to the second question, it is my view, for what it is worth, that there are aspects of the tribunals which we clearly had in mind in this House at the time tribunals were set up and subsequently. There are various modules which have to be investigated, some of which have been completed while others have yet to be carried out. I believe we must complete that process before we reflect on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">On Deputy Rabbitte's question as to whether we should move forward to further issues which the Oireachtas had not contemplated, I believe we should come to a collective view on the matter at that stage. I am anxious that elements which were matters of public controversy and where various allegations were made should be completed. However, as to whether we should go on <i>ad nauseam</i>into other new and more current areas, that was not the wish of the House. I believe those aspects should be looked at afresh when we come to the end of the process. Otherwise, I agree with the Deputy that the process might still be continuing in 15 years' time. That was certainly not the wish of the House in 1997 and 1998 when we dealt with these issues. We should look at the situation again at the end of the phases relating to major issues.</p>

          <p eId="para_111">The incredible level of fees paid to barristers at the Moriarty and other tribunals has been raised previously in the Dáil. I recall pointing out that the tribunals were creating more millionaires than they were investigating, on occasions. What has the Taoiseach done, since then, to cut down the costs of legal fees at the Moriarty tribunal? Especially in the context of recent days, when both the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have been quite shrill in demanding that the most humble civil servants have to produce quite substantial productivity for their benchmarking awards, what benchmarking has been or is being applied to the legal teams at the tribunal? Everyone agrees, quite clearly, that alleged corruption has to be investigated very thoroughly. Does the Taoiseach agree, however, that the tribunals have become so leadránach and expensive that, unfortunately, the upshot may be to bring the concept of such investigations into disrepute among hard pressed taxpayers?</p>

          <p eId="para_136">In the context of the Moriarty tribunal, does the Taoiseach consider that alternative methods of inquiry are desirable to bring about more efficient and speedy conclusions to matters of public interest that ought to be inquired into? In that respect, does he agree it is time, one year or longer after the decision in the Abbeylara case, the Government brought forward amending legislation to enable inquiry by parliamentary committee to continue?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_116">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_137">There are legal issues around doing that. A certain amount of work can still happen, but the Deputy is aware of the difficulties regarding all these investigations. The Government published a committee of investigations Bill, which we believe would be a more speedy and effective way of dealing with these issues. As to whether we can get around some of the issues, such as those that arose in the Abbeylara case, the mini-CTC signalling project or other such issues, I am not certain we would be able to satisfactorily deal with the legal issues. However, we are satisfied that the committee of investigations Bill could be used to provide for committees of the House to deal with such cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_138">I agree with the Deputy's point, that we could deal with these issues more speedily and complete a report on them. The proceedings of tribunals are not proven legal fact. They can be challenged in court and they do not prove a case for prosecution. Such issues could be addressed by the committee of investigations Bill. As to whether that would satisfy the House and members of the public, I do not know. If many of the issues that arise now and in the future were to require full judicial tribunals, with the staff and the necessary resources involved to make them effective, that would be an expensive way of going forward. We should pass this Bill and examine the issues involved after we have gone through the main aspects of the tribunals. In the case of the Moriarty tribunal, I believe it will be finished sooner because it will not drag on while others may.</p>

          <p eId="para_139">I welcome the Taoiseach's confirmation of the figures I outlined earlier. In his initial response he indicated the overall cost of the Moriarty tribunal to his Department. However, is it not the case that these costs are multiplied several times when we take account of the other tribunals taking place and that we are looking at a colossal overall figure?</p>
          <p eId="para_140">On legislation, the Taoiseach referred to reform of the process of the tribunals. Will legislation now be considered by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to address the cost of the conduct of tribunals? Will the Taoiseach advise whether the Government is considering introducing legislation to address the issue of legal costs generally? Will he use the opportunity of Ireland's Presidency of the EU to have this matter addressed, not just in Ireland, but across the Union?</p>
        </speech>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_141">While Members have inquired if we can find a more speedy, efficient and cost effective way of dealing with these issues, I do not want to say anything about any of the current tribunals.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">In examining future reforms, we must remember that, over the past number of years, we have had much experience of these issues. This has not just been since 1997 but previously with the beef tribunal and other inquiries. We know the costs involved. Even at Oireachtas committees, such as the DIRT, Abbeylara and mini-CTC inquiries, counsel were present. Members argue that these committees come to conclusions more quickly and that the Bill should lead to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">Tribunals are established by the House and we cannot now raise these issues as if we did not support the existing tribunals. The Oireachtas established these with huge support and broad terms of reference. However, in many cases, vague terms of reference have allowed for extensions. I will not get into the rights and wrongs and whether it is necessary to investigate all the matters raised to the nth degree in every part of the country. That will become a matter of opinion as time goes on. The House could examine this option. While I am not opposed to that happening, I am opposed to short-circuiting some aspects of the tribunals because this would create many problems and much cynicism. It will be a different process for future tribunals and inquiries.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_144">I am interested in the Taoiseach's reply in respect of the costs per legal representative at the tribunal. However, I want to know the average cost of a day's public hearing as against a private one. I understand that, at a public hearing, up to 20 to 30 legal personnel can be present in the tribunal hall. A recent newspaper article on the Moriarty tribunal pointed out that the evidence given in public session contained a myriad of intricate commercial strategies and details within one of the companies. However, this had nothing to do directly with the issue at the central focus of the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">In the interests of the Taoiseach's Department as sponsor for costs, the cost per day might be an interesting figure to produce. A more interesting analysis would be whether it is necessary for the tribunal to deal with all that material in public when it just could be dealt with more cheaply and effectively in private.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_120">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_146">I take the Deputy's point that it is difficult to deal with these matters without somebody assuming a criticism is being made. I merely gave the State costs while Deputy Kenny's question was on the costs of the legal teams.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">A substantial number of people can be involved. A recent newspaper article stated that, in another tribunal, an argument centred around whether a £2,500 donation had been given while 11 people were present who would have each earned that amount for the day. I do not know whether that is right or wrong. The Deputy can take it that the cost per day for some of these issues is only a fraction of the costs. Considering the overall legal costs from private senior counsel, junior counsel, legal teams and back-up staff on a number of these issues that are cross-company, this would only be a small fraction of the cost. I have heard a figure, which I will not repeat on record, as I have no reason to know whether it is right. If one were to take the figure of the legal issues around this tribunal, what I am reading out today would not be a very significant amount of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">The Deputy should remember what I said in my reply regarding future liabilities, even though we are many years into it, I do not have a prediction of what costs may be awarded. The Deputy knows from the debate we held here just before summer that that is an enormous legal issue. I do not want to get into any conclusion on that, because it is not my position or my right to do so. The eminent sole member will have to deal with this issue, but it is clear that will be a very substantial amount of resources.</p>

      if he has satisfied himself with the operation to date of the Public Order Act 2003; and if a review is planned.
      [28332/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_121">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_150">As the Deputy will be aware, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 was enacted on 28 May 2003 and came into operation on 28 June. It is therefore too early to seek to assemble any meaningful statistics on the operation of the Act or to form a conclusive opinion of its operation. At the end of the year I will seek details on both the operation of the Public Order Act 2003 and the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003, which only came into operation at the end of September, with a view to keeping their operation under review. I believe the provisions in both Acts are and will prove of great value in dealing with the types of public disorder, which have given rise to understandable public concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">There has already been progress in dealing with these matters. On public order, the Garda Commissioner has informed me that in the 12-month period November 2002 to the end of October 2003, which is the most up-to-date period on which I can provide statistics, assaults causing harm have decreased by 22%, or 1,144 fewer cases. Other assaults are down by 18%. Non-headline crime, which includes public order incidents, has decreased in the same period by 9%. This categorisation includes less serious assaults, which have decreased by 14%.</p>
          <p eId="para_152">Since this is the first time the PULSE computer system has been used for the compilation of statistics for non-headline crime, caution must be exercised in comparing these figures with the figures for previous periods. Nevertheless, they are a positive indication that the policy of targeted operations is being successful. Yesterday I visited Cork city and met the chief superintendent there, who informed me that public order offences in Cork city are down by one third in the past year.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">As the Deputy will be aware, Operation Encounter came into force on 23 February 2002. This Garda operation is focused on all issues of public order occurring in the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_154"><i>Additional information.</i>Particular attention is paid to nightclubs, fast food outlets and other venues where large numbers of people congregate and where there is the potential for public disorder. I am further informed that Garda resources are deployed at periods and times best suited to provide an effective policing service in a particular locale, both at mid-week and during the weekend.</p>
          <p eId="para_155">Since its inception, Operation Encounter has resulted in 82,423 incidents coming to the attention of the Garda. Of these, 55,559 incidents were recorded under the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994; 2,689 were recorded under the Intoxicating Liquor Act, 1998, as amended; and 24,175 under the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997. Such statistics clearly show the determination and level of resources devoted by the Garda authorities to ensuring public safety on our streets.</p>
          <p eId="para_156">Targeted initiatives have also been put in place by Garda management. In Dublin, a new city centre policing initiative was launched on 9 June 2003 by the Assistant Garda Commissioner for the Dublin metropolitan region. This initiative provides a high visibility policing presence in specific target areas in the north and south inner city centre areas. It targets issues of particular concern such as public order, assaults, street theft, shoplifting and offences committed by drug addicts. A further initiative, Operation Boulevard, which targets anti-social behaviour in the environs of O'Connell Street, is also in operation.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnDeasyFG" eId="spk_122">
          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_157">It is a healthy development that the Minister is finally moving around the country. Before the enactment of this Act, I spoke to a number of gardaí who said it was useless legislation in many ways, which would never have any real effect on the incidence of public order offences. The Minister gave me the answer I expected. It has been enacted for five months. How are we supposed to follow trends if we do not know how effective the legislation is after five months? How do we know exactly what is going on? How do we know how effective we in this House are in passing a Bill when five months later the Minister has no idea of how effective that legislation is? He cannot tell me how many people have been barred from premises or how many premises have been closed as a result of this legislation, which was brought in as a face-saving exercise because the Minister could not produce the additional 2,000 gardaí.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">As for the situation improving over the past year or so, many people no longer report these crimes. This is about the presence of gardaí on the streets as a visible deterrent. The Minister is now talking about shutting down Garda stations, including those in urban areas. This is nonsense. We are wasting time on this matter. The Minister is avoiding the real issue, which is giving the Garda the resources to do its job.</p>

      the number of claims for residency status made prior to and since 23 January 2003 by the non-national parent of an Irish-born child; the number of cases which have been processed; the number of cases in which residency has been granted; the number of cases in which the application has been refused; the number of cases in which deportation of such parents have been ordered; the number of cases in which deportations have taken place; if his attention has been drawn to the serious concern expressed by the Human Rights Commission in regard to the procedures in use and particularly the lack of readily accessible legal advice to many such parents; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_160">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_198">Following the decision of the Supreme Court on 23 January 2003 in the case of L and O which held that no automatic residency rights obtain in respect of non-national parents of Irish-born children, the Government decided that the separate procedure which had then existed to enable persons to apply to reside in the State on the sole basis of parentage of an Irish-born child would not apply to cases which were outstanding on 19 February 2003, namely, in cases where applications were lodged but no decision had been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">In regard to outstanding claims to reside in the State on the basis of parentage of an Irish-born child and future claims for leave to remain in the State from the non-national parents of Irish-born children, the Government decided that every such case would be examined and decided individually. The Government's policy in this regard was stated in public notices issued on 18 July 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">In respect of every person, including a parent of Irish-born children, who has no legal entitlement to remain in the State, a letter issues under the terms of section 3(3) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, informing him or her of the Minister's intention to deport. The person is allowed 15 days in which to opt for one of the following: make representations to the Minister setting out the reasons he or she should not be deported, that is, be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leave the State before an order is made; or consent to the making of a deportation order.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">In regard to the option of voluntary return, it should be noted that an agreement has recently been reached between my Department and the International Organisation for Migration, IOM, by which the IOM will provide, <i>inter alia,</i> a specifically tailored voluntary return programme for non-national families with children born in Ireland. The registration for this programme is open until the end of January 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">If the person, in respect of whom a letter issued under the terms of section 3(3) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, opts to make representations as to why he or she should not be deported, a range of factors specified in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, is taken into account in making a decision in the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_203"><i>Additional information.</i>These factors include the person's individual family and domestic circumstances and humanitarian considerations. In the case of a parent of an Irish-born child, particular regard is given to the Supreme Court judgment in the L and O case and the subsequent judgments in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">From 1996 to 23 January 2003, 10,584 persons were granted permission to remain on the basis of an Irish-born child. Figures for refusal of permission are only available from 2000. From 2000 to the 23 January 2003, 40 persons were refused permission to remain.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">As at 19 February 2003, 11,493 such cases were on hand. Of this number, 996 applications have been returned as the applicants had an alternative legal basis to remain in the State, for example, valid work permit, business permission to remain, full refugee status and so on. Depending on the circumstances of the individual cases it is likely that the majority of the remaining applicants will be issued with letters under the terms of section 3(3) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, informing them of the Minister's intention to deport.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Given the complexity of the task which the individual consideration of each of the outstanding Irish-born child cases will involve, it was agreed that additional staff resources would be provided, by way of a levy on Departments, to process these cases. These staff will shortly come on stream to begin work on case processing.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">In advance of the additional levied staff coming on stream some preliminary work has been done. In September and October 2003, 353 letters issued under the terms of section 3(3) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, to parents of Irish-born children whose claims were outstanding at 19 February 2003. Of these, 171 submitted representations as to why they should not be deported, that is, be allowed remain in the State; 62 applied to re-enter the asylum process; five applied for voluntary return; six provided an alternative basis for remaining in the State; and 109 either did not respond or the letters were returned on the basis that the individual no longer lived at the address. Deportation orders have been signed in respect of seven individuals of which two have been effected.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">As regards the views expressed by the Human Rights Commission, I issued a detailed response setting out the reasons for the policy indicated above. The policy is fully in accord with the Supreme Court decision in the L and O case. I reiterate that every application for leave to remain in the State based on the parentage of an Irish-born child will be examined and decided individually. In regard to the provision of legal advice, at no stage did I indicate that State-funded legal advice would be provided for those who receive notifications under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999. As in general immigration matters, the position is, as it always has been, that persons seeking legal advice may make their own arrangements with any legal adviser they choose.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">The Government remains concerned at the abuse of Irish citizenship law by persons with no connection to the State arriving in Ireland with the sole objective of giving birth to a child who will, as a result of being born in Ireland, be entitled to Irish citizenship. In this regard, I am cognisant of the concerns of the masters of the maternity hospitals in regard to the number of non-nationals arriving in Ireland in the late stages of pregnancy. I continue to monitor the situation in regard to this issue, including the question as to whether constitutional and legislative change may be necessary. Ireland is the only member state of the European Union which grants citizenship to a child based solely on its birth on the national territory. In all other member states the citizenship of a child is dependent on the citizenship of the parents and-or the status and duration of residence in the member state concerned.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_210">I am flabbergasted at the Minister's response. He did not answer any of the questions I asked, he merely referred to procedure. He did not give any facts or figures. My question sought to ascertain facts and figures about the number of cases in which residency has been granted, the number of cases in which the application has been refused, the number of cases in which deportations have taken place and if the Minister's attention has been drawn to the serious concern expressed by the Human Rights Commission. This is a scandalous reply. No information was given in response to the question. Will the Minister please answer the question rather than spend the remainder of the time waffling on once more?</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Has it been brought to his attention that the Human Rights Commission has pointed out the difficulties and the potential infringements of the human rights of Irish citizens. All children born in this country are Irish citizens. The commission is concerned at the manner in which deportation orders issue, that only 15 days is given for a reply, and that no free legal aid is available to the people to whom the deportation orders issue thus making it difficult for them to make a proper response.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">The Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights brought in a number of organisations representing various people affected by the Supreme Court decision. The Minister declined our invitation to attend committee meetings on a number of occasions. We have been unable to discuss the issues raised there with the Minister to see if we could come up with a reasonable process to deal with the matter. In all, 11,000 people are affected. These are people who had a reasonable expectation based, in some cases, on the advice of the Minister's officials that they would forego their asylum application and seek residency on the basis of their parentage of Irish-born children. All of those have had to do a <i>volte-face</i>on this matter. They are now forced by the Department to retrospectively make a different form of application, on foot of a deportation order. That is not fair. Will the Minster give us some real information – facts and figures – on this matter?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_162">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_213">If I had sufficient time I would have informed the Deputy that from 1996 to 23 January 2003, 10,584 persons were granted permission to remain in the State on the basis of an Irish born child. As of 19 February 2003, there were 11,493 such cases on hand. Of this number, 996 applications have been returned as the applicants had an alternative legal basis to remain in the State, for example, a valid work permit, business permission to remain, full refugee status and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">The question of a legitimate expectation is not correct as the High Court ruled on this matter and it was then appealed to the Supreme Court. The High Court ruled in the same way as the Supreme Court in this matter so people who came in after the High Court ruling and before the Supreme Court ruling had no legitimate expectation that the law would change or that the High Court had decided the case wrongly. I want to make that very clear. People had no legitimate grounds at that point to conclude the law was not as administered prior to the High Court decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">The Deputy also suggested some people withdrew their refugee applications, which is correct. A number of them reapplied to be considered as refugees and to seek asylum. The real issue is that the High Court and the Supreme Court have strongly ruled that the mere fact of parentage of an Irish-born child does not constitute legal grounds which prohibit the State from deporting a person where appropriate to maintain the integrity of immigration law. Each of the 11,000 people whose cases are on hand is to be the subject of an individual examination unless somebody decides otherwise. That is the view which the Government has taken. It was decided that there would be no mass deportations nor would there be any mass amnesty.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">I have received the Human Rights Commission's response and I have replied to it. I have set out in detail exactly what is happening in my Department and described its approach to the matter. The issue of the absence of legal aid was raised. The composition of letters seeking humanitarian leave to remain does not require legal aid. In some cases, assistance may be required which is generally available. It is not fundamentally a question of making a legal case to me in most instances.</p>

      <b>Mr. Cuffe</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
      his plans to bring forward improvements in prison conditions in Mountjoy and other locations in view of recent disturbances at Mountjoy Prison, and disturbing reports of prison conditions at this jail and other jails throughout the State.

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_163">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_218">There has been a significant surge in new prisons construction and in prison refurbishment in recent years with the result that prison conditions generally have improved considerably. I acknowledge that further improvement at certain prisons is required and I am determined to proceed with it as quickly as resources will allow.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">There are two possible options in respect of the replacement of the outdated prisoner accommodation at Mountjoy Prison. The first is to redevelop the prison on the existing site. This would involve the demolition and reconstruction of existing buildings while the prisoners remained <i>in situ.</i> The second option is to relocate the prison to a greenfield site. Exploration of the economics and feasibility of these options is under way and it is not possible to say when a decision is likely to be made regarding which option to pursue. I hope it will be made sooner rather than later. The possibility of acquiring suitable lands in the Dublin area and surrounding counties will have a major bearing on the decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">A new wing providing 100 spaces will come into operation early in 2004 at Limerick Prison. A tender for a new wing at Portlaoise Prison, which has been approved by the Department of Finance, is expected to issue in January 2004. The wing will replace C block at the prison which is in a poor state of repair.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_221">Is the Minister aware that the male prison at Mountjoy is one of the most historic within the system as well as one of the three worst within the State? I understand that outline refurbishment plans were drawn up but that these were rejected on cost grounds. I hope suitable alternative plans will be drafted.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">Can the Minister clarify whether he intends to move the prisoners at Mountjoy Prison to a more distant location? Does he not think it preferable to maintain a prison at a central location to ensure that visitors are not adversely affected by having to travel long distances to see their loved ones?</p>
          <p eId="para_223">Is the Minister aware of the unsanitary conditions prevailing at Mountjoy? In the basement level up to seven people are confined to each cell for up to 23 hours of any given day. What short-term plans does the Minister have to improve conditions at Mountjoy? This prison is over 150 years old and inflicting undue hardship on prisoners and staff.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_165">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_224">I assure the Deputy that I toured the Mountjoy complex at great length and in great detail a couple of months ago. It was after the summer recess of the Houses of the Oireachtas. My aim was to examine conditions for myself as it is sometimes easier to understand something when one sees it with one's own eyes. I am fully acquainted with the conditions at Mountjoy and I fully agree with the Deputy that in the male prison they are substandard and unsatisfactory. As the Deputy will appreciate, the Mountjoy complex has a number of elements including Mountjoy Prison, the training unit and the Dóchas centre for women prisoners. In the last facility conditions are very good by comparison with others. While the fabric of the building which houses the training centre is ageing, conditions there are remarkably superior to those in the main Mountjoy Prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">It is one of the terrible ironies of Irish life that when Mountjoy Prison was handed over to the State, there was a crude form of in-cell sanitation. This was removed as a security measure in the early 1920s. I regard it as wholly unacceptable that slopping out continues to be the norm at a number of Irish prisons. I was surprised when I visited Cork Prison to see that a portion which had been built in the 1980s had been constructed without in-cell sanitation. I have made it very clear to the Irish Prison Service that I must decide whether to embark on a sticking plaster refurbishment of the Mountjoy complex and expend considerable sums to achieve acceptable standards of sanitation, or to demolish and replace the existing buildings. If I come to the view that the buildings must be demolished and replaced, the issue of the prison's location arises as Deputy Cuffe has suggested.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">An argument can be made for maintaining a city centre prison, especially one which is close to the Four Courts and can facilitate committals. It is possible following a reallocation of functions within the Prison Service that Arbour Hill Prison would be used for that purpose. The question must be asked if Mountjoy is all that convenient for many visitors. Getting through the city centre is not that easy these days. It might be the case that a location on the M50 or some other place would be more accessible to more people than Mountjoy is at the moment. I will take this issue into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">I assure Deputy Cuffe that if it were up to me, the resources which are allocated each year would be used almost exclusively to refurbish and upgrade prison accommodation. One of the problems I have faced is that the massive overtime bill in the Prison Service has cannibalised capital which this House has voted for improvements to prisons. The money has been used to pay for an unsustainable staffing level.</p>

      [28400/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_166">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_230">I propose to take Questions Nos. 52 and 53 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">I am aware of a recent newspaper article which claimed that a woman is raped every 90 minutes. In the interests of accuracy, I clarify to the House that this figure is not taken from the Sexual Assault and Violence in Ireland report, also known as the SAVI report. There are two points which must be made. First, the SAVI report, which was published in March 2002, found that 7.8%, or almost one in 12, female victims of adult sexual assault reported their experiences to the Garda. However, this figure refers to all forms of sexual assault, including, for example, indecent exposure and is not restricted to the crime of rape. It is worth noting that one of the common reasons for adults not to disclose abuse in the form of sexual abuse was that they thought it was too trivial. Those are the reasons given in the SAVI report.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">Second, the reporting rate of 7.8% in the SAVI report refers to the lifetime experience of women interviewed rather than their experience taken on an annual basis. The claim that a woman is raped every 90 minutes is a newspaper extrapolation from the number of rape cases which actually take place grossed up by a factor of 12 for non-reporting and then divided into each day of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">As the Deputy has noted, the provisional statistics for the first nine months of this year show an increase of 42% in the number of sexual assaults in the third quarter of 2003. However, it is worth noting that in the same period, rape offences showed a significant decrease, with rape of a female down by 20% and section 4 rape down by 64%. The overall figure for sexual assaults in the first nine months of this year shows an overall decrease of 5%, or 76 fewer instances on the same period last year. The Commissioner has also informed me that there has been a 13% decrease in the number of sexual assaults for the 12 months ending on 31 October 2003. In addition, the overall category of sexual offences is showing a decrease of 20% in the same period.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">While I accept there must be a huge amount of non-reporting of sexual offences, I do not accept the extrapolation by that particular newspaper. Although I fully accept it was trying to do its best, it just multiplied the number of rapes by 12 and divided them into the number of days in the year, whereas the non-reporting multiple of 12, on which it was relying, dealt with a far wider range of offences. In one of the most significant reasons category for non-reporting, 15% were regarded by the victim as too trivial to report. That would not apply to rape.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDeasyFG" eId="spk_167">
          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_235">In one breath the Minister accepts there was a huge amount of non-reporting of these crimes but then he understates, or questions, the level of non-reporting generally. Some 42% of women experience some form of sexual abuse. If one looks at the figures in the 2002 census, that equates to approximately 620,000 women. Some 28% of men experience some form of sexual abuse, which amounts to 399,000 if one equates it to the 2002 census. We are talking about over one million people.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">Last month's figures from the Department show that the rape of a female was down 20%. The Rape Crisis Centre's figures, which compare January to August 2002 with January to August 2003, show that it was up 10%. The Rape Crisis Centre's figures indicate that fewer people are reporting to the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">The Minister has questioned me about public order offences and non-reporting. The people who deal with this crime dispute the Department's figures and strongly believe it is on the upswing and is not going down. They have asked the Minister to look at the legal system and at what it does to people, that is, what they go through when they are victims of sexual abuse. The Minister must look at some of the basic suggestions of the Rape Crisis Centre and people who deal with these crimes. I am talking about speedier trials and making the case that people are not comfortable with the complex and harrowing legal system and, for that reason, they are not reporting these crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">The Minister is not dealing with these issues and he is questioning the figures. Those who work in this area are of the strong opinion that the number of these crimes is on the rise and is not going down. The Minister questioned that and understated the level of non-reporting. That is dangerous. The Minister must accept that this report found there is a massive level of sexual abuse and it is increasing.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_168">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_239">I have no doubt the amount of sexual abuse and sexual crime greatly exceeds the amount of reported crime, but it is important for the Deputy to have regard to the report on which he is relying. The report contains on page 131 an interesting graph which sets out the reasons people did not report offences. It is interesting that by far the greatest category of reasons for non-reporting was that the victims thought the case was too trivial. That applied to adult and child abuse cases. The next most prominent reason, which was relative to younger people, that is, child abuse, was that they were too young to do anything about it. I stress to the Deputy that this was a lifetime's history. Less than 5% stated as a reason that they wanted to prevent family distress. Again, less than 5% stated that they felt ashamed. There are similar figures for child and adult abuse in that regard. Less than 5% blamed themselves for the incident, which was an unfortunate fact.</p>

          <p eId="para_277">We have a short time today and I do not want to deal with newspaper reports but with the SAVI report. The findings of the SAVI report are frightening, even if only two people were raped. There is a number of reasons so few women, in particular, report assaults and we must deal with them. As the Minister said, the first reason is they are terrified their case will become public. We must deal with that. The women interviewed said there was a lack of consistency in how judges approach and treat women who have been raped or violently attacked. We must also deal with that. I understand the Department provided some funding to deal with that problem but we do not know what happened that money – I think it was about €300,000. I raised that issue with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, at a committee meeting last week and he did not know what had happened it.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">Women are put off by the system and do not have confidence in it. They must wait at free legal aid centres as they cannot afford private solicitors.

          <p eId="para_288">The survey suggests that the Garda, for whom I am responsible, treat the victims of sexual assault in a caring way. The Deputy then asked about the way in which the court process is perceived to affect victims, women in particular and male victims on occasion. There is no doubt that an adversarial system such as we have, in which the complainant is a witness, is intimidating for any woman going to give evidence. I accept there is an element of intimidation purely on the basis that most people having been brutalised once do not want to relive the occasion in unsympathetic circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">It must be remembered, however, that justice is a public process in which the accused is entitled not to be convicted unless the case is proved beyond reasonable doubt. The accused must be in a position to challenge the victim's evidence and to be represented in court. As the Deputy knows, the law has changed in recent years to prevent wholly irrelevant questioning of victims about their sexual history with a view to embarrassing them. That is a step forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Legal aid has also been provided for victims of sexual crimes to advise them on their rights and to make submissions, where necessary, regarding proposals to cross-examine them on their sexual history. Victim Support and groups such as the Rape Crisis Centre make every effort to assist victims of sexual crime. They provide psychological support in what is for the victims, and I fully accept this, a traumatic re-enactment on the public stage of the offence committed against them.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">From my experience of both prosecuting and defending cases, the majority of the Judiciary are sympathetic to and protective of victims, both male and female, of sexual crime.</p>

      the proposals he has to review the current Garda districts; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_297">As I have indicated in responses to previous questions on this issue, the revision of district and divisional boundaries is being considered as part of a major ongoing review of Garda organisational structures under the strategic management initiative programme of modernisation. The review includes criteria for the justification of Garda districts which if accepted and implemented could have implications for the number of Garda districts.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">I am informed that the Garda SMI implementation steering group is in the process of finalising a report which will be forwarded to me over the coming weeks. I will give careful consideration to all the steering group's recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">The issue of Garda district boundaries also arises in the context of the national spatial strategy. The current boundaries are not fully geographically aligned with those of other agencies such as health boards and local government. This potentially creates a barrier to the multidisciplinary approach to service provision required in the implementation of the national spatial strategy. It also creates a problem for the proposals I am bringing under the Garda Síochána legislation to allow for interaction between local authorities and local gardaí. If gardaí span a number of local authority areas because of a non-conformity of districts, there will be difficulties with the issue. The national spatial strategy would seem, therefore, to offer an opportunity to review and make necessary revision to the organisational boundaries of the Garda Síochána which date back to the 1920s.</p>

          <p eId="para_300">The Garda authorities have been considering the PricewaterhouseCoopers report for over two and a half years. Is it acceptable that it is taking that length of time? Does the Minister think it acceptable to make public comments on the report without having received the final report? The report's proposals threaten the viability of rural Garda stations. We know that many of the rural Garda stations are already closed in all but name. Is it not the case that the Office of Public Works for which the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, has responsibility has already carried out a valuation on some of these rural Garda stations?</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_301">The SMI process is one in which there has been an undertaking to involve the representative associations and to move on the basis of a partnership approach. It is only now that the Garda is in a position to come to me with the report of the steering group. The Deputy may say that it has taken two and a half years but a fundamental change is being contemplated. If the participants in the process have regarded it as necessary to spend two and a half years studying it and working out the implications, I hope the time has been well spent because the work they have been doing has been serious.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">The Deputy raised the issue of the allocation of resources and the implications for rural Garda stations. I do not want to comment in detail on this, and I have not made any detailed comment on it despite what <i>The Irish Times</i> headline may suggest.</p>

          <p eId="para_306">I know what comments I have made. I have not made detailed comments on the issue because I am waiting to see the steering group's report. Resources will have to be allocated to the Garda Síochána and focused in a manner which reflects 21st century conditions and not the inheritance of the RIC from the 20th century. Undoubtedly, there will have to be change. It will not, however – I emphasise this – mean a depopulation by the Garda of areas which are vulnerable, nor will it entail an attitude that urban areas are given priority over rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">I am sure the present pattern of Garda stations in urban areas will also be the subject of review. In many areas of the country, as the Deputy pointed out, Garda station operating hours have been reduced to a few hours a week.</p>

Whether it makes sense to maintain those institutions and to keep the roof on them and spend Office of Public Works money keeping them for such short periods is a question which will, doubtless, be addressed in the SMI process.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">We live in a world of motor cars. In some areas of our cities a number of Garda stations can be found within a quarter or half a mile of each other and this must be considered. In my constituency, within the boundary of the canal, there are three Garda stations, one in Pearse Street, one in Harcourt Terrace and one in Kevin Street. Garda headquarters are in Harcourt Square. The centre point could hardly be ten minutes walk from any of them. I am sure there are some areas in the Deputy's constituency which would consider that indefensible.</p>

I would like to ask about Garda matters in my constituency. If the Garda division of Roscommon-Galway East is abolished and a new division of Roscommon-Sligo is created, a new Garda station will have to be built in south Roscommon within half a mile of the existing Garda station in Athlone.

          <p eId="para_322">I refer the Deputy to my response to Question No. 17 of 19 June 2003. As I stated then, the control and direction of the Garda Síochána, including the allocation of resources, is vested with the Garda Commissioner. I repeat that the Commissioner is the chief of police in Ireland. The allocation of Garda resources is based on a variety of operational demands which includes dealing with drug related offences. Any additional allocation of personnel to specific locations is subject to ongoing operational demands and the overall deployment of Garda personnel. I have been informed by the Garda authorities that since the publication of the national drugs strategy in May 2001, resources in Garda stations covering local drugs task force areas have been monitored. The number of personnel in the stations covering local drugs task force areas increased by 66 between January 2001 and September 2003. The level of Garda resources allocated in these areas continues to be monitored by local Garda management in line with the recommendations of the Garda national drug strategy implementation group.</p>

          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_323">I happen to have some knowledge of this area. Can the Minister elucidate further regarding policing on the ground? He has indicated that extra gardaí will be provided in the area. Does he believe that adequate gardaí, as opposed to extra gardaí, are available to meet the current requirements? My information suggests that adequate gardaí are not available to meet current requirements, regardless of the extent to which an increase has taken place.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Given that serious organised crime problems exist in that general area, as well in as other parts of Dublin and elsewhere, will the Minister take some initiative? He should avoid clarifying that there is a distinction between the chief of police and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The Minister has made clear that he receives advice from the chief of police. At what stage will he take initiatives in respect of these matters?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_241">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_325">A considerable amount of resources has been supplied to support the gardaí in the particular area with which we are dealing. The House is well acquainted with the problems which gave rise to the need to provide such resources. I do not want to comment on the exact number of persons who have been deployed or the exact nature of their deployment. A threat emerged as a result of the use of firearms, the incidence of intimidation and the activities of a small number of people in the area in question. The Garda is quite satisfied that it is making very significant progress in its extensive investigations into the activities of those I have mentioned. Extra resources were drafted in as a result of the problems I have mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">I spoke recently to Mr. Carty, assistant commissioner of the Garda Síochána, about Finglas Garda station. He said that he is not satisfied with the fabric and the suitability of the building. We have to examine all means of providing Finglas with a decent Garda station. A number of possibilities are being considered closely in that regard. The exact deployment of resources between Finglas Garda station and neighbouring Garda stations is a matter for the local Garda management, taking into account such issues as accommodation and facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">I share Deputy Durkan's concern about the Finglas area. Although I have been briefed about the response being made by the Garda, it would not be appropriate, in these circumstances, for me to make public the exact detail of the response. There is a significant response to the problems that have emerged in the area in question. The Garda Síochána has briefed me regularly on its response.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">I am not the chief of police and my function does not involve deciding that 20 gardaí should be moved from one place to another, or that five gardaí should be moved from one station to another. The reason I do not have such a function is very straightforward. The Garda Síochána is a disciplined force directed by an independent Commissioner. He reports to me and I report, in turn, to this House. We have a good and close working relationship. Very serious civil liberties or constitutional issues would be at stake if I became responsible for making decisions about the security of individuals, moving gardaí from one station to another, or giving the Commissioner direct day-to-day instructions on the micro-management of the resources which this House is making available to him. Deputy Durkan would not be the last person to point out such issues to me.</p>

          <p eId="para_331">Notwithstanding the Minister's reply, can he indicate if he agrees that one must deal with issues as they arise in certain circumstances? I accept that there is a need to protect the civil liberties of the people as a whole, but there is also a need to protect the civil liberties of law-abiding citizens. Certain acts are being committed on the watch of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. What does he propose to do, with or without the interaction that should take place, if the actions we have seen in recent times continue?</p>

          <p eId="para_333">I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle. Press reports have suggested that 980 gardaí are taking the pre-retirement course. This is a worrying statistic when one considers that no more than 670 recruits can graduate from the training college at Templemore each year. Can the Minister respond to that figure? What steps are being taken to do something about the high retirement rate within the force?</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_334">The Minister referred to Finglas Garda station, which is in very bad order. Reports in today's newspapers indicate that there have been more deaths this year in the Finglas area than in the Limerick area. Gardaí have to go to Blanchardstown to speak to suspects as they cannot conduct interviews in the station. What are the Minister's proposals for dealing urgently with the matter?</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_335">It was true that one could not conduct an interview in the Garda station in question at the time of an incident which was the subject of a recent court case, but I think that is no longer the case. I understand that video facilities are now available – I hope I am correct in saying that.</p>

          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_337">I accept the Deputy's point that the Garda station in Finglas is unsatisfactory and needs to be refurbished, replaced or rebuilt. In response to Deputy Deasy, who raised the issue of Garda retirements, members of the Garda Síochána are free to choose when to leave the force, having completed their minimum service for pension entitlements. Those who have served for 30 years are free to remain in the force until the age of 57. I am not in a position to click my fingers to put in place one pattern of retirement rather than another. That is their free choice and is the contract they entered into with the State. In the next few weeks, an additional class from Templemore will graduate and be fully attested. In those circumstances, for the first time in the history of this State, the strength of the Garda Síochána will exceed 12,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">On Deputy Durkan's point, I agree there are occasions on which we must respond but neither I nor the Commissioner announce the responses in public. We do not give to the people to whom we are responding and to whom we are facing up the advantage of knowing, in exact detail, what we are doing. The Commissioner informed me that there has been a considerable allocation of resources in this particular area. He has given me an outline of what is involved and I am satisfied that his decision in the matter is correct. I fully support him in how he is deploying members of the Garda Síochána.</p>

      <b>Mr. Stagg</b>
      asked the

      the progress made to date with regard to the installation of video recording equipment in Garda stations; the number of stations in which the equipment has been installed; the number which have no such equipment; the overall number of interview rooms in Garda stations; the number in which equipment has been installed; the number which will have it when the current programme is completed; the number which will have no such equipment; his views on whether it is desirable that all interview rooms should have such equipment; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [28264/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_251">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_340">The Criminal Justice Act 1984 (Electronic Recording of Interviews) Regulations 1997 provides for the recording of interviews in respect of suspects who are detained in custody. In 1999, the Government decided to introduce an audio-video system for the recording of such interviews and the number of stations and rooms now fitted out with the specialised equipment within these stations is such as to provide broad nationwide coverage. To date, 235 interview rooms in 131 stations have been fitted out and of these, all but a handful are in use. The small number of rooms where equipment remains to be installed will be operational as soon as practicable.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">There are 703 Garda stations throughout the State – Deputy Naughten referred to some of them earlier. Many of these are rural stations and are not equipped to accommodate the holding of prisoners or their interrogation and are open for a set number of hours per day, week or month. It was never the intention, nor is it considered necessary, that all 703 Garda stations should have audio-visual facilities installed or that every interview room in the stations be fitted out with the system. Indeed, I am advised by the Garda authorities that the number of rooms and stations fitted out provides the nationwide coverage envisaged by the Government decision. The installation of the equipment is now virtually complete.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_252">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_342">The Minister will have noted a particular case before the courts last week, the substance of which was never heard because of two to three weeks of legal argument on whether statements taken in 1998 by the Garda were admissible. The statements were not allowed and the case collapsed. A jury had been empanelled and lawyers had been contracted at enormous cost to the State, all of which could have been avoided had the recommendations of the Barra O'Briain report in 1979, a quarter of a century ago, been implemented. We have been remiss in this area. The installation of video recording equipment in interview rooms has taken a long time.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">Arising from the Minister's reply, can I take it that we will never again witness the wasting of time, money and alleged breaches of people's rights and that we will have factual records of what transpires when people are in Garda custody rather than reading on a regular basis in the newspapers about what is or is not happening?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_253">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_344">The reply which I just gave the Deputy is based on information given to me by the Garda Síochána which believes the country is covered by an adequate network. I agree with Deputy Costello that the circumstances of the case revealed last week were most unsatisfactory. We must remember, as he has conceded, that the offence to which that case related was apparently committed before commencement of the Government programme in 1999 and that the equipment in question was not available at that time.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The period of delay between the committing of the offence and the trial – I might as well speak on this matter before somebody raises it – is another matter of grave concern to those studying the figures. The latest figures from the Garda Síochána, dating from last June, show that 20,271 interviews with suspected persons have been recorded since the introduction of the scheme. The equipment was not used in 1,340 interviews during the same period. That figure breaks down as follows: 891 prisoners objected to having their interviews recorded and in 448 interviews, equipment was not available or was faulty. I do not have the other figure. The number of interviews which did not proceed because of the non-availability of equipment represented 2% of the total. I will keep that matter under review as we proceed. I agree with Deputies that there is no good reason an accused person who is subject to detention under the 1984 Act should not be visually recorded so as to remove all controversy when a jury comes to consider the matter of who is telling the truth and what transpired during an interview.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_349">On 11 November, in response to questions in this House on the Cabinet sub-committee, the Taoiseach told me he would continue to hold regional meetings with the Cabinet. It is the Taoiseach's business if he decides to hold a meeting in Nenagh.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">In the course of his reply, the Taoiseach said that the Society of the St. Vincent de Paul would be given an opportunity to make its case in respect of persons for whom it cares. Subsequently, the Taoiseach disputed its report that some 300,000 children were in families living on incomes of less than €175 per week by saying: "There are not those kind of figures. The official figures of what people actually get in money terms do not show that." The figures produced by the Society of the St. Vincent de Paul are contained in the Combat Poverty Agency's official report which states that the most recent data indicates one quarter of all children, almost 300,000, live in families with an income of, not €175 per week, but €156 per week which is even worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">Will the Taoiseach clarify his remarks in respect of the clear and cogent case made by the Society of the St. Vincent de Paul that there are 300,000 children living in families whose incomes are less than €175 per week? What does he propose to do about that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_256">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_352">I made those remarks during the weekend when assisting the Society of the St. Vincent de Paul in its Christmas campaign as I have done for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">Deputy Kenny said the figures presented by the Society of the St. Vincent de Paul on the extent of child poverty, that 300,000 children are in families with incomes of less than €175, are derived from the published results of the Living in Ireland survey in the pre-budget submission from the Combat Poverty Agency. Those figures are based on risk of poverty indicators and the percentage of persons below 60% of median income. The figures differ substantially from the consistent poverty measurement in the national anti-poverty strategy. The current figure for children in consistent poverty is 6.5%, or 74,000. There is a major difference between 300,000 and 74,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">The measure of poverty used in the national anti-poverty strategy, or NAPS, and more recently in the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion is that of consistent poverty, which measures a combination of low income and enforced deprivation, that is, below 50% to 60% of average disposable income and lacking at least one of a set of eight basic deprivation indicators as set out in the SRI report. The consistent poverty measure was adopted in the NAPS because the inclusion of deprivation as well as income gives a far better guide than income alone to changes in the extent and nature of poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">The second part of the Deputy's question asked what measures we are taking to deal with the problem. We are already acting on child benefit. We also have measures to tackle child poverty. The lower social welfare rates have risen by 50% over the past five to six years, which is 24% above the rise in the cost of living over the same period from 1997 to 2003. Child benefit has more than trebled, from €38.10 per month to €125.60. We also intend to meet the NAPS income target.</p>

          <p eId="para_357">By 2007 under the programme. We have also provided almost €17 million for the back to school clothing and footwear allowance. A range of services introduced in recent years has benefited children in low-income families. We have also introduced several other initiatives on health, pre-schooling and primary schools, which are all helping children.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_358">That seems to represent the Killarney speech that I heard the Taoiseach make some time ago. It reflects a different world from the reality. All I can do is quote from the official report of the Combat Poverty agency which says that 300,000 children live in income-poor families. That was reiterated by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, whose figures the Taoiseach castigated. If he was helping the society last week, for which I commend him, I hope he listened to Professor John Monaghan, its vice-president, who said: "Government needs to take steps urgently to ensure that those who benefited least during the so-called Celtic Tiger are not further penalised now that things are much tougher for them."</p>
          <p eId="para_359">The Taoiseach read out a list of instances where he feels that benefits have been brought about. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has introduced cuts of €58 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_361">Those dependent on long-term medication have had to pay a 50% increase since the general election, those attending hospitals pay 40% more, those who depend on rent supplement pay 70% more, and those who send their children to college, if they can, pay 90% more. These increases in stealth charges have a direct downward pressure on those who are most marginalised and victimised by society and Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">The Taoiseach, more than anyone else, should not castigate official figures from his own Government's national Combat Poverty Agency, whose truth is reflected by the Society of St. Vincent de Paul. There will be hungry children this Christmas and families seriously under pressure. The type of activity introduced in the Estimates last week does not help them.</p>

          <p eId="para_363">I did not castigate the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, of which I am a long-standing supporter and which I was supporting last Sunday. I agree with Professor Monaghan that there will be children at risk this year who will require our help. That is the reason my Government is so supportive, not only of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul but of many of the agencies, and funds them year after year with large sums to assist them in their excellent work. I do not accept what was said about the risk of poverty. There is a difference between being at risk of poverty and poverty itself. The figures are based on the risk of poverty. I was making the point that 300,000 children are not in poverty, and the figures exist to support this.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">I know what the Society of St. Vincent de Paul bases its figures on, but the risk of poverty indicator is not the one to consider. I obtained my figures from the anti-poverty agency. My only comment was that the society's figures are not in line with our own for people in this category. The figure for those in consistent poverty is 6.5%, or 74,000 children. That has fallen in the past eight or nine years from about 15% to about 5%, which is an enormous drop. We must continue with important measures to target and assist children, especially those at risk. For that reason, the Government supports the efforts of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul in trying to help those at risk this Christmas.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_365">If the Taoiseach asserts that he has always helped the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, no one in the House will challenge that. However, the matter is not about charity but justice. Deputy Bertie Ahern is the Taoiseach, and his Government has cut €58 million from spending on the most defenceless section of society. He dismissed the impact on the weakest in society of those €58 million of cuts which the Minister for Social and Family Affairs put through in the Book of Estimates.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">If the Taoiseach wishes to dismiss the case I made last week, does he also dismiss the same case advanced by these 13 organisations? They are Threshold, the Simon Community of Ireland, Focus Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, the Jesuit Centre for Faith and Justice, the Irish Refugee Council, the National Youth Council of Ireland, the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, Age Action Ireland, the Children's Rights Alliance, Women's Aid, OPEN and Cherish. All these organisations point out that what the Taoiseach has done will have a serious impact on the poorest and weakest in the community.</p>

He knows that the former was agreed between the Government and those organisations in the NAPS to mean children who cannot be sure of a hot meal during the day or a warm coat. That figure is 70,000 children. However, the figure for relative poverty takes in people—</p>

          <p eId="para_431">Against the backdrop of the election, does the Taoiseach agree that, during the course of the summer, many leaders in communities and political parties, including Sinn Féin, the Ulster Unionist Party and others, played an heroic role in helping to defuse difficult situations which arose in what are sometimes termed "interface communities" and ensuring that many problems which could have arisen around contentious Orange marches did not take place? We had an important summer in terms of showing what can be achieved through collective and concerted efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">Does the Taoiseach also agree that there is great concern at the growing incidence of sectarian attacks in the North of Ireland? Only last Thursday, we saw the brutal murder of 21 year old James McMahon and the previous week, a man was subjected to an horrific machete attack. Does the Taoiseach agree that all these attacks deserve to be roundly condemned and the only way in which they can be properly addressed is through the same efforts being employed by community leaders and political parties as was demonstrated during the summer?</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The Taoiseach is meeting the British Prime Minister later this week. In following on from these terrible events we witnessed, including the tragic death of Mr. McMahon, will the Taoiseach raise these ongoing sectarian attacks with the British Prime Minister?</p>

          <p eId="para_434">As always, I utterly condemn all sectarian attacks. Those engaged in carrying them out do an injustice to the huge number of people who want to see progress and peace in Northern Ireland. I condemn the tragic circumstances of the death of James McMahon last week. The PSNI has already given its view on where it believes responsibility for that murder and events surrounding it lies. It has been quite categorical in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">There is no doubt the pro-Agreement parties and many community organisations worked extremely hard and co-operated well during the summer. I had the opportunity before, during and after the summer of discussing this issue with all the groups, including, for the first time, the loyalist commission. Everyone worked extremely hard to deal with the issues. However, as the Deputy pointed out, there have recently been a number of signs which are a cause for concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">As I said over the weekend, I hope people turn out for the Assembly elections tomorrow. It is the first time since 22 May 1998 that people have had an opportunity to vote for the Assembly. It is important that there is strong commitment to and support for the Good Friday Agreement, the Assembly, the Executive and the North-South bodies. Every report published in recent years has shown the benefits which have accrued to the people of Northern Ireland because of the Agreement. I hope politicians will receive a good mandate to continue the institutions and the Government remains ready to continue the effort to get full implementation of the Agreement after the elections.</p>

We have also seen many attacks on Catholic homes and schools. We have already indicated, and I have no doubt it is the shared view of all opinion in the House, that sectarianism in all its manifestations must be rejected and condemned. Will the Taoiseach join me in so doing? There is only one way in which this can be addressed, as demonstrated in other parts of the North of Ireland, the Border counties and elsewhere. It is only through concerted leadership, good example and the collective efforts of community and political leaders that the scourge of sectarianism can be rooted out of Irish society.</p>

          <p eId="para_438">I reiterate that there have been many attacks, examples of intimidation and other events. There is no need to discuss the detail of these, regardless of who originated or was involved in them, but I reject them all. We must hope that after the election we will be in a position to move on, to try to have the Agreement implemented, to get the institutions functioning, to encourage cross-party co-operation and to deal with issues such as policing. Respect must be fostered and progress made on these issues in order to deal with the type of occurrences to which the Deputy refers. It is clear that there are acts outside the law which are dangerous and undermine everything we are trying to achieve. I look forward, after the election, to joining the parties to try to deal with these matters as quickly as possible.</p>

I know the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is a busy man on all fronts, but is there any prospect of this Bill soon coming before the House and will it address the issue that came as a big shock to the Minister, Deputy Walsh?

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney)</from>
          <p eId="para_564">I propose to take all the questions together.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">It is important to focus on what the proposal before the Council of Ministers this week is about. It is not about the funding of or legislating for embryonic stem cell research in Ireland, it is about the adoption of stringent guidelines and safeguards to regulate the conduct of research in respect of embryonic stem cells. This forms part of the specific EU programme for life science, genomics and biotechnology for health within the overall €16 billion EU framework programme. Funding of €1.1 billion for adult and embryonic stem cell research was agreed when the Council of Ministers adopted a specific programme over a year ago. A moratorium on this type of research was agreed, which expires at the end of 2003. Member states asked for the moratorium to allow the Commission time to develop guidelines in governing the research. The Commission's proposals are about those guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">I support the application of strict guidelines and safeguards to regulate this research at European level. The guidelines the Commission has produced are comprehensive and include important safeguards. It is vital that we understand what can happen if the guidelines are not agreed by the Council. As the Council has agreed the activity of stem cell research and the line of funding attached to it, there is no reason the European Commission should not seek to pursue that activity once the moratorium expires at the end of 2003, even if no guidelines are agreed in respect of embryonic cells. Many member states have the requisite legal and ethical regulatory regimes in place to permit such research and are strongly supportive of concerted European research being undertaken in this field.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">Following the opinion of the European Parliament, the matter was recently discussed at working group level in Brussels. In those discussions, the EU Council legal services confirmed that the Commission has a duty to implement the measure even if no guidelines are agreed. It is, therefore, open to the Commission to bring forward a programme of action via the established common procedures initiated via the relevant framework programme regulatory committee. Ultimately, if the regulatory committee rejects the Commission's proposal to act, the matter will revert to Council where in this instance a qualified majority vote will be required to reject it.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">Given that the majority of member states have indicated that they wish to see this research proceed, there is every reason to believe that a Commission proposal emerging via this route will be adopted. However, there is no guarantee that such a proposal will be based on the guidelines as drafted. The fact that the European Parliament has voted in favour of liberalising the guidelines by removing the cut-off date which restricts activity under this programme to embryos created before 27 June 2002 for IVF treatments and no longer required for that purpose underscores this danger. Against this background, the Commission's proposal establishes coherent, consistent and stringent guidelines and safeguards to govern EU funding of research taking place only in those member states where it is deemed legal and ethical. I stress that it explicitly respects the positions of those member states whose legal and ethical regimes forbid such research. We must not miss the opportunity to put in place controls, guidelines and parameters for the conduct of this research. It would be an unsatisfactory outcome if Ireland were to oppose the guidelines and contribute to a situation where European research in this area would go ahead in a more loosely or non-regulated fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_569">I reiterate to Deputy Gay Mitchell that the funds in question are EU funds. Framework programme funds come from Community resources collected and distributed under the legal framework of the EU treaties. This pooling of resources is fundamental to all democratic decisions. The Commission's proposal is for a Council decision on the application of guidelines and safeguards on embryonic cell stem research. No new legislation is involved in this case and the matter of funding is not at issue, as it was previously decided.</p>
          <p eId="para_570">The European Union (Scrutiny) Act 2002 does not require draft Council decisions to be submitted for scrutiny. Nevertheless, my Department was happy to brief the sub-committee on European scrutiny, chaired by Deputy Gay Mitchell and to further brief the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business on the dossier.</p>

          <p eId="para_580">I appreciate that the matter of embryonic stem cell research is an emotive issue on which Members have strong views. It is essential, however, that we do let those views obscure what is at issue. There has been a tendency in some quarters to address the European Commission proposal as if it were legislating for embryonic stem cell research in Ireland. It does precisely the opposite. The proposal reinforces the principle of ethical subsidiary and guarantees that Community supported research will not be undertaken in any member state where it is neither legal nor deemed ethical.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Having made that guarantee, it provides for stringent guidelines and safeguards to underpin concerted European research only in those member states where it is legal and deemed ethical, and then only when the researchers in question have explored all possible alternatives to their planned approach to the research. Given that what is at issue here is the application of guidelines and safeguards, I stress that it would be a very unsatisfactory outcome if Ireland were to oppose the guidelines and contribute to a situation in the EU where this research would go ahead in a more loosely or non-regulated fashion.</p>

          <p eId="para_582">Is the Tánaiste aware that technology is now available allowing <i>in vitro</i> fertilisation to take place without the creation of spare embryos? Is she further aware that stem cells can be produced from other sources, which are more promising as material for the various therapies that are at issue here than stem cells produced from human embryos involving the killing of those human embryos? In the Tánaiste's opinion are the embryos in question human and, if they are human, do they have any human rights? If they have human rights, do the human rights of the embryos in question encompass the right not to be deliberately killed?</p>
          <p eId="para_583">Does the Tánaiste think she might be accused of being a hypocrite by voting to allow Irish taxpayers' money to be used to pay for something in another country that is illegal here? Would that be almost as hypocritical as saying that we would ban experiments on human animals in Ireland but would use Irish taxpayers' money to support the carrying out of experiments on live animals somewhere else in the European Union? Is that not a position that is fundamentally not only contrary to human rights in this instance, but also hypocritical?</p>

          <p eId="para_586">I am not a scientist and will not pretend to be one. While I am not familiar with all the developments in science, in recent weeks I have spoken to a number of scientists who differ on this matter, which is not black and white. Some scientists take the view Deputy Bruton has expressed that adult stem cells can do what is necessary and others take the view that the embryonic cells are much more versatile and can be converted into any one of the 210 cells we have in our bodies whereas adult cells can only be used for the purpose for which they were taken – a liver cell for a liver etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">Clearly these embryos have the potential to become a human being if implanted in a woman. We are talking here about supernumerary embryos that remain after IVF treatment and embryos that were created before June 2002, which is the cut-off date, although I accept the European Parliament wanted that date to be removed. We are talking about embryos that are in existence and that are clearly frozen in different member states. In those member states where there are not legal or ethical issues they may in some circumstances, subject to the guidelines, which the Commission suggests, be used for basic research. We are not talking about creating new embryos.</p>

          <p eId="para_589">They can become human if they are implanted in a woman. Clearly they have not the potential to become human by remaining in a refrigerated condition, which is what we are discussing.

          <p eId="para_591">Of course they deserve respect and dignity. Some countries take one view and other countries take a different view. While Ireland has its own view on these matters, as the Deputy knows, we strongly believe in ethical subsidiarity in this and other issues. We have had protocols added to treaties to protect our rights in this regard in some instances and that has always been respected.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">Funding is not up for discussion tomorrow. The funding issue has been settled. It is now part of the EU framework programme that up to €1.1 billion can be used to fund research on this and adult stem cells. The issue is whether it should be done under guidelines, controls and safeguards or in a free-for-all way as applies in other parts of the world. I believe, as does the Government, that guidelines and safeguards are far preferable in this area than an unregulated situation after the end of December.</p>

          <p eId="para_594">Given that we had such advance notice of this impending decision, why did we not seek direction from the Irish Council for Bioethics, which we specifically set up to address difficult ethical issues like this? Why have we not heard from that body? Why has the Tánaiste not sought direction from it on what should be our position?</p>
          <p eId="para_595">In the Seanad the Tánaiste seemed to indicate that scientific knowledge is now an international commodity without any real borders and that if a scientific development occurs in one country it is very difficult to prevent its use becoming applicable elsewhere. Does this mean that it will be a question of who is willing to use the latest science and that we do not really have control over what genetic research may develop because some other company – it is largely companies that are carrying out this research – will patent the results of such research? Was the Tánaiste intimating in the Seanad that we do not really have control because this is an international affair?</p>
          <p eId="para_596">If the funding issue has been decided, why did the European Parliament committee, which was asked to investigate the issue on 4 November, debate a series of detailed amendments, which sought to redirect the funding in many different ways? The committee may not have sought to amend the budget but to set conditions as to what could be funded. Why did the European Parliament debate a range of amendments on where the funding should go? Was that Parliament just engaged in an exercise for show or was there real room to determine where the funding should go? How can the Tánaiste say on the one hand that the funding has been decided but on the other hand that the European Parliament has been engaged in a very strenuous debate as to where the funding should go?</p>
          <p eId="para_597">Why does the Tánaiste think other countries are taking a different position in saying they will not vote in favour of the funding? While we will not know until Thursday, why will countries like Germany and Italy decide to vote against the proposals if, as the Tánaiste says, the funding has been decided and all that remains is to provide the guidelines to regulate the research to be carried out?</p>
          <p eId="para_598">Why did we not ask for direction from the Irish Council for Bioethics, which has about 20 scientists with specialist knowledge in this area and which we established for the purpose of providing advice for the Government and all parties here on these very difficult ethical issues?</p>

          <p eId="para_599">The group that has been charged with responsibility to advise the Government in this area is the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction, chaired by Dervilla Donnelly, which was appointed by the Government about three years ago to look at all the issues arising from IVF and which has not yet reported.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The European Parliament has a role of consultation and not of co-decision. While the European Parliament was consulted, it has no co-decision roles. The legal service's advice states: "It is clear that the Commission has to exercise its implementing powers in full conformity with the provisions of the decision of last year." It is for the Commission to initiate changes in the framework programme. Proposals are initiated by the Commission under the European Union structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_601">The issue of funding has been settled and is law within the European Union. The only open issue is what will happen when the moratorium runs out. At the time the Framework Document was adopted, Ireland was one of the countries that stated we did not want to see money going into this area until there were guidelines and safeguards. There was an agreement – not a legal requirement – that a moratorium would be established giving the Commission a reasonable timeframe, which it believed was about 18 months. That timeframe has now almost expired which is why the decision must be taken at the Council meeting this week. The Commission produced its proposals in this regard in July. Those proposals followed widespread consultation with member states in the form of internal conferences, seminars and a working group. The Commission only made its proposal after the widest consultation.</p>

No advice was given to the Cabinet by the Attorney General. Does this comply with the Constitution?

          <p eId="para_609">Does the Minister also agree that it is likely, as Deputy Ryan said, that this matter will be blocked by the Council of Ministers in any event because of the position of Italy, Portugal, Germany, Austria and others who are sitting on the fence?

          <p eId="para_621">Yes, today. This is the first point I wish to make, as people seem to make a big issue of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">I confirm what I said to Deputy Kenny on the Order of Business on many occasions, as I am sure he will agree, that I was available to attend either the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business or the Sub-committee on European Scrutiny, or any other committee to discuss this matter but no invitation was forthcoming.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">On the issue of Community funding, I do not want to compare nuclear research with this area except to say that Ireland takes a strong view against nuclear power and nuclear research, yet Community funds have been used in this area for many years, including when Deputy Gay Mitchell was in power.</p>

          <p eId="para_625">We know the implications of pooling funds within the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">The issues raised by Deputy Gay Mitchell would be relevant if we were proposing to conduct this research in Ireland. We are not. What we are doing is ensuring that, in those member states where it is ethical and legal, it will be done under strict safeguards, guidelines and controls and that there will not be the unsatisfactory free-for-all which exists elsewhere. That is the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">It is wrong of Deputy Gay Mitchell to suggest that the reference to supernumerary embryos is a red herring. This is not the case. No new embryos can be created for the purpose of this research. These embryos cannot be used if adult stem cells can be used and the applicants must prove this to an ethical committee. The strongest possible guidelines are being put in place. Scientists will have to share the stem lines to avoid having to create unnecessary ones. That is a fact. The Commission has to come back in 2005 having reviewed the outcome regarding this research.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">This is a grey area. It is a complex and sensitive issue. As a country, we are being asked whether we agree with Commission proposals for guidelines and safeguards. As one of the countries that sought those guidelines and safeguards, it would be wrong for us to use our vote now to block the guidelines being put into effect and to have the uncontrolled situation which will exist from next year. It is a matter for every member state to decide for itself what it should do in the vote. Our decision is based on our concerns and the way we believe research in this area should be governed.</p>

          <p eId="para_638">In regard to the Minister's opening remarks on adult stem cell research, which was further developed by Deputy John Bruton, like the Minister I do not have the necessary scientific information to make a judgment call on this, which I imagine to be the case with many Members. This underlines my argument that we need to have a full and informed debate here.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">Is it not the case that what is required here could well be addressed through research on adult stem cells as opposed to embryonic stem cell research which clearly raises a major ethical question for many people, including many Members? Given the obvious – not apparent – division within scientific opinion and what I already outlined as the need for further information and debate on this important issue, would it not be better for the Minister to abstain from voting on this matter? This would allow for a full and informed debate on a motion to be put before the House by Government, if there is agreement at Government level on this issue, and a comprehensive debate with all the information available in the House. In such a full and frank debate, we should allow for a free vote.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHarney" eId="spk_489" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
          <from>Ms Harney</from>
          <p eId="para_640">I answered a number of the questions already but I will repeat them. There are conflicting views from the science world in regard to this area. Some scientists are of the opinion that embryonic stem cells have greater versatility and, therefore, have a greater capacity to contribute to finding cures to many degenerative illnesses. The purpose here is basic research. Others take the different view that there is still great potential in adult cells. That is not a debate I will get involved in as I am not a scientist and I am not competent to comment on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">There is no question of EU funds being provided to countries which do not allow this research legally or ethically. In fact, one of the very clear guidelines within the Commission's proposal provides that research must be legal and ethical in a member state before any application can be considered. Furthermore, applicants will have to satisfy an ethics committee that adult cells cannot be used. The need to use embryonic cells will have to be demonstrated.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">Many issues arise in this debate. One of them is the question of what to do with embryos a couple no longer wishes to use after IVF treatment has been concluded. This question must be addressed which is why the Donnelly commission's report will cover it and many other matters and inform everyone's thinking including members of the Government. The vote will take place tomorrow, not on 27 November. Ireland must decide whether to vote in favour of the guidelines it sought so strongly or, as Deputy Ó Caoláin suggests, sit on the fence. It would not be satisfactory for this country to take the latter course. If it is the case that a blocking minority prevents these guidelines being adopted, how could a country which formed part of it request guidelines in January or February if research is proceeding. That would be a very difficult scenario in which to find oneself.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">Taking all circumstances into account, the Government and I believe putting guidelines, safeguards and regulations in place is preferable to the situation which might exist if that action were not taken. In many member states research of this sort is supported in the private sector. We are talking here about public sector research which will come into the public domain. One of the proposed guidelines involves an EU register whereby the results of research would be made available. The research will not be the sole preserve of the private sector. Many member states feel very strongly about that matter. As Senator Henry said, we do not want to see private companies with large bio-banks in Europe. Some countries take the strong view that public funding of research is necessary to provide public information about findings.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">The issue of the availability of research was raised. Knowledge knows no boundaries. If new knowledge becomes available as a result of stem cell research, I am sure companies all over the world will use it to create and develop new products and medicines. Knowledge cannot be confined to where it is researched or emerges. This is always the case with new developments and innovations.</p>

          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_645">I have some questions for the Minister with which I seek to put the debate in context. Is it the Minister's understanding that the purpose of stem cell research is to investigate the possibility of treating Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, spinal cord injuries, stroke, burns, heart disease, diabetes, osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis, among others? Is it a fact that the concrete and specific proposal to be voted on tomorrow involves the funding of research only in member states in which such funding is requested? Will research only involve embryos created for medically-assisted IVF treatment which are currently frozen and which would otherwise be destroyed? Under this proposal, will embryos have to be donated voluntarily by consent of the male and female involved and without any payment? Will researchers have to comply fully with comprehensive ethical and legal rules? Will research only be funded where it meets agreed objectives and where there is no adequate alternative?</p>
          <p eId="para_646">Given that no ethical guidelines are in place, what was the Irish input into the formulation of the Commission's proposal? Was a paper produced? Can we have sight of the view of the Minister, the Government and the country on the proposed guidelines? It is claimed that if the proposal is not agreed, the existing moratorium can be extended beyond 31 December and into the Irish Presidency. Is that a fact?</p>

          <p eId="para_649">Those who favour the research in question say it can advance treatment of many degenerative illnesses such as those mentioned by Deputy Howlin. Funding will go only to those member states in which such research is legally and ethically permitted. Before funding is approved, researchers will be required to demonstrate that there is no alternative to the use of embryonic stem cells and that they cannot use adult or animal stem cells. Researchers will have to make stem lines available to other researchers to minimise the number of lines which will be used. Donors cannot be paid. The donation of embryos must be voluntary.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">I understand that well established guidelines exist in this area and that these formed the basis of the proposal. I am not sure who from Ireland was involved in the drafting of the Commission's proposal. It was done at working group and at Commission level. I do not have the details of our involvement in terms of technical expertise to hand, but I can forward them to the Deputy. There was widespread consultation with member states on the proposed guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">The legal advice is that the moratorium will cease at the end of this year. I am not aware of any support for its extension and there may be legal implications in adopting that approach. I have not spoken to the Commission since the EU Parliament's decision. We will be informed of that tomorrow. The Commissioner was here to meet with me a couple of weeks ago and we had a long discussion about this and other matters. I took the strong view that there was no question of an extension of the moratorium. There are many countries which want to proceed with applications in this area and I am not certain they would agree to a further extension.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnBruton" eId="spk_494">
          <from>Mr. J. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_652">The Minister has said that scientists differ on the need to destroy human embryos to produce stem cells to accomplish the positive goals Deputy Howlin outlined. Given that there is doubt about the need to destroy any human embryo, the Minister would be wise to apply the precautionary principle we apply to the environment. If there are two ways of doing something, one of which creates pollution and one of which does not, we do the latter unless we are forced to take the former action. Surely, we should apply the cautionary principle to stem cell research. If there are two ways of producing stem cells, one of which destroys a potential human life and one which does not, we should only take the former action if we are satisfied there is no other option. Why have the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, who originally agreed to this programme, failed to apply the precautionary principle? Deputy Cowen has been anonymous and failed to defend his decisions in the House. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment is having to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The argument that these human embryos will die anyway is a very tricky one to use. It is an argument which could be used to justify the carrying out of experiments on people who are terminally ill. Surely, that is not something this House would wish to justify.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">I wish to probe the Minister's concept of ethics. She speaks of actions being ethically permissible in one country, but not in another. While I am not a philosopher, my understanding is that ethics are indivisible. Ethics do not change simply because one crosses to another jurisdiction. Given this is a European Union and we are citizens of it, we should not permit, vote for or accept something we believe is ethically wrong. I have been trying to establish the Minister's opinion, and I still do not have a clear picture in my mind. Does she believe it is right and necessary to destroy these potential human lives in the interest of medical research at this stage in the state of her knowledge? I am not asking her to give a scientific judgment but a political one as a principled politician. Does she believe it is right and necessary to destroy these human lives? Should we not apply the precautionary principle and try other methods of producing stem cells first?</p>

          <p eId="para_664">On the issue of ethics, what is the role of the Irish Council for Bioethics if it is not to give advice on these complex issues of genetic engineering and the related issue which will follow on from it? The advice for which the Minister is looking, if I am correct, relates to a commission set up to investigate IVF technology. The issue we are debating today is primarily one about the ethics of the genetic engineering techniques being used. The Irish Council of Bioethics is the very body that could help us in terms of presenting the scientific argument to the Government before we reach a decision in Europe on where we stand.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">I take the Minister's point that we do not have to have one European ethic and that people can have different ethics. Surely, as a country, we, like the Germans or the Italians, can set out our ethics. On that basis, why has the Minister not gone to the Irish Council for Bioethics? Some 20 scientists were selected by the Government to work on a wide variety of scientific disciplines related to genetic engineering, the very type of work stem cell research is. If we are not consulting the council on this issue, why did we set it up? Will we get its advice after the fact? It is having a special seminar on the issue on 9 December next. The time is unfortunate. We should have examined the ethics behind our decision in advance of us having to vote rather than afterwards.</p>

          <p eId="para_669">Clearly, the Government would always seek the advice of the body Deputy Eamon Ryan mentioned on matters influencing what might happen in this State. The reason we appointed the commission a number of years ago was to report, advise, examine and consult on all the issues surrounding the difficult area of IVF treatment. It comes down to what we want to see at European level. If this research is going to be funded, do we want it to be in an uncontrolled and unregulated fashion or under the type of regime being proposed by the Commission tomorrow? Controls, regulations and safeguards are far preferable to a free-for-all.</p>

I am appalled to hear colleagues in this House ask leading question and being prepared to go along with an issue of such vital importance and on which the Dáil and the Government have been sidelined. The decision is being made tomorrow and the Minister brought the issue to the Government today having up to now resisted all efforts to account either to the Government or to this House for her actions. That is appalling. That did not happen in Italy, Portugal, Austria and Germany. Why does the Minister find it necessary to accommodate what the British and the French are saying? There are other member states which do not believe the sky will fall tomorrow if this decision is not made in the way the Minister has stated.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">I accept what the Minister said that this is a grey, complex and sensitive area but for all of those reasons, she has handled it appallingly.

Even at this late hour and in view of the fact this matter is likely to be blocked at the Council tomorrow, will the Minister ask her colleagues in Government to come forward with a Green Paper on this complex and sensitive issue so that, once and for all, this House and the representatives of the people can deal with an important issue in the way it should have been addressed without anybody in the Opposition or elsewhere giving an excuse to a Minister who has behaved in an appalling manner.</p>

What, to the Tánaiste's knowledge, is the extent of human somatic stem cell research in Ireland?

          <p eId="para_711">I am told that whatever research might be done here on adult stem cells is limited. We have no information but it is probably limited. I understand that, at present, the embryos created <i>in vitro</i> are frozen and stored. In some cases the medical practice is to insert them back into the woman outside the womb and she excretes them. That is the practice that operates here. There are issues as to what we do with embryos that remain after IVF treatment. Some countries take the view that, if they can be used to research medicines that help cure the degenerative illnesses referred to earlier, that should happen.

          <p eId="para_713">There is no doubt that scientists are in disagreement on this delicate issue. The nub of the matter is whether embryonic stem cell research or adult stem cell research serves a specific function, leaving aside the ethical issue. A recent publication in the proceedings of the National Academy for Science indicates that there is a strong case to be made for adult stem research and for the merit of that research. I refer back to a Council of Europe document which stated: "This means that ethically disputed research regarded as having high priority objectives should not be given attention while ethically less controversial methods of research are being pursued". Is it not reasonable, sensible and ethical to pursue the other alternatives?</p>

          <p eId="para_717">On the issue of adult stem cells having the capacity to be of greater use, this is the reason precaution is written into the guidelines. The precautionary approach about which Deputy John Bruton spoke is in the guidelines. Embryonic stem cells can only be used where it can be proved to the ethics committee which will oversee the funding in this area that adult stem cells cannot be useful. That is part of the guidelines and the reason they are so important.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">The Commission, as the Deputy knows, initiates proposals within the EU. In this instance the formalised proposal was made in July. It consulted with the member states at technical and official levels in advance of that. I do not have the name of the individual who dealt with the matter on our behalf, but I can give it to the Deputy at a future stage. The Commission has been engaged since July in widespread consultation on the proposals at working group level and with individual Ministers. It has sought suggestions for improvements or changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">The Commission will affect what we do here. I do not think it will change what will happen at EU level, as that is not its intention. The Commission has proposed at EU level that this research should take place in a controlled and regulated environment in which there are safeguards. If this research is to take place, I cannot envisage that it will happen without safeguards, guidelines and regulations. I imagine that most people would prefer research in this area to be conducted on that basis and in a controlled environment.</p>

As parliamentarians, our job is to hold Ministers accountable and I will not apologise to anybody for doing so. Is the Minister aware that the Medical Council guidelines state that human embryo research is unethical? I understand that the guidelines are unlikely to change after the examination of them, which is under way at present, has been completed. The guidelines are the only thing that prevents human embryo research in this country because there is no legislation or Government or Dáil guidelines. Does the Minister agree that there are no scientific guidelines for those who are not doctors? There is a major hiatus in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">Given that she has said that the report of the Commission on Assisted Human Reproduction is finally about to be published, after three years, does the Minister not agree that she should reconsider my suggestion of a Green Paper in this area? I agree that there should be proper debate and consultation on the many issues which need to be addressed in this regard before we rush into making a decision on them. Members of this House, who represent the public, should be allowed to have their say. It is sad that we had no say on this occasion.</p>

It is required to be treated with such dignity under the European Union's draft constitution. The first article of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights relates to respect for human dignity. Does the Minister agree that little dignity is being accorded to human embryos that are being flushed away for the sake of dubious research gains? We should explore the other available sources of stem cells, which can provide the same gains, before we engage in this area.</p>

I am certain that the report will be the subject of widespread debate in the House and throughout the country. This issue is debated in many other places. The period following publication of the report would be an appropriate time for such a discussion. Deputy Gay Mitchell is right to say that the Medical Council has put guidelines in place, but I do not understand why it is relevant that other groups do not have guidelines in place, given that embryos cannot be procured from anyone other than a doctor. I do not know why the Deputy mentioned that other professions have not put in place guidelines in this area.</p>

If such companies conduct research within a particular country, we cannot confine it to being developed elsewhere. It seems that those of us in Ireland cannot regulate this area because it is an international industry. Given that so much of our investment in the biotechnology and information technology areas of scientific research is aimed at biotechnology, does the Minister believe we will have to regulate to an increasing extent to allow for what is happening internationally? Multinationals will be involved in the area of biotechnology.</p>

          <p eId="para_872">(5) It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</p>
          <p eId="para_873">This resolution provides for the amendment of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952 and the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992, as extended by the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licenses) Act 2003, in respect of rates of motor tax and fees for trade licence plates. The resolution will provide for an increase of 5% in the rates of motor taxation for licences taken out with effect from 1 January 2004. The decision to propose an increase in motor tax rates was taken to raise funding for the local government fund and, specifically, to provide extra funding for non-national roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">It is important to underline the fact that motor taxation is different to other taxes. Unlike other taxes, the proceeds from motor tax are not paid directly into the Exchequer. Instead, motor tax is paid directly into the local government fund and is ring-fenced entirely for local government. It cannot be used by the Exchequer for any other purpose. The motor tax paid into the fund is supplemented on an annual basis by a financial contribution from central government. The fund is used predominately to finance non-national roads and the general purpose needs of local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">The general purpose grants paid from the fund are discretionary block grants and may be used by authorities for whatever purpose they consider necessary. In general, they are used to supplement other current income sources such as specific State grants, commercial rates and fees and charges for services. The income from all these sources is incorporated into local authorities' annual budgets to fund a wide range of functions central to the social and economic lives of local communities. These operations include maintenance and development of the non-national road network, management of the planning system, upkeep of social housing, operation and maintenance of public water and sewerage systems, waste management, care of the natural environment, running the fire services and community development.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">The level of funding available to local authorities has increased substantially under the new arrangements introduced by the local government fund. The level of general purpose grant aid to local authorities has, since this Government took office in 1997, increased on average by 85%, representing an average annual increase of some 14% over the past six years. This, in anybody's language, represents a valuable contribution to local government.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">The establishment of the local government fund and its substantial funding by motor tax receipts has created an important link between the amount of tax paid by motorists and the visible and concrete service they get for that tax in terms of better roads. It is anticipated that the proposed 5% increase in motor tax rates will raise some €34 million extra for the fund next year. Clearly, raising taxes is not a popular thing to do, but I believe that this increase is fully justified because the funding raised will be re-invested in our non-national road network.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">The national development plan provided for investment of €2.43 billion in the non-national road network in 2000 to 2006. Of this, €1.08 billion is scheduled for the BMW region and €1.35 billion for the south-east region. The BMW region accounts for 40,500 km or 45% of the network. Given the predominantly rural character of the BMW region, non-national roads play a very important role in its economic and social life and its future prosperity.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">The south-east region accounts for some 50,000 km or 55% of the non-national road network. While considerable economic growth has been achieved throughout the region over the last plan, this has been centred predominantly around the region's four main cities and the larger urban centres. This has led to capacity constraints in these areas while at the same time the more remote rural sub-regions have suffered from the negative effects of peripherality and isolation. Investment in non-national roads in this region from 2000 to 2006 will improve access to such locations, promote them as places in which to live, work or establish enterprises and improve the quality of life for resident communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">The additional €34 million, which is the total estimated yield from the proposed increase in motor tax from 1 January 2004, will be spent on non-national roads in 2004. This local government fund money is in addition to the increased Exchequer funding for next year as set out in the recently published Book of Estimates. Exchequer funding in 2003 for non-national roads is almost €40 million. The Exchequer provision for 2004 is €48.8 million – an increase of around €8.8 million over the 2003 provision. This increase in the Exchequer provision will provide funding towards the increased costs of key strategic non-national road projects which will assist housing, commercial and industrial development. The additional funds being provided in 2004 will enable local authorities to progress work on these critically important schemes situated on the country's regional roads network. It is important to highlight that all of this funding is additional to, and will build on, the record levels of funding already being provided for non-national roads in 2003. I presume colleagues know I am referring to strategic roads in that package as opposed to the €400 million, which is the total non-national roads package.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">The restoration programme accounts for about half of non-national road State grants each year. This programme was introduced in 1995 to restore regional and local roads in county council areas that had become deficient due to underinvestment. Since 1996, more than €1 billion has been allocated to county councils for improvement works under the ten-year restoration programme from 1996 to 2005. The result will be that around 32,000 km of non-national roads will have been improved by the end of this year. In addition, county councils have been allocated almost €320 million for maintenance works under the programme since 1996.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">A pavement condition study carried out in 1996 identified that 47,000 km of the non-national road network were deficient at that time. The success of this Government in the area of non-national roads can be gauged by the fact that by the end of this year around 32,000 km or 68% of the deficient network will have been restored to good condition. This is real progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">I recently announced the award of a contract to RPS-MCOS Limited, for the carrying out of the second ever pavement condition study of non-national roads and a review of pavement management systems. This new study is part of the Government's ongoing commitment to restoring the network of regional and county roads to a satisfactory condition over the ten-year period 1996 to 2005. The results of the study will determine the progress made since 1996 and also the extent of deficiencies remaining in the non-national road network since the last study was carried out. The results will also form an important part in prioritising investment in the non-national road network and ensuring value for money.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">The review of pavement management systems is a first. The consultants are being asked to review existing systems and recommend a single one for use by local authorities on the non-national road network. This is intended to assist local authorities in prioritising schemes for inclusion in the restoration programme. Work on the study and review will commence immediately and is expected to be completed by mid-2004. The highest ever level of State funding for the non-national road network, which will be available in 2004, will allow for continued investment in non-national roads which is necessary for regional development. This achievement will only be made possible by raising extra funding through motor tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_885">This Government is showing its commitment to local government and the non-national roads programme. I want to make it abundantly clear that this level of commitment must be matched at local level. I do not want this extra funding from central government to be used as a substitute for local authorities' own resources contribution. I expect local authorities to maintain their own resources contribution to non-national roads and to increase this next year in line, at least, with inflation. My Department will monitor this element of the programme next year. It is by central and local government working together that we will achieve our goal of a non-national road network that is second to none.</p>
          <p eId="para_886">The new rates of motor tax set out in the financial resolution will apply to tax discs and trade licences taken out for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2004. A general increase of 5% is proposed. The new rates for all vehicles are set out in the printed financial resolution and rather than read them all out and take up the limited time we have available, I will highlight for the House a few details of the proposed changes for private cars and goods vehicles which make up 91% of the national fleet. The annual rate increase for the lowest engine size car under 1000cc is €7, an increase of 13 cent a week; for cars in the 1001cc to 1300cc range, the annual increase is between €11 and €13; and for cars in the 1301cc to 1400cc range, the additional annual increase is €14. Some 60% of the national car fleet is made up of cars under 1400cc. Therefore, the extra costs for most motorists will be between €7 and €14 a year, that is between 13 cent and 27 cent a week.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">For the remaining cars, the increases will range from €15 for cars not exceeding 1500cc up to €64 for cars over 3001cc. Less than half of 1% of cars in the country are in the 3001cc plus category. For goods vehicles the effect of the 5% increase will vary depending on the size, in weight terms, of the vehicle. Some 85% of vehicles in this category are at the lowest level of charge, meaning they will pay an annual increase of €12 or 23 cent per week. A 5% increase is also proposed for trade licences, or trade plates, as they are known. These are the green registration plates used by motor traders on vehicles temporarily in their possession in lieu of taxing such vehicles. The increase for a pair of trade plates will be €13.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">In discussing motor tax, it is important that I update the House on a major e-government project which is currently taking place. A new system which will allow people to tax their cars on-line over the Internet is being piloted in November in three counties – Clare, Galway and north Tipperary. Under this system, people will not have to travel to motor tax offices or to post their documents to the motor tax office. Rather, it will be possible for people to renew their tax at a time and a location that suits them. The on-line facility will be open for business 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 52 weeks a year. I am sure the House will agree that this is a major step forward in using technology to provide a quality service to customers of central and local government. The indications to date are that there is a good level of take-up on the pilot and that the system is sound. All going well, it is hoped that the service will be rolled out nationwide in early 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">In conclusion, I am concerned to ensure the viability and well-being of local government and in particular the non-national road programme. The level of increase in motor tax rates is not penal to individual motorists. However, the combined contribution of the increases on a vehicle fleet of about 1.8 million will provide a reasonable amount of additional funding which will facilitate the continued improvement in our non-national road network. It is for this reason that I am proposing to increase rates of motor tax. This financial resolution will cease on the enactment of the relevant Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licences) Bill, which will be presented to the House at the earliest possible date.</p>

        <speech by="#BernardAllen" eId="spk_586">
          <from>Mr. Allen</from>
          <p eId="para_890">This debate takes place against a backdrop of one of the worst Books of Estimates for several years. It is bad because it cuts back services in almost every area, because it shows that we are no longer a low-tax economy but one with high stealth taxes, and because it is the product of two years of broken promises and six years of economic mismanagement. The proposed increase in excise duty is just one sorry story from this book of woe.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">Let us take the time to go through the Government's long list of punitive increases this year. Development levies of between €6,000 and €30,000 are likely to raise €700 million from house buyers. The drugs payment scheme threshold has been raised by €8 to €78 per month, the third increase in a year. People with chronic illnesses will be priced out of the health market. Accident and emergency charges are going up to €45 from €40. It would be cheaper to buy one's own trolley. There has been a 15% increase in the cost of a private bed in a public hospital and a €5 increase in the cost of an overnight hospital stay to €45, with a cap of ten nights per year. Third level student registration fees have increased by €80 to €750. The fees for junior and leaving certificate exams go up €10 to €82 and €86, respectively. The fee for a standard ten-year passport is increasing from 1 March 2004 by almost a third, from €57 to €75. The cost of a three-year passport for infants aged up to three years is rising from €12 to €15, and a five-year passport for those aged between three and 18 years is going from €12 to €25. The emergency fee for passport applications processed outside office hours is up €37 to €100 for adults. The price of a ten-year passport for senior citizens bucks the trend, having been cut from €57 to €25.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">Motor tax is up by 5%. The Government is determined to make life impossible for motorists. It provides the worst public transport in Europe and one of the worst rail services in the world, thereby forcing people into their cars, which are the most expensive in Europe. It under-invests in roads, and those roads that it improves it digs up shortly afterwards because of the lack of co-ordination between the statutory authorities. It increased motor tax by 12% last year and 5% this year. This is perhaps the only example of joined-up thinking in this Government – it is determined to make life miserable for motorists, and it has achieved its aims.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">On this side of the House we are totally opposed to the increase. It is an insult to hard-pressed taxpayers, who have been hit time and again by stealth taxes on everything from houses to bin collection. The Government inherited a boom, cut taxes, squandered the boom and raised taxes, not on income, on millionaires or on the basis of ability to pay, but on everyone. This increase in excise is a disgrace. No doubt some in the Government will say that it is an environmental measure. It is nothing of the sort. The Government could do a great deal to help the environment, but the bottom line in all this is raising tax revenue. That is the only issue in which it is truly interested.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">The Government says it is necessary to keep the roads programme on track. This relates to what the Minister said about ring-fencing for non-national roads, but the national development plan is seven years late and €9 billion over budget. A 5% increase will do very little. The increase is a simple, straightforward stealth tax – daylight robbery and a handbag snatch. However, Deputies should not take my word for it. They should listen to the Automobile Association, which called the news that motor tax is to increase by 5% deeply disappointing, saying that the notion that such an increase can be blamed on inflation is infuriating to motorists who are already paying an aggregate of €3.8 billion in taxes annually. It said that the Government has a primary duty to see that this money is well spent and that one cannot have a situation where inefficiencies and cost over-runs are tolerated simply because one can always go back once again to the motorist's pocket. As I stated, this measure will yield €29 million per year to the State. With that relatively small measure, it is clear what a mess the Government has got us into.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_587">
          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_895">A 5% increase in motor taxation is not something about which I would normally get excited, were it not for the fact that it is part of a con being perpetrated by the Government. First, it is a con against taxpayers, who are being told repeatedly, particularly by the Minister for Finance, but echoed by other Ministers, that this is a low-tax economy. Yet at every opportunity the Government introduces and increases what are now popularly known as "stealth taxes", of which this is one. Today's increase of 5% in motor taxation is an action by the Government whereby it increases the level of taxation on the people while pretending that it is maintaining a low-tax economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">Second, the increase is a con against the motorist. The Minister has said that the revenue raised will be dedicated to non-national roads. He said the same last year, and we all expected that some time in the early part of the new year we would see announcements made about increases in the grants to local authorities for such roads. The record shows that the money allocated by the Government for non-national roads in 2004 is €6 million less than the Estimates provided for in 2002. That is despite an increase of 12% in motor tax last year and a further increase of 5% for 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">The Government claims that revenue generated by the increase in motor tax is being dedicated to the improvement of non-national roads. The motorist has been told that the extra money to be paid to tax his or her car will ensure better roads on which to drive. The reality, however, is different. The 2002 Book of Estimates provided for over €54 million in grants to road authorities for non-national roads. That was a significant increase on the €39 million outturn for 2001, which was trumpeted by the Government in the run-up to the general election as a major increase in money to improve rural and urban roads. The then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Dempsey, declared it "a record provision". He described non-national roads as "the backbone of rural transport" and went on to say that he was also committed to the improvement of urban roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">Of course, that was before the general election. In every constituency in the country, Fianna Fáil candidates in particular could point to the increased provision in the Estimates when confronted by a constituent concerned about roads. However, like so many other pre-election commitments, the extra money for non-national roads disappeared very quickly after the general election. The amount of money spent in grants for non-national roads in 2002 turned out to be not the €54 million promised but just over €41 million, or 30% less than the sum estimated. This time last year, the Minister increased motor tax by 12% and assured the public that the increase would result in extra money for non-national roads. Presenting the motor tax motion to the Dáil on 12 December 2002, the Minister stated: "I took the decision to increase motor tax rates because it is necessary to protect and develop our non-national roads system, which is the bottom line."  However, the real bottom line is that the amount in the Book of Estimates for 2004, which includes the proposed 5% increase, is €48 million. This is €6 million less than the amount estimated for two years ago, before there was any increase in motor taxation.</p>

          <p eId="para_904">The provision in the Estimates was €39 million last year. As I understand it, the outturn for this year will be about the same and the Estimate for this year is €48 million. The Minister told the House earlier that the extra €34 million would be on top of that. When I asked him the simple mathematical question as to whether that meant it would be €82 million, it suddenly disappeared.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinCullen" eId="spk_594" as="#Minister_for_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_905">We are talking about two completely different things. I have not yet made the non-national roads allocation. That is made when I publish the Estimates for local authorities with the local government fund. The actual spend from that fund on non-national roads is €400 million. If one examines those figures, one will see that last year's increase is correct, as I said it was, and when one looks at the local authority estimates for non-national roads when they are published in the next few weeks, one will see the figure is more than last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_906">The ring-fenced figure in the Book of Estimates is the listed number of strategic roads, which has nothing to do with the 5% increase – that was an Exchequer-funded increase which we managed to get for the strategic roads, as opposed to the whole non-national roads programme which is running at €394 million. The full 5% will be in that figure, as distributed to the local authorities.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EamonGilmore" eId="spk_595">
          <from>Mr. Gilmore</from>
          <p eId="para_907">That so-called explanation does not in any way negate the point I am making, which is that the €54 million provided for in the 2002 Estimates was never allocated or spent. Some €39 million was actually spent. The figure of €54 million was put into the 2002 Estimates for the purposes of providing political comfort in constituencies where money for non-national roads was likely to be an issue in the general election. Precisely the same strategy is being teed up for the coming year.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">The Minister commissioned a pavement study, about which we have been hearing for two years, and we are now told the report will be produced by mid-2004. In mid-2004, the study will be published in advance of the local elections in order that every Government candidate who comes across a disgruntled constituent concerned about the state of the roads will be told the study has been completed. I predict there will be another grandiose press conference announcement by the Minister pledging additional money and resources for non-national roads to underpin the notion. This happened in 2002 with the €54 million which never became a reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">The other area to which the revenue from motor taxation is to be applied is the local government fund, which is used for the general purposes of local authorities. In last year's Estimates, the amount to be provided to local authorities under the local government fund was reduced. One would have expected that there might at least be a minimal increase in the amount being allocated this year but this has not happened. The figure for this year is €423 million and last year it was €421 million. That is not a real increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">The significance of that, aside from their increased responsibilities, is that local authorities are now facing into annual estimates in the coming months and will have to find the money for benchmarking from their own resources. The Minister told the House some time ago that the total cost of benchmarking to local authorities for next year would be €140 million. No provision has been made for that in the Book of Estimates. Therefore, following the publication of the Book of Estimates and what the Minister has had to say, it is inevitable that local authorities will have to raise that money, either by increasing commercial rates or charges for services to the public.</p>

          <p eId="para_913">Sinn Féin has time and again criticised the Government's habit of addressing revenue shortfalls through stealth taxes rather than through the general taxation system. The Government has shown a marked preference for stealth taxes which take no account of ability to pay and increasingly penalise those on lower incomes. Instead of taxing the wealthy, the Government taxes lower earners increasingly by stealth.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">Sinn Féin strongly supports the concept of public transport and believes that proper funding must be a Government priority. We support measures which are designed to reduce private car usage, which is damaging to the environment and can cause huge traffic problems, particularly in the Dublin area. However, we are realistic enough to see that because the State has a severe deficiency of public transport, people are unwilling or unable to make the behavioural change to public transport. We have not yet reached the stage where the alternative of public transport is available widely enough to allow motorists to use it in place of private transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">This problem is particularly acute in rural areas where public transport is practically non-existent. If a safe, reliable and reasonably-priced system of public transport was available, commuters would use it. However, that system does not exist and it looks increasingly less likely that the Government, with its policies of privatisation, will take the necessary measures to support this type of public transport. I have a problem with the proposed increase. Motorists, particularly the young, are crippled by high insurance and tax. The Government has done nothing to address this. We are constantly told the market will solve these problems but while we wait for that to happen, the price of insurance and tax continues to rise.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">The hard-pressed motorists do not want more rising costs, hand-wringing, empty promises or excuses – they want action. However, the Government is reluctant to tackle the cosy cartel in the insurance industry. What we see instead is rising costs, like this motor taxation proposal which penalises the hard-pressed motorist who is without alternatives. I intend to vote against this proposal.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_917">The Green Party will also vote against this proposal. However, this is because we believe we should adjust the tax system to take into account the true costs of motoring which are huge. While motorists may feel they are paying more than their fair share of tax for their driving, the cost to our society in terms of accidents, environmental costs and the delays caused by excessive traffic mean we need to begin to reduce those costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">Taxing driving is one way of encouraging better behaviour, but the way in which the Government proposes to do this is the wrong way. It is not as sophisticated as is possible. We need to move away from flat vehicle tax duties towards a more sophisticated system, through which we can target tax according to the weight and types of vehicles which people use. We also need to move towards a system whereby the more people drive, the more they pay. There is a variety of credible new measures, using satellite and other technology, which apply sophisticated taxes on car use. In this manner, one need not necessarily penalise people who need a car, such as those who live in remote rural locations. Instead, we can apply a tax to people who are using valuable road space which in turn has a high economic or environmental cost depending on the type of vehicle which is being used.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">With this measure, the Government proposes to introduce another stealth tax increase which is regressive because people of all incomes pay the same. This small measure, 5% on the existing tax, is part of a range of similar tax increases the Government has introduced. We do not believe it is the sophisticated response that is necessary. While it is primarily seen as a revenue-raising exercise, we would like it to be far more.</p>

        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_600">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_920">In the recently announced Estimates, the people have been hit with the full raft of totally disproportionate and unfair stealth taxes. Not least among these is a 5% increase in motor taxation, which the already punch drunk motorist has had to absorb. According to the motoring organisation the AA, in statistics announced last April, the long-suffering motorist who purchases a typical family car at €21,500 will have to pay €22,000 over ten years of driving. This includes VRT of €4,300 and VAT of €3,000, or 33% of the price of the car. Based on an annual mileage of 12,000, total road tax for this individual will amount to €3,490 and estimated petrol taxes for him or her will be approximately €10,000. There is then the ten year insurance levy of €140 and VAT on car servicing at €480. When added together, these bring the motorist's total tax contribution to €22,000. Added to the depreciation of the vehicle, it means that a car is a very expensive luxury.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">The figures to which I refer are conservative. Nevertheless, the already fleeced motorist is ripe for further plucking in the eyes of the Minister for Finance. This comes on top of the 12% rise in motor tax at the same time last year and a 7% increase in VRT on vehicles over 1900 cc.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">Some years ago, the heads of Europe's largest motoring organisations came together in Brussels to launch a new motorists' charter. The message was that the unfortunate motorists had had enough and that there should be a moratorium on new motoring and road tax increases. They might as well have remained idle if the actions of the Government since then are any guide. As taxes keep increasing, there has long been a breakdown of trust between motorists and the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">Europe's motorists pay in excess of €300 billion in taxes every year, but only one quarter of this is re-invested in transport and mobility. As bad as matters are internationally, the Government's record is much worse. Last year, it collected in excess of €3.8 billion in taxes for motorists and spent approximately €750 million, or a mere 18% of the total motor tax take, on roads and transportation.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">The motorists' charter demanded a fair deal in other areas. It demanded fair taxes, fair investment, spending transport taxes on transport improvements, an investment in improvement in roads, driver safety and vehicle design, green incentives and the purchase of cleaner, safer cars through tax incentives. On the subject of green incentives, the Minister for Finance recently confirmed the introduction of a carbon tax by this time next year. This is despite vigorous opposition to the idea of such a tax from the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney. The latter is in character with the Janus-like approach of the Government, which manages to look both ways at the same time while politicians sit on the fence with their ears to the ground listening to the grass roots. If they listen hard enough to the grass roots, they would discover that people in rural areas depend on cars to a large extent because of a lack of public transport. They will be penalised further by the imposition of a carbon tax levied on petrol they are compelled to use. The fuel allowance of low income families will be further eroded by the levying of such a tax, which will also adversely affect the farming sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">The car can no longer be regarded by the Minister for Finance as a luxury, but rather as an essential to economic empowerment, social inclusion and quality of life. People in rural areas have no option but to use cars because they do not have access to public transport or a Luas light rail system. This tax is being pushed on us and we have no choice in the matter.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnCurranFF" eId="spk_601">
          <from>Mr. Curran</from>
          <p eId="para_926">The main purpose of the resolution is to increase motor tax rates broadly by approximately 5%. It is never easy to discuss an increase. However, it must be viewed in the overall context of where the money goes and the real cost to the motorist. When one considers the figures and what is delivered, an increase of 5% is modest. It has been referred to as a stealth tax, a suggestion with which I do not agree. Motor taxation has been with us for many years and it is part of drivers' annual costs; they appreciate it and know they are going to have to pay it. I do not believe that the level of increase is excessive.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">The rate of tax we pay affords drivers the opportunity to drive and live within a given budget. It is not a flat rate per car, it is a rate based on the size of the car's engine and there are cost implications in that regard. It is worth considering the actual costs. In many cases, the increase of 5% will, depending on the size of the car, be €10 or €12 per annum and less if the car is small. It must be borne in mind that a sizeable proportion of the cars involved are less than 1400 cc or 1500 cc. I suggest that for private cars with engines of two litres and over, we should consider an upward sliding scale in terms of the rate of increase because there appears to be a substantial number of luxury cars on our roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">We must consider the impact of this increase in motor taxation on business. I gave some consideration to this matter before coming into the House and I understand that for most business delivery vans and vehicles, the annual increase will be approximately €12 per annum. When one considers it in an overall context, including the question of competitiveness, I do not believe that the increase of 5% is excessive. The annual increase per individual motorist per annum, be it €7, €10, or €12, is anything but excessive.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">This 5% increase will yield to the Exchequer approximately €34 million which will be invested in the local government fund. Motorists are constantly making demands for upgraded, improved and safer motoring facilities. In the greater Dublin area, where non-national roads are not the issue, there has been a substantial investment in road infrastructure. In the part of the city in which I live, which has grown rapidly in recent years, road improvements have tried to keep pace with the increasing number of cars and have included the M50 toll bridge, the slip-roads on and off the M50, the flyover out of Clondalkin into the new Luas light rail depot and the widening of the Naas dual carriageway from Rathcoole to be continued further south. There is a continuous programme to provide the facilities motorists are demanding.</p>
          <p eId="para_930">I support the resolution. I disagree with previous speakers who referred to the increase of 5% as a stealth tax. This is a modest and fair increase and I do not believe it will affect competitiveness in the area of business.</p>

          <p eId="para_931">The Minister referred to motor tax rates and the previous speaker stated that the motor taxation system has been in place for a long time. I am old enough to recall when motor tax was done away with. I refer to 1974, when people were asked to pay a car registration fee of £5. This amount was subsequently increased on many occasions and we have now returned to a system of motor taxation.</p>
          <p eId="para_932">It is lovely to hear Members say that a 5% increase does not matter and it does not count. The Minister even broke the increase down to euro per day, which sounds great. The Ceann Comhairle and I are from the same constituency and businesses there must compete against those of our friends across the Border. Another 40 jobs were lost in Kingscourt and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment did little about that. She stated on television on Sunday night that she was thinking of changing portfolios, and that would not be bad, given our experience in the Border region.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_934">We must compete against our counterparts in Northern Ireland. I checked the current motor tax with my local tax office earlier and the tax on a 2.5 litre car is €782, the tax on a 2 litre is €513 while the tax on a 1.6 litre is €372. It does not matter what size one's car is in Northern Ireland because motor tax is charged at a flat rate of £160 or approximately €230 per year. Insurance costs are also much higher in the Republic than in the North, particularly for young motorists. In addition, VRT must be paid here. We must be able to compete and my constituents have a difficulty in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">It is more difficult in rural areas. The Minister of State is from Donegal and those who travel between Donegal and Dublin on a regular basis will use a larger car than a Mini Minor. There is no rail service to Counties Donegal, Cavan and Monaghan and, therefore, no alternative means of transport for passengers and freight. Naturally, people from these counties use larger cars, particularly those working in the agriculture industry who need such cars to tow trailers and so on. This is yet another tax on top of many others and it is a major issue. It creates a non-competitive environment for those who live in the Border area. It would be grand if, as the Minister stated, we got everything back in the form of good roads but the reality is different.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">The current ten year programme commenced in 1995 and it is good that the Minister gave the rainbow Government the credit for it. However, a few years ago County Monaghan did well in terms of the number of miles of road dealt with under the available budget. Budgets have been increased but costs have also increased at a greater rate. A lower number of miles of road is being dealt with compared with the past. Motor tax is a charge that will, in addition to development levies and so on, make it much more difficult for those living in rural areas. The Government has not financed local authorities in terms of the work they need to do or benchmarking, and that is an indication of failure.</p>

          <p eId="para_937">I will leave it to my colleague, Deputy Grealish, to defend the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I support the motion. The Minister stated that the establishment of the local government fund and its substantial funding through motor tax receipts has created an important link between the tax paid by motorists and the visible and concrete service they get in return in terms of better roads. It is anticipated that the proposed 5% increase in motor tax rates will raise €34 million extra for the fund. It is not popular to raise taxes but the increase is fully justified because the funding generated will be invested in our non-national road network.</p>
          <p eId="para_938">We are all entitled to make political points and many colleagues have referred to their constituencies. Deputy Crawford referred to the roads in Counties Cavan and Monaghan and I will refer to Tallaght in Dublin South-West.</p>

Part of my role and that of my colleagues is to continue to stress to Government the needs of our constituencies. Tallaght has come on enormously over the past 14 years and there has been direct investment in road infrastructure. My colleague, Deputy Curran, listed a number of developments, including the M50, which pass through both Clondalkin and Tallaght. The road infrastructure has improved enormously. I am not from Tallaght, although I have been living there for the past 33 years and I know a little about what it was like when I arrived there.</p>

When I moved to Tallaght, there was a lack of infrastructure and facilities but this has been addressed and Tallaght is a great place. While the road infrastructure has improved enormously, there are still gaps. For example, the Tallaght bypass, which is a superb road, requires further investment and it needs to be extended to Brittas and Wicklow.</p>

          <p eId="para_944">It is not in Dublin South-West. However, if we debate the works at the roundabout sometime, the Deputy will discover that our views are compatible. I have to sit in traffic at the roundabout as often as anyone else and I have strong views about what should be done. I refer to positive developments in Tallaght. The Tallaght bypass needs to be extended so that the nice people of Wicklow can get to Tallaght much more quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">I served on Dublin County Council, together with Deputies Burton and Gilmore, from 1991 onwards and until recently I was a member of South Dublin County Council. I often raised the need for investment in minor roads. For example, a minor road outside Saggart in my constituency has been closed. The local authority should be able to seek funding to do the necessary work on that road.</p>
          <p eId="para_946">The Minister referred to pavement repairs. I actively promoted the repair not only of roads but also footpaths when I served on South Dublin County Council. I am glad that over recent years, through prudent budget management by the controlling group, such work has been done. This work is important. We all have different views and I am happy to entertain the views of others. The financial resolution is reasonable and it is important that the money should be used properly and allocated to local authorities to get the necessary work done because that is what our communities want.</p>

          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_947">The vote later will be the first instalment in a series on budget 2004. Given what the Government did this year, it is appropriate that next year's budget proposals are marked by yet another increase in direct taxation. This increase in motor tax is a stealth tax for many members of the public.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">The Government likes to focus, as its great achievement, on dropping direct income tax rates, particularly the reduction in the higher rate to 42%. However, it does not tell the electorate about the continuous stream of increases introduced last year, the previous year and this year, of which this is the first to be voted on. This increased charge for this year is not alone. There is provision for increases in registration fees, hospital charges and the contribution which must be paid before one can get a drugs refund. A series of stealth charges are already provided for at a time when the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, continue to suggest that this is a low tax Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">It is certainly a low tax rate Government in terms of the headline rates of income tax. However, when those who people the back pages of the Minister for Finance's budget illustrations, such as Duncan and Mary, add up the additional charges imposed by the Government this year and what they will be charged next year, the burden on them, including taxation and charges, is considerably increased. While we will not know the content of the budget until next Wednesday, the biggest stealth tax of all was the failure by the Minister to increase tax credits and allowances.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">When considering this increase in motor taxation, it should be borne in mind that we have a very dispersed style of development in this country, a situation which many Members from the Fianna Fáil benches are at pains to praise. However, the consequence of such dispersal across the country, but particularly in Leinster, which is undergoing the greatest development, is that many families must have not just one, but two cars. Those are also the families paying mortgages as well as trying to pay the equivalent of another mortgage in respect of child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_951">Where people live in such a dispersed pattern, there is little or no public transport. For many people in city suburban areas, including my constituency, public transport is also extremely limited. A recent survey showed that it takes 40 minutes to travel to the city centre by train from parts of Dublin West, while the equivalent car journey takes only about 35 minutes on a good day. Under the patterns of development which have been set up, families which need to have two cars will pay the cost inflicted by the Government in the form of these extra charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">With regard to the pavement survey to which Deputy O'Connor referred in the context of better local government and public service reform, we now have highly paid officials at the top echelons of Departments and local authorities. Why do we need yet another costly consultancy exercise in connection with a matter such as pavements? This is where taxpayers' money is going. The top level officials to whom we are paying large salaries should be capable of producing this work, rather than out-sourcing it to expensive consultants and having an expensive launch, complete with photo opportunities, for Ministers. It is a waste of taxpayers' money. This is where the real debate about benchmarking should take place. It is easily done.</p>

          <p eId="para_953">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important matter. On the facts of the situation, an extra 25 cent a week is not a heavy demand to place on motorists in this country. That is what the average motorist will have to pay in January when the motor tax rate is raised. Some 60% of the national car fleet consists of 1.4 litre engines or less and, on that basis, the extra cost will be between 13 and 27 cent per week. For motorists with 3 litre cars, the increase will represent approximately an extra €1 a week, which I do not believe they will begrudge.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">The problem with Opposition Deputies is that they have fallen into the habit of opposing everything. Every increase in charges or levies is met with a wringing of hands and indignant howls of protest. They want better roads and better public transport, but without any sensible or sane proposals as to who is to foot the bill. They constantly shout about increases, but how would they propose to run the country if they were in Government?</p>

          <p eId="para_957">In this country, we have the most ambitious road programme anywhere in Europe, but this does not come free of cost. The Government cannot realistically be expected to wave a magic wand and produce the money from thin air. Some form of levy must be imposed. Those who use our roads must contribute, as they do, through motor taxation. The increase in motor tax from January is expected to raise an extra €34 million. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has made a commitment that every cent raised will be ploughed back into non-national roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_958">Motor taxation is paid directly into the local government fund, which is ring-fenced for the specific purpose of local government and cannot be used for other purposes. That is welcome. It is a fair system whereby those who use the roads on a daily basis are asked to contribute to their maintenance. We cannot overhaul, improve and extend our network of non-national roads without this increase. I recall the pothole election candidates who were a significant feature ten, 15 or 20 years ago. As a Deputy representing a largely rural constituency, Galway West, I can appreciate, at first hand, the huge investment that has been made in recent years in our road network and the benefits this is having.</p>
          <p eId="para_959">Only a few short years ago, one could scarcely drive from Galway to Clifden without being at risk of disappearing down a pothole. Roads were poorly maintained and badly in need of repair, resurfacing, extending and improvement. In some instances, they endangered driver safety and accidents and fatalities occurred. That is becoming a thing of the past. This year alone, €434 million will be spent on non-national roads. That translates to €4,346 for every kilometre of non-national road in the country. That type of improvement and investment must come with a price. I believe a 5% increase in motor tax is justifiable.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">Following publication of the Estimates, I met with a number of constituents to discuss the issues and gauge their reaction. There were no howls of protest at the motor tax increase. There was no outcry or attacks on the Government. That behaviour seems confined solely within this House.</p>

They recognise that one cannot continue to call for better services and greater facilities, but then keep one's hand behind one's back when it comes to payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">The average motorist, when asked about costs, will point first to insurance premiums. I am glad that cost is now being tackled. I compliment the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Transport on their work to bring down insurance costs. A range of measures, including the penalty points system, is starting to pay dividends and insurance companies are starting to lower their premiums, some by as much as 15%.</p>
          <p eId="para_964">Insurance is the real cost for motorists, not motor tax. Those Deputies who oppose the 5% increase in motor tax now will be first into this House in the new year, putting down questions as to when a road in their constituency will be maintained or improved. I, too, want to see the roads in my constituency maintained and improved but at least I had the courage today to put my hand up and acknowledge that the money must come from somewhere and motorists must pay a share.</p>

          <p eId="para_969">What is new in terms of the Progressive Democrats' position on further taxing those who can least afford it? There should be no increases in this regard. Respect should be at least given to a Deputy to make his or her contribution without interruption. We do not have the luxury of having five minutes to speak. There should be no increases, irrespective of how great or small, in motor tax. The reality is that motorists are already being fleeced at every turn. We have value added tax on cars, vehicle registration tax, excise duties on petrol and diesel and the ever spiralling cost of car insurance. Motorists are again being used as an easy target to secure further revenue by the Exchequer. That is completely unacceptable. This is another form of stealth taxes, make no mistake about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_970">Pledges were made by the Government and earlier speakers in terms of road improvement investment, but there has been a kinked investment record by the Government <i>vis-à-vis</i>road improvements over the past six years. The Border, midland and western region has not seen investment equal to that in the east and south of this island. That is a fact. Motorists in the Border, midland and western region are being continually penalised, yet they are being asked to contribute exactly the same as those in other regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_971">I refer to young drivers in particular. Young people are in despair in many of these counties, not least in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan. They are in despair because they are clearly in a situation where they have the least access and opportunity to take up third level education. They are invariably dependent on private car access to employment because I repeat we have no public transport system in these counties. That is the reality. That dependence of people of all ages, particularly young people, to access employment through the use of private car opportunities means that this is a further tax on work. That is what this tax boils down to. It is completely unacceptable. It takes no account of ability to pay. There is a bounden duty on Government to decide not to press ahead with this proposition. I oppose the motion and will vote accordingly.</p>

        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_624">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_972">The spurious use of the establishment of a local government fund as a means of better funding local authorities to justify the raising of this motor tax must be opposed. On several grounds the local government fund is to be increased only by revenue generated by this measure. The Government has chosen not to directly fund local government by any other means in the Estimates. This is the one method by which local authorities are being asked to meet their ever increasing costs, especially in terms of benchmarking payments. In view of this, this increase will be accompanied by large increases in commercial rates and in service charges in local authority areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_973">The local government fund is spurious in a number of respects. It does not take account of the number of motor vehicles in each area, whether there is greater car usage as between urban and rural areas in a local authority area, or the extent to which public transport is available in some areas and non-existent in others.</p>
          <p eId="para_974">Motor tax must be questioned in terms of its efficiency. The cost of the motor car must be properly accounted for. However, this is a regressive tax in that a widow who makes one or two journeys a week is taxed in the same way as a person who chooses to use his or her car on a regular basis day in day out for several hours a day. If the Government was serious in targeting motor taxation as an environmental tax, it would consider how we could raise such tax revenue on a usage basis. In that context, rural communities would have to be considered differently because, as speakers pointed out, there is no public transport infrastructure in place in such communities.</p>

The fact that we have a tax that only raises revenue on the basis of whether one has a car is not an environmental tax. Given the damage commercial vehicles cause to the fabric of our road network by their weight and size, their owners do not pay proportionately more motor tax. If the Minister was serious about having an equitable car tax, he would not put in place this measure.</p>

          <p eId="para_980">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for this opportunity to speak. People in the west experience great difficulty in regard to the condition of the roads there. The carve up of the BMW region for funding has always been disproportionate. The area that suffers the most is the west because it does not have the necessary infrastructure to allow it to attract the type of industry required to ensure that the people can stay there. Half of graduates from the west have to go to Dublin to get their first job.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">There was an increase in motor tax in the previous budget and a further increase is now proposed. Such a tax is disproportionate in that people in rural areas, in particular, depend on their cars, which are a necessity. If a tax is constantly increasing it is not equitable. The position is different in Dublin or other cities where public transport is available but a similar facility is not available to people in the countryside. Therefore, this tax is inequitable. I appreciate it is ring-fenced and the revenue accruing from it will go towards the maintenance of secondary roads which is important. However, if people from the west thought that such revenue would be used for road improvement works in the west, they would have more confidence in this measure. Given that there has seen such neglect of the west over the years, I hope that this position will improve.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">There have been many price increases. While we do not have a high income tax rate, indirect taxation has given the lie to the fact that this is supposed to be a low tax economy. Overall, we pay many taxes and people are finding it increasingly difficult to manage. I have a problem with this increase.</p>

          <p eId="para_985">I have two questions for the Minister. The first relates to what is grandiosely entitled the pavement condition study which is to be carried out. A pavement condition study basically involves finding out what roads need to be repaired or resurfaced. The Ceann Comhairle or I could do that. We could go around and check where a road needs to be resurfaced.</p>
          <p eId="para_986">Given that engineering staff are attached to every local authority and they ought to be able to recognise a pothole or a damaged road, why is it necessary to engage consultants to carry out this study? What will the consultants be paid for this work? What skills will consultants bring to this task that the average county engineer could not?</p>
          <p eId="para_987">At a press conference held by the Minister following the publication of the Estimates on 13 November, he told the assembled press that €38 million was being provided in the Estimates for the local government fund towards the cost of benchmarking in local authorities. I have searched the Estimates but I cannot see sight of that €38 million provision. Will the Minister identify in the Estimates from where that €38 million comes and if any of it will come from revenue raised by motor taxation?</p>

          <p eId="para_988">On the question of the pavement study, we want to know the current position. While the consultants engaged will talk to the local authority officials, I decided not to directly approach each local authority because I wanted the study to be as objective as possible.

          <p eId="para_990">We have made much progress over recent years and I want to continue to ensure that we are getting such results. The indications are positive and I want to see more maximum results and a more uniformed and targeted approach, depending on the various parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">The cost of the study, Deputy Gilmore, came to over €730,000. In the context of the overall amount of money that we are spending on the road network, it is good value for money. If the Deputy checks last year's figure for the total local government fund in the Book of Estimates, he will see an increase of €38 million. That does not include the 5% motor tax increase that comes to €34 million. Overall, there is an increase on last year's fund of €72 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">There is some confusion between two different aspects of the road fund. To clarify, there is a specific EU co-financed fund for non-national, strategic roads, identified for housing needs. That is the figure of €40 million from last year which I increased to €48.8 million this year. The total amount on roads last year in the local government fund was €394 million. This year, with the €34 million increase, it will stand at €428 million.</p>

This could have been part of the conditions for benchmarking for local authorities. The Minister introduced a tax for the disposal of cars to comply with the EU end-of-life vehicle directive. Why is there a hold-up in the implementation of this directive? The tax was imposed on the motorist through the price of a car, yet the directive has never been implemented.</p>

          <p eId="para_996">On the Deputy's point on the pavement study, the last one was commissioned for the first time by the rainbow Government. It was a valuable contribution to the non-national road network. I commended it at the time and it is still a valuable instrument. I hope we will be able to build on that good work done by the then Minister. Deputy Allen was then Minister of State at the Department and I understand he had direct responsibility when the report was commissioned. I am only emulating some of the good things that were done when they were in government.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">There is no tax imposed on the disposal of end-of-life vehicles. The Deputy is correct that there has been no finality on this issue. However, I am trying to bring many different groups together and to be fair to all concerned. This is difficult as people see this issue in different ways. The directive is also being implemented in different ways in different countries with differing interpretations. The bottom line is that the directive comes into force in a few years' time, one way or the other. I want to introduce a compulsory stage and we have made much progress on its implementation. We are at the end game and I hope we will get agreement on it soon.</p>

          <p eId="para_1015">– raised VAT on house purchases;</p>

          <p eId="para_1019">The Taoiseach, who has been in office for six and a half years, has led by compromise on virtually every issue at the expense of the electorate. Dealing with all the vested interests was possible when money was available to buy peace but now that reduced spending is the order of the day, Departments and vested interests are no longer getting that to which they became accustomed. There is trouble in paradise. Because the Taoiseach had such a loose rein on what went on, myriad problems exist. This manifests itself in 15 options on issues in the Cabinet rather than any single leadership voice unifying the Government's vision and direction. The lack of co-operation and co-ordination among Cabinet colleagues is reflected in the lack of interdepartmental co-operation on the national spatial strategy, an integrated national poverty strategy, an integrated transport policy and an incomplete picture of the socio-economic reasons for crime, leading to little action to prevent it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">It is a tale of two worlds, one where the Government had a great deal of money from an economic boom and no accountability worries and a second world where there is near stagnation in the economy and in which the Government is aware of the resources it will get. In the latter scenario, any money spent must show a value greater than the alternative uses for the money – or it should. Clearly the Government is not choosing wisely. There is no coherent approach to the major challenges facing Ireland today. There has been almost total failure on the part of Government to implement any coherent approach to the national spatial strategy. Initiatives to ease congestion in Dublin and to rejuvenate depopulated regional towns and areas are non-existent. The promise of decentralising 10,000 civil servants has been a distraction to keep desperate communities from demanding a response from Government. There has been a distinct lack of cohesion in targeting transportation congestion, particularly in Dublin. Individual modes of travel, be they cars, trains or buses have received little of what they want. No overall vision to reduce the wastage caused by traffic jams has been produced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">Money was thrown at the health service as if that alone could make decisions and get value for money. No vision existed to ensure that taxpayers' money was spent wisely. The same is true of local government reform, competitiveness in industry and the housing problem. Departments do things in different ways and, as a result, there is no effective strategy to address the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">In the time available to me, there are many things I could say, but I want to deal with the following issues: the Government's complete inability to meet the housing needs of the young population; the scandalous lengthening of waiting lists for local authority housing which has increased to 52,000 households from 39,000 before the Government took office; the starvation of local authorities which, for the second year in a row, have not been granted an increase in funding. The motion which my party has put before the House is an amalgam of all these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">From next March, every new home buyer will be faced with the result of the broken promises and the economic mismanagement of this shameful Government. They will be faced with handing over thousands of euro in one of the biggest stealth tax swindles in years, namely development levies. The levies were provided for in the Planning and Development Act 2000. They were designed to allow for flexibility in the type of infrastructure that could be funded under the development contribution scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">My party did not oppose this provision when the legislation came before the Oireachtas. We accepted that this country had a First World economy with a Third World infrastructure and something needed to be done. We did not know that the levies would not be used to fund infrastructural development but rather to make up for the shortfall in Government funding for infrastructure. The Government, in all its mealy-mouthed arrogance, has hijacked the scheme to cover up the complete and utter mess it has made of the public finances. The House must make clear its revulsion at this arrogance. The Government has stripped back funding of vital infrastructure and is forcing councils to do its dirty work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">The national development plan is €9 billion over budget and seven years late. The Government has failed to allocate the cash originally committed to the NDP. Let us also be clear in regard to another issue. The incredibly high level of development levies that will be forced on home buyers and businesses was not envisaged when the legislation was being enacted. No Minister stood up to say that a 200m² house might have a development levy of €28,000 slapped on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">At that time we did not realise quite how bad was the economic situation facing the country. Neither did the voters. We did not realise that, in order to win the election, the Government would mislead the people, spend its way out of trouble and then, with 88 seats in the bag, cut back on services and increase charges. The development levies are the next target.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">I will lay before the House the details of the abject failure of this Government to do anything right in the housing area. Before the Government blinds us with meaningless statistics from the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, let me put the real picture on record. Because of the Government's failure to provide adequately for increasing housing demands, the average price of a new house is €222,000. According to Government figures, the average price of a second-hand house is €267,000. In Dublin, the price of a second-hand house is €367,000. The ESRI puts house price increases at between 15% and 16% in the past year alone. Since the Government came to power, the price of a home has tripled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">Over 100,000 individuals are waiting for a local authority house. Due to the high cost of housing, more than 42,000 people aged over 30 still live with their parents. Some 1,000 students live in hostels. A total of 5,581 people are homeless, which is the greatest shame of all. The Government has responded dismally over the years to this crisis. However, in the past few weeks its response has been disgraceful. According to Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, the answer to the housing monster that we are faced with is to make housing more expensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">Next year, new home buyers will face a triple whammy from the Government which will cost them up to €600 million. Last year, we saw the removal of the first-time buyer's grant. With a stroke of his pen, the Minister for Finance robbed thousands of young people of the vital few thousand euro which could offset the crippling cost of buying a house. Fine Gael collected tens of thousands of signatures calling for the grant's restoration, but the Government ignored them. In 2002, the Government single-handedly added 1% to the price of a house when it increased the rate of VAT. From March 2004, new house buyers will be faced with development levies of between €6,000 and €30,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">The high rate of development levies is not, on its own, the major problem. As local authorities up and down the country calculate the levy they must charge, we face a ticking time bomb whereby councils with a sustained high level of development will be able to charge less than those with a smaller pool of developers from which to draw an income. In other words, richer local authorities will be able to out-price less wealthy councils, and business and investment will be drawn to areas in which development levies are lower.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">A picture of the huge variations in development levies which will result in uneven infrastructural development is already emerging. For a new house in County Cork, levies could mean a €4,800 charge and in south Tipperary a €12,200 charge. In Wicklow, a 200 square metre house could incur a €20,000 levy. South Dublin County Council is proposing a €10,000 levy per two bedroom unit while the local authority in Galway city will charge €10,000 for every new unit of accommodation built. In Carlow, commercial development will be levied at €49 per square metre. Carlow Town Council is preparing to charge residential units €2,200 for sanitary services, €2,000 for roads and in excess of €2,100 for recreational facilities. Dublin City Council will raise development contributions from €30 to €100.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">How can the Government talk about national development plans and spatial strategies when everything it does, from the Hanly report to development charges, flies in the face of the effort to spread the benefits of the economic boom it inherited? The sum collected in development contributions is likely to be much higher next year than the €122 million collected in 2001. IBEC has said that contributions to Fingal County Council will rise by €37 million while Cork County Council's total will rise by €13 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">It might be appropriate to quote the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment at this point. In her speech to IBEC on Thursday, 25 March 1999 she stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">You do not have to be a professor of civil engineering to realise that Ireland has a major infrastructural deficit. That deficit stems from many factors; lack of resources for investment, the slowness of the planning process, a failure to recognise the need for large-scale expenditure. I believe that the private sector must be given a much greater role in this area than ever before.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">How can the Minister claim she wants greater private investment in infrastructure when the Government is proposing to slap businesses with a massive levy which will discourage them from making such investments? South Dublin County Council proposes a €75 levy on every square metre of commercial, industrial and retail development. When the Minister spoke of competitiveness previously, many in industry may have allowed themselves a wry smile. Now, they probably cry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">The Chambers of Commerce of Ireland has said the Government's total failure to properly fund local government has created a massive €220 million additional cost to its members. Mr. John Dunne, chief executive of Chambers of Commerce of Ireland said in October that the Government had given local authorities no alternative but to find money through a combination of cutting services and hiking up charges to businesses. He called for a cap in business rates. He said that while his organisation did not favour a cap, the irresponsible attitude of the Government meant absolute boundaries had to be established.</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">The Government has lost the faith of the people. It has lost the faith of business and it long ago lost the faith of home buyers. In sections 48 and 49 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 we were sold a pup. No one could possibly have imagined that the levies could go so high. Nobody could have thought the Government would be so unscrupulous as to scale back local authority funding to such a degree simply to cover up its pathetic economic mismanagement. The development levies represent another nail in the coffin of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. They have conned the electorate too many times. Since taking office six and a half years ago, the Government has claimed it has made Ireland a low tax economy. However, it has become a specialist in introducing stealth taxes in the form of local council levies. These taxes are having a major effect on the competitiveness of business. In the past three years, 10,000 IDA Ireland created jobs have vanished. The increases in stealth taxes will raise costs even more and cause further job losses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">All new commercial developments will be hit by development levies. They will make businesses less competitive, damage people's purchasing power and further damage our economic well-being. While advocating local government reform, the Government has undermined local authorities by putting them in the front line in the raising of new taxes which hit businesses and young people, especially those attempting to purchase a house for the first time. The Government has broken every promise it made before the last election. These latest proposals are a bridge too far.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_649">
          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_1039">I will first deal with a little theory before I discuss the substance of the motion. Private property is the most important institution of social and political integration. Ownership of property creates commitment to the political and legal order and the most important property one can own is a house. Historical evidence indicates that societies with a wide distribution of property ownership, notably in residential housing and land, are more stable and more resistant to upheavals and change. In his book on the Russian revolution, Richard Pipes writes that the French peasant who was a source of instability in the 18th century became a pillar of society in the 19th century as a result of the French revolution. When people are confident that their lands and businesses are legally theirs, their respect for other people's property increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">In Ireland, even more than in other European countries, home ownership and property rights are emotive issues. We are familiar with Davitt's three f's and our Constitution recognises property rights. The economic fibre of society is based on those rights. The absence of such certainty in many non-European and non-American countries has been the main cause of poverty. In many cases, assets are held without title, and capital cannot be drawn from them. The greatest form of investment in the United States of America is through the remortgaging of property. While this concept of wealth creation is something of which we are almost unaware, it is not unusual for us to use things without understanding how they work. Magnetic compasses were used before a satisfactory theory of magnetism was developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">One of Ireland's great attractions as an investment centre has been the firmness and certainty of our property rights and the recognition of ownership. I am concerned that we could damage the source of our strength by failing to recognise its importance or even its existence. We take the system for granted. The recognition and implementation of such a system would help to correct the economic failures of poorer countries. These failures have nothing to do with deficiencies of cultural or genetic heritage. While there is no cultural commonality between the Latin Americans and the Russians, since both regions adopted capitalism without capital, or property ownership, they have shared the same political, social and economic problems. Yet in the last decade since both regions went down the road of capitalism without capital – in other words, property ownership – they have shared the same political, social and economic problems, including glaring inequality, underground economies, Mafia, political instability, capital flight and disregard for the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">These troubles did not originate in the monasteries of the Orthodox Church or along the pathways of the Incas. It is not only Third World countries and former Communist regimes which have suffered these problems. The same was true of the United States in the late 18th century when George Washington complained about the Banditti, who occupied land they did not own, of skimming and disposing of the cream of the country at the expense of the many. I would like to claim the former theory as my own but it is from the works of Hernando de Soto, one of the world's leading innovators in property reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">The failure of the Government to deal with the housing crisis has caused a major problem in this State. Almost every problem goes back to the failure to provide affordable housing. The Government is attempting to interfere with the Constitution and property rights in what it sees as a populist move designed to give the impression that it is trying to do something. However, it has done nothing to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">I welcome this motion tabled by our spokesperson, Deputy Allen, which has come about as a result of the controversy that has arisen in recent months and which he has articulated on several occasions, namely, the difficulties of the proposed new levies. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, who regrets his senior colleague is not here, will quote <i>ad nauseam</i> from the debate on the Planning and Development Act 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">Deputy Allen hit the nail on the head when he said that when we discussed this Bill we welcomed it, but in the context that local authorities would have an opportunity to raise funding for much needed community facilities. In my contribution to the debate on that Bill on 9 February 2000 I said:</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">I hope section 47 is used wisely and I look forward to many fine community centres in these areas. I trust the temptation to use the levies collected as a prop, due to a lack of central Government funding, is resisted. The section leaves that open and perhaps there is a case for an amendment to ensure the levies are put into community facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">I regret we did not table an amendment because I, like hundreds of thousands of people, believed the Government – much to our detriment. However, we now know differently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">When the housing problem arose as a result of the increase in employment and in population and a decrease in the household numbers, the Government went down the usual path and hired a consultant, Dr. Bacon. He brought forward a set of proposals which the Government implemented. When they did not work, Dr. Bacon brought forward another set of proposals which the Government implemented. They drove rents through the roof and drove billions of pounds out of this country to the south of Spain and to France.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">There is an old economic maxim that absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. I could commend the Minister for Finance, a much maligned individual. While I do not have access to Cabinet papers, I would say he was the one person who said we must stop this social engineering, or this madness, and change the policy. Unfortunately, it was too late for many people who were looking to rent a property because Irish people are now investing in central Europe to the detriment of this economy. If one goes to Dublin Airport on a Friday, aeroplanes to the south of France and the south of Spain are full of Irish people who invested abroad.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">My county faces a particularly difficult time. Economics is simple and housing is a simple commodity. The law of supply and demand applies, so what does one do when there is a difficulty? One tries to enhance the supply because there is nothing one can do about the demand. The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, is nodding his head. Maybe he has a different philosophy but everything this Government has done has hindered supply. I disagree with the 20% because it allows the Government to abdicate its responsibility. It should purchase land and build houses for people. Its record on local authority housing is appalling. Some 80% subsidise that 20%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">There is a ‘locals only' policy in Wicklow which the Minister may claim the local authority brought in. It introduced it at the behest of officials in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The policy in Wicklow means that somebody can come from Timbuktu and buy a house in Carlow town ten or 15 miles away from where I live. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows it well because he held many clinics there. However, someone from Carlow town cannot buy a house in Wicklow. Indeed, people in Rathvilly, who vote in the constituency of Wicklow, cannot buy a house in Wicklow. Someone from the Philippines, who works in Wicklow for a year, can buy a house in Wicklow but someone who lives down the road cannot. Someone from Dublin cannot buy a house in Kilcoole, which is on the rail line and which is only 15 or 16 miles from Dublin. However, one can drive to Rochfordbridge or to anywhere else in Ireland and buy a house.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">The policy in Wicklow is crazy. In the judicial review against Meath County Council, Justice Quirke stated that the policy was flawed, unworkable and that there was no definition for it, yet nothing has been done at central Government level. I feel sorry for the lady holed up in an office somewhere in Dublin through whom every telephone call must go. I would like something to be done about this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">On the levies, the Minister went on the 9 o'clock news and stated that people were scaremongering. I have the details and a proposal for a 200 square metre house. The proposed services levy for a 222 square metre house in the countryside in Wicklow is €28,000. The Minister also stated that those who will benefit will be those who will pay. That is not true. Many people who will benefit will pay nothing. Services will improve for me if the water supply is upgraded in my area but I will pay nothing. Many people who will pay will not benefit, particularly those who build houses in the countryside. It is a crazy system and it is inequitable. Counties have suffered from infrastructural deficits in the past. The people do not mind paying tax if it is fair, equitable and transparent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">This levy is being used as a prop for a lack of Government funding. I went out of my way to say it was not associated with benchmarking but maybe I was being too honest. It is indirectly associated with benchmarking because it is one more method of making up for the Government shortfall and one more stealth tax. The reason it is increasing is that the Government is not providing funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">I spoke about tangible concepts earlier. This is the concept of the hen that lays the golden egg. This Government found the hen but it choked it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_650">
          <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
          <p eId="para_1056">I thank my colleagues for tabling this motion and giving us the opportunity to speak on it. Taking poetic licence from Deputy Timmins, I cite the poem, <i>Eldorado</i>:</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">"Shadow", said he, "Where can it be</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">This land of Eldorado?"</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">The Minister and the Government have discovered Eldorado. Eldorado is the people who do not have homes, the people who have been waiting on housing lists for the last five or six years and the 50,000 plus families in towns and in the countryside who hope to buy a house and who have been deprived of doing so because of the Government's policy. The reason is that the Government is now using homeless people as a means of raising taxes. It is a unique opportunity to take full advantage of the disadvantage of people who are on the housing list, whether to buy or acquire a house from the local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">There are many areas of neglect on which this Government can reflect as it approaches the local elections and the next general election, whenever that is – the sooner, the better. That is the sentiment expressed by every person to whom I have spoken in the past six months. There are few areas to which it did not make promises before the last general election but it promised very little to those in need of a house and, true to its word, it gave them nothing. The Government looked at the €3,800 first-time buyer's grant and took it back. It decided it did not have enough money because it is saving up for the next general election. After all, it must pay for all the promises it hopes to make. To save more money, the Government decided to raise various service charges. Every local authority was given the option either to go under or raise charges. The attitude was double them, to hell with inflation, let us have a good cut at it and take all. Having sat and gazed at that particular pot of gold for a while they looked again, thought there was more and decided to go for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">Not only were they unhappy with what they got from taking away the new house grant but they then decided to penalise people without a home of their own. They decided that to impose a penalty on people with no home of their own was the right way to solve the problem so that people would become grateful for being allowed to live, subsist or exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">Deputy Timmins made reference to the peasants in France and various parts of eastern Europe. The way things are heading here, in a few years the Government will do what was done in Europe after the Second World War. It will build a few apartment blocks on the outskirts of towns and villages and hold people in them because it will be easier to control them. It will be able to get all the taxes it wants from them any way it wants in such a situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">I hate saying this to the Minister of State because I know he is a nice guy at heart. However, I have come to the conclusion that we will have to carry out an exploratory operation to find his heart. All his policies are appalling and punitive. They hit the most vulnerable people in society. At this late stage, will he look into what goes for his heart, and that of his senior colleague, and ask where things are heading? He should ask himself what the young people have done to offend him and why he is doing this to them. Surely it is possible to allow them live life in their own way, improve their circumstances and better themselves as opportunities arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">The Minister of State is taking those opportunities from them. He is trying to ensure they will never have a home of their own. Unfortunately, I have come to the conclusion that the objective of this Government is that the young population should never be able to aspire to homes of their own. The best they can aspire to is renting a home from some landlord or financial institution because they will never be able to afford one.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">About 150,000 people will be the victims of what is proposed by this latest atrocity. Many of those people could build a home of their own if they were allowed. The Government will not build them nor has it any intention of doing so. It has no intention of building but only of saying what it did and how much it spent over the past five or seven years. It gives us a history lesson at every opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">The Minister of State served time on a local authority and I hoped he would have used that experience to good advantage. Instead we have a nonsensical housing scheme. There is a maximum €130,000 shared ownership loan for people to get a home of their own in my constituency. We know there is no chance or possibility of them buying or building a house for that. On countless occasions I have asked the Minister of State to raise this to a realistic level. I am disappointed that he obviously does not intend to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">I congratulate my colleagues on giving us the opportunity to speak on this matter by putting down this motion. These Government measures will have long and far-reaching effects which I hope are visited on the Government which perpetrated them.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_651">
          <from>Mr. O'Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_1068">I congratulate Deputy Allen on bringing this motion before the House. It is timely because the effects and impact of these measures are being discussed in council chambers up and down the country. They are also being discussed in the homes of people who have saved for years to buy their own home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">Let us examine the fantastic change in our demographic profile over the past number of years. In the 1970s and 1980s we did not have the same need for housing because many young people did not have jobs but were going abroad. We did not have the same pressure on services or the demand for new homes we have now. Emigration has ended and we now have net immigration. More young people are staying at home and they want to buy their own home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">The effect of this proposed stealth tax will be different for couples, depending on where they live. Cork County Council will charge €5,000 or €6,000 but County Louth will charge perhaps €12,000. There is no equity or fairness in the charge. It is an additional, unfair and unacceptable burden on young couples who want to build their own home. What effect will it have on them? At present, if people are lucky enough to be in the sector of society able to buy their own home, they have borrowed to the hilt. Lending agencies are issuing warnings about the number of maximum 90% mortgages that have been provided to young families and young people starting out in life. This measure will create additional borrowing pressure for young people. It is unacceptable and unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">How will people deal with this issue? Perhaps the builder will drop the quality of the house he is building, thereby reducing the cost, but I do not think that will happen in the city of Dublin or in most places I know. If young people cannot borrow more, their parents may give them more. Many more parents will now have to participate in securing or funding mortgages for their sons and daughters.</p>
          <p eId="para_1072">The other alternative is to move further from the centre of population to find a cheaper house. If we could argue for that or argue that there was some merit in the Government spatial strategy, there would be a case for not imposing extra taxes on people who move where we want them to live. Perhaps we should look at the spatial strategy and designate growth centres around the country. The Government could designate places in which it wants young people to live, such as places on the eastern seaboard or towns not growing in population but with existing infrastructure that is not being used, e.g. main roads with no houses on them and schools with empty classroom places. People would be happy to live in these places if it was made attractive to them to move there.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">The Minister of State should examine what merit there is in the national spatial strategy and devise a system whereby people who bought in these areas would not have to pay these taxes. Then he could argue there was some cogency or reality in asking people to live in places where we need more people to reside. However, that is not what he is doing. The effect of this measure will be that the counties of Louth, Meath, Wicklow and Kildare will have more people moving into their villages from the limits of the city. More people will take the daily drive to and from Dublin or pack into the trains and buses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1074">There is no real thought or construction behind the processes at work here. The Government has just decided it needs money for infrastructure. Everybody agrees with that. However, Government is not looking at the counties or places where there is a developed infrastructure and where people would be glad to live if it was made more attractive for them to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1075">I want to make a point about industry. I understand from the newspapers that the IDA mentions it does not consider County Wicklow attractive for industrial investment. This increased tax on people who want to set up a business where they live will be penal and negative. The Minister of State should consider that there may be merit in looking at areas which might be designated as areas where these charges would not apply. He should examine again where he wants people to work and live.</p>
          <p eId="para_1076">If the spatial strategy means anything nationally, it means there is a plan regarding what the Government wants to happen. However, what the Government is imposing is a mish-mash. It is putting massive increases on housing costs and giving people no choice. The Minister of State is not encouraging choices which would benefit the economy. This resolution is both worthwhile and important.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1103">The first part of the motion criticises the Government's position on local government funding. Contrary to what it attempts to suggest, the funding of local government has undergone a transformation in recent years. The Government is more than proud to stand over its performance since it came into office in 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_1104">The Local Government Act 1998 reformed the arrangements for the central Government's support of local government. This completely transformed the financial position of the local government sector by giving it a dedicated and buoyant source of income. The establishment of the local government fund, as a ring-fenced source of funding for local government, was the key to this transformation. The fund is financed from the proceeds of motor tax. An Exchequer contribution indexed to the initial amount was provided for in the 1998 Act. The fruits of the rapid advances in the economy since the fund was established have been made directly available to local authorities. The commitment by the Government to fund local government properly is demonstrated by the fact that the Exchequer contribution to the fund since its establishment is €208 million more than the level required by the indexation provision in the 1998 Act. General purpose allocations of over €626 million were made from the fund in 2003.</p>

        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_670" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1106">There has been an unprecedented transfer of resources to local authorities to enable them to provide day-to-day services. The buoyancy in the fund has enabled the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to increase general purpose grants to local authorities by about 85% since 1997. The fund provided just under €400 million for non-national roads this year. This means that grants for non-national roads have almost doubled since 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_1107">A key thrust of the local government reform programme is improving the range and quality of services provided by local authorities for their customers. In many cases, these services are linked to the infrastructure being provided through the national development plan. Local authorities have improved the quality of the water supply and treatment they offer, road maintenance has improved beyond measure in the past ten years, social housing supply is framed to match the sector's needs in a more sensitive manner, social inclusion initiatives have been developed and implemented and better planning and development control has allowed local authorities to respond positively to customers' increased expectations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">Most of my Department's spending flows to local authorities in grants and subsidies. Capital programmes account for over two thirds of the expenditure. I have dealt with the supports which have been provided to the local government sector for current spending, but it would be remiss of me not to remind the House of the rapid and sustained rise in capital grants to local authorities since the Government was elected six years ago. The value, excluding roads, of the Exchequer-funded public capital programme expenditure in the 1997 Estimates for the then Department of the Environment was just over €500 million. According to the 2004 Abridged Estimate for my Department, comparable expenditure will approach €1.6 billion. The funding for the same services has increased from €500 million to €1.6 billion in a few short years. Virtually all this expenditure will be advanced to local authorities for a range of services, which are mainly infrastructural in nature. The largest of the programmes relate to local authority social housing and investment in water and waste water services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">Exchequer capital spending on local authority and social housing was about €214 million in 1997, but similar supports to local authorities will exceed €930 million next year. There has been an increase of over 400% in seven years. Although inflation in the construction industry has been higher than we would have wished, it is still a dramatic increase in real terms. It has resulted in the addition of many more local authority houses to the social housing stock. I will expand on this later. I do not like to hear complaints from people like Deputy Durkan, with whom I have discussed this matter privately. The Department has made funding available to local authorities in recent years. The performance of a number of local authorities is pathetic, however. We are at the end of the four-year multi-annual programme.</p>

          <p eId="para_1115">Investment in water and waste water services is the other large infrastructural programme with which the Department is concerned. It is the most significant investment programme which relates directly to environmental protection. It builds capacity into the economy to enable economic growth to continue into the future. We invested €190 million in the programme in 1997, but the comparable figure in 2004 is projected at €440 million. This is an increase of over 100%. Other capital programmes assisted by my Department include non-national roads, fire and emergency services, the public library service and urban renewal. All this funding is made available to local authorities, which are not adequately funded according to the Opposition. The local government sector has been increasingly better funded since 1997. The evidence of improved social and economic infrastructure is plain for all to see.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1151">This is precisely the opposite of what is happening. Under the 1963 Planning Act, development contributions were, until now, imposed by way of manager's order as a condition of planning permission. That system was widely and rightly criticised as being too haphazard, unevenly applied across the country and lacking in transparency. Development interests agree with the principle of paying development contributions but they rightly object to not knowing what they are to pay, how it is calculated and for what they are paying.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">Prior to the enactment of the Planning and Development Act 2000, development interests lobbied for the introduction of a new system that would give them certainty about the contributions they would have to pay. Looking at the amounts being collected –€122 million in 2001 and an estimated €150 million in 2002 – it must be acknowledged that some clarity needed to be introduced into the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">Section 48 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 was brought in to require local authorities to prepare schemes setting out how development contributions would apply in their area. This was designed to bring order to a system which already applies and to introduce a new level of openness. It will ensure that the costs to local authorities of supplying infrastructure and facilities will become evident to developers and the public at large. It will also ensure that developers know in advance what contribution they will have to make towards infrastructure and facilities and what infrastructure and facilities they are funding. Moreover, the new system gives a new role to elected members in determining the level of contribution that would apply. That is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">We speak a great deal about providing councillors with extra authority. It is also important to note that the new system of applying development contributions was welcomed by all sides of the Oireachtas at the time – I could quote at length from the contributions made by Fine Gael and Labour Deputies who put forward amendments to extend the types of infrastructure that could be funded. They were not only happy with what was contained in the Bill, they wanted to extend and expand it.</p>

          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1156">It is a pity that attitude has not continued. Deputies should not be running scared with misinformation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">The third myth is that all developers will have to pay a set levy in respect of all developments. That is not true. People have mentioned wild figures like €28,000 per house. That is nonsense. Each planning authority has prepared, or is now preparing, its development contribution schemes for final adoption by March next year. The draft schemes must be published and the public consulted. At that point they are submitted to the elected members of each authority for adoption.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">The final decision on making a development contribution scheme and setting the levies rests with elected members of the local authority. If councillors want to set a figure of €28,000, they may do so. Given that we all know they will not set a figure anything like that amount, it is beyond me why people continue scaremongering on this issue. This is an important new policy role which presents a challenge for elected members. I hope and expect that local authority councillors from all sides of the political spectrum will take it up and develop it in a proper manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159">It is up to local authorities to balance the overall charges to be levied on new development and the impact that may have against the costs which would otherwise arise to its finances in providing infrastructure to service such development. Why should local authorities and the general taxpayer have to pay for everything and allow developers to continue to make and pocket a fortune? The members have to strike a level of contribution for all types of development that reflects fairly the increased load of that development on local authority infrastructure and facilities while at the same time not discouraging some development or, indeed, not allowing some developers to take advantage of publicly funded infrastructure and make a super-profit at public expense. However, they must ensure that contributions are set at an appropriate rate because without them local authorities will not be able to service land at the necessary rate and this will inevitably impact on the rates of development of all kinds over the next few years. First-time buyers will not thank elected members if they prevent a proper rate of serviced land for housing and restrict supply as a consequence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1160">The main plank of the Opposition argument is that house prices will suffer a direct increase as a consequence of the new development contribution schemes. That is incorrect. As I pointed out, local authorities have been levying contributions since the implementation of the 1963 Act. When charged by manager's fiat, house prices did not vary in the wild manner claimed by the industry. If builders do hand on these costs, hard questions will have to be asked of the industry about its willingness to pass on costs while maintaining its profits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1161">The key to house price moderation is supply. The development contribution system is the key to providing the necessary services for land to build houses and the additional facilities which make places worth living and working in. Housing remains at the top of the Government's agenda and a wide range of measures have been taken over the course of our two terms in office to increase housing output to match demand. These include removing infrastructure and planning constraints on residential development, affording greater access to the housing market to first-time buyers and improving affordability for first-time buyers and lower income households.</p>
          <p eId="para_1162">In recent years, we have witnessed an unprecedented demand for housing, brought about by a number of economic and demographic changes, such as rising disposable incomes, historically low interest rates and changing household formation patterns. These have placed significant pressure on housing supply and house prices. The Government's response is to ensure the continuation of the measures which we initiated in our previous term to increase the supply of housing to meet demand and improve affordability, particularly for first-time buyers, and in that way to seek to bring moderation to house price increases. Therefore, the Government's response has rightly focused on increasing supply, and that is the key. Measures have included increasing investment in the provision of serviced land for housing and more effective use of that land through improved planning guidelines on residential densities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163">Our considerable success is reflected in the fact that last year just over 57,000 units were completed. Let us put that in context and examine development over the last ten years. In 1993, around 22,000 houses were built. Going from 22,000 to 57,000 – and, one hopes, over 60,000 this year – is an enormous increase. Ireland is now building at the fastest rate in Europe – close to 15 units per 1,000 population last year, which is an extraordinary achievement. It is not just the highest rate of house construction in the EU in proportion to population but miles ahead of anyone else. We are building at a rate of 15 per 1,000, the UK is at three per thousand and Sweden at one per thousand. Portugal, which is nearest to us, is building at nine per thousand. The positive trend in supply has continued this year, with production for the first six months up 16.5% on the same period last year. Completions in the greater Dublin area were up, and we hope to achieve 60,000 new dwelling units this year, a significant achievement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164">The Government continues to be concerned about addressing the issue of affordability. The general improvement in employment and increases in disposable income resulting from economic growth, lower interest rates and tax reductions has assisted many individuals in purchasing their homes and improved affordability for many. Price is one aspect of affordability, but interest and taxation rates and disposable income are all very important. Obviously, houses are still affordable, and just under 50% of new mortgages are still being taken out by first-time buyers. The Government has also implemented a range of targeted measures of direct benefit to first-time buyers. Those include increasing the mortgage interest relief available to first-time buyers in the budget last December—</p>

          <p eId="para_1166">—by raising the annual ceiling on the amount of interest that can be allowed by over one quarter and extending the period for which the relief is available to seven years. Stamp duty rates have also been rebalanced to favour first-time buyers, including more than doubling the exemption limit. Other measures such as the rent a room scheme have also assisted first-time buyers in gaining a foothold on the property ladder by enabling them to earn rental income exempt from income tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_1167">The Government decided last year to abolish the first-time buyer's grant. While that was a difficult decision, it was important to refocus the expenditure to meet the needs of low-income groups through targeted measures. The grant had clearly outlived its usefulness as an economic incentive. Indeed, several Members of the Opposition, including Deputy Timmins, who spoke earlier this evening, specifically called for its abolition in the House, in his case in 2001 and again last year, and I am surprised at the hypocrisy of now supporting a motion condemning its abolition. If Deputy Timmins were consistent, he would consider his position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168">The Government has also responded to the needs of first-time buyers in other ways, including its continuing commitment to the shared ownership and affordable housing schemes. Activity under those schemes continues to play an increasing role in assisting low-income households to purchase their own homes. The needs of just under 900 households were met in 2002, and around 1,000 houses will be sold under the scheme in 2003. The provisions under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended, are also assisting the delivery of social and affordable housing. In the future, they will be a major source of social and affordable housing. The dividend from that measure has been slow to develop, but it will be significant, probably from next year onwards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169">A new affordable housing initiative is also being developed under the Sustaining Progress arrangement with the social partners. In responding to the proposal, the Government is committed to an ambitious scale of delivery of affordable housing for target groups. The announcement in July 2003 of the immediate release of two sites in Dublin, and agreement to a proposal relating to two further sites in Meath and Kildare, is a critical step in both ensuring early delivery of housing under that initiative, and in ensuring that such housing is affordable for the specific target groups. The Government agreed to the immediate release of those lands to ensure that work could begin as a priority in delivering affordable housing at those sites, while work on identifying further sites could make progress over the coming months. The release of those spearhead sites shows the Government's determination to make measurable progress by the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress in the middle of 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170">Given those measures, together with increases in output in social rented accommodation, the Government should be credited for bringing about real and positive changes in the provision of social and affordable housing. Last year saw the delivery of the highest level of output under the range of social and affordable housing measures for over 15 years. The Government has actively demonstrated its concern to ensure that the broad spectrum of housing needs be met, and from 2000 to 2002, €3.8 billion, or 109%, of the NDP forecast on social and affordable housing measures was spent. That reflects the Government's commitment to meeting the needs of low-income groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171">The Estimates published ten days ago show that total housing provision will increase next year by 5.5% to €1.885 billion in 2004, despite the pressure on the public finances. That is a considerable increase. The 2004 provision includes capital investment of over €1 billion, which will allow for 5,000 starts under the main local authority programme, an increase of 500 on this year, and a further 500 units to commence under area regeneration programmes in such areas as Ballymun. The provision also underpins continuing progress in the voluntary and co-operative housing sector, which has been considerably increasing its contribution. Together, those measures mean that the needs of about 12,500 households will be met this year. That compares well with five or six years ago, when the figure was only about 8,500.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172">The number of people on the waiting list is 48,000 households rather than any of the other figures that people mention, and sadly, when we take 12,500 from that list each year, others join the queue. At the same time, much progress has been made. It is not fair to compare the figure on the waiting list now with that for five, ten or 15 years ago, since many new categories of people are now eligible for the waiting list who previously were not. I believe that around 30% or 32% of those on waiting lists are now single people. Ten years ago, they would not have been eligible to get on the list unless they were senior citizens. We are not really comparing like with like when we throw around statistics regarding the number on waiting lists.</p>

          <p eId="para_1177">We are introducing new legislation which would give them added protection and better tenancy agreements, and there would be no fear of being evicted so quickly. The Government remains determined to respond effectively to the broad range of housing needs, particularly those of low-income households. Those targeted measures to assist low-income groups and those with special housing needs, together with the broader housing objectives of increasing overall supply, form part of the Government's overall response to meet housing needs. Its performance represents a record of successful support for local authorities, which have never been better funded to carry out their work. It is a record of success in reviewing the planning system to ensure greater transparency and a greater role for the people elected to take responsibility for the future of their area and in delivering housing for every sector of society. For those reasons, I am happy to commend the Government's amendment to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178">I encourage Deputies to apply pressure at local level because some councils are not delivering. They sought money under the multi-annual programme and received it.

Notwithstanding what the Minister of State said, we have a housing crisis which is damaging individuals, families and communities. In the six years since the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats coalition first took office, the numbers on the housing list have increased by nearly 100%. The list was more than 27,000 when they took office and is about 49,000 now. When those figures are extrapolated, between 100,000 and 130,000 individuals are looking to the State for housing support, which does not include the hundreds of homeless people who are sleeping rough.</p>

          <p eId="para_1185">At the same time, so-called affordable housing has increased by more than 300%. Couples in relatively good jobs earning two salaries cannot afford to purchase the same type of house which their parents could purchase on just one salary less than 30 years ago. Ireland has one of the highest rates of home ownership in Europe and, in their efforts to buy a house of their own, purchasers are exposing themselves to huge financial risks. I would hate to see the situation should interest rates increase or house prices collapse.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">In their efforts to secure a home at a price they can afford, individuals and couples are obliged to live considerable distances from their place of employment, families and friends, thus adding to commuting times and road congestion. It is not beyond the bounds of possibility that a person might leave the midlands at 6.30 a.m. and get home at 8.30 p.m. because he or she cannot afford to buy a house in the greater Dublin area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187">In order to secure a house on a mortgage, it is necessary for both partners to work long hours, with huge consequences for family life, child care and family relationships. Notwithstanding these difficulties, many couples are making the choice to purchase a house outside the greater Dublin area with the hope of returning to live closer to work and extended family in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">The Minister of State referred to affordability. Unfortunately, there are many people who are not eligible for a local authority house, if one was available, nor can they get a mortgage from the financial institutions or the local authority. That is a major problem. This is the position of an increasing group of people who have been totally disregarded.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">There are two local authority housing schemes, namely, the affordable housing scheme and the shared housing scheme. Tonight, I pulled out a report from the National Economic and Social Forum which states that the Government should look at the income limits and loan amounts in regard to affordable housing for people who cannot secure a loan from a financial institution. The report recommends that these be kept under review.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190">The maximum loan anyone can secure from a local authority is €130,000. This figure has not been reviewed or perhaps the Minister for Finance has refused to increase amount. Eligibility for the mortgage is based on an income of €32,000 for one person or a formula where there are two applicants to bring them up to €80,000. A couple may be over the limit for a council loan, even though it is just €130,000, and may not be able to get a loan from a financial institution either.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">We were told by the Department and the Minister of State that the affordable housing scheme under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 would solve the problem. The criterion for affordability under that Act is that if an applicant is required to pay in excess of 35% of their net income by a financial institution, he or she should not have to go down that road, rather they should be entitled to an affordable house from the local authorities under the Act.</p>

I brought this to the notice of the Minister of State in recent months. I was told there is a claw-back in the scheme which some of the financial institutions are not happy with. It is not good enough for the State or the Minister of State to say there are problems. He is paid to implement the legislation and he should do so. If there are officials or county managers standing in the way of implementing the legislation, they should be removed. There are people who are entitled to be housed, but they are being denied their rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194">Reference was made to development levies. I introduced a Private Members' Bill a couple of years ago which suggested that the criteria could be extended to allow contributions, other than those in respect of which provision already existed, to be made. In that regard, I had in mind community-based developments or those for community benefit. I have no difficulty with development levies, but what I originally envisaged was a levy of perhaps €1,000 or €1,500 per house which would be put towards the provision of services. I am not prepared to accept that the money from such levies can be used for capital expenditure, benchmarking or anything else.

          <p eId="para_1202">Having abolished the grant a year ago, it is unbelievable that the Government cannot process these applications in a more speedy manner. There are over 3,000 homes awaiting inspection, but only four additional inspectors have been hired to deal with the backlog.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203">Following another Book of Estimates which brought bad news for people trying to buy houses and the Minister's assertion that he can build a further 500 homes at a cost of just €66,000 each, it seems clear that the Minister, Deputy Cullen, and his colleagues in Government are becoming increasingly detached from the harsh realities facing people who are being priced out of the housing market. I call on the Minister to speed up the processing of applications for the first-time buyer's grant for the few people who await payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">The new development levy is being promoted by the Government and, in particular, Fianna Fáil in the House. Like everything else, however, it is not being supported by Fianna Fáil outside the House or at local authority meetings. Cork County Council has voted it down and Kerry County Council will do likewise. As with the Hanly report, the levy is supported in the House and at meetings of the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party, but outside the gates of Leinster House it is a free for all. Everyone is against everything.</p>

          <p eId="para_1209">I agree with Deputy Allen, they have no backbone.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210">Section 48 was intended to consolidate existing arrangements for development levies and to allow for such levies to be used for the provision of facilities in local communities. There is nothing wrong with section 48. What is wrong is the way it is being implemented, which will result in first-time buyers having to pay up to €10,000 more for their homes. Local authorities which are starved of finance for capital works and community facilities have latched on to section 48 development levies as a means of building up local funds. The amounts being proposed are far in excess of that which obtained when the levy was first envisaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211">In the absence of any price controls on new housing, these levies will be passed on to purchasers who, in most cases, are first-time buyers. This is the third occasion in one year that first-time buyers have been plundered by the Government. Last November, the first-time buyer's grant was abolished. This was followed by a 1% increase in the cost of building materials. Now we have an further imposition of €10,000 on home buyers in the form of the development levy. In the meantime, the Government has reduced capital gains tax for developers from 40% to 20%. As Deputy Seán Ryan stated, it voted down a Labour Party Bill to cap the price of building land. It seems the Government is determined that developers and land owners can continue to profit, in full, from the housing needs of families and first-time buyers, who have to pay for everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_1212">In an era when more and more people are finding it increasingly difficult to finance the purchase of a home for themselves, this could be the straw that breaks the camel's back. Many young people might have an opportunity to purchase a site in a rural area but they face obstacles in the planning process which might prevent them, even those who satisfy the requirements of the local needs clause in county development plans, pursuing this route. One cannot but see the imposition of these levies as another attempt to ensure that people will be further burdened if they opt to live in a rural area. If the current trend continues, the denuding of the rural landscape will come to pass. These levies will hasten that process. The Government is expert at introducing stealth taxes and in trying to fool people. The latest attempt should be rejected because ordinary people will carry the burden.</p>
          <p eId="para_1213">A debate on motor tax preceded this debate. When I heard the Minister's reply to that debate, I was determined to touch on that matter in my contribution. I was fascinated and baffled by the proposal of the Minister, Deputy Cullen, that consultants be paid €750,000 to ascertain the roads throughout the country which require improvement. That is an insult to every county engineer and it is also a complete waste of money. Any county engineer worth his salt could provide the Minister tomorrow morning with a programme of the roads in their county which require improvement. These individuals will not charge him €750,000. There are plenty of rural roads in my constituency which would benefit far more from that €750,000 than would the friends of Fianna Fáil consultants who are going to make money out of this move. The latter will derive far more from the Minister's action than will the people of my constituency, south Kerry, where there are more potholes than money.</p>

          <p eId="para_1216">This year, for the first time ever, a limit was imposed on the funding available in County Kerry for grants to people with disabilities and older people to adapt their homes to enable them to move around with greater ease. A letter was sent to Kerry County Council in respect of this matter, but perhaps that did not happen in the case of other councils. The allocation to Kerry County Council in 2003 for the disabled person's and essential repairs grants was capped by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. It was 22% less than the amount promised and the county council has had to appeal to the Department to meet its funding commitments and reverse the cut in funding.</p>

          <p eId="para_1234">B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé oiriúnach go bhfuil an Bille seo os comhair na Dála ar an lá ina bhfuilimid ag comóradh bunadh Óglaigh na hÉireann 90 bliain ó shin. The introduction of the Bill is appropriate given that the foundation of Óglaigh na hÉireann 90 years ago was celebrated earlier at the Garden of Remembrance. I thank Deputies McGinley and Sherlock for attending.</p>
          <p eId="para_1235">I am pleased to present the Bill to the House as it fulfils an important election manifesto commitment. The Bill will establish a new statutory office of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, a major historical milestone in the modernisation of redress procedures. The Defence Forces ombudsman will generally replace the Minister for Defence as the final point of appeal in the statutory redress procedures of the 1954 Defence Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236">However, the Second Stage reading is tinged with sadness. Members will recall that the late John Lucey, the former general secretary of PDFORRA, was a most committed and articulate advocate of the Defence Forces ombudsman. He campaigned tirelessly for the establishment of a Defence Forces ombudsman for many years. However, early in 2002, John Lucey tragically lost his life in a mountaineering accident. Both Mr. Lucey and his family are very much in our thoughts. Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a anam dílis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237">Since the Bill's publication, consultations have continued with the representative associations, PDFORRA and RACO. I have agreed to table a number of amendments on Committee Stage in the interest of promoting the widest consensus in support of the new ombudsman. I will refer to the more important amendments later.</p>
          <p eId="para_1238">The legislation provides for the establishment of the office of the Defence Forces ombudsman and for the appointment of an individual to that office by the President on the recommendation of Government. The Bill defines the functions of the ombudsman and sets out the general right of Defence Forces personnel to make a complaint to the ombudsman. The limited circumstances in which the ombudsman shall not investigate particular types of complaint are also outlined. Generally, an alternative route of appeal to the Minister for Defence is provided. Overall, the Bill provides the ombudsman with considerable independence and autonomy in the discharge of his statutory functions and in the conduct of investigations. Military personnel are assured of complete independence from the Minister, the Department of Defence and the military authorities in the investigation of complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239">A system of complaints inquiry is available to all serving military personnel. Section 114 of the Defence Act provides for application for redress by military personnel who may think themselves to have been wronged by another member of the Defence Forces. This system was modified administratively in 1996 with the introduction of an external complaints inquiry officer appointed directly by the Minister to act in an advisory capacity. The advisory role of the CIO was introduced into the redress procedure on an agreed basis following extensive consultations with the representative associations at conciliation and arbitration. Individual complaints brought before the Minister could be referred to the CIO at the discretion of the Minister for independent review. The CIO then made recommendations to the Minister. It was agreed at the time that the question of a statutory Defence Forces ombudsman could be considered at a later date, in light of practical experience and in the context of a subsequent review of the operation of the informal CIO system.</p>
          <p eId="para_1240">That review commenced towards the end of 1999. The CIO was dealing with two dozen cases a year on average at the time. The review identified a continuing demand among enlisted personnel at private and junior NCO level for the introduction of a more transparently independent and statutorily rigorous procedure which would be clearly seen to be independent of the Defence Forces chain of command, the departmental secretariat and the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1241">Other more recent developments have highlighted the importance of ensuring military personnel have faith in grievance procedures. The Doyle report into the incidence of unacceptable workplace behaviour in the Defence Forces found there was a serious lack of confidence in existing internal military complaint procedures. This lack of confidence was found to be widespread, particularly among enlisted personnel. I published the Doyle report in March 2002 and it received national media attention. The Bill providing for the new ombudsman had been published and circulated by then and the detailed research findings of the Doyle report were troubling. The report underlined the need for an independent statutory mechanism of investigation of complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_1242">The findings and recommendations of the report were based upon extensive research undertaken by Dr. Eileen Doyle and her team. Her report highlighted widespread perceptions of harassment, sexual harassment, bullying and discrimination within the Defence Forces. Decisive remedial action had to be taken. I accepted Dr. Doyle's report and its recommendations in full and ensured that required actions were expedited.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">An independent monitoring group, chaired by Dr. Doyle, is overseeing the implementation of fundamental reforms. This is a major collaborative enterprise involving senior military authorities, the Department and the representative associations. Arising from the work of the monitoring group, a number of important initiatives are now under way. An equality steering group is engaged in a major equality audit of Defence Forces regulations, administrative instructions, practices and procedures in the light of contemporary legislation and best working practices in general Irish employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1244">An independent body has been engaged to provide an entirely independent 24 hour confidential help line and counselling service. Another independent body has been engaged to carry out confidential "exit interview" questionnaires for a selection of personnel leaving the Defence Forces. The findings of these interviews will be fed back to the monitoring group.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245">A new administrative instruction A7, "Interpersonal Relationships in the Defence Forces", was launched in early April. This instruction clearly sets out policy and procedures on personal relationships within the Defence Forces. A user-friendly guidance booklet and pocket reference card are being provided to every member of the Defence Forces. The new instruction provides procedures for the making of either a formal or informal complaint about unacceptable behaviour and provides significant protections for complainants and third party witnesses. The appointment of an independent ombudsman will mark a further milestone in developing a positive working environment for members of the Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_1246">I now come to the main provisions of the Bill. The new Defence Forces Ombudsman will investigate complaints with a view to ascertaining whether an action complained of may have been unreasonable, arbitrary, improperly discriminatory or otherwise inconsistent with sound and fair administrative practice. The ombudsman will be statutorily independent in the course of his investigations and in the performance of his duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1247">At present, a complaint may be finally brought before the Minister for Defence where an applicant so wishes. The present right of referral to the Minister for Defence will be replaced, in nearly all cases, with a right of referral to the Defence Forces Ombudsman. However, it is proposed to amend the Bill on Committee Stage, so that the right of referral to the Minister will be retained in clearly defined circumstances in which the ombudsman is specifically excluded from access under the Bill, but where there would be access to the Minister under current arrangements. These circumstances relate to security or military operations, as defined in the Bill; matters relating to the organisation, structure and deployment of the Defence Forces; and matters relating to the administration of military prisons.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248">It is also proposed that any complaints concerning actions predating the commencement of the legislation will continue to be dealt with by the Minister on a transitional basis. Generally, the ombudsman will become involved first, where a complainant has had full recourse to the internal military redress system, up to and including the level of the Chief of Staff; second, where those procedures have been exhausted, and third, where the ombudsman forms an opinion that the complainant has an apparently bona fide and justified cause of complaint or grievance, which, in the opinion of the ombudsman, has not been satisfactorily redressed or resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1249">The ombudsman will also be accessible to former members of the Defence Forces, subject to specified time limits. The present redress procedures are confined to serving members and to persons serving at the time of initiation of their complaint. Conversely, it will be entirely for the ombudsman, at his own discretion, to refuse any trivial, vexatious or manifestly unreasonable or foolish complaints, or to refuse complaints where the internal military redress system has not been properly utilised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">The military environment poses specific challenges to the ombudsman concept. There is a delicate balance to be drawn between on the one hand, the need to provide appropriate rights of access to the ombudsman and, on the other hand, the need to safeguard military lines of authority. I emphasise to the House that, in this regard, I have been at great pains to confine the level of restriction on the remit of the new ombudsman to the very minimum. Some exclusions are self-evident. For instance, the ombudsman will not be able to investigate a complaint where a legal action has been initiated and he or she will not become involved in matters within the remit of the Defence Forces conciliation and arbitration scheme and the representative associations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">Matters relating to the organisation, structure and deployment of the Defence Forces and the administration of military prisons will also be excluded from the remit of the ombudsman. Security matters will also be outside his or her remit and the Minister will retain the right to request the ombudsman to desist from an investigation in such an area. The ombudsman may, however, apply to the High Court and seek a direction from the court if such a situation should ever arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1252">Military operations will be excluded from the ambit of the ombudsman. However, I have decided to revisit the definition of "military operation" in the Bill, in direct response to concerns expressed by PDFORRA. An amendment will be proposed on Committee Stage in order to add further precision to the definition of the term. The term should only encompass operations in the field and the amendment will reflect this so as to widen the remit of the ombudsman to the greatest practical extent. I am glad to have been able to respond positively to PDFORRA in this regard. All things considered, I envisage that the number of complaints falling outside the remit of the ombudsman will be very small.</p>
          <p eId="para_1253">The Defence Forces have demonstrated a real, active and genuine commitment to this entire process. I fully realise that securing the necessary fundamental and irreversible changes in workplace culture and attitudes will not be simple or easy. However, I have every confidence that appropriate leadership can establish and maintain the proper environment throughout the Defence Forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_1254">I am pleased to submit this Bill for the consideration of the House. The provision of a statutory Defence Forces Ombudsman will mark a development of major significance for the Defence Forces. This important legislative measure will serve to assist in the cultivation and maintenance of a modern working environment which will benefit all ranks within the Defence Forces. The Bill is based upon the philosophy which gave rise to the original ombudsman legislation in 1980.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255">I wish to touch on a few other areas before concluding. With regard to staffing, it is envisaged, initially, that one civil servant, probably at executive officer or higher executive officer level, will be assigned to the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces. The level of staffing and the number of staff which may need to be assigned subsequently is unknown at this stage, being subject to the number of complaints submitted to the ombudsman in due course. The combined strength of the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force is approximately 24,480. Only a small proportion of those are likely to initiate complaints, many of which may be satisfactorily resolved within the military chain of command. It is not foreseen at this stage that the ombudsman will require a large number of staff. It will probably be necessary for him or her to rent office accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">The ombudsman appointed pursuant to this Bill will not be a member of the Defence Forces or a serving civil servant. He or she will hold office for a period not exceeding seven years but may be eligible for re-appointment for a second or subsequent term. The retirement age will be as prescribed in the regulations made by the Minister for Defence under the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">Appointment to the Office of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces will be made by the President on the recommendation of the Government and not upon a resolution passed by the Dáil and Seanad as in the case of the Ombudsman appointed under the 1980 Act and in the case of the Information Commissioner. It will be recalled that the President also appoints the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces on the recommendation of the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">While the nature of the appointment of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, in practice, may be consistent with a part-time commitment, it has been decided not to reflect this specifically in the Bill for the reason that at present the level of complaints that may be addressed to him or her is as yet unknown. The only precedent guideline available is the work pattern of the part-time complaints inquiry officer who processed only a few applications for redress per month.</p>
          <p eId="para_1259">The Bill represents a sensible, practical model for the operation of the Defence Forces ombudsman. This is a real response to the desire for further modernisation and reform of the redress procedures among military personnel. I look forward with anticipation to hearing the views and contributions of Deputies on all sides of the House as the debate on the Bill progresses. Even though the odds could be a little against us, I look forward very much to being able to complete Second Stage before the Dáil rises at Christmas. That would be a matter on which I would seek the agreement of Members on all sides of the House, although I am aware there are constraints in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1260">It would be remiss of me not to say a word about the soldiers some of whom have left and others who are about to leave for the mission in Liberia. I was grateful to my colleagues in the House last week for their unanimous support and the good will towards each and every one of those soldiers on this mission, which is not without risk. We have tried by every means at our disposal to cover the risks in terms of the preparatory work put in place before these soldiers leave, the equipment and facilities provided but above all in the provision of medical and other facilities about which many Members have spoken publicly and privately. In respect of every recommendation we received from the Chief of Staff and every facility sought, we have gone to every possible length to make sure they are met. I wish each and every one of those soldiers a safe trip and I pray that they will all return safely to their families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1261">The proposed legislation fulfils a commitment made some years ago. I hope the intervening period and the delay in getting it to the House have been worthwhile in the sense that Dr. Doyle's report has given us a deeper understanding of some of the problems and the kinds of solutions necessary to redress them. I believe the House has gained from that experience as opposed to the way in which we viewed this initially when we were disappointed about not seeing everything through. I am open to taking account of contributions and, in respect of any amendment proposed which I deem appropriate and sensible, I will be pleased to consider how I can accommodate such views.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262">As Minister for Defence, I have introduced legislation and a raft of new missions on a number of occasions and I have had extraordinary support and virtually unanimity on all occasions, something of which the Chief of Staff, members of the Defence Forces of all ranks and officials in my Department and myself have been most appreciative. I thank the officials in my Department who have been working on the preparation of this Bill, on the amendments that will be brought forward and on the consultative process which took place with PDFORRA and RACO. I hope the Bill is such that we almost cannot make it any better than it is and that it will work effectively in the interests of all for whom it is intended.</p>

          <p eId="para_1263">Ba mhaith liom fáilte a chur roimh an Bhille seo atá curtha i láthair an Tí ag an Aire anseo tráthnóna. Tá mé ar aon intinn leis an Aire go bhfuil sé tráthúil go bhfuil an Bille á chur i láthair na Dála ar an lá áirithe seo nuair a bhí an céiliúradh stairiúil sin anseo i mBaile Átha Cliath mar chuimhneachán ar 90 bliain ó bunaíodh Óglaigh na hÉireann. Bhí sé ina phribhléid agus ina phléisiúr agam féin agus – tá mé cinnte – ag an Teachta Sherlock bheith i láthair ag an ócáid stairiúil sin nuair a rinne muid céiliúradh ar an lá stairiúil nuair a bunaíodh iad. Nuair a bhí an tAire ag caint ar an Bhille seo, thagair sé do dhuine a rinne obair mhór agus a rinne gach iarracht go dtabharfaí Bille mar seo isteach. Is é sin John Lucey, a bhí ina rúnaí ginearálta ar PDFORRA, agus is ceart go mbeadh cuimhne againn air agus go luaifí a ainm agus an Bille seo ag dul tríd an Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_1264">The Bill first published in January 2002 provides for the establishment of the Office of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces. I welcome its introduction. One criticism is that it has taken so long for it to be debated in the Dáil. Having listened to the Minister's contribution, I wonder was it deliberately held back until this particular date.</p>

          <p eId="para_1265">No.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" eId="spk_760">
          <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
          <p eId="para_1266">If that is the case, we will forgive him for some of the delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">We cannot expect our enlisted personnel to serve under regulations, conditions and codes of discipline in the 21st century that rightly belong to the 19th century. Bearing in mind the present day emphasis on human rights and fair employment regulations, the employment conditions governing our Defence Forces must adapt to modern requirements and acceptable codes of practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268">Members of our Defence Forces operate under unique working conditions. It is only in recent years that they have been granted permission to have their own representative bodies, such as PDFORRA and RACO. While these bodies are recognised as having the right to negotiate remuneration, working conditions and such matters, they do not have the right to withdraw labour or strike. That is a vital, but probably an understandable, difference between themselves and regular trade unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1269">Many Defence Forces personnel feel they can be treated unfairly, but they have nowhere to voice their concerns apart from the military. That is like the police investigating the police. An ombudsman would allow soldiers to make complaints about their grievances to someone independent of the military, removing bias and making the process more fair. PDFORRA has been campaigning for a military ombudsman for a decade to address grievances of the military in a way that is fair to all. It is generally accepted that there are problems that have not yet been satisfactorily solved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270">The 2002 Doyle report examined harassment, discrimination, bullying and sexual harassment in the Defence Forces. Some 20% to 30% of soldiers surveyed experienced difficulty in each of these categories. They must be able to bring these concerns and grievances to an independent forum such as an ombudsman. The Doyle report also revealed that 75% of those surveyed believed that they could get away with bullying in the Defence Forces. PDFORRA accounts this to the culture the military creates and believes an ombudsman – someone outside of this culture – would be effective in dealing with this serious problem. If an ombudsman for the Defence Forces is not created, these trends may well continue and create further serious difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1271">The ombudsman system has been proven to work effectively elsewhere. The Australian defence forces, for example, have an ombudsman who helps serving soldiers, former soldiers and their family members to bring their grievances to an independent forum. This system has dealt with more than 800 grievances when attempts to deal with them within the Australian defence forces had failed. Due to existing codes of discipline and chains of command, it is difficult to have a personal grievance objectively investigated. An enlisted person with a legitimate complaint may only have recourse to his commanding officer. It takes courage to go higher up the command chain, which results in many grievances and complaints being buried or overlooked.</p>
          <p eId="para_1272">The Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill is tailored to address these difficulties. The Bill will create an ombudsman to be appointed by the President on the recommendation of the Government. The length of term for the ombudsman may not exceed seven years and is fixed in the instrument of appointment. The ombudsman, rightly, may not be a Member of the Oireachtas, a Member of the European Parliament, a civil servant, a member of the Defence Forces or a member of a local authority. The mandatory retirement age for the ombudsman would be established by regulations promulgated by the Minister for Defence. The Minister for Defence, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, sets the compensation for the ombudsman as well as pension benefits, if any. However, any regulation promulgated by the Minister for Defence that regulates the ombudsman and his office must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas for 21 sitting days, during which time either House may pass a resolution of disapproval voiding it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">This is the fourth ombudsman office to be established in the State. The Ombudsman Act 1980 established the first such office. In 2002, the Pensions Ombudsman was appointed under Part 3 of the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002. The appointment of the office of the Ombudsman for Children has been covered in the Ombudsman for Children Act 2002. It is interesting to compare the powers, responsibilities and limitations of each office. Unlike the proposed ombudsman for the Defence Forces, the Cabinet has less power over the State Ombudsman. The President appoints the State Ombudsman on the recommendation of a concurrent resolution between the Dáil and Seanad, not on the recommendation of the Government, as is the case in this Bill. It is the Ombudsman Act 1980, not a Minister, that fixes the retirement age and compensation of the Ombudsman. He or she, apart from resigning on reaching retirement age, may be removed from office by the President in case of misbehaviour, incapacity or bankruptcy, if the Dáil and Seanad so recommend. The ombudsman for the Defence Forces can be removed in a similar manner, except in cases of misbehaviour, incapacity or bankruptcy, if the decision is made by the Government and both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">The vital difference between the two offices is that the President is omitted from consultation in the case of the Defence Forces ombudsman. Except for the aforementioned differences and their respective different fields of authority, the Ombudsman is similar to the Defence Forces ombudsman in the manner in which he or she carries out investigations. However, the Ombudsman Act 1980 does not contain the various accountability provisions, including requirements and provisions for appearing before committees of the Oireachtas found in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1275">The Ombudsman for Children Act 2002 established the position of Ombudsman for Children. The President appoints the Ombudsman for Children on the nomination of the Dáil and Seanad. The term of office is set at six years and the retirement age is fixed at 67 years. The President can remove the Ombudsman for Children for due cause, provided it is among those laid out in the statute, with the prior approval of the Dáil and Seanad. Similar to the proposed Defence Forces ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman, the Minister for Health and Children, with the consent of the Minister for Finance, determines the compensation for the Ombudsman for Children. The major difference between the provisions of this Bill and those establishing the previous three ombudsmen offices lies in the age of retirement. In the previous three Bills, the age of retirement is set at 67 years, whereas in this Bill it may be set by the Minister for Defence. Why is this Bill different in this respect?</p>
          <p eId="para_1276">We must compare the proposed Defence Forces ombudsman to those established in other western democracies, such as Canada, the United States, France, Portugal and Spain. The mandate and powers of the ombudsman for the Canadian defence forces are laid out in departmental and administrative orders and directives. Its mandate is to be a neutral sounding board and mediator of Canada's Department of National Defence and the Canadian defence forces, provide information and referral for existing methods of redress within the Canadian defence forces and assist in making long-term improvement in the welfare of employees and members of the Canadian national defence and defence forces community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1277">There are numerous differences in how the Canadian ombudsman and the proposed Defence Forces ombudsman are able to investigate complaints. Whereas the latter may investigate specific cases when the normal means of dispute resolution fail to satisfy the complainant, the former investigates complaints to review the existing process for handling complaints to ensure that the process is fair. However, the Canadian defence forces ombudsman can hear complaints from a much larger range of people than the Irish Defence Forces ombudsman. In matters relating to the Canadian forces, those eligible to file complaints with the Canadian ombudsman include current and former cadets, members of the Canadian forces, employees, applicants to the Canadian forces and family members of any of the preceding.</p>
          <p eId="para_1278">Although a wide array of assistance is offered to its troops, the United States has no centralised ombudsman dedicated to its armed forces. The closest the US has to a defence forces ombudsman is in the Department of Veterans' Affairs, which has an ombudsman to handle complaints concerning he customer service system for the Board of Veterans' Affairs. The limited scope of this ombudsman and the fact that his work only involves former members of the armed forces make this position too unlike the proposed Defence Forces ombudsman to warrant any further comparison.</p>
          <p eId="para_1279">The United Kingdom, although it has no ombudsman dedicated to the armed forces, has a central ombudsman entitled the parliamentary ombudsman. The parliamentary ombudsman, with whom the UK Ministry of Defence has agreed to co-operate, is charged with investigating maladministration in the British Government, including the Ministry of Defence. France, Spain and Portugal all have ombudsmen, of various titles and powers, whose scope covers most, if not all, of central government activity. They are generally able to receive and investigate complaints from people and have the powers necessary to investigate these complaints and make recommendations to remedy them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">Considering these other Government ombudsmen, both inside and outside Ireland, several improvements to the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill may be advisable. The Bill as it stands gives the Government considerable sway over the Defence Forces ombudsman, including nominating the ombudsman, setting his or her compensation, setting the length of his or her term and setting the mandatory retirement age. It would be prudent to grant the ombudsman more independence from the Government. This can be achieved by making the Defence Forces ombudsman more like the 1980 Ombudsman by fixing in the Bill one or more of the following: compensation, term length or retirement age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281">The Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill can gain from the example of the Canadian ombudsman by expanding the range of those eligible to file complaints. Currently, the Bill places strict limits on who can file complaints. Expanding this right to other people related to the Defence Forces, whether cadets, families or members of the Defence Forces, would help guarantee that the rights of these groups are protected. Apart from these shortcomings, I welcome the introduction of the Bill. When enacted it must address such grievances as harassment, bullying and any others that need to be resolved. At present there are difficulties in the Air Corps, as we do not have crewed search and rescue services in the north-west. Such grievances could be handled by the ombudsman when the Bill is enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">I agree with the Minister that we have been well served by our defence personnel since the foundation of the State. We can be proud of their achievements at home and abroad. We know they have acquitted themselves very well on the many peacekeeping missions they have carried out in different parts of the world. The Minister said he hopes that those departing for Liberia have a safe passage there. We all hope they will also have a safe passage home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">My party will give the Minister every assistance in processing the Bill through the House as soon as possible because it is long overdue. It will improve the working climate and conditions in the Defence Forces. It is vital to have good relations between all the ranks and sections in the Defence Forces.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeSherlock" eId="spk_761">
          <from>Mr. Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_1284">Aontaím lena dúirt an tAire faoi John Lucey, nach maireann, agus an meas a bhí againn go léir air. The Labour Party welcomes the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Bill 2002. The Bill, when enacted, will provide a formal framework to deal with the issues of bullying, harassment, discrimination and sexual harassment in the Defence Forces. These are issues that can arise in any workplace whether it is a business, commercial or voluntary organisation. These issues are not confined to the Defence Forces, but clearly there are procedures and structures within the military which can lend themselves to a culture of harassment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">The Bill is good, but the delay in bringing it to this stage raises many questions. The Government's procrastination in bringing the Bill to the Chamber has also been raised by PDFORRA, whose general secretary Gerry Rooney said at its annual delegate conference in Waterford:</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">We believe it is imperative to appoint an Ombudsman as part of the overall process of dealing with the issues raised by Dr. Doyle. We are somewhat concerned about the present delay.</p>
          <p eId="para_1287">It is vital that the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is created as soon as possible. However, in the Estimates, not one red cent was allocated to establish the ombudsman's office. The Labour Party does not believe the office will be up and running during 2004.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelSmith" eId="spk_762" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
          <from>Mr. M. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_1288">Yes, it will.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeSherlock" eId="spk_763">
          <from>Mr. Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_1289">This is an inexcusable delay and the Minister needs to explain to the House how he proposes to fund this very necessary post and when he expects the office to be functioning.</p>
          <p eId="para_1290">Dr. Eileen Doyle, in the Dignity at Work – the Challenge of Workplace Bullying report, revealed the startling levels of bullying, harassment and sexual harassment in the Defence Forces. This damning report was presented in March 2002 and yet, at the end of 2003, only some of the recommendations have been implemented, including the establishment of an independent monitoring group to oversee the implementation of the reforms. An equality steering group has been established and a confidential help-line has been made available to the Defence Forces since April 2002. However, where is the ombudsman? Where is the funding in the Estimates to establish this very necessary post?</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">Dr. Doyle's report found that 34.7% of women and 26.6% of men in the forces have suffered harassment. Of these, 39.4% of women and 39.3% of men thought about leaving the military following their ordeals. Each day that passes without the appointment of an ombudsman is another day that those men and women are neglected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292">Those of us who have read that report are aware of and have been horrified by the examples of abuse that have been allowed to continue and have been tolerated, particularly when that abuse is targeted at those who, in one well-publicised example, were trying to raise legitimate concerns about safety equipment. There is also the case of the former "star" of a navy recruitment campaign, who was dismissed from the Naval Service after she was diagnosed as a coeliac. Ms Maria Fitzgerald, who successfully completed 158 days of tough training, was the face of the naval campaign before she embarked on a legal case against her dismissal, which was recently upheld by the Supreme Court. While the Naval Service may have been justified legally in discharging Ms Fitzgerald, was it morally justified in its decision? This is particularly hard to justify if reports of other navy personnel suffering the same condition being allowed to continue serving are correct. This would have been a case for the military ombudsman; instead, Ms Fitzgerald was obliged to take her case through the courts. What message does this case send out to those with health problems, many of whom are doing fine jobs in all walks of life in our society?</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">The participation of women in the Defence Forces is another issue that needs to be investigated. Women currently make up a paltry 4.6% of military personnel. In the 12 years since women were recruited into the military, the highest rank attained by a woman is that of lieutenant colonel. Are there particular barriers preventing women from participating more fully in the Defence Forces? Is there a macho mentality in our forces which is discriminating against female recruits? The enforcement of an anti-sexual harassment policy in the military is as imperative as the enforcement of the same policies for the civilian population.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">While speaking about barriers, it is important to highlight the failure of the military to promote soldiers from within the military rank and file to the officer corps. In other countries ordinary soldiers have far better promotional opportunities open to them. The demarcation and glass ceiling that exists between enlisted and commissioned personnel in the Defence Forces is an injustice that should not be tolerated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">In her foreword to the report, Challenge of a Workplace, Dr. Doyle said that the creation and development of a friendly workplace environment must be the aspiration of any manager. She said a hostile environment disables human endeavour and contributes nothing but pain and suffering. According to her, the human response is sometimes expressed in low morale, absenteeism, distrust, unwillingness to name the suffering, unresolved anger and a determination for vengeance of some kind, whether on individuals or on the organisation. There is a sense of urgency in her foreword, yet despite the Bill being presented by the Minister for Defence in January 2002, it is only coming before the House in November 2003. If the political will had existed, the legislation could have been enacted sooner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">Members will agree that it is laudable of the monitoring group to develop confidential help lines, a counselling service and to engage in training and an equality audit of various Defence Forces regulations and instructions. We do not have the full implementation of legislation, regulations and administrative instructions, practices and procedures to ensure bullying is dealt with and eradicated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1297">PDFORRA welcomes the introduction of a new Defence Forces instruction, A7, which sets out both formal and informal procedures for dealing with complaints of bullying, harassment and sexual harassment. We must deal with the issues highlighted by the Doyle report as part of the development of a better and more effective Defence Forces. It is our duty to uphold principles of best practice and ensure those who serve our country – those who are currently on peacekeeping duty in Liberia and elsewhere – feel proud to serve the Irish nation. Instead, it may appear to these brave men and women that their interests are not shared and prioritised by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">The delay in bringing the Bill to this Stage and the fact that no money was provided in the Estimates sends a clear message to the Defence Forces that they do not rate high on the Government's list of priorities. The prompt processing of this legislation will show members of the Defence Forces that the Oireachtas takes these issues seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_1299">While we broadly welcome the Bill, it is important to stress that serious deficiencies can no longer be ignored and must be addressed. These include the fact that no funds were earmarked for the ombudsman in the Estimates. When will the Government tackle the glaring inconsistencies that exist within the Defence Forces?</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">As citizens, we are afforded rights and privileges, rights fought for us by our forefathers. The members of the Defence Forces should not lose their basic rights when they put on a uniform. While legislative systems to deal with disputes have been developed, important issues still have to be addressed in the area of industrial relations, particularly in regard to the Defence Forces. When will the Government realise that such benefits would be for the good of all? Until the Government recognises the need for a strong trade union movement, sections of our society, in this case members of our Defence Forces, will continue to lose out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">Deputy Rabbitte raised this issue recently at a PDFORRA conference. He highlighted the importance of the organisation being represented at the ICTU. He said he had never understood this prejudice against the existence of representative bodies and, since that has been conceded, against there being any form of association with the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1302">By not allowing PDFORRA to sit in on partnership talks, the organisation has no say on pay negotiations and other issues which are negotiated at national level. What message is being sent to the young men and women who are keen to join up and serve their country? Would we expect those embarking on any other career to enter into the workplace without any effective policies and procedures to protect them? The Labour Party does not. We should not expect or tolerate it for those who are assigned to protect and defend our nation. What is there to fear from reform? The Labour Party demands equitable treatment for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303">There has been a radical change in attitude to the Defence Forces in recent years. Critics of the establishment of PDFORRA claimed its formation in 1990 would be a threat to good order and discipline among the Defence Forces rank and file. This did not happen. The Bill would be more relevant if it included granting our citizens in uniform the right to join a trade union, to have membership of congress and the right to take industrial action in certain circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304">Concerns have also been raised by PDFORRA about the use of military law in some parts of the country. The organisation questioned the military authorities' use of the disciplinary code to deny its members their civil rights. Mr. Rooney from PDFORRA said recently that it is concerned about the use of military disciplinary procedures to essentially deny soldiers their civil rights. In a recent case, a PDFORRA member was charged under military law for submitting a subsistence claim, which was disputed in technical terms. Was this not a mere administrative disagreement which did not warrant the rigours of military law? This issue was raised, not because PDFORRA does not support military law, but because the organisation felt it was being used as a bullying tactic. An issue such as this would ideally be dealt with by a military ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">There is widespread concern about the future of the Air Corps amid fears of downsizing. How can one downsize an organisation which is already operating at minimum capacity? Any further reductions would be a false economy. As soon as the general election was out of the way, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, advised the Minister for Defence, Deputy Smith, to make cuts in Defence Forces expenditure. The long-awaited order for five medium-lift helicopters was cancelled.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_1309">I extend to the Ceann Comhairle my sincere thanks for giving me the opportunity to raise this important issue at this late hour. I am extremely concerned, as is the Ceann Comhairle, at the loss of 38 jobs in Kingscourt. Both of us know many of the employees. They are extremely disappointed, to say the least, by the decision of the management of Horseware Products Limited to cease operations in Kingscourt immediately prior to Christmas. I understand from Councillor Clifford Kelly, who has spoken to some of the factory's employees, that staff learned yesterday of the management's decision to close the facility. It came without warning and was totally unexpected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310">It is devastating at any time for a person to lose his or her job, but to lose one's employment at Christmas adds to the pain. Horseware Products Limited was established in 1985 and had its principal manufacturing base in Dundalk. The Kingscourt facility commenced operations in the mid-1990s. The plant has a dedicated and diligent workforce of almost 40 employees. Great credit is due to all involved in Horseware Products Limited on the successful development of a range of horse blankets. The company's product innovation and design has made it a world leader. I have expressed my grave concern to Mr. Jim Mulcahy, regional manager of Enterprise Ireland, and I wish to express it to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, through the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1311">Horseware Products Limited has been an extremely important employer, particularly for females, in the Kingscourt area. The closure of this factory is all the more unexpected when one considers that it was extended and saw a substantial investment in new technology relatively recently. I understand that some employees may be offered employment in Dundalk which is 25 miles from Kingscourt. This is not a practical option for everybody as many of the employees have young children. Employment such a distance from home would cause considerable strain on some individuals. I make the strongest possible appeal to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, her Department and the industrial development agencies to make every possible effort to retain the current employment in Kingscourt. Such a course should be pursued immediately and as vigorously as possible with the management of Horseware Products Limited.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312">If their efforts are unsuccessful, I emphasise to the Minister that we must secure a replacement industry as quickly as possible. Mr. Vincent Reynolds, chief executive of Cavan County Enterprise Board, and I have discussed the difficulties facing the Horseware Products employees. We are both of the view that employment, predominantly of females, at this factory is essential to Kingscourt, the factory's employees and their families.</p>

It employs 170 people, 150 of whom work in Ireland. The company designs and manufactures some of the world's leading brands of horse blankets and exports most of its production to Europe and the USA. Increased competition in the marketplace and the increasing cost base in Ireland means Horseware Products is being forced to restructure its operations. This will involve the closure of the Kingscourt plant at which it employs 36 people and consolidation of all activity in Dundalk. Some staff members in Kingscourt will move to Dundalk and overall there will be approximately 30 redundancies in the group. The business itself is strong and a return to growth and profitability is expected next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">Enterprise Ireland is actively working with the company to grow its business. The full range of FÁS services are being made available to the workers affected by the closure. Enterprise Ireland continues to work with companies in County Cavan to help them grow their sales and exports and improve innovation to enable them to compete in world markets. Enterprise Ireland has focused on the production of building and construction materials as a targeted sector for Cavan and is endeavouring to expand the existing cluster of companies in the county. In November 2002, Abbott Laboratories, the Chicago-based health care company, announced plans to expand its nutritional manufacturing plant at Cootehill, County Cavan. The expansion is being supported by Enterprise Ireland and will lead to the creation of 100 new jobs over the next three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">Enterprise Ireland supports infrastructure creation for new enterprises through its community enterprise centre programme. The agency has helped fund the establishment of six enterprise centres in Cavan. In September 2003, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment announced that the Bailieboro development centre had successfully secured €240,000 for phase 2 of construction of its enterprise centre. IDA Ireland has 42 acres of land at Cavan Business Park, which is being upgraded. The principal focus of IDA Ireland's marketing is the recently vacated 23,745 sq. ft. building at the business park.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317">I must point out that regional development is a significant focus of Government policy. Its importance has been confirmed in the current national development plan and the national spatial strategy. The strategy addresses the continuing concentration of population and economic activity along the eastern seaboard, especially in the greater Dublin area, with a view to achieving balanced regional development throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318">I have heard what Deputy Brendan Smith had to say and I will report his comments to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>

        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_768">
          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_1319">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important issue. It is hugely disappointing that neither the Minister for Transport nor his Minister of State is in the House and that the Minister of State with responsibility for housing is replying to the matter I raise. The Government has singularly failed to ensure that social and economic development is balanced across the regions. The Government's regional policy, such as it is, has been completely self serving with the result that many regions, including the mid-west, have not fully shared in balanced development.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320">The Government has utterly failed to address the new challenges faced by Shannon Airport. The airport has a critical role to play as a catalyst for the development not only of the mid-west but the entire western seaboard. The EU decision to open negotiations with the USA on the open skies policy has again raised the issue of Shannon's dual gateway status. Fine Gael believes the status must be retained to ensure that we have some semblance of regional development. It is clear that the Government does not take the same view. The Government has drafted a paper in which it proposes the winding down of the dual gateway status over a three-year period. The reasoning behind this is that Aer Lingus seeks direct flights to Dublin which would increase the value of the company in the privatisation the Minister has planned. It is sought to maximise the funds generated from the sale of Aer Lingus as these can then be used to buy the next election. It was bad enough to buy the last one.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321">The European Union has no difficulty with the USA and Ireland negotiating to protect the dual gateway status of Shannon Airport. In the United Kingdom, Heathrow Airport has special status which demonstrates the acceptability of this practice. To date, the Minister has done nothing but dither with the result that we have no plans in respect of the future of the dual gateway at Shannon Airport. What impact will the removal of the dual gateway status have on the future of an independent Shannon Airport? There will be a loss of up to €10 million per annum with the falling off in transatlantic passenger numbers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1322">Last week the Minister stated that Shannon Airport caters for passenger numbers in excess of two million and will be able to generate sufficient funds to keep its capital investment going. The difficulty is that Shannon Airport must carry out significant capital investment on an ongoing basis. If it loses the passenger numbers on transatlantic flights, it will not be able to generate sufficient funds for re-investment in the airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_1323">Has there been an economic analysis of the dual gateway and the impact its abolition could have on the western seaboard? Has any business plan for the finance of the airport been developed should the dual gateway be removed? The Minister has been developing policy as he goes along. Will the State provide any subvention for capital investments required at the airport in the coming years such as the upgrading of the 50 year old runway?</p>
          <p eId="para_1324">No commitment has been given to date on the security of loans should Shannon Airport become an independent entity under the State umbrella. Last Thursday the Minister stated that the current legislation and protection for Aer Rianta in regard to capital investment would remain. That would mean that Dublin Airport's debt would be secured by the Government but it would not impact on any future loans which Cork or Shannon Airports would take on. This would have a detrimental effect on the viability of Shannon Airport.</p>
          <p eId="para_1325">The Minister is humming and hawing on this issue. He has yet to make a firm commitment on the future of Shannon, on what investment is required, on how capital investment will be generated at Shannon and on the future plans for the dual gateway status at Shannon Airport. These are all critical issues. The Minister has not been prepared to give any detail. The only thing he has said to date – again, it was last Thursday – was in the context of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report when he said there was too much financial pressure on the company and that Shannon Airport cannot stand alone. I would like answers on what will be done to ensure Shannon Airport is viable and that we have a decent regional development policy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_769">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1326">The Minister for Transport has spoken in the House about this issue several times recently, including several replies to parliamentary questions this month, and, as the Deputy said, it was discussed last Thursday. As far as the issue raised by Deputy Naughten is concerned, the situation is as already mentioned by the Minister in his recent replies. However, I will restate the position. I will begin by outlining the background to this matter before replying to the specific point.</p>
          <p eId="para_1327">The European Court of Justice ruled on 5 November 2002 on a case taken by the European Commission against eight member states, not including Ireland, on those states' open skies agreements with the US. The court ruled that the designation of national airlines in those member states' bilateral air transport agreements is contrary to the right of establishment provided for under the treaties establishing the European Union. This means that member states must allow any European airline established in their country to enjoy the benefits of that member state's bilateral agreements. This legal principle applies to each member state's bilaterals with every third country, not just with the US.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328">In response to the court's ruling, the European Commission re-activated a proposal to give it a mandate to negotiate an open aviation area agreement with the USA. This was a long-standing proposal and the Minister considered that it was only a matter of time before such a mandate would be given to the Commission. Under the mandate, the EU and US territories would be treated as a single aviation area. Such an open aviation area agreement between the EU and US would satisfactorily solve the legal problems highlighted by the court in regard to the US and is a pragmatic response to the difficulty of up to 15, and shortly 25, member states having simultaneously to change their agreements with the US in an integrated way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1329">The mandate put forward by the Commission envisages a liberalised regime in which airlines may operate services in both Europe and the US as well as between them. The intention is that European and US airlines are not constrained as to the destinations to which they fly, just as they are not so constrained within Europe today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1330">Other issues also arose during discussion on that mandate, such as the implications that an EU-US agreement would have for relations with third countries other than the USA and whether member states could continue to negotiate changes to their agreements with third countries on a bilateral basis. These were all taken into account when the Transport Council took its decision on this whole issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1331">Coming to the issue of the Minister's position on the dual gateway status of Shannon Airport, wider considerations must be taken into account, especially the opportunities for new business for Ireland currently not being exploited due to the limitation on the number of US destinations open to Irish airlines when deciding on this issue. Other considerations include the position of Aer Lingus and other Irish airlines, the position of the new board designate of Shannon Airport as well as the position of the unions representing the airport staff. Needless to say, the impact on the surrounding region must also be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1332">As the Minister for Transport has said, change in this area is inevitable. Whatever change there is must be introduced on a phased basis and must run in tandem with the putting in place of a package of measures that will be equally beneficial for Shannon. That package of measures will relate to such issues as the continuity and stability of air services through Shannon Airport, especially by Aer Lingus but by other carriers also, the maximisation of the airport's catchment area through surface transport improvements and the establishment of Shannon Airport as an independent commercial airport with a top quality board and management.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333">Officials from the Department of Transport are currently engaging on the Minister's behalf with the trade unions representing airport staff, and the Minister will shortly consult the new board designate of Shannon Airport. The Minister has said it is his intention to authorise officials to engage in bilateral negotiations, under his supervision, with their US counterparts on the Ireland-US bilateral agreement. Only when those consultations with the board designate and with the unions are concluded will the Minister finally be in a position to decide on the next steps.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_770">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_1334">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the manner in which the policy framework and guidelines for best practice regarding Traveller accommodation, as per the standards set down by the national Traveller accommodation unit of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, are being implemented in general and specifically in County Clare, the monitoring mechanisms for compliance with these standards and the procedures to be taken when they are ignored or breached. I am not talking about compliance with local planning but about compliance with the standards set down by the national Traveller accommodation unit of the Department. I also wish to ask about the Department's compliance with its own standards and what procedures are in place when they are breached.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335">For years I have been trying to get something done about the scandalous condition of the transit accommodation for Travellers in Carrowbrowne on the Headford Road but the attitude among the local authorities responsible and others is that it is perfectly acceptable to have broken windows and tiles. They give the impression that there is no point doing anything different. This question is not answered by saying it is a matter for the local authorities. It is a matter for the Department and the Minister. It is a disgrace to the Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336">What do I mean by saying the local authority departs from the standards laid down by the Department's unit? I mean that a local authority has not produced a design brief, that it has not had consultation with the prospective tenants or occupants, that the council's policies do not embody inclusion and the social circumstances of the people who will occupy the accommodation and that the designs in regard to the surrounding area are not a matter of consultation with those who will live in the accommodation being provided. I also mean it specifically with regard to such practical matters as the thickness and height of walls, the attempts at exclusion and the hiding of accommodation from view.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337">What does the Department do when the designs on offer do not comply with the minimum best practice standards in the Department but are argued to have complied with the lesser and different standards within the planning process? What does it do when the houses do not meet tenants' requirements or are frequently built with toxic and non-environmentally sensitive building materials? What does it do when the houses have very little space around them or when some have thick, high reinforced boundary walls? What does it do when there is an obsession with hiding the accommodation from public view or when little attempt is made to take account of cultural integration or relationships between Travellers and those in the settled community? Why does the Department correctly vet the standards applicable to a social housing scheme or a pre-school but does not do so with regard to the proposals made by way of design for the kind of accommodation I mention? Is it so different or of less value to warrant this approach? What do these different standards tell us?</p>
          <p eId="para_1338">Who is responsible for the design and the accommodation in these circumstances? What if construction goes ahead on the basis of an appreciation that some accommodation is better than none? How can we justify lesser standards, lesser accountability, lesser monitoring and no attempt to deliver the provisions in accordance with the standards set by the Department? These dwellings breach social housing standards, most of the Department's criteria on site selection and all of the procedures on consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1339">Some of those interested in these issues have written to the Taoiseach, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. They have received an acknowledgement that the matter is under investigation but have received no answer to any of the questions I have raised.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_771">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1340">It is important that accommodation provided for Travellers should meet modern standards and requirements. My Department has issued four sets of guidelines on aspects of Traveller accommodation since 1999 in order to reinforce this approach. They were issued on the advice of, and in consultation with, the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee and they cover the design of permanent, temporary and transient halting sites as well as the design of group houses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1341">The guidelines are intended to assist local authorities in providing a reasonable standard of accommodation to Travellers at a reasonable cost. They set out for local authorities guiding principles on selecting suitable sites for halting sites and group houses. They also include advice on minimum standards of accommodation and on meeting fire safety and emergency requirements. They are intended to facilitate local authorities in making decisions specific to their own particular local circumstances. Local authorities utilise the advice in the guidelines to ensure that the design, site selection, planning, environmental, technical and social aspects are appropriate for the provision of accommodation for Travellers in each case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1342">Local authorities, in preparing Traveller specific accommodation proposals, are required to consult with the prospective Traveller tenants regarding each development. They must also comply with the public notice procedures of Part 8 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001. The guidelines also advise local authorities to consider what further measures may be desirable to inform local residents about proposals to provide Traveller accommodation schemes in their areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343">The Department's role with regard to Traveller accommodation is to ensure that there is an adequate legislative and financial framework in place within which local authorities can provide accommodation for Travellers. In assessing projects, regard is had to the guidelines and any local issues which an authority considers relevant. Where proposals are not considered appropriate having regard to the particular situations, funding is not provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344">Clare County Council has adopted a significant programme for the provision of Traveller specific accommodation. The council has recently completed a permanent Traveller specific accommodation scheme at Ballymaley. It also has schemes under construction in Ballaghfadda, Clarecastle, Deerpark, Ennistymon and Beechpark, Ennis. These schemes will give a total of 24 new units of permanent Traveller specific accommodation. In addition, the council is actively seeking other sites in order to complete its programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345">It is expected that the outturn expenditure by Clare County Council on the provision of Traveller specific accommodation in 2003 will be over €5 million. It is looked on as being one of the more active local authorities in this area.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_772">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_1346">That does not answer my question.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_773">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1347">This expenditure reflects the concerted approach by the council to meet those needs. I listened to the Deputy's questions but I may not be able to give him the kind of answers he seeks now. Sometimes when sites are hidden from public view this is probably an effort to build and develop a relationship with local settled communities and to get them to have a more reasonable and accepting approach. Life is not always as clear cut as we might like it to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_1348">In addition to providing Traveller specific accommodation, housing is provided for Travellers in standard local authority accommodation. However, the Deputy's concerns are with the specific accommodation sites. The Department will continue to consider proposals for the funding of projects submitted by Clare County Council, and other local authorities, for the provision of Traveller specific accommodation. In this context, with the involvement of the national Traveller accommodation consultative committee. we are reviewing the operation of the Housing (Traveller Accommodation) Act 1998 with a view to ensuring that progress continues to be made on the implementation of Traveller accommodation programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349">I took note of some of the specific points made by the Deputy. I am surprised by them, particularly with regard to County Clare. While there has been confrontation on many matters, it is considered that an active programme is under way in the county. I will come back to the Deputy directly on some of the other points he has raised.</p>

        <heading>Environmental Pollution.</heading>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_775">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_1351">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this matter of serious concern. The Minister for State wears several hats on behalf of the Government. One seems to be Minister of State with responsibility for Adjournment debates. In his role as Minister for State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government I ask him to convey to the Minister my serious concern about the issue I will now outline.</p>
          <p eId="para_1352">On 30 May 2002, 13 days after I was elected to this House, a pollution incident occurred on the grounds of GlaxoSmithKline Beecham in Currabinny, Carrigaline, County Cork. It occurred when a toxic by-product was being disposed of in an on-site incinerator on the company's grounds. A chemical reaction took place when steam connected with the materials in the fire chambers, resulting in the release of 2.4 kg of a substance known as dimethylsulphate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1353">The company did not inform any of the State agencies responsible for environmental protection or the health and safety of the workforce at the plant. The information that this incident occurred was made available by a worker at the plant to the Health and Safety Authority, which then instituted court proceedings. The Environmental Protection Agency became aware of the incident through the Health and Safety Authority and initiated its own District Court proceedings. These were heard in June 2003. This was the first public acknowledgement that a serious pollution incident had occurred at this site.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354">As a constituency Deputy, I wrote to the Environmental Protection Agency and asked why it did not publicly confirm such incidents. It gave me the hollow excuse that it felt that subsequent prosecutions might be compromised. We do not hear such an argument when ordinary crimes are being prosecuted. I received an undertaking that the agency would review its proceedings on this matter, but we have to wait to see if that will come to pass.</p>
          <p eId="para_1355">The Health and Safety Authority managed last week to secure a prosecution of the company in the Circuit Court under the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 1989, as a result of which a fine of €15,000 was imposed. This was the first time that the details of the pollution occurrence were made public. The EPA prosecution related only to a breach of the company's IPC licence. It should be noted that it has been reported today that 30% of IPC licences issued by the EPA have been breached. The Minister and the Department will have to address this matter in another way. The fact that it has taken almost 18 months for a full public revelation of this serious pollution incident is a serious indictment of our environmental protection laws. The Health and Safety Authority said that the incident could have been fatal if the exposure had lasted any longer. The agencies involved do not seem to be responsible for ensuring that the public is made aware of incidents such as this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1356">The RTE journalist, Mr. Tom MacSweeney, who presents the "Seascapes" radio programme which deals with maritime issues, has followed up this issue. He asked the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government why certain information was not made publicly available, but he was told that the matter was not its responsibility. He asked this question of Cork County Council, which is a major player in the Cork major emergency plan, but it said that it was not aware of the problem until the second court case took place last week. He contacted the Environmental Protection Agency, but it said that the company had not informed it of the matter, even though the agency was involved in a prosecution at District Court level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1357">There is a very serious flaw in the existing legislation in this area. This flaw will be exacerbated because of the policies of the Minister, Deputy Cullen, who not only feels that this type of waste disposal should be continued by the various companies that hold integrated pollution licences, but also thinks that there should be larger-scale waste disposal of toxic materials in the area where the establishment of a national toxic incinerator has been proposed. When incidents of this type occur, how are the people of my constituency supposed to have confidence in the environmental protection measures that exist, in the agencies that are meant to promote them and in the proposal for a waste disposal incinerator?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelAhern" eId="spk_776">
          <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_1358">I thank Deputy Boyle for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity to address this issue on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Cullen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1359">I am aware of media reports on 20 November last that a major pharmaceutical company was prosecuted by the National Authority for Occupational Health and Safety following the release into the workplace of a carcinogenic material. The prosecution was apparently brought after an incident that occurred on 30 May 2002. The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, whose Department sponsors the National Authority for Occupational Health and Safety, is responsible for legislation relating to health and safety in the workplace. I understand that this legislation sets out requirements in respect of emergency situations. Not only must the company in question comply with its health and safety in the workplace obligations, but it must also comply with the requirements of the integrated pollution control licences it holds in respect of the facility.</p>
          <p eId="para_1360">The operation of the IPC licensing system, including its enforcement, is a matter for the Environmental Protection Agency and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, who is legally precluded from becoming involved in cases which fall under the agency's remit. Deputies will appreciate that I cannot go into the detail of the case. I understand that in May 2003 the agency successfully prosecuted the company on foot of the incident in question. The EPA is committed to transparency in its operations and to making appropriate information available to the public in a timely manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1361">I would like to speak about legislation for which my Department is responsible. The Protection of the Environment Act which was enacted earlier this year contains important new provisions. It requires that the EPA cannot grant an IPC licence if it is not satisfied that the necessary measures will be taken to prevent accidents and, where an accident occurs, to limit and remedy its consequences. The Act requires the EPA to include in licences conditions specifying the measures to be taken in the event of an accident and obliges the operator to inform it without delay of any accident significantly affecting the environment. Work is under way on the necessary secondary legislation to bring these and other provisions into effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1362">The new directive on access to information on the environment, which was agreed earlier this year, was supported by Ireland. It requires member states to take measures by February 2005 to ensure that all information held by public authorities, which could assist those likely to be affected by an imminent threat to human health or the environment, must be disseminated without delay in such an event. This will strengthen significantly the law in this area. The Office of Environmental Enforcement was launched last month as a distinct and dedicated unit of the Environmental Protection Agency. It is backed up by stronger legislation and it will bring a new and enhanced focus to the enforcement of Ireland's environmental legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1363">The Dáil adjourned at 11.05 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Wednesday, 26 November 2003.</p>

          <p eId="para_1366">The Garda youth diversion project scheme is a community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiative which seeks to divert young persons from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social or criminal behaviour. It provides suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects. The projects also contribute to improving the quality of life in communities and enhancing relations between the Garda and the communities. I am committed to their continuing development and, as resources permit, their expansion. There has been a dramatic expansion in project numbers in recent years, from 12 in 1997 to 64 at present. This process has been made possible, in part, by funding under the national development plan. The locations of the new projects were decided on according to local needs, prioritised by the Garda authorities in conjunction with my Department. The rapid expansion in project numbers created quality assurance challenges in respect of the projects' operation and management outcomes.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_28">My Department commissioned an evaluation report on the youth diversion projects, called Impact and Effectiveness of the Garda Special Projects. The report suggested that a set of guidelines was required to develop a planned and strategic approach. It recommended that the guidelines should set out the nature of youth crime prevention and diversion projects, the implementation structures required to deliver programmes at local level, the roles of the various stakeholders involved and the range of actions and measures appropriate to fund a good crime prevention work. In 2001 my Department commissioned the Centre for Social and Educational Research at Dublin Institute of Technology Rathmines to prepare comprehensive guidelines for the establishment, operation, management and administration of the projects. The guidelines, which were launched in May 2003, act as a benchmark against which applications for new projects will be evaluated on an ongoing basis. They should aid the establishment, operation, administration and monitoring of new and existing youth diversion projects. They set out best practice in respect of preventative activities and interventions in dealing with marginalised young people and will act as a practical aid to projects, their management committees and their co-ordinators.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_29">Funding of €5.577 million has been allocated to these and related projects in 2003. I have secured an overall increase of 9.5% in the Estimates for the Garda Síochána Vote for 2004. The continuing need to maintain discipline in the public finances, however, means that I must prioritise expenditure and so cannot increase the funding for all items of expenditure in the Vote. Consequently, the abridged Estimates volume for 2004 provides for funding of €5.318 million for the youth diversion projects, a reduction of 4.6% on the figure for 2003. Given that most of the more recently established projects incurred start up expenses in the last two years which are not expected to exist in the coming years, I am confident that all the projects can be maintained on the proposed funding allocation. It is not envisaged that additional Garda youth diversion projects will be established in the short-term. The possibility of establishing further projects in the future in light of budgetary conditions will remain.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_30">The Garda juvenile diversion programme provides that, in certain circumstances, a juvenile under 18 years of age who freely accepts responsibility for a criminal incident may be cautioned as an alternative to prosecution. The programme has proven to be highly successful in diverting young people away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families. In the more serious cases, juveniles are placed under the supervision of Garda juvenile liaison officers, who are specially trained members of the Garda Síochána responsible for administering the programme at local level. Part 4 of the Children Act 2001 introduced the concepts of restorative justice, specifically restorative cautioning and restorative conferencing, to the juvenile diversion programme. Essentially, these provisions provide for the inclusion, where appropriate and possible, of the victim, the juvenile's family and the wider stakeholding community in the process of diversion.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_31">Most Garda juvenile liaison officers have received training in mediation skills to facilitate these innovative developments. Advanced training has been provided to selected officers. Ongoing evaluation of restorative justice practice is carried out by the Garda research unit. As Garda juvenile liaison officers become more skilled in administering restorative justice, it is planned that they will be able to focus on more complex and high-risk offenders, with a view to further reducing recidivism. Decisions on the allocation of funding to the programme rest with the Garda Commissioner.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1374">I am aware of the increase in the number of claims of racial discrimination made to the equality tribunal during the past year. I assure the Deputy that the Government is committed to tackling racial discrimination in all its forms. While the increase is a cause of concern, it should be noted that it may reflect an increased understanding among the general public of equality rights and equality legislation. We should recognise that the number of claims on the race ground is growing from a low base. This will exaggerate the significance of the actual percentage increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_1375">As the Deputy may be aware, the national anti-racism awareness programme was launched in 2001 for a three-year term. The programme will have completed its term at the end of the year. As it will no longer be operating in 2004, it will not require substantial funding. Some of the expenditure allocated under the last grant scheme will come to fruition in early 2004. I have allocated €230,000 towards the programme in 2004 to pay for outstanding fees or costs relating to its activities this year. I intend that any funds left unspent from the €230,000 will be added to the amount of €335,000 which I have allocated towards the national action plan against racism, which I hope to finalise before the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1376">Funding for anti-racism initiatives comes from many Departments and combating discrimination on the ground of race is a component of the general equality framework. I should point out that the budget for the Equality Tribunal has been increased for 2004 by 3%. The reduction of 4% in the allocation for the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism is in line with the general reduction in the published Estimates. The fact that the NCCRI's funding increased substantially since it was established in 1998 can be clearly seen from the attached table. As anti-discrimination activities cover a range of activities funded across a number of subheads, I appreciate that it can be difficult to appreciate the entire funding picture.</p>
          <p eId="para_1377">As the Deputy may also be aware, I hope to publish before Christmas legislation to give effect to EU Directive 2000/43/EC. As I have indicated previously, implementation will necessitate some, mostly minor, amendments to the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the Equal Status Act 2000 because Ireland's legislation is already substantially in compliance with the directive. The Government is finalising Ireland's first report under the UN Convention on the Elimination of all forms of Racial Discrimination, which sets out the range of legislative, judicial, administrative or other measures Ireland has taken to tackle racism.</p>

          <p eId="para_1381">The cost structure of the Prison Service cannot be sustained. As the Deputy is aware, management proposals on more efficient work practices and the elimination of overtime have been put to the Prison Officers Association. I want agreement to be reached on the way forward, but if it cannot be reached the Government has approved the progressive implementation of certain cost reduction measures from 1 January 2004, including the mothballing of Fort Mitchel and the Curragh Places of Detention.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_32">If this comes into effect, it is intended that the offenders in Fort Mitchel will, in the main, be transferred to Cork and Limerick Prisons and to St. Patrick's Institution. The majority of offenders currently detained in the Curragh Place of Detention will be moved to the Midlands Prison. The newly-built block in Limerick Prison has room for up to 100 prisoners and could accommodate all of the current Fort Mitchel population of 83 prisoners. It would not be a simple case of moving the Fort Mitchel population as a unit to Limerick Prison, however, as some offenders would be more suitable for St. Patrick's Institution in Dublin. Some movement of existing prisoners from Cork Prison to Limerick Prison would also be likely, which would facilitate the placement of some of the Fort Mitchel population in Cork Prison. While the majority of offenders detained in Fort Mitchel would be moved to Limerick Prison, each case would be looked at individually to effect a transfer which is most appropriate. Staff transfers would also take place at the same time.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_33">The prisoners detained in the Curragh Place of Detention would, in the main, move to the much more modern Midlands Prison some 20 miles away. Accommodation is available there for this purpose but it has not been possible until now to bring this into operation due to the lack of available staff under existing rostering arrangements. The transfer of staff from the Curragh Place of Detention to the Midlands Prison would facilitate the commissioning of these facilities. Prisoners will not be disadvantaged by any proposed move as educational and other opportunities will be available in the more modern facilities at the new locations. The proposed mothballing of the places of detention at Fort Mitchel and the Curragh would temporarily reduce the number of spaces available to the prison service by a total of 204. This would be almost fully offset by bringing into commission the additional accommodation available in the Limerick and Midlands Prisons.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_34">I stress that I do not want to close any of our prison institutions and I reiterate that this action is not being taken lightly. If it is necessary, it will be done solely because the Irish Prison Service cannot continue to spend public money feeding an overtime culture which has gone out of control and is sustaining inefficient work practices.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1383">I do not believe there is any disagreement in the House that the cost of running the Prison Service is excessive. There is a need to bring the costs under control. I have pointed out on a number of occasions that approximately 3,200 prison officers will cost between €60 million and €65 million in overtime payments this year, while 11,900 gardaí will cost us approximately €56 million. This has developed over a long period of time and has become quite complex and difficult to resolve. We have reached a point where the problem cannot be allowed to continue. We have come through a lengthy period of analysis and the time for action has come.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_35">The Deputy has asked me to outline the main features of my proposed cost control measures for the Prison Service. There are two approaches to dealing with the range of problems facing the Prison Service – a consensus approach or a unilateral approach. I have made it clear in the House that my preference is for an agreed way forward which will be beneficial for management and staff. The Prison Service has pursued that line for some considerable time. Following five years of analysis and two years of discussions, a package of proposals for change was put to the Prison Officers Association. The package involves the proposed introduction of a new system of attendance based on the concept of annual hours combined with the introduction of a range of efficiencies recommended by an expert group, the staffing and operations review team, which examined operational practices in every prison and place of detention in the country.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_36">The 2004 Estimates for the prison service provide for €203 million to fund staff costs which reflects the projected cost of the package proposed. I will not adopt a unilateral approach lightly, but I will do so if agreement is not reached between the Prison Officers Association and the management of the prison service before the end of the year. I have been forced to consider the unilateral approach as a direct consequence of the current impasse between the management and staff sides.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_37">On 11 November 2003, the Government approved the progressive implementation of certain measures, while I will outline, with effect from 1 January 2004, in the event of a lack of agreement with the association on the proposed change agenda aimed at eliminating overtime payments and reducing other costs in the Prison Service. Staffing levels and overtime will be strictly capped at a level which will result in the annual expenditure provided for in the Estimates based on the offer made to the association. Fort Mitchel and the Curragh Place of Detention will be mothballed. A prior information notice, signalling my intention to invite tenders from contractors to provide a prisoner escort service to the prison service, will be published in the EU journal. Arrangements will be made for the transformation of the open centres at Loughan House and Shelton Abbey into post-release centres for the reintegration into society of prisoners on conditional temporary release. A competition will be held for the recruitment to a new entry level grade of prison officer.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_38">The question of whether the implementation of measures leads to an industrial dispute is not one over which an employer has full control. A dispute involves at least two sides. I have always sought to urge management and staff to address the unsustainable overtime problem in the Prison Service. At the Annual Conference of the Prison Officers Association in May 2003, I asked both sides to seek to reach an agreement on the issue within 90 days. When this failed, I agreed to the engagement of two eminent industrial relations experts, namely Mr. Bill Attley, a former General Secretary of SIPTU, and Mr. Joe McGovern, a former Assistant Secretary of the Department of Finance, to facilitate further negotiations. In mid-September, the facilitators reported back that the two sides were too far apart for the gap to be bridged at that time. An improved offer was put to the union in early October, however, based on some progress made in the talks. A ballot rejecting the offer took place during October.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_39">I remain open to an agreement being reached. As recently as last Thursday, I met national officers of the Prison Officers Association to explore how negotiations might be advanced. I found this meeting useful and I hope that progress may be made on the proposals put forward by the official side. In the absence of an agreed way forward before 1 January next, however, the Government decision of 11 November will have to be implemented.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1456">Deputies are aware of the context within which the Government decision was made to put in place cost reduction measures if agreement cannot be reached with the association on viable work practices and manning levels and the elimination of overtime. The invitation of expressions of interest from the private sector on the provision of an escort service is one of those measures. I have no desire to privatise the prison escort service. My preference is for an agreed way forward which is beneficial to management and staff. The responsibility for the choice, which must be made, rests entirely with the Prison Officers Association.</p>
          <p eId="para_1457">I have an entirely open mind on what types of firms would be able to carry out this work but I am confident that a suitable operator could be identified during a tender evaluation process.

    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_789">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_1463">The Children Act 2001 introduces a wide range of innovative measures that will provide a statutory framework for the future development of the juvenile justice system in accordance with modern thinking and best international practice. The Act also amends the Child Care Act 1991 by providing for the detention in special care units of non-offending children with challenging behaviour, establishes the Special Residential Services Board to ensure the efficient and co-ordinated delivery of services to young children in detention, and re-enacts and updates provisions in the Children Act 1908 protecting children from abuse by persons who have custody, charge or care of them. The Act is a very complex and comprehensive piece of legislation and for those reasons provisions under the Act are being implemented on a phased basis, as was envisaged at the time of enactment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1464">Responsibility for implementing the Children Act 2001 lies with three Departments, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science in respect of juvenile offending, and Health and Children in respect of children who are non-offending but out of control. The National Children's Office is co-ordinating the cross departmental aspects of the implementation of the Act.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_47">The first commencement order under the Act in respect of my Department was signed by my predecessor on 23 April 2002. The order, which came into force on 1 May 2002, provided for,inter alia: the payment of compensation by parents in respect of offences committed by their children, section 113; a court order which would require parents to exercise proper and adequate control over their children, section 114; the establishment of the Garda diversion programme on a statutory basis and the introduction of a “diversion conference”, sections 17 to 51, based on restorative justice principles as pioneered in New Zealand – to date in excess of 100 of these conferences have taken place countrywide; and (iv) the introduction of a curfew for children found guilty of offences, section 133.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_48">The position on further commencement is as set out below. It is an underlying concept of the Children Act to expand the options a court will have at its disposal when deciding on how to deal with a young offender. These options are an essential feature of the Act as they will allow effect to be given to the principle that detention for young offenders will be a last resort. Thus, the Act envisages committals to custody of young offenders being availed of only in situations where other alternative diversions and community-based options have been resorted to and have failed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_49">The successful implementation of the community based options in the Act will require a very significant input from the probation and welfare service. In this context, the probation and welfare service, as part of its planning for implementation of the Children Act 2001, engaged trainers from the Department of Child, Youth and Family, New Zealand, for the intensive training of all professional staff as facilitators for family conferences to be convened and managed in accordance with the requirements of the Act as well as providing day seminars for all probation and welfare officers. The service will provide ongoing training through its staff development unit as required.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_50">Nine additional probation and welfare officers took up duty in September 2003 and a response to other offers of appointment is awaited. It is the intention that, subject to an adequate number of staff being recruited community sanctions provided for in the Act will commence to be implemented in 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_51">Under the Children Act, I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will be obliged to provide separate detention facilities for 16 and 17 year old boys and girls who are committed to custody by the courts either on remand or under sentence. The provision of appropriate custodial facilities is a priority for the Irish Prison Service. The primary objective of these detention centres will be to provide a secure but supportive environment in which young offenders can develop the personal and social skills necessary to avoid future offending.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_52">In line with this, a new facility for male juveniles in this age group will open at St Patrick's Institution in the near future. This unit, which was designed by a multi-disciplinary team, will include a custom-designed facility for the delivery of education, recreation, medical and therapeutic services. The longer-term provision of a dedicated facility on a greenfield site for 110 juveniles – 90 male and 20 female – is also being considered. Having considered a report by the Commissioners of Public Works and the recommendations made and having conferred with the director general of the Irish Prison Service, I decided some time ago that the proposed development of such a facility at Newlands Villa, Naas Road, Clondalkin, Dublin 22, will not now proceed. The identification of another site for the proposed juvenile detention facility is now being pursued in consultation with the director general of the Irish Prison Service and the Office of Public Works.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1469">A charter flight from Dublin travelled, via Stansted Airport, to Moldova and Romania on 18 November 2003. The flight was arranged to facilitate the removal from Ireland of a group of 25 Moldovan and Romanian nationals. Twenty four of the group, comprising three Moldovans and 21 Romanians, were the subject of deportation orders and one, a Romanian national, was being returned to Romania having been refused leave to land in the State. The group was accompanied by Garda escorts. The aircraft landed in Stansted Airport where the British authorities placed a further four Moldovans and 12 Romanians who were the subject of removal orders in the UK on board. These were also accompanied by escorts provided by the UK authorities. There were no persons on the flight who were the parents of Irish born children.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_53">There were two unaccompanied minors on the flight from Dublin – a girl of ten years of age and her brother of 16 years of age. They were accompanied by an older brother of 18 years of age who is physically handicapped. The whereabouts of the parents of these young persons is unknown but the Garda National Immigration Bureau arranged for them to be met by relatives when the flight landed in Romania. The Romanian social services were also informed in advance of their arrival and of the special requirements of the handicapped young man.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_54">Three persons who fall into the category of unaccompanied minors or separated young people were deported in 2003. Two of these are the persons referred to above while the third person, who was 17 years of age, was deported to Romania in March 2003. Where the deportation of unaccompanied minors is contemplated, each case is given careful consideration on its own merits taking into account,inter alia, the individual circumstances of the person concerned and the circumstances in his or her country of origin at the time of deportation.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_1485">I propose to take Questions Nos. 77 and 315 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1486">First, the Deputy will be aware that the investigation of criminal offences and the detailed allocation of Garda resources are operational matters for the Garda Commissioner, with whom I liaise on a regular basis. Second, I have already pointed out in this House that the most recent figures made available to me indicate that the overall crime rate is not escalating. Provisional Garda figures for the nine-month period to the end of September 2003 show a 3% decline over the same nine-month period in 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_1487">In addition, the commissioner has informed me that the personnel strength of the Garda Síochána as of 19 November 2003 was 11,875. A further 164 probationer gardaí are due to be attested to the force on 27 November 2003 and allocated to their respective stations on 28 November 2003. Garda recruitment and training has been prioritised to bring the force up to its maximum authorised strength of 12,200 as soon as possible. Six hundred and ninety Garda trainees have been taken into the Garda college during this year. A new Garda recruitment competition is under way, and the commissioner has projected, based on the anticipated rate of retirement, that the maximum authorised force strength of 12,200 will be achieved during 2004. Those extra gardaí will be assigned to the areas of greatest need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1488">As the Deputy will be aware, the Garda Síochána Bill 2003, which will be published within weeks, contains several measures on the organisation, management, performance and accountability of the Garda Síochána aimed at improving the efficient and effective use of Garda resources. The publication of the preliminary draft scheme allowed all directly interested, and the public at large, the opportunity to take part in the consultative process that is informing the drafting process of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1489">Responsibility for crime prevention and enforcement cannot rest solely on the gardaí and the wider criminal justice system. Local authorities also have a role to play. The Garda Síochána Bill therefore proposes a formalised consultation process in the form of local policing committees which will formulate and oversee the implementation of measures of co-operation between the local authority and the Garda aimed at reducing crime and disorder and combating the misuse of alcohol and drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1490">I have recently made an additional €2 million available to the Garda Síochána to cover the period up to the end of this year which will provide over 55,000 additional overtime hours to tackle crime and will also cover all additional travel and subsistence requirements. The bulk of those additional resources will be targeted at the southern and Dublin metropolitan regions and at support units, including the emergency response unit, where appropriate.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_55">A €91 million increase has been received for the Garda Vote for 2004 over the 2003 Estimate of €954 million. That represents a 9.5% increase in the Garda Vote for 2004 and means that the Garda budget is over €1 billion for 2004. The co-ordinated deployment of specialist units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Garda national drug unit, has enabled the Garda Síochána to tackle organised crime more effectively, as well as other crime. Other smaller units, including the money laundering investigation unit and a unit dealing with the theft of computer components, have also had success in combating the activities of organised criminals.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_56">As I have previously informed the House, I maintain close contact with the Garda Commissioner and his senior officers regarding violent incidents. The commissioner has assured me that he is satisfied that the necessary resources are being directed towards those areas of criminal activity. He has informed me that a proactive and integrated approach would continue to be taken by the gardaí in investigating cases where there is a suspicion that organised and gangland criminals are involved.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_57">The commissioner has also informed me that non-headline crime, which includes public order incidents, has decreased by 9% in the twelve-month period from November 2002 to the end of October 2003. Since this is the first time that the PULSE computer system has been used for the compilation of statistics on non-headline crime, caution must be exercised in comparing those figures with those for previous periods. Nevertheless, they are a positive indication that the policy of targeted operations is being successful.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_58">I am committed to ensuring that our body of criminal law is constantly reviewed and updated so that it is effective in dealing with contemporary manifestations of crime, including organised crime, public order offences and anti-social behaviour, and that it does so in a way that is balanced and fair. The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 gives the gardaí significant additional powers when dealing with anti-social behaviour. In addition, all sections of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 have been in operation since Monday, 29 September 2003. The latest provisions to come into effect change the closing time on Thursdays to 11.30 p.m., grant licensees discretion to exclude young persons from bars, and oblige persons aged 18 to 20 to carry an age document if they wish to purchase alcohol. I am confident that those reforms will improve compliance with, and enforcement of, the licensing laws. The many structural reforms to the licensing system recommended by the Commission on Liquor Licensing will be addressed in the codification of the licensing code. I expect that an outline of a codification Bill will be available by the middle of 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_59">I have also published the scheme of a revised Criminal Justice Bill in recent months. The aim of the Bill is to ensure that the Garda Síochána has at its disposal the necessary legislative framework to allow for the proper investigation and prosecution of serious crime. The measures that I propose include: increasing powers of detention in Garda custody for questioning from the current maximum of 12 hours to a maximum of 24 hours for arrestable offences; strengthening the power of the gardaí to operate legal searches by providing general powers to the District Court to issue a search warrant regarding an arrestable offence and, in exceptional circumstances, that a senior member of the gardaí will be empowered to issue a warrant which would expire after 24 hours; introducing statutory powers for the gardaí to preserve a crime scene to allow proper examination and investigation to take place and providing for a prosecution right of appeal on a point of law.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_60">The House will be aware that, arising directly from recent events, I am considering the introduction of a statutory provision allowing for the admissibility of witness statements in circumstances where the witness subsequently recants at trial or refuses to co-operate with the court. I am at present examining Canadian law and jurisprudence in the matter, and if I consider it beneficial to do so, I will also bring forward proposals in that respect in the Criminal Justice Bill.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_61">I welcome the decision of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to conduct a legislative and administrative review of the system, and, in particular, the issue of witness protection, and to invite submissions from interested organisations and individuals with constructive proposals.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1492">The Deputy will be aware of the position, as indicated in several other questions answered today, regarding my proposals for the application of more efficient staffing arrangements in the Prison Service, and the elimination of overtime. Senior officials from the Irish Prison Service has held frequent meetings with the Prison Officers Association, or POA, during 2003, and protracted negotiations have been conducted during the course of the last few months with a view to securing staff agreement for the measures necessary to reduce prison service costs.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_62">While staff did not vote in favour of the proposals, my preferred position remains agreement with the POA on a reasonable and sustainable cost structure for the operation of our prisons. I want to move forward on the basis of consensus along the lines of that reached in 2002, which identified an annual hours approach as offering the best prospect of achieving a set of arrangements that meets the needs of both sides. If an agreed way forward is not possible, I will proceed to give effect to the decision taken by the Government on 11 November 2003 in this matter progressively to implement from 1 January 2004 certain cost reduction measures, including: the mothballing of the Fort Mitchel and the Curragh places of detention; and the making of arrangements for the transformation of the open centres at Loughan House, Blacklion, County Cavan, and Shelton Abbey, Arklow, County Wicklow, into post-release centres for the reintegration into society of prisoners on conditional temporary release.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_63">In the event that the mothballing of Fort Mitchel and the Curragh places of detention has to be proceeded with, I am aware of the implications for the positions of some of the teaching staff of the two centres. I can also confirm to the Deputy that I have received detailed submissions on behalf of the staff of the education units of each institution expressing their serious concerns about the threat to the future of the two centres.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_64">I wish to reiterate that I do not want to close or even mothball Fort Mitchel or the Curragh places of detention. However, if the Prison Officers Association is unwilling to agree reasonable terms for the operation of prisons on an economically sustainable basis, it is a course that I will reluctantly have to pursue, along with other measures.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_65">The members of the teaching staff of Fort Mitchel and the Curragh, who have been duly assigned there by County Cork VEC and County Kildare VEC, respectively, are paid by those vocational education committees and are not on the payroll of the Irish Prison Service. Transfers to the education units of other prisons of those teachers cannot be advanced by the Irish Prison Service as a matter of course, even to the education unit of another nearby prison, since that would involve transfers of individual teachers from one VEC to another. The Deputy will be aware that those prisons nearest to both Fort Mitchel and the Curragh are in the catchment areas of vocational education committees other than those of County Cork and County Kildare. I understand that, while it is ultimately a matter for the Department of Education and Science, the redeployment or secondment of full-time teachers between different vocational education committees must be negotiated on a case-by-case basis.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_66">The teaching staff of Fort Mitchel, in common with the education units of several of the other prisons, is composed of part-time as well as full-time teachers. In the mainstream education system, where schools close, I understand that it has not generally proved possible to arrange or negotiate a suitable global mechanism to secure redeployment or secondment of part-time teachers between different vocational education committees. In closure scenarios, job losses can therefore arise.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_67">If the failure of the POA to reach agreement causes the mothballings to proceed, the prisoner population of the two institutions will be transferred to one or more of the other prisons and places of detention, as may be appropriate. As there will therefore be no reduction in the overall number of prisoners in custody, the overall allocation of teachers to the various vocational education committees to support the delivery of education programmes in the prisons, as determined by the Department of Education and Science, will remain at its current level.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_68">Against a background of the various factors mentioned, it would be the intention of the Irish Prison Service to offer every possible assistance to the County Cork and County Kildare vocational education committees and other relevant vocational education committees to enable retention, to the greatest extent possible, within the prison education system of all teachers employed at Fort Mitchel and the Curragh.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_69">As regards the teaching staffs at the other institutions mentioned by the Deputy, namely, Loughan House and Shelton Abbey, the position is that, as stated in the terms of the Government decision, the Irish Prison Service will, in the absence of agreement on a way forward, be making arrangements for the transformation of those two open centres into post-release centres for the reintegration into society of prisoners on conditional temporary release. Open centres play an important role in our penal system and will continue to do so. I support the work of open centres and acknowledge the efforts of many people in Loughan House and Shelton Abbey over the years. They provide a necessary alternative to dealing with those prisoners for whom the traditional high walls and internal movement restrictions are not appropriate.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_70">In open centres, reliance is placed on the prisoners transferred there not to abscond. The overall focus is either one of preparation for release of prisoners coming to the end of their sentence or of the containment of prisoners considered a low security risk but not yet suitable for release. I therefore see an enhanced role for the open centre in the Irish criminal justice system, and ideally that would include more open regimes, either separately or as self-contained elements within larger institutions on a model like that of the Grove in Castlerea Prison, where prisoners are accommodated in self-contained houses.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_71">My Department is carefully examining the detailed arrangements which need to be put in place to give effect to the Government decision on the transformation of Loughan House and Shelton Abbey into post-release centres. That will entail careful consideration of what best meets offenders' needs and those of the Irish Prison Service and will include consideration of the mechanisms for retention, to the greatest extent possible, of the education services currently provided at Loughan House and Shelton Abbey by County Cavan and County Wicklow vocational education committees, respectively. I assure the Deputy that, whatever is put in place, offenders will not be disadvantaged by the move. I envisage offenders in Loughan House and Shelton Abbey enjoying the same conditions which currently prevail.</summary>

The group's terms of reference were to examine all the issues arising from any extension of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 to the Garda Síochána and to prepare a detailed proposal of actions for consideration by the commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1498">Following that, the commissioner has made a submission to my Department, analysing the issues to which any such extension would give rise. I will carefully consider that submission before coming to a final view on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_1504">On 30 July 2003 I published the general scheme of the Garda Síochána Bill 2003, which contains several measures to strengthen the operational capacity of the Garda Síochána. The general scheme contains, <i>inter alia,</i> an enabling provision for the establishment of a Garda reserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_1505">Many people around the country would be willing to give some of their time in assisting the Garda Síochána in the discharge of its functions and, in so doing, give something back to their community. I believe that such a development would have beneficial effects for the establishment of closer connections between the gardaí and the communities in which they serve. The consultation and drafting phases for the Garda Síochána Bill are at an advanced stage, and I expect to be in a position to publish the Bill shortly. The Bill will set out the role and powers of members of the reserve. As I have stated previously, the Bill will contain the necessary enabling provision, but the Government has not yet taken a final decision on when such a force should be established. Any decision will also be the subject of consultations with the Garda representative bodies.</p>

      his plans for penal reform.

          <p eId="para_1511">A number of significant changes to the Irish penal system are in the process of being introduced. First, the Deputy is no doubt aware of the position regarding my proposals for the application of more efficient staffing arrangements in the Irish Prison Service and the elimination of overtime. Protracted negotiations have been conducted during the course of the last few months with a view to securing staff agreement for the measures necessary to reduce prison service costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1512">While staff did not vote in favour of the proposals, my preferred position remains to have agreement with the Prison Officers Association, POA, on a reasonable and sustainable cost structure for the future operation of our prisons. I want to move forward on the basis of consensus. If an agreed way forward is not possible, however, I will proceed to give effect to the decision taken by Government on 11 November 2003 in this matter to progressively implement from 1 January 2004 certain measures in the event of failure to reach agreement with the POA on the proposed change agenda.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_72">New rules for the government of prisons will be introduced in the near future. These rules, which will set out in considerable detail the full range of rights, duties and obligations for prisoners, prison staff and management, were prepared in my Department and transmitted to the Attorney General for legal drafting. These draft rules have been the subject of detailed and extensive consultation with senior staff throughout the prison system. European standards for prisons have been taken in account in the drafting of the new rules. The rules will come into force as a statutory instrument as soon as possible after the text has been finalised.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_73">The Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003 was signed by the President on the 29 October 2003. The Act will provide a clearer legislative basis for the power to grant temporary release by setting down the principles which will apply to the exercise of this power. The Act amends section 2 of the Criminal Justice Act 1960 and will provide a clear and transparent basis, as well as the necessary safeguards required, for the operation of the system of temporary release. It will be commenced shortly following finalisation of draft regulations which are currently with the parliamentary counsel.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_74">Work is also proceeding in my Department on the scheme of a prison service Bill, which will provide a statutory basis for the Irish Prison Service and related matters. As Minister, within the resources available to me, I have strengthened the probation and welfare service, especially in the area of youth justice, in order to work to reduce the need to send young offenders into custodial settings. The Children Act 2001 introduces a wide range of innovative measures which will provide a statutory framework for the future development of the juvenile justice system in accordance with modern thinking and best international practice.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_75">It is the underlying concept of the Children Act to expand the options a court will have at its disposal when deciding on how to deal with a young offender. These options are an essential feature of the Act as they will allow effect to be given to the principle that detention for young offenders will be a last resort. Thus, the Act envisages committals to custody of young offenders being availed of only in situations when other alternative diversions and community-based options have been resorted to and have failed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_76">The Act is being implemented on a phased basis. It is expected that the first of the new community sanctions will come on stream in 2004, subject to the availability of resources. There is also a requirement under the Act for my Department to provide separate detention facilities for 16 and 17 year olds. In this regard, it is anticipated that the transfer to a new facility at St. Patrick's Institution of up to 44 male offenders aged 16 and 17 years will take place in the near future.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_77">Under the Criminal Justice (Community Service) Act 1983, a court may make a community service order as an alternative to a sentence of imprisonment or detention in respect of any individual over the age of 16 years who has been convicted of a criminal offence and who consents to the order being made. The order requires an offender to perform unpaid work for between 40 and 240 hours, usually to be completed within 12 months. The aim of a community service order is to rehabilitate the offender through the discipline of having to work in the community and the making of meaningful reparation to that community for his or her crime.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_78">The courts already exercise wide discretion in using community service orders in dealing with people over 16 years of age who offend. It is used in practice for all age categories of offenders. My Department also funds two restorative justice projects through the probation and welfare service. These are the victim-offender service in Tallaght and the Nenagh reparation project. Both projects work closely with the community and have community representation on their management committees.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_79">Within the prison custodial system, there is a wide range of services in place aimed at providing offenders with the means to avoid re-offending following their return to the community. The services provided include work skills, training and education and are matched, where possible, to individual aptitudes and abilities, sometimes unrecognised or untapped prior to imprisonment. In addition, a range of medical, psychological and other support services are available to assist those suffering from particular problems such as drug addiction.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_80">As part of its commitment to rebalancing the custodial and care-rehabilitation functions in prisons, the Irish Prison Service has established a regimes directorate composed of a multidisciplinary team of staff. The formation of this directorate is facilitating the adoption of a multifaceted approach to helping prisoners to develop their sense of responsibility and encouraging those attitudes and skills which will assist them to return to society with the best chance of leading law-abiding and self-supporting lives after release. These services are also important in sustaining prisoners' physical and mental health, counteracting the detrimental effects of imprisonment, encouraging positive personal development from within and preparing for their integration into wider society as law abiding citizens on release from custody.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_81">As indicated in the Irish Prison Service Strategy Statement 2001-2003, implementing positive sentence management is a key task for the Irish Prison Service. A scoping group to examine positive sentence management was established by the Irish Prison Service in 2003 and it will present its report to the interim board of the Irish Prison Service before the end of this year.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_82">Elaboration of positive sentence management will involve a new orientation in the delivery of services to prisoners and a new emphasis on prisoners taking greater personal responsibility for their own development through involvement in the process of deciding which programmes and treatments they should follow. The end result should be a prisoner-centred, multidisciplinary approach to working with prisoners with provision for initial assessment, goal setting and periodic review to measure progress.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1538">I can inform the Deputy that €18.388 million has been allocated by way of a grant-in-aid for the Legal Aid Board in 2004, an increase of 5% over the 2003 allocation. The provision for 2004 represents an increase of 71% in funding for the board since 1997, when the grant-in-aid was €10.656 million. When an increase of this magnitude is compared to an increase of just 26.63% in the consumer price index during the period from January 1997 to October of this year, the Deputy will agree that in recent years the Legal Aid Board has received significantly increased resources in real terms. During this period sanction to employ additional staff was also conveyed to the board. Since 1997, sanctioned posts in the board's law centre network increased from 191 to 215, of which 89 are solicitor posts, an increase of eight solicitor posts. These combined additional resources have contributed to a significant improvement in waiting times throughout the board's law centre network during this period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1539">In regard to waiting times for an appointment, it is important to note that the board operates a procedure whereby priority is accorded for certain categories of cases, for example domestic violence, child care, child abduction and other cases where there are time limits. These cases are dealt with immediately and such applicants are not placed on a waiting list. Such a system for priorities is necessary to ensure that persons who are subjected to domestic violence and cases involving the care of children are provided with speedy service. It is important to note that in 2002, priority appointments offered by law centres was approximately 22% of the total number of appointments offered to new clients during the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1540">In addition, managing solicitors at law centres have authority to give priority to any case on the waiting list at their centre. For example, if an applicant is gravely ill or in cases where an applicant is in danger of losing assets or of losing title to a legal remedy if legal services are delayed, the managing solicitor can accord such cases priority status.</p>
          <p eId="para_1541">In addition, I can assure the Deputy that in order to maximise the use of its resources and to provide legal services to the greatest number of people possible, the board continuously monitors the operation of its law centre network, particularly the throughput of cases at each centre. Where waiting times, for whatever reason, become excessive the position is examined by the board with a view to taking remedial action. In this regard, the additional management posts which were made available in recent years are enabling the board to develop a more structured change management approach to the provision of civil legal aid throughout the State.</p>

I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that I do not want to say or do anything which might prejudice those proceedings.

          <p eId="para_1573">I am aware of the report in question. It is unclear whether the figures in the report are compiled according to the strict legal definition of the offence of burglary, as is the case with the Garda figures, or whether other household crimes were included. It is also unclear whether the figures relate to the company's clients only and whether account has been taken of the increase in the company's client base.</p>
          <p eId="para_1574">The figures in question are therefore not directly comparable to Garda statistics. In fact, provisional Garda figures for the 12 month period up to the end of June, 2003 show a 5% decrease in burglary when compared to the previous 12 month period. The Garda supports and fosters a number of crime prevention measures which have direct value for householders including the neighbourhood watch scheme which was established in 1985 by the Garda. In common with other community-based schemes, it enlists the voluntary help of the community in co-operation with the Garda Síochána. There are some 2,600 neighbourhood watch schemes in operation nation-wide with over 400,000 households involved. The scheme is currently organised by the Garda Síochána community relations section.</p>
          <p eId="para_1575">In addition, a similar partnership of relevance to rural communities is the community alert programme, which is part funded by my Department in partnership with Muintir na Tíre. The programme currently consists of over 1,100 schemes, covering almost 250,000 homes. This scheme has particular reference to the security of older persons.</p>

The courts are, subject only to the law and the Constitution, independent in the exercise of their functions and it would be entirely inappropriate for me to comment on specific cases. However, as stated in my previous response, I am awaiting the results of a study which my Department has commissioned into convictions for the new drug trafficking offence created by section 4 and that the provisions under section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999, as one of a number of legislative instruments designed to address the issue of national and international drug trafficking, is constantly monitored to ensure that the appropriate measures are in place to address the issue.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_92">I have not decided to introduce legislation to provide for a minimum three-month sentence for anyone found trafficking illegal drugs. Such a proposal would need to be refined as it could potentially involve a mandatory sentence for friends, including boyfriends and girlfriends who gave each other illegal drugs. Trafficking in this context would have to be carefully defined. Addicts frequently obtain drugs for onward supply to other addicts.

        <summary eId="sum_93">The provision for the probation and welfare service, both in regard to operating costs and services for offenders, for 2004 is realistic. In 2002, expenditure under both subheads amounted to €3.115 million and €14.142 million, respectively. The outturn of expenditure for both subheads to date in 2003 amounts to €3.061 million and €12.861 million, respectively, which is substantially less than the allocation for the coming year. Having regard to this, I consider that the 2004 allocation for the probation and welfare service is adequate.</summary>

In 2001, 402 trainees were attested and 322 members left the force. In 2002, 486 trainees were attested and 406 members left the force.

A total of 690 Garda trainees have been taken into the Garda college during this year.

Accordingly, the justice and equality sector PVG is required to provide its assessment of progress made by the following organisations relating to the general round and benchmarking payments due on 1 January 2004 no later than 1 December 2003: Land Registry and Registry of Deeds; Courts Service; Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner; Refugee Appeals Tribunal; Irish Prison Service; Probation and Welfare Service; Legal Aid Board; Office of the Director of Equality Investigations – The Equality Tribunal; Equality Authority; National Disability Authority; Garda Síochána Complaints Board; Forensic Science Laboratory; Office of the Data Protection Commissioner; and the Film Censor's Office</p>

To achieve this objective I have secured substantial additional funding for the Garda Síochána amounting to an increase of €91 million. Included in this figure is an increase of almost €7 million for Garda overtime which will be used to fund specific anti-crime operations. I have also secured additional funding of almost €7.5 million in the Garda Vote to deal with security operations arising out of the Government's hosting of the EU Presidency in 2004.</p>

My priority in relation to the Prisons Vote is to eliminate entirely the burden of excessive expenditure on overtime through the introduction of a system of annualised hours. If agreement cannot be reached with the Prison Officers' Association in relation to annualised hours, the Government has decided that specific cost-saving measures will be introduced on a phased basis commencing on 1 January 2004. I am also increasing the number of probation and welfare officers to address the demands placed on the service under the Children Act 2001 where community-based options under the supervision of probation and welfare officers are available to the courts.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1704">I propose to take Questions Nos. 117, 310 and 313 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1705">I am responsible for ensuring that the Courts Service is adequately funded. A sum of €92.179 million has been provided in 2003 for the Courts Service which represents a 5.6% increase on the level of funding for 2002. The funding provided is allowing the Courts Service to progress the implementation of its strategic plans and policies specifically in the areas of information technology and capital building programmes. I am confident that the level of funding provided to the Courts Service is adequate to maintain existing levels of service so that there is no undue delay in expediting the process of cases or any backlogs due to the lack of financial resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1706">Under the Courts Service Act 1998, the Courts Service, which is responsible for the day to day management of the courts, is independent in the performance of its functions. Consequently, having regard to the statutory independence of the Courts Service, the Deputy will appreciate that it is a matter for the Courts Service to decide how funding provided is specifically allocated. While some element of delay is inevitable in the courts system, the situation differs from court to court. Within existing resources, improvements have been made and the waiting time for trials in the High Court, especially for family law, criminal trials and appeals and judicial review has been reduced and maintained at an all-time low.</p>
          <p eId="para_1707">The Deputy specifically referred to family law. In this regard, I have been informed by the Courts Service that, as of 31 December 2002, in the District Court there was an average 13 week waiting period in Dublin from the date of issue of the summons to the date of hearing of safety, barring, maintenance or guardianship order applications. As a result of the Domestic Violence (Amendment) Act 2002, the time between an <i>ex parte</i>interim barring order and a full hearing is no more than eight working days. In Cork there is a one month waiting period.

        <summary eId="sum_113">As regards judicial resources, seven additional judges were appointed under the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002 – two High Court judges, three Circuit Court judges and two District Court judges. A further two High Court judges were recently appointed under the provisions of the Courts and Court Officers (Amendment) Act 2003. The provision of these additional resources has assisted in the objective of reducing delays generally. I might add that, in 1996, the total funding allocated to the Courts was €35.408 million, or £27.886 million. The amount allocated to the Courts Service this year represents an increase of 160% on this.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1709">The number of suicides in Irish prisons and places of detention since 1980 indicate a rise in the number of deaths attributed to suicide from the late 1980s. The figures, as recorded by my Department, show that there was one suicide per annum in the years from 1980 to 1987, with the exception of 1985 when two prisoners took their own lives and 1984 when there were no suicides. The statistics from 1988 to 2002 indicate that, on average, between three and four prisoners died as a result of suicide in each year. The figures from 1988 to 2002 vary from one death in the years 1993, 1995, 1998, and 2001, to six in 1999. There have been two apparent self-inflicted prison deaths to date this year. A coroner's inquest has not yet been held in either of these two cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_1710">It should be noted that the average daily prison population has risen considerably over the period in question. The average daily prison population in 1980 was 1,215, which compares with an average of 2,108 in 1990 and 3,163 in 2002. The increases in the number of deaths in custody attributed to suicide since the late 1980s should also be viewed against the background of a reported increase in such deaths in the community. The latest Council of Europe annual penal statistics available to me were compiled for the year 2001. The rates of prison suicide varied throughout Europe from none to 47.5 per 10,000 prisoners. The rate in Ireland was 3.2 per 10,000 prisoners, which indicated that Ireland had one of the lowest rates of prison suicide in Europe at that time.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_115">There are strategies and plans in place for the prevention of suicides in all institutions. There also exists a great level of awareness and care in the prevention, in so far as possible, of suicides within all institutions. Prison officers receive appropriate training in recognition and response to suicidal behaviour. This is covered in the induction programme for recruit prison officers. In addition, familiarisation training in this area is available to all officers and an information pack has been issued to all training officers in each institution. The importance of this subject in a prisons context is fully accepted. The Samaritans have provided courses for staff in some institutions in how to deal with traumatic situations and how to relate to people who have been traumatised.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_116">All deaths in custody are the subject of a Garda investigation and an inquest held in a coroner's court. The cause of death is determined by a jury on the basis of the information presented to the court. The circumstances of each death in custody are also examined by a suicide awareness group in each institution. These examinations fully cover the background and circumstances of each death. Their objective is to identify, where possible, measures which might be implemented to contribute to a reduction in the risk of deaths in the future. In addition, the national steering group on deaths in custody, established in May 1996, provides a forum for collating the reports of the local suicide awareness groups and disseminating significant findings throughout the prison system.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1743">The insurance reform programme I announced on 25 October last comprises a comprehensive set of inter-related measures designed to improve the functioning of the Irish insurance market. The key measures include: implementation of the recommendations in the Motor Insurance Advisory Board Action Plan within a target timeframe, 23 of which have been fully implemented to date, three partially implemented and work is in progress on the implementation of the other recommendations; and establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board. The Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill 2003 was published on 18 November 2003 and is before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The Bill, when enacted, will provide for the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board on a statutory footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1744">My Department and the Competition Authority are undertaking a joint study into the insurance market. The study will identify and analyse barriers to entry and limitations on rivalry in the insurance marketplace. It is envisaged that the bulk of the work will be completed this year and that a report will be produced in the early part of 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1745">I chair a ministerial committee established to drive the co-ordinated implementation of the reform programme across the relevant Departments and other bodies concerned. Substantial progress is being made on a range of other measures that will radically overhaul the functioning of the insurance market and help tackle the high cost of insurance. These include measures to reduce the number of accidents, to tackle fraudulent and exaggerated claims and streamline the law in relation to personal injury claims.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_127">While EU law prohibits the imposition of price control on insurance, I have made it clear that I consider there to be an onus on the insurance industry to ensure that the reforms to be taken will have the effect of significantly reducing the cost of premia to consumers and businesses. In this regard, it is heartening to report that a number of insurers have announced reductions in motor insurance premia. As implementation of the reform programme continues, in particular the reform of the law on personal injuries and the establishment of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board, I expect reductions to occur in all forms of insurance including employers and public liability.</summary>

For 2004 only, the dairy premium will be a coupled scheme, with the payment based on the milk quota held, either owned or leased in, by the producer on 31 March 2004. The dairy premium will be decoupled in 2005 and will become part of a single payment entitlement. The part of the single payment related to the dairy premium will then be based on the eligible milk quota held on 31 March 2005 and will be payable in 2005 and subsequent years to the producer who holds the quota on that date.</p>

In this case it should be noted that where a person sells a milk quota into restructuring, that person's son or daughter, subject to certain conditions, will have first priority in the purchase of quota under a later restructuring scheme provided it is available.</summary>

The single payment is calculated by taking the three yearly average number of animals-arable hectares which attracted payment and multiplying them by the payment rate for 2002 in respect of livestock or by €383.04 per hectare in the case of arable aid.

        <summary eId="sum_131">Leaving the state aid issue to one side, since the introduction of the seafarer's allowance in 1998, a number of groups have sought the extension of the allowance or the introduction of a similar tax allowance. Such a concession for the marine fishing industry as suggested would almost certainly lead to claims from other workers for similar treatment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_132">Tax reliefs no matter how worthwhile in themselves, reduce the tax base and make general reform of the tax system more difficult. Accordingly, I have no plans at this stage to extend the seafarer's allowance to fishermen.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_133">The commissioners hold open and confined competitions on a regular basis to fill vacancies that arise in Departments and offices. The candidature for open competitions is made up of non-civil servants and existing civil servants. The candidature for confined competitions is made up of existing civil servants. The commissioners then assign successful candidates from panels established from open or confined competitions to Departments and offices, which require staff including the Office of the Ombudsman. Therefore, recruitment of staff to the Office of the Ombudsman is not restricted to existing civil servants.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_134">When the Office of the Ombudsman was first established, special competitions were held in the early 1980s for investigator at assistant principal level and senior investigator at principal level, posts which were open to non-civil servants. Special competitions were also held in 1998 and 2000 for the recruitment of staff to the Office of the Information Commissioner and were also open to non-civil servants.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1839">I assume that the Deputy is referring to the Government's policy of widening the standard rate band and placing it on a per person basis and how many income earners have benefited from it. This policy was put in place to reduce the number of income earners paying at the top rate of tax. Before the previous Government came into office in 1997, a single person with an income of more than €17,270 or £13,600 became liable at the top tax rate. This meant that someone on roughly 90% of the average industrial wage in 1997 – then about €19,370 or £15,255 – was liable to tax at the higher rate. This is no longer the position because the standard band has been widened considerably. It now stands at €28,000 for a single person.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_141">As resources have become available to make progress in doing so, those who in each year would have paid tax at the higher rate but for the increase in the value of the band in that year have benefited from and availed of the widening process. In addition, those who have remained paying at the top rate have also benefited because the band widening has reduced the extent of their liability to tax at the higher rate. Beneficiaries have included single persons, married one-earner couples and married two-earner couples. No income earner is worse off as a result of the band widening process.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_142">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the numbers of taxpayers liable to tax at both the standard and higher rates of tax who are estimated to benefit in 2003 as a result of band widening implemented since the 1999-2000 income tax year are estimated as follows.

          <p eId="para_1895">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that a total of nine partnerships involved in multi-storey car parks were examined as part of the top 400 study and that these partnerships generated aggregate losses of €9,725,723. Approximately 90 individuals were involved in these nine partnerships. The average loss relief claimed per individual was in the region of €100,000. These losses would have been allowed at the individuals' marginal income tax rates. The top rate was 46% in 1999-2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1896">Revenue has advised me that in the time available it has not been possible to identify the highest individual amount of multi-storey car park relief claimed.

        <summary eId="sum_149">It should be noted that the Revenue Commissioners conducted a similar study in 1997 on the effective tax rate of high earners in the tax years 1993-94 and 1994-95. One of the conclusions drawn from the 1997 study was that the use of capital allowances was one of the main methods of reducing the tax bills of high earners to very low levels. I subsequently introduced provisions in the 1998 Finance Act which placed a cap of €31,750 per annum on the amount of capital allowances a taxpayer could claim on investments outside his or her own business.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_150">In the case of the 2002 study by the Revenue Commissioners, it was noted that some individuals were still able to avail in 1999-2000 of the pre-1998 budget legislative provisions because of the normal transitional measures associated with the budget changes. The impact of these transitional measures has been declining in the intervening years and will eventually cease.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1910">School caretakers are not employed by my Department. They may be employed directly by schools, vocational education committees or private contractors who provide a caretaking service to schools. Caretakers in vocational schools are employed and paid by the appropriate VEC. Those employed on a whole-time basis are pensionable under the education sector superannuation scheme which was formerly part of the local government superannuation scheme. Caretakers employed on a whole-time basis by community and comprehensive schools are pensionable under the terms of the contributory pension scheme for full-time non-teaching staff of comprehensive and community schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_1911">In the case of secondary schools, each school receives a grant from my Department for the provision of caretaking and other ancillary services. It is a matter for the school to determine how best to meet its caretaking requirements. No public service pension scheme exists for caretakers employed in such schools. In primary schools there are two separate arrangements for the provision of caretaking services. Under a limited scheme introduced in 1979, caretakers are employed on a whole-time basis by 204 schools. In all other primary schools these provisions have been superseded by an arrangement under which each school receives a grant from my Department for the provision of caretaking and other ancillary services. As in the case of the grant provided to secondary schools, it is a matter for the school to determine how best to meet its caretaking requirements. No public service pension scheme exists for caretakers in primary schools whether they are employed directly by the school or otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1912">The question of pension cover for caretakers employed directly by primary and secondary schools and for part-time caretakers employed by vocational education committees and community and comprehensive schools is currently under consideration in the context of the implementation of the Protection of Employees (Fixed-term Work) Act 2003 and the Protection of Employees (Part-time Work) Act 2001. Discussions with the education partners are ongoing regarding the implementation of these Acts. My Department's approach will be informed by the outcome of these discussions and developments in the wider public service.</p>

Exemption from the study of Irish may, however, be granted to primary pupils under certain circumstances outlined in Department circular 12/96. Under the terms of the circular, delegated authority to grant exemptions from Irish, within the conditions laid down, is vested in the individual school authority. Children attending primary school who have moved to Ireland may receive exemption from the study of Irish if their primary education up to 11 years of age was received in Northern Ireland or outside Ireland, provided the parent or guardian who had custody of the pupil was permanently resident in Northern Ireland or outside Ireland during the pupil's period of education up to that age. Exemptions may also be granted to pupils who were previously enrolled as recognised pupils in primary schools and who are being re-enrolled after a period spent abroad, provided at least three years have elapsed since the previous enrolment in the State and the pupils are at least 11 years of age on re-enrolment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1924">Pupils from abroad who have no understanding of English when enrolled are be required to study one language only, either Irish or English. Children of foreigners who are diplomatic or consular representatives in Ireland can be granted exemptions as may children from other countries resident in this country as political refugees and children with a learning disability of such a degree of severity that they fail to achieve expected levels of attainment in basic language skills in the mother tongue. In the last case, exemption from Irish may be considered under paragraph 1(c) of circular 12/96 provided a qualified psychologist confirms that such disability exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_1925">Children who have been assessed as having a general learning disability due to serious sensory impairment and who are also failing to attain adequate levels in basic language skills in the mother tongue may also receive an exemption if supported by a report from an appropriate medical specialist.</p>

          <p eId="para_1927">Under the current regulations governing the payment of fees for certificate and diploma programmes in institutes of technology, my Department meets the tuition fees of students who hold EU nationality. It also meets the tuition fees of non-EU nationals who have been granted official refugee status or who have been granted humanitarian leave to remain in the State and who have been ordinarily resident in an EU member state for at least three of the five years preceding their entry to an approved third level course. The rate of tuition fee charged by individual third level institutions, where students are not eligible under the free fees initiative, is a matter for each institution to determine on an autonomous basis. The classification of a student as an EU or a non-EU applicant is a matter for each institution to determine in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1928">My Department made enquiries with the Dublin Institute of Technology in this case and was informed that the student, who is a non-EU national, was previously charged a reduced rate of fees for a certificate programme as an exceptional matter. It is also understood that he has now been accepted onto a follow-on diploma programme but the Dublin Institute of Technology is not in a position to extend the reduced fee arrangement for this further course. The Dublin Institute of Technology is a statutory body established under the Dublin Institute of Technology Act 1992. Under the Act, the governance and day-to-day activities of the institute are matters for which the governing body and the management staff of the institute are responsible.

          <p eId="para_1941">There have been significant improvements in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. In the context of the 2004 Estimates, I recently announced a further improvement in the <i>per capita</i> grant to €274 per pupil as against the rate of €224.74 that applied in 1997. This increase will bring the grant to €312 in the case of disadvantaged schools. In addition, secondary schools have benefited under the school services support initiative. The initial grant of €25 per pupil which was introduced for second level schools in September 2000 was increased to €89 per pupil from September 2002 and was further increased by €10 per pupil from January last to €99 per pupil. In the case of voluntary secondary schools, the grant was increased by a further €28 to €117 in September 2002 bringing the support services grant in the case of such schools to €127 per pupil from January last.</p>
          <p eId="para_1942">In the context of the 2004 Estimates, the grant will be further increased to €131 per pupil. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to €15,554 per school, or €44.44 per pupil, per annum which have also been approved for voluntary secondary schools. For a secondary school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to €105,684 per annum and annual grants of €242,501 –€261,551 in the case of disadvantaged schools – towards general expenses and support services. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is, in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific initiatives, including those referred to by the Deputies.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_157">Voluntary secondary schools in Counties Dublin, Monaghan and Waterford are funded on the same basis as secondary schools throughout the country. The funding arrangements for voluntary secondary schools is structured mainly on the basis of capitation grants with additional grants for secretarial and caretaking services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_158">There have been significant improvements in the level of funding for voluntary secondary schools. In the context of the 2004 Estimates, I recently announced a further improvement in theper capitagrant to €274 per pupil as against the rate of €224.74 that applied in 1997. This increase will bring the grant to €312 in the case of disadvantaged schools.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_159">In addition, secondary schools have benefited under the school services support initiative. The initial grant of €25 per pupil that was introduced for second level schools in September 2000 was increased to €89 per pupil from September 2002 and was further increased by €10 per pupil from January last to €99 per pupil. In the case of voluntary secondary schools, the grant was increased by a further €28 to €117 in September 2002 bringing the support services grant in the case of such schools to €127 per pupil from January last. In the context of the 2004 Estimates, the grant will be further increased to €131 per pupil. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to €15,554 per school, €44.44 per pupil, per annum that have also been approved for voluntary secondary schools.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_160">For a secondary school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to €105,684 per annum and annual grants of €242,501, €261,551 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is, in general, a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific initiatives, including those referred to by the Deputies.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_161">Tackling the difficulties that are being caused by high insurance premiums is a clear priority for the Government and for my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A key concern to which the Tánaiste is giving priority is the cost and availability of liability insurance. In this context, the Tánaiste has announced a comprehensive programme for the fundamental reform of the Irish insurance market. The Government considers that these measures constitute a programme that is capable of delivering very real reform and that reductions in insurance costs will translate into significant reductions in premiums. I am committed to improving further the funding position of voluntary secondary schools in the light of available resources.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1973">I am fully aware of the cost involved in, and the benefits accruing from, participation in further and higher education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1974">My Department operates three means-tested maintenance grant schemes for students attending third level education and one scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses as follows: the higher education grants scheme; the vocational education committees scholarship scheme; the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post-leaving certificate courses. The cost of the four schemes in 2002 was €132 million. The Department also meets the tuition fees of eligible students who are attending approved full-time undergraduate courses. The cost of this provision in 2002 was €240 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1975">The Deputy will be aware that, on 25 May 2003, I announced a new package of student support measures costing €42 million in a full year to further address and ameliorate the problems facing students from low to moderate income households in accessing third-level education.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_163">This package combines substantial improvements in the level and coverage of the maintenance grant for those on low to moderate incomes, with increases in the level of top-up grant for those who are most disadvantaged. The main provisions arising from the €42 million package are: an increase of 15% in the maintenance grant, to give a maximum grant of €2,885, benefiting, it is estimated, approximately 56,000 students; significant increases, above the normal CPI increases, in the reckonable income limits and in the allowance by which the income limits may be increased for each dependant where two or more children are in further or higher education and the introduction of a revised income limit scheme, to include the following threshold levels – a new part maintenance, 75%, and full fees and an upgrading of the full fees only income limit to become a part maintenance, 25%, and full fees entitlement.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_164">The top income limit has been increased from €36,897 to €40,000, ensuring that a significantly higher number of students from households with moderate incomes will not have to pay the student service charge. Significant improvements have been effected in the special rates of maintenance grant, or top-up grants, for students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The higher, non-adjacent rate has been increased to €4,495, an amount equal to the maximum personal rate of social welfare unemployment assistance. The adjacent rate has been increased to €1,800. These increases represent top-ups on the ordinary grant of €1,610 and €645 respectively. The annual income threshold for the special rates of grant has been increased by 10.8% to €13,760.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_165">In addition to the ordinary maintenance grant schemes and the free fees initiative, spending on third level access measures funded directly by my Department has, since 1997, increased from €500,000 to €24 million in 2002. The provision for 2003 is €26 million. By any standards this represents a quantum leap in the commitment of resources.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_166">The access measures funded include: special rates of maintenance grants for disadvantaged students, commonly referred to as top-up grants. Over 8,000 students received the top-up grant in 2002-03; the millennium partnership fund for disadvantage which provides assistance to partnership companies and community groups to develop their support schemes for students from disadvantaged families. The provision for the fund in 2003 is €2 million and 59 area partnerships and community groups are receiving allocations and the student assistance fund which provides financial support to disadvantaged students who require additional support to enable them to fully benefit from their third level studies. Provision for this fund was €8.94 million in respect of the 2002-03 academic year.</summary>

      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Education and Science,</b>
      further to Parliamentary Question No. 106 of 12 November 2003, if his attention has been drawn to the research which shows that programmes in the arts and music develop reading skills and are very effective at pre-primary and primary level; and if he will make a statement on the fact that such programmes do not seem to be used alongside, or in place of, some of the solutions outlined in his answer to that question in view of the fact that prevention is better than cure.

          <p eId="para_1989">I am aware that studies have highlighted that arts and music education programmes provide important opportunities for learning. However, the latest evidence for transfer of learning and for the beneficial effects of arts and music education on literacy levels is inconclusive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1990">Nevertheless, programmes of support for disadvantaged school communities, funded by my Department, are mindful of the vital role and impact of the arts on children's general learning. In addition, the primary school curriculum 1999 states clearly that an experience of the arts is an important aspect of the general education of the primary school child.</p>

Additional funds became available towards the end of 2002 which allowed the Department to allocate supplementary grants in respect of child care assistance. Actual payout to vocational education committees for 2002 was €4,736,831 of which €101,837 was paid to County Mayo VEC. Some 27 vocational education committees, including County Mayo VEC, have requested special assistance by way of additional funding in 2003 for their child care services up to the end of the year. These vocational education committees were asked to indicate their minimal requirements to maintain the service and this information is currently being analysed in my Department.</p>

Children who live remote from the route of service may not always be accommodated with a nearer pick-up point, as the road network in the area may be unsuitable or the cost involved in extending or re-routing the service to accommodate them may be prohibitive. The position in this case is that an extension of service is not feasible as the road in question is not suitable for the type of bus used.</p>

          <p eId="para_2039">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private companies operating in a fully liberalised sector. There are, however, many areas of the country where demographics and location make it difficult to establish a business case for private sector investment in infrastructure, and my Department is addressing this problem in our regional broadband programme. An indicative €200 million of European Union and Government funding has been set aside for telecommunications infrastructure projects under the National Development Plan 2000-2006, including metropolitan fibre-optic networks, new fibre trunk lines, enhancement of existing cable facilities, and the enabling of telephone exchanges for digital subscriber lines.</p>
          <p eId="para_2040">The fibre-optic metropolitan area network, MAN, in Letterkenny, which will be officially launched on Friday, 28 November, is one of 19 such networks in towns and cities across the country and constitutes phase one of a massive public investment in telecommunications infrastructure under the NDP. In addition to the MAN programme, a number of private sector projects have been grant aided. The ESB fibre trunk network, 1,500 kilometres in length and including an extension through Letterkenny to Buncrana, was co-funded under the NDP and will shortly be able to offer service providers alternative access to back-haul.</p>
          <p eId="para_2041">The upgrading of telephone exchanges nationwide by both Eircom and Esat BT continues. I understand 900,000 telephone lines have been DSL enabled to date, and the aim is to have 1.2 million enabled by March 2004. Eircom has reported huge interest in broadband with upwards of 1,000 new DSL customers being connected each week.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_167">Decisions regarding funding possibilities for further infrastructure developments will be made following a full assessment of phase one of the regional broadband programme. However, in those areas where broadband cannot yet be provided over traditional telephone lines, a number of companies are marketing broadband using wireless and satellite technology.

I have no function in this matter. The Communications Regulation Act 2003 provides that the commission is independent in the exercise of its functions. The new framework also entitles ComReg to impose licence fees for users of spectrum or rights of use charges.

Under this programme, the scientific model for analysis of salmon stocks continues to be refined in the light of data relating to marine survival, catches, spawning escapement and habitat. A key element of this approach is the installation and operation of fish counters on strategically located salmon index rivers around the country. Arrangements in respect of the operational, data management and quality assurance issues are being finalised by my Department for the fish counter management programme to be carried out by the regional fisheries boards in partnership with the Marine Institute in 2004. While I am advised that there are no proposals at present to install counters in the rivers mentioned by the Deputy, the question of installing any additional counters will be a matter for the fisheries boards and the Marine Institute to decide in the context of the future development of the programme.</p>

RTE proposes to have a survey carried out in the area to find a suitable transmission site. If this survey identifies a suitable site, pending the availability of funding, RTE should be in a position to install a low power system in the area during 2004.

          <p eId="para_2081">The strategy of health boards recruiting medical personnel abroad has generally been initially to target European Union countries which have a surplus of such personnel. Some boards have worked with FÁS-EURES in this regard. Applications for medical posts are received from candidates from the African continent on the initiative of the doctors themselves. These applications are treated in the same way as are all others for such posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_2082">The concept of ethical recruitment is underlined in Guidance for Best Practice on the Recruitment of Overseas Nurses and Midwives, published by the Department in December 2001. The document recommends that health service employers only actively recruit in countries where the national government supports the process. In examining opportunities for overseas recruitment, I am informed that the directors of human resources of the health boards have regard to the requirements for medical and nursing personnel in the relevant countries and, as a matter of practice, would not recruit where such activity would adversely affect the provision of health care in that country.</p>
          <p eId="para_2083">Non-consultant hospital doctors working in the State include in their numbers many non-nationals. They are generally working in training posts and the additional skill and expertise which they obtain will be of considerable benefit to those doctors on their return to their own countries.</p>

One of the factors affecting the ability of the hospital system to facilitate the timely admission of patients is the high number of acute beds which are occupied by patients who have completed the acute phase of their illness.

The level of funding being provided by my Department for suicide prevention is now more than 20 times what it was in 1999.</p>
          <p eId="para_2105">The task force report recommended that steps be taken to make the mental health services more accessible to the public, particularly to young people. In this regard, additional funding has been made available in recent years to further develop consultant-led child and adolescent psychiatry services to assist in the early identification of suicidal behaviour and to provide the necessary support and treatment to individuals at risk. Significant additional funding has also been provided for many voluntary organisations who deal with people suffering from depression, mental illness and bereavement who are at risk of suicide and attempted suicide.</p>
          <p eId="para_2106">I assure the Deputy that the Government shares the public concern about the level of suicides in this country and is fully committed to supporting suicide prevention programmes. A national action-oriented strategy for suicide prevention is being considered jointly by the Health Boards Executive, HeBE, the national suicide review group and the Department of Health and Children. It is important to stress that this proposed strategy will build on existing policy and on the recommendations contained in the report of the national task force on suicide. All measures aimed at reducing the number of deaths by suicide will be considered in the preparation of this strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_2107">The additional resources required to continue the work in suicide prevention and the further development of mental health services for individuals who may be at risk will be considered in the context of the overall determination of expenditure for mental health services for 2004 and subsequent years.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_2110">I propose to take Questions Nos. 242 and 243 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2111">I understand the Deputy is referring to cases involving personality changes following accidents. As the Deputy is aware, significant developments have taken place in the child welfare and child and adolescent psychiatric services in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_2112">Since 1997 approximately €179 million additional revenue funding has been invested through the health boards in the development of child welfare and protection services. This includes an additional €8 million for 2003. This has provided for a wide range of developments including family support projects, preventive services and intensive community based services.</p>
          <p eId="para_2113">As stated in the health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, the dominant focus in child care services since the early 1990s has been on the protection and care of children who are at risk. This policy has shifted in recent times to a more preventative approach to child welfare involving support to families and individual children, and the aim is to avoid the need for further more serious interventions later on, such as taking a child into care.</p>
          <p eId="para_2114">Internationally acknowledged best practice for the provision of child and adolescent psychiatric services is through the multidisciplinary team. In furtherance of the recommendations of the working group on child and adolescent psychiatry, additional revenue funding of €6.061 million was allocated in 2002 to provide for the appointment of additional child and adolescent consultants, for the enhancement of existing consultant-led multidisciplinary teams and towards the establishment of further teams. A further €1.64 million was allocated in 2003. Each health board now has a minimum of two teams in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_2115">Each of these services may have a role in meeting needs in the circumstances identified by the Deputy.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
          <p eId="para_2117">I understand from the regional health boards that the support mechanisms available to minors who are victims of sexual assault and their parents include professional services such as medical and nursing, social work, child and adolescent psychiatry, clinical psychology and family support services. Services provided include risk assessment, child protection and treatment, counselling, support and advice and alternative care as appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_2118">Some health boards have indicated that they do not have waiting lists for counselling and some do not routinely collate figures on the number of cases awaiting counselling. The number of cases awaiting counselling in those health board areas who indicate that they both have waiting lists and also collate the relevant figures is 32.</p>
          <p eId="para_2119">Not all health boards distinguish between priority and non-priority cases and timescales tend to depend on the type of counselling needed, but in general priority cases are in many cases seen immediately. Non-priority cases are generally seen within a matter of a few months.</p>
          <p eId="para_2120">The Eastern Regional Health Authority is not in a position to provide the detail sought by the Deputy in the time available and my Department has asked the regional chief executive to respond to the Deputy directly with the information sought.</p>

      the main elements of his plans for health reform; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_947">
          <from>Minister for Health and Children (Mr. Martin)</from>
          <p eId="para_2124">I have already outlined in detail to the House the background to the health service reform programme. The Government's decisions in this regard are based on the recommendations of three key reports: the audit of structures and functions in the health system, the Prospectus report; the commission on financial management and control systems in the health service, the Brennan report and the report of the national task force on medical staffing, the Hanly report.</p>
          <p eId="para_2125">The key elements of the reform programme include a major rationalisation of existing health service agencies to reduce fragmentation. This involves the abolition of the existing health board-authority structures, the reorganisation of the Department of Health and Children to ensure improved policy development and oversight, and the establishment of a health services executive which will be the first ever body charged with managing the health service as a single national entity. The executive is to be organised on the basis of three core divisions: a national hospitals office, a primary, community and continuing care directorate, and a national shared services centre. Other elements include the establishment of a health information and quality authority to ensure that quality of care is promoted throughout the system; the modernisation of supporting processes, service planning and management reporting, etc. so that they will be in line with recognised international best practice; the strengthening of governance and accountability across the system; the reduction of non-consultant hospital doctors working hours in line with the EU directive; and the reorganisation of the acute hospital sector. The programme's priority focus is improved patient care, better value for taxpayers' money and improved health care management.</p>
          <p eId="para_2126">I have previously outlined in the House the activity already completed or under way in relation to the implementation of the programme. The Government agreed that to succeed it would be necessary to clearly set out the Government's vision of reform to all in the existing health system, including board members, staff and staff representatives. This engagement was undertaken as a vital first step in the implementation process. This is the process on which we have been engaged during the last number of months. The Secretary General and I briefed every senior manager of every agency in the system in the days after the Government's decision. There followed a visit to every health board area, meeting large numbers of staff and board members.</p>
          <p eId="para_2127">The Department commissioned the office for health management to conduct an information and consultation exercise reaching as many people and agencies as possible in the system. More than 20,000 staff were directly engaged with over the summer months and into September. The draft report of the OHM is now completed. Overall co-ordination of the change programme is supported by a project officer led at assistant secretary level which reports to the Secretary General of my Department.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_170">Output to date from the project office includes a draft project plan for the reform programme, identifying manageable phases of implementation and the establishment of 13 action projects to advance specific elements of the programme by the end of the year. The work of these action projects is well under way at this stage. I am satisfied that the preparatory work on which we have been engaged has been undertaken with the appropriate degree of professionalism and urgency. This programme affects every aspect of the health system and everyone working in it – close to 100,000 people. If it is to have a lasting impact, particularly for patients and clients, it must be professionally planned and executed. I am more than satisfied that the planning and initial consultation phase we have undertaken will pay dividends in the longer run and that the reform programme is being advanced in the appropriate manner and pace for change of this order.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_171">The establishment of the health service executive on a statutory basis will require legislative changes. Work has commenced on the preparation of this legislation, which will provide the statutory basis for the establishment of the new health service executive and related structures. The new legislation will also incorporate other legal changes required and my aim will be to introduce the necessary legislation next year. It is my intention that, assuming the legislation can be advanced in a timely fashion, the health service executive will be in place on a statutory basis in 2005.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_172">The Government decision on funding of the reform programme provided that funding in 2003 would be met from within the existing allocation. This has been achieved. Provision for 2004 has been the subject of discussion during the Estimates process. I am satisfied that there will be adequate provision for the advancement of the programme, including the funding of the interim health service executive in 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_173">The Government has agreed on the appointment of an executive chair for the interim health service executive and the formalities of that appointment are currently being worked through. In parallel, I am in the process of inviting other individuals with the required competencies to become members of the board and I expect to have that process completed by the end of the current week. I will be making a public announcement on the appointment of the board at the earliest opportunity. Following on the appointment of the board, I will bring proposals to Government on the membership of the national steering group.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2131">The provision of drug treatment services is a matter for the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority in the first instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_2132">The overall objective of the National Drugs Strategy 2001 to 2008 is to reduce the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research with the ultimate aim of leading a drug-free lifestyle. The health related aspects of the national drugs strategy focus in particular on education and prevention and treatment and rehabilitation, including substitution treatment under the methadone protocol.</p>
          <p eId="para_2133">The number of treatment places has expanded considerably in recent years, in line with the Government's commitment under the national drugs strategy. At the end of September 2003 there were 6,844 people receiving methadone treatment. This compares with a figure of just over 5,000 at the end of 2,000. I am informed that, at the end of September, there were 259 people on the waiting list for treatment under the methadone protocol within the Eastern Regional Health Authority, ERHA.</p>
          <p eId="para_2134">In the Eastern Regional Health Authority there are 59 drug treatment locations. This compares with 12 locations in 1997. Outside the ERHA, treatment clinics have been established in the South Eastern Health Board, Mid-Western Health Board, Western Health Board and Midland Health Board. General practitioners and pharmacists also provide treatment services and their involvement has also increased over the past number of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_2135">I understand there are a wide range of specific support mechanisms for parents and their children who are addicted to heroin and other drugs funded through the ERHA and the health boards. These include counselling and family services provided directly by the area health boards, local drugs task force initiatives and projects provided by community and voluntary sector organisations. The chief executive of the ERHA understands that there are no waiting times of significance in relation to these dedicated projects and that there is relatively immediate access to same.</p>

          <p eId="para_2159">The recruitment and retention of adequate numbers of nursing staff has been a concern of the Government for some time. A number of substantial measures have been introduced in recent years, some with the specific intention of encouraging nursing staff who have left the profession to return to employment. These include an increase of 70% in the number of nursing training places from 968 in 1998 to 1,640 from 2002 onwards; payment of fees to nurses-midwives undertaking part-time nursing and certain other undergraduate degree courses; an improved scheme of financial support for student paediatric nurses and student midwives; payment of fees and enhanced salary to nurses-midwives undertaking courses in specialised areas of clinical practice; abolition of fees for "back to practice" courses and payment of salary to nurses-midwives undertaking such courses; financial support to State enrolled nurses, SEN, working in the Irish health service wishing to undertake nursing conversion programmes in the United Kingdom; 40 sponsorships made available each year for certain categories of health service employees wishing to train as nurses; and the introduction of flexible working options.</p>

      if he will make a statement on the implementation to date of the juvenile justice provisions of the Children Act 2001.
      [28401/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_972">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_2241">The Children Act 2001 introduces a wide range of innovative measures that will provide a statutory framework for the future development of the juvenile justice system in accordance with modern thinking and best international practice. The Act also amends the Child Care Act 1991 by providing for the detention in special care units of non-offending children with challenging behaviour. It also establishes the special residential services board to ensure the efficient and co-ordinated delivery of services to young children in detention. The Act re-enacts and updates provisions in the Children Act 1908 protecting children from abuse by persons who have the custody, charge or care of them. It is complex and comprehensive legislation and, for those reasons, its provisions are being implemented on a phased basis, as was envisaged at the time of enactment.</p>
          <p eId="para_2242">Responsibility for implementing the Children Act 2001 lies with three Departments, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Education and Science in respect of juvenile offending, and Health and Children in respect of children who are non-offending but out of control. The national children's office is co-ordinating the cross-departmental aspects of the implementation of the Act.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_181">The first commencement order under the Act in respect of my Department was signed by my predecessor on 23 April 2002. The order, which came into force on 1 May 2002 and provided for,inter alia, the payment of compensation by parents in respect of offences committed by their children-section 113; a court order which would require parents to exercise proper and adequate control over their children – section 114; the establishment of the Garda diversion programme on a statutory basis and the introduction of a diversion conference-sections 17 to 51, inclusive, based on restorative justice principles as pioneered in New Zealand and in excess of 100 of which have taken place countrywide; and the introduction of a curfew for children found guilty of offences – section 133.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_182">I will outline the position on further commencement. It is an underlying concept of the Children Act to expand the options a court will have at its disposal when deciding on how to deal with a young offender. These options are an essential feature of the Act as they will allow effect to be given to the principle that detention for young offenders will be a last resort. Thus, the Act envisages committals to custody of young offenders being availed of only in situations where other alternative diversions and community-based options have been resorted to and have failed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_183">The successful implementation of the community-based options in the Act will require a very significant input from the probation and welfare service. The service, as part of its planning for implementation of the Children Act 2001, engaged trainers from the Department of Child, Youth and Family in New Zealand for the intensive training of all professional staff as facilitators for family conferences to be convened and managed in accordance with the requirements of the Act, as well as providing day seminars for all probation and welfare officers. The service will provide ongoing training through its staff development unit as required.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_184">Nine additional probation and welfare officers took up duty in September and a response to other offers of appointment is awaited. It is the intention that, subject to an adequate number of staff being recruited, community sanctions provided for in the Act will commence to be implemented in 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_185">Under the Children Act, I, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, will be obliged to provide separate detention facilities for 16 and 17 year old boys and girls who are committed to custody by the courts either on remand or under sentence. The provision of appropriate custodial facilities is a priority for the Irish Prison Service. The primary objective of these detention centres will be to provide a secure but supportive environment in which young offenders can develop the personal and social skills necessary to avoid future offending.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_186">A new facility for male juveniles in this age group will open at St. Patrick's Institution in the near future. This unit, which was designed by a multidisciplinary team, will include a custom-designed facility for the delivery of education, recreation, medical and therapeutic services. The longer-term provision of a dedicated facility on a greenfield site for 110 juveniles – 90 male and 20 female – is also being considered. Having considered a report by the Commissioners of Public Works and the recommendations made and having conferred with the director general of the Irish Prison Service, I decided some time ago that the proposed development of such a facility at Newlands Villa, Naas Road, Clondalkin, Dublin 22, will not now proceed. The identification of another site for the proposed juvenile detention facility is now being pursued in consultation with the director general of the Irish Prison Service and the Office of Public Works.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2312">The running cost, including staff, overtime, prisoner services and maintenance, for the Curragh Place of Detention was €5.7 million in 2002. The Irish Prison Service has advised me that the costs associated with mothballing the institution will be approximately €625,000 in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_2313">Staff cost €3.3 million, excluding overtime, and it will continue to be incurred in the new prisons to which they are assigned. The staff transferred will reduce overtime in those prisons thereby saving overtime payments at premium rates.

        <summary eId="sum_191">In my reply to the Deputy's Question No. 78 today I outlined the position of the educational staff at the Curragh Place of Detention in the event that I am forced to implement the mothballing of the centre.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_192">The centre is a closed institution with a capacity for 102 offenders, the vast majority of whom are sex offenders. The average age of offenders is over 50 years as against a prisons wide average of just under 30 years. Although offenders in the Curragh are in custody for serious crimes they do not pose a significant disciplinary or security risk. It is intended that most offenders detained in the Curragh would be transferred to the Midlands Prison, Portlaoise. Others may be transferred to other institutions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_193">As the move would be from one closed institution to another, there would be no major difference in the level of security under which the offenders are held. The move would be to a modern facility so their custodial conditions would be equivalent to those experienced in the Curragh. The intention would be to make every effort to retain the integrity of the Curragh's multidisciplinary team approach in order to provide for continuity in all regime areas, including education.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2325">On 11 November the Government approved the progressive implementation, from 1 January 2004, of a number of measures in the event of failure to reach agreement with the Prison Officers' Association on the proposed change agenda aimed at eliminating overtime payments and reducing other costs in the Prison Service. These measures included the mothballing of the Fort Mitchel and Curragh Place of Detention.</p>
          <p eId="para_2326">In my response on 18 November I made it clear that I have no desire to close or mothball the institutions at Fort Mitchel or the Curragh. These are actions that were approved by the Government on the basis that the counter proposal submitted by the POA on 7 November was unrealistic. Its proposal did not address the core problem of escalating overtime costs in the Prison Service. It abandoned the concept of annualised hours that both sides had agreed long ago presented the best prospect for dealing with the overtime problem for once and for all. The central feature of the POA proposal was a demand for an increase in basic pay that is totally at variance with the terms of Sustaining Progress and benchmarking coupled with retention of the present discredited prison overtime system.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_194">I want the POA to agree to a reasonable and sustainable cost structure for the continued operation by them of our prisons and the open centres. I want to move forward on the basis of consensus. If that proves to be impossible to achieve I will proceed, as soon as possible, with arrangements for the alternative management of the open centres and the mothballing of Fort Mitchel and the Curragh Places of Detention. In line with existing arrangements regarding the transfer of staff within the Prison Service, I will arrange for the transfer of prison officers from these locations to places to which prisoners from these institutions have been transferred and to institutions where the additional staff would allow the amount of overtime required to be worked to be effectively reduced. Pending the outcome of further talks with the POA, I am not in a position to be more specific on the question of transferring staff from these institutions.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_195">Last Thursday, 20 November, I met the POA. I found our meeting useful and hope that progress may yet be made on the proposals put forward by the official side. My position remains the same. In the absence of an agreed way forward before 1 January 2004 the Government decision of 11 November will be implemented.</summary>

In the period from 1 January to 21 November ten cyclists have died on our roads, representing 3.2% of the total number killed in road accidents. The problems associated with cyclists have been identified and discussed at senior Garda level with a view to putting measures in place to deal effectively with such breaches.

          <p eId="para_2400">My position, which is shared by the Government, is that the proposal put forward by the POA for negotiation is essentially a claim for an improvement in pay. As such claims are precluded under Sustaining Progress, I am not prepared to authorise the Prison Service to enter talks in any forum where a proposal involving such an increase is part of the discussions.</p>
          <p eId="para_2401">The POA proposal does not deal with the key issue that has been at the heart of discussions to date, the elimination of overtime. Both sides agreed to the introduction of an annualised hours system of attendance more than a year ago. It should be the main focus of further discussion but it was also omitted from the POA proposal. Its document envisaged leaving the prison overtime system intact or replacing it through the recruitment of up to 1,200 extra staff. Both propositions are unacceptable and unrealistic. The suggestion that the Irish Prison Service enter into discussions under the auspices of the LRC without preconditions is not a realistic proposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_2402">On 20 November I discussed my position on a resumption of negotiations with the POA. The meeting was useful and I hope that progress may yet be made. In the absence of an agreed way forward, before 1 January 2004, the Government decision of 11 November on alternative cost reduction measures will have to be progressively implemented.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_2404">Given the considerable history to the problem of overtime working in the Prison Service and to dialogue between the parties on the subject, it would not be possible to provide the information sought by the Deputy with absolute precision or completeness. I am informed that the number of meetings that have taken place over the past decade with the POA on this issue is quiet large. Consultations with the POA about tackling this problem have been both protracted and exhaustive.</p>
          <p eId="para_2405">The current efforts to address the problem have their origins in the report of the Prison Service cost review group that was published in 1997. The group comprised POA representatives and it deliberated over a two year period.</p>
          <p eId="para_2406">Arising from that report a team of experts, known as the staffing and operations review team, was set up in October 1998 to conduct a prison by prison, landing by landing, review of prison tasks and staffing. The POA declined an offer to be represented on this group. Over the following two years the SORT team produced 18 detailed reports, one for every prison and place of detention, and a global report that was subsequently issued to every member of staff. Subsequently a 19th report was produced on prisoner escorts.</p>
          <p eId="para_2407">The reports formed the basis for the next stage of the change process initiated in March 2001. They were pursued on a partnership basis through the establishment of a joint staff-management change implementation team. In the course of discussions between March 2001 and July 2002 the POA and management reached a consensus. They agreed that a system of attendance, based on the concept of annualised hours, might be the best prospect of achieving a set of arrangements that would meet the needs of both sides. They also agreed that it should be the main focus of further discussions.</p>
          <p eId="para_2408">Over the ensuing months management set about fleshing out the framework for the change required. On 30 April I outlined the main features of that framework at the POA annual delegate conference. I set a timeframe of 90 days for concluding negotiations between the Irish Prison Service and the POA on the issue. Between May and July the Irish Prison Service met the POA on 12 occasions. At the end of July a composite proposal for change was put to the association.</p>
          <p eId="para_2409">In the absence of agreement on this proposal, I agreed to the appointment of facilitators, Bill Attley, former general secretary of SIPTU, and Joe McGovern, former assistant secretary at the Department of Finance. Between mid-August and mid-September facilitated discussions between the Irish Prison Service and the POA were held on five occasions. During this period the facilitators had separate meetings with both organisations.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_199">The facilitators withdrew from the process in mid-September having concluded that the gap between the sides was too great to be bridged. During the course of those discussions the Irish Prison Service made certain improvements to its proposals for change. On 26 September they were submitted to the POA. The association then conducted a ballot of its members with a recommendation that management's proposals be rejected. The result of the ballot was a clear rejection of the proposals for change.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_200">Apart from the meetings mentioned above, the director general of the Irish Prison Service met the POA on a number of occasions, both formally and informally. He offered to meet them where there were specific issues it wished to raise in order to assist in the process.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_201">Last Thursday I met the POA in an attempt to move the process forward. The meeting proved to be useful and I hope that both sides will be able to return to the negotiating table shortly. I want to move forward on the basis of consensus. If that proves impossible I will have no option but to proceed with arrangements to implement the recent Government decision on alternative cost reduction measures.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2415">Following the World Conference Against Racism in September 2001 my Department embarked on a comprehensive consultative process to identify the key issues on racism here and the priority issues for inclusion in the development of a national plan. The consultation process took place between March 2002 and February 2003 and was overseen by a steering group. The group was comprised representation from Government and non-government organisations, including representatives from the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Education and Science. More details on the steering group are available in the document, Diverse Voices – A Summary of the Outcomes of the Consultative Process and a Proposed Framework for the National Action Plan Against Racism, that is available on my Department's website.</p>
          <p eId="para_2416">Draft recommendations for the national action plan are included in the report, Promoting Anti-racism and Interculturalism in Education, produced by the Department of Education and Science.

          <p eId="para_2417">National newspaper advertisements were placed to encourage submissions to the NPAR. As many as 94 submissions were received and 31 of them were on education. My Department also provided funding to support a wide range of organisations to undertake their own consultative processes. My Department also held a thematic round table on education that involved a range of key stakeholders. A draft of the plan will be forwarded to the relevant Departments in the near future.</p>

Two of the cases involve allegations of collusion by the Garda Síochána, namely, the killings of RUC Chief Superintendent Harry Breen and RUC Superintendent Bob Buchanan in 1989 and the killings of Northern Ireland Lord Justice Gibson and Lady Gibson in 1987. The other four cases relate to allegations of collusion by British security forces. The aim of the process was to determine whether there is sufficient evidence of collusion between State security forces and those responsible for the killings in each case to warrant a public inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_2431">The two Governments publicly committed themselves to publishing Mr. Justice Cory's final reports. They did not commit to publishing the documents on which they are based, subject only to any necessary adjustments, to ensure that the privacy and right to life of individuals is protected and that the relevant Government's obligations to ensuring justice and protecting national security are maintained. As part of the Weston Park agreement, the two Governments committed themselves, in the event that a public inquiry is recommended in any case, that the relevant Government will implement that recommendation.</p>

While there is no similar statutory provision in the case of other courts, it is understood they hold similar meetings. Under the Criminal Justice Act 1993 the Director of Public Prosecutions may, where it appears to him that a sentence imposed on indictment is unduly lenient, apply to the Court of Criminal Appeal to review the sentence.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_208">The complex question of sentencing policy was addressed at length by the Law Reform Commission in 1996 in a report that specifically recommended against the introduction of statutory sentencing guidelines.

When a person is reported missing the local Garda district officer takes direct responsibility for the investigation. He or she will appoint an investigation team to include any specialised unit deemed necessary such as the national bureau of criminal investigation or the technical bureau.

Their view is that while specialist units prove extremely useful in investigating certain types of crime, the nature of missing persons cases requires specific local knowledge both about the area and the circumstances of the person who is missing.

          <p eId="para_2501">As a result of considerable investment, an extra 1,200 prison places have been provided in the past five years. This measure has largely addressed the issue of widespread overcrowding that had become a chronic problem for the prison system by the early 1990s. The Government is committed in An Agreed Programme for Government to continue with the modernisation of prisons and to the provision of sufficient places to avoid serious overcrowding in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_2502">The process is being severely hampered by the overtime crisis in the prisons. Money earmarked for necessary capital projects is being devoured by an overtime system that is out of control. It must be tackled and Deputies will be aware of the efforts that are being made in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_2503">As I have stated before, it is not my preferred option to close, even temporarily, any of our prison institutions. I may be left with no choice if the Prison Officers Association does not agree to annualised hours. It would not result in significantly reduced capacity as the space lost by the mothballing of Fort Mitchel and the Curragh places of detention would be largely offset by the opening of new landings in Limerick Prison and the Midlands Prison. If the running of the open centres at Loughan House and Shelton Abbey is transferred to another agency it is intended that the spaces in these centres will still be available for transfers from prisons of persons under sentence.</p>

However, following on the most recent incidents involving commercial vehicles on two separate occasions over the autumn period, it has been decided that more robust measures are needed to protect the gate, which is a protected structure under the Planning Acts. Plans are being drawn up to insert a steel core in each of the gate pillars to reduce future damage. It is proposed to proceed with this work early in the new year.</p>

In line with this very significant increase in my Department's capital provision for the scheme, recoupment costs have also increased from €6.3 million for 2,512 grants in 1998 to almost €31.5 million for 5,070 grants in 2002. In that time the maximum grant has doubled from €10,158 to €20,320. These very significant increases in the levels of funding provided are a clear indication of the Government's commitment to the disabled person's grant scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_2525">A review of the disabled person's grant scheme is currently being finalised in my Department. On completion of the review, I will be in a position to determine the changes, if any, required to the regulations governing the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_2526">Details of the capital funding being provided for the payment of the disabled person's grants in 2004 will be made available in the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2004 which will be published early in 2004.</p>

          <p eId="para_2528">I recently allocated a sum of €3.81 million for the construction of a new visitor centre for Ballycroy National Park, County Mayo, which is being funded by my Department under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. My Department has already purchased a site for the centre in the village of Ballycroy.</p>
          <p eId="para_2529">The visitor centre will be built into a hill overlooking Blacksod Bay, with the national park to its rear, and will comprise an exhibition area, a cafeteria, educational space and a viewing platform. A planning application for the project will be submitted in the coming weeks. I would hope that, subject to finalisation of design and layout issues, the planning process and tendering procedures, the new visitor centre in Ballycroy will be open to visitors in 2005.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_214">The establishment of the new centre will contribute to a network of heritage sites in Mayo, including the Céide Fields Centre and the National Museum of Country Life at Turlough Park House, Castlebar. I am confident that this network of heritage sites will prove attractive to visitors and will help to promote County Mayo as one of Ireland's premier tourist destinations, as well as contributing to the effective conservation and appreciation of the nation's heritage.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2745">I propose to take Questions Nos. 331 and 345 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2746">My Department has been actively engaged with the Society for the Irish Motor Industry, SIMI, the Irish Motor Vehicle Recyclers Association, IMVRA, the Metal Recyclers Association of Ireland, MRAI, and other stakeholders with a view to developing a producer responsibility initiative, PRI, to implement the European Parliament and Council Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles, ELVs. I have also had meetings with the three main stakeholder groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_2747">Necessary enabling provisions to facilitate implementation of the directive have been incorporated in the Protection of the Environment Act 2003. Part V of the Waste Management Act 1996 – as inserted by section 44 of the Protection of the Environment Act 2003 – explicitly provides for producer responsibility for the free deposit of ELVs at authorised treatment facilities for appropriate treatment and recovery in line with the directive requirements; the mandatory deposit of ELVs by their registered owners at authorised treatment facilities for appropriate treatment and recovery; and the issue of certificates of destruction in respect of ELVs deposited at authorised treatment facilities for scrapping.</p>
          <p eId="para_2748">Agreement in principle was reached in December 2001 that the relevant stakeholder groups would establish a not for profit company to operate an ELV recovery scheme to be subsidised by a fund generated by a levy on imported new and used vehicles. However, it has not been possible to reach agreement on the detailed mechanisms to apply the levy and introduce the scheme as originally envisaged.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_219">My Department is continuing to engage with the relevant stakeholder groups on the detailed mechanisms for the operation of the free ELV take-back arrangements required by the directive, including how such arrangements will be funded. Such detailed mechanisms will be provided for in regulations. It is intended to implement the proposed ELV take-back scheme by means of a PRI which would involve the establishment of a collective industry-based company similar to the Repak model which operates for the recovery and recycling of packaging waste. In accordance with the usual arrangements for PRIs, responsibility for funding the free take-back scheme would, in the main, fall to the motor industry. The timing of the commencement of free ELV take-back is dependent on the conclusion of the discussions with the relevant stakeholder groups. It is my objective that these discussions will be concluded as soon as possible in order to facilitate early implementation of the proposed take back system and to ensure that by the time the directive becomes fully operational in 2007 Ireland has a system in place for the recovery and recycling of ELVs capable of meeting the targets and standards set out in the directive.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_220">I understand that the Minister for Transport, in conjunction with the Attorney General, is considering the question of introducing controls on the sale of vehicles generally including to persons under the licensing age established under the Road Traffic Acts.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_221">Expenditure incurred by my Department on consultancy studies to assist in the implementation of Directive 2000/53/EC on end-of-life vehicles amounts to €177,339.24, inclusive of VAT. There is an agreement with the relevant stakeholder groups that this expenditure will be refunded after the commencement of the proposed ELV take-back scheme to be operated collectively by the relevant stakeholder groups.</summary>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_2750">The current local authority mortgage interest rates are 2.95% variable and 4.45% for five year fixed, which represent competitive rates of lending. Certain fixed interest rate loans issued by local authorities prior to 1988 carry rates in excess of current levels. These fixed interest rates reflect the cost of the long-term funds involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_2751">Since 1980, borrowers with local authority fixed rate mortgages have been permitted to redeem such loans without any interest rate penalty and refinance them in the private sector. This represents a significant concession, having regard to the redemption penalties, of up to six months interest or more, applied by commercial lending agencies in the event of early redemption of such mortgages.</p>
          <p eId="para_2752">The position regarding high fixed interest rates on local authority loans was reviewed in November 2001, in consultation with the Department of Finance. This review determined that a State subsidy to reduce interest rates would not be appropriate.</p>

          <p eId="para_2754">Crowd safety in nightclubs is the responsibility in the first instance of those who manage the clubs and those who own, occupy or are in control of the premises in which the night clubs are run. It is a function of the District Court to consider applications for the registration of clubs and to consider licensing applications made in respect of night clubs for liquor or dance purposes under various enactments. Under section 24 of the Fire Services Act 1981, fire authorities are notice parties to the applications for such licences and may appear, be heard and adduce evidence in respect of the application.</p>
          <p eId="para_2755">Occupant capacity issues and maximum numbers permitted on the premises are reviewed as part of inspections, including during performance inspections, of night clubs undertaken by fire authority inspectors under the Fire Services Act. The Fire Safety in Places of Assembly (Ease of Escape) Regulations 1985 also apply to night clubs and require, <i>inter alia,</i> persons in control to ensure that all escape routes to a place of safety are kept unobstructed and immediately available for use.</p>
          <p eId="para_2756">The Licensing of Indoor Events Act 2003 made provision for a new licensing system to be operated by fire authorities for certain large-scale indoor events as well as amending and updating the enforcement provisions of the Fire Services Act 1981, making it simpler for fire authorities to prosecute offences and strengthening substantially the inspection and advisory powers of fire authority inspectors. The Act also gives statutory backing to existing codes of practice on fire and crowd safety. Under section 30 of the Act, an authorised fire authority inspector may, in addition to inspection and advisory powers, serve a closure notice with immediate effect where a premises poses a serious or immediate risk to the safety of persons on or in the premises at any time. The latter provisions came into effect from 14 July 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_2757">The measures outlined above relate to fire authority powers to deal with issues of overcrowding in night clubs and are in addition to the powers of the Garda Síochána and other public authorities under other legislative codes.</p>

          <p eId="para_2822">I propose to take Questions Nos. 336, 337 and 342 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2823">An audit trail forms an integral part of the electronic voting and counting system from ballot paper preparation and printing, programming of ballot modules, installation of ballot papers and preparation of voting machines to testing the machines prior to their despatch to polling stations. Further verification procedures are undertaken by the presiding officer in the polling station before voting commences and when the poll closes.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_223">The verification of votes cast is also provided by the system. When using the voting machine, the voter will see his or her preferences beside the candidates' photographs and the details of each preference will be shown separately on the voting machine display screen. Before pressing the "Cast Vote" button, a voter can amend the ballot preferences recorded on the voting machine screen. Finally, the system software will allow for the printing of a ballot paper for each vote cast, without attribution to an individual voter, where a court order to this effect is obtained at an election petition. The inclusion in the system of a facility for printing a ballot paper as the cast vote button is pressed and its retention in the voting machine was not considered necessary due to the proven accuracy of the software used, as certified by the international accredited institute and the voting machine's track record of many years use in the Netherlands and in parts of Germany. Some of the proponents of this facility have now accepted that it would not be useful for an audit on the election result as a different result would be obtained due to the legal provision to mix the votes. In addition, the use of such a facility would probably be unconstitutional as it would create a direct link between the voter and the ballot paper which the Supreme Court ruled against in the McMahon case in 1971.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_224">In relation to voter turnout, the principal aim in introducing electronic voting and counting is to seek to modernise the election system in Ireland including making it easier for electors to vote. Its impact on voter turnout will not be definitively known until after its use for a number of polls. I have expressed the view previously that the new system may give rise to more interest in the electoral process. In addition, the major information and awareness campaign on electronic voting to be undertaken next year will also seek actively to encourage and increase voter participation.</summary>

          <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_2828">For commonage farmers affected by stocking level restrictions, both the REP scheme and the national scheme administered by my Department require the full application of the relevant commonage framework plan at farm level. The main difference relates to the calculation and levels of payments arising.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_226">The payments in REPS are standard area based payments, whereas in the national scheme payments will be based on proven actual loss due to the restrictions imposed and, subject to certain limits, will be proportional to the number of stock removed from the commonage. Participants in REPS receive set annual payments for a five year period. Under the national scheme, from 2004 participants will also sign up to a five year plan, but will receive annual payments which will vary according to their actual loss in each year. The calculation of REPS payments also includes an incentive element which is not present in the national scheme. It should also be noted that no payments will be made under the national scheme for reductions of stock above five ewe equivalents per hectare calculated over the farm as a whole.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_227">Farmers choosing in 2004 between REPS and the national scheme will need to be aware of the implications of decoupling. When decoupling is implemented, REPS payments will not change, but the amount payable under the national scheme is likely to reduce substantially when elements such as ewe premium are incorporated in the new single payment and are no longer taken into account in compiling figures for the actual losses sustained by destocking.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2848">I propose to take Questions Nos. 349 and 351 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_2849">The Abridged Estimates Volume, AEV, for 2004 provide for total social welfare spending of €10.65 billion. This represents an increase of €358 million or 3.5% on the 2003 published Estimate. This increase does not take into account any additional social welfare spending to be announced in the forthcoming budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_2850">To stay within Government spending guidelines, a number of policy measures were identified leading to total savings in 2004 estimated at €55.8 million or 0.5% of total spending. The specific policy measures are shown below together with the Estimates for the associated savings and the number of recipients affected by each measure.</p>
          <p eId="para_2851">The back to education allowance is being refocused on people who are long-term unemployed in that the qualifying period for the allowance is being increased from six months to 15 months, in respect of the third level option, for all new claimants with effect from September 2004. The estimated savings arising from this measure are €2.2 million in 2004. Existing recipients of back to education allowance will not be affected nor will applicants for the second level option. It would have been expected that some 1,200 persons between six and 15 months unemployed would have qualified for the allowance in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_2852">Transitional payments for recipients of the one parent family payment, where earnings rise over €293 per week, will be discontinued from next January. The savings in 2004 will be €1.3 million and the measure will affect some 350 beneficiaries in 2004. It is expected, however, that there will be an increased take-up of family income supplement which is the main income support for persons with children in employment.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_230">A number of measures in relation to the supplementary welfare allowance, SWA, rent supplement scheme will be implemented with effect from January next. These include an increase in the rate of the minimum contribution to be made by the recipient from €12 to €13 per week. This measure will result in savings of €3 million in 2004 and will affect approximately 60,000 recipients; if either of a couple is in full-time employment, they will be excluded from claiming rent-mortgage supplement. This measure will save €1 million and will affect 350 recipients in 2004; health boards will be given the power to refuse rent  supplement in cases where the applicant has not already been renting for a period of six months, with provision for exceptions in relation to, for example, the homeless and people who are at risk. It is expected that some 4,000 applications for rent supplement will be affected by this measure, with an estimated net saving of €10.5 million in 2004; and rent supplement claimants will be referred to the local authority to have their housing needs assessed. In addition, any applicant who has left or refused offers of local authority housing will be refused rent supplement. It is estimated that approximately 100 such cases may arise in the year which will generate savings of approximately €600,000.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_231">Payment of certain other supplements under the supplementary welfare scheme are being phased out or discontinued in the light of changes in the environment in which these supplements apply or where they have been applied beyond what was originally intended. The crèche supplement, which had been applied beyond its original score, is being discontinued from January 2004. It is expected that some 1,600 people who would otherwise have applied for the supplement will be affected, with savings of some €2.3 million. The supplement to support arrangements under the money advice and budgeting service is also being discontinued from January, affecting some 370 persons and with savings of some €700,000.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_232">The diet supplement scheme is being restructured to take account of changes in the level of social welfare payments generally. The expected savings in 2004 are €1 million approximately, with 13,500 supplements affected.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_233">In relation to the diet supplement, the current basis for calculating the amount of supplement payable in individual cases was put in place in 1996. In general, the amount of supplement payable is either €34.28, lower cost diets, or €44.44, higher cost diets, less one third – one sixth in the case of couples – of the applicant's income at 1996 social welfare payment rates. In the case of children under the age of 18 there is a standard rate of €10.20 per week for a higher cost diet and €6.40 per week for a lower cost diet.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_234">The assessment of means for diet supplement has not changed since 1996 to take into account increases in the real value of weekly social welfare payments or changes in the cost of special diets. Similarly, the rates of payment have not changed since 1996. The cost of diets is to be updated to take account of inflation since 1996 and the means test will be based on current social welfare payment rates.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_235">In the case of future applicants for diet supplement, the amount of supplement payable will be based on the revised diet costs less one third – one sixth in the case of a couple – of the applicant's current income. Consequently, the amount of diet supplement payable will be adjusted as social welfare rates increase in the future.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_236">A person in receipt of a diet supplement prior to the introduction of the revised regulations will continue to receive the current rate of supplement until such time as there is a change in his or her circumstances that would warrant a review of the supplement.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_237">A number of changes were also announced in relation to schemes funded from the social insurance fund: entitlement to child dependant allowance will be discontinued in January 2004 in respect of unemployment benefit and disability benefit claims where the claimant's spouse-partner has gross weekly earnings in excess of €300. This provision is estimated to save €10.4 million and will affect, on average, 16,800 recipients; in the case of disability benefit, unemployment benefit and health and safety benefit the weekly earnings threshold of €88.88 for the purpose of payment of reduced rates which has not being adjusted in line with increases in benefit since its introduction in 1993 will be increased to €50. The increase will result in net savings of €7.4 million and will affect, on average, 10,300 recipients; entitlement to the additional half rate payment of disability benefit, injury benefit, unemployment benefit, unemployability supplement, maternity benefit, adoptive benefit and health and safety benefit, currently payable at half rate, where the recipient is already in receipt of widow/ers pensions, lone parent payments etc. for new claimants, will be discontinued. A saving of €5.8 million is estimated and the measure will apply to an estimated weekly average of 2,000 claimants; from April 2004, the linking period for unemployment benefit and disability benefit claims will increase from 13 weeks to 26 weeks. This condition will apply to approximately a weekly average of 275 claimants and result in a saving of €2 million; the underlying number of paid contributions required for entitlement to disability benefit, unemployment benefit and health and safety benefit will be increased from 39 to 52 paid contributions. A total of €2.5 million will be saved in 2004, affecting a weekly average of 400 claimants; entitlement to unemployment benefit will be reduced from 15 months to 12 months where less than 260 PRSI contributions have been paid since first entering employment. This measure will affect a weekly average of 700 recipients and save some €5.2 million.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2857">To determine entitlement to one parent family payment, it is necessary to establish that the statutory conditions are satisfied. This involves inquiries as to the applicant's means and, in the case of separated applicants, it also involves inquiries as to the arrangements for maintenance and, in some cases, a visit to the applicant's spouse. The amount of work involved in establishing that the conditions of the scheme are met is reflected in the time it takes to complete these inquiries.</p>
          <p eId="para_2858">The vast majority of one parent family payment applicants are in receipt of another social welfare payment while their claim is being processed. Such payment will normally continue until entitlement to one parent family payment is determined.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_238">Every effort is made to process applications as quickly as possible and to minimise the time during which applicants have to rely on these alternative forms of support. In this regard, arrangements have continued to devolve the administration of one parent family payments to the Department's network of local offices. This is intended primarily to improve client service by reducing claim processing times through closer linkage with the local investigative officer network, as well as in providing more direct local contact for lone parents with the Department's employment support services.</summary>

          <p eId="para_2864">The significant improvements which have been made in recent years to the maximum disabled person's grant and the level of recoupment available have resulted in increased levels of demand with expenditure on the scheme increasing from €13 million for 2,455 grants in 1998 to €52.6 million for 5,932 grants in 2002. In line with this very significant increase in my Department's capital provision for the scheme, recoupment costs have also increased from €6.3 million for 2,512 grants in 1998 to almost €31.5 million for 5,070 grants in 2002. In that time the maximum grant has doubled from €10,158 to €20,320.

      <b>Mr. S. Ryan</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Social and Family Affairs</b>
      if she will review the current requirements for entitlements for retirement and old age contributory pensions with particular reference to full rate social insurance contributions or credits from 1955; and if she will consider reducing the average yearly requirements with a pro rata reduction in payments.

          <p eId="para_2905">In recent years, the Government has introduced a number of measures designed to make qualification for pensions easier for people with reduced or broken insurance records. These measures can be of particular benefit to women who may not have complete social insurance records.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_244">In 1997, the average yearly number of contributions required for a minimum pension was reduced from 20 contributions to ten.Pro rata pensions are also available for people with insurance contributions at different rates or from other EU countries or countries with whom Ireland has signed a bilateral agreement. In addition, special pensions were introduced for those with pre-1953 contributions and for self employed who were already over 56 years of age in 1988 when compulsory insurance was introduced for that group.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_245">Measures are also in place since 1994 to protect the pension entitlements of those who take time out of the paid workforce for caring duties. This scheme, known as the homemaker's scheme, allows for up to 20 years to be disregarded when a person's insurance record is being averaged for pensions purposes. Further changes to the qualifying conditions for contributory pensions would have to be considered in the budgetary context. The homemaker's scheme is being examined as part of an overall review of qualifying conditions for old age contributory and retirement pensions. The report of this review is at an advanced stage of preparation. Changes to the operation of the scheme will be examined in the light of the conclusions of this review.</summary>
