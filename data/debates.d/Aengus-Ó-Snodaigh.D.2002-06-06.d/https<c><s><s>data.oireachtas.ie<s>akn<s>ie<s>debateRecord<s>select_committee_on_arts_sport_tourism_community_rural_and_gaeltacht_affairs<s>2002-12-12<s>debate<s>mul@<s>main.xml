          <p eId="para_16">In page 7, between lines 38 and 39, to insert the following subsection:</p>
          <p eId="para_17">"(2) The Minister shall consider the matter of regional representation when appointing the members of the Council.".</p>
          <p eId="para_18">The Minister may be aware that people in different parts of the country were dissatisfied in the past because their areas were not represented on the Arts Council. At one time, no member of the council was from south of a line across the country. It seems that we cannot convince the Minister to create a council of 12 members, rather than eight, but I hope that regional representation will be taken into account when the members of the council are appointed. It is difficult to represent all parts of the country as each region consists of different counties - there are many counties in the mid-west, and the south-west is made up of counties Kerry and Cork. A person from one county may not be seen as representing the other. It is important that there is a distribution of people from across the country who can look after their regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">In the 1980s, the Arts Council had a system of regional officers. Perhaps the Minister could look at the regions to which those officers were appointed. I realise he must appoint experts in the visual and performance arts to the board. I recommend that the Minister attempt to achieve a balance between regional representation and expertise.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">With regard to amendment No. 31, it is important that the Minister is mindful of the Irish language when he is appointing members of the council. Some of them at least should be proficient in the language because it would be difficult to expect them to be very proactive with regard to Irish language arts if that were not the case. It is also important that there should be representation from Northern Ireland. There has always been a representative from the North on previous Arts Councils and it would be a good idea, if possible, to provide for that in the legislation. The person might be from the equivalent council in Northern Ireland, particularly as North-South relations are very strong in the cultural field. Both arts councils work hand in hand on a number of programmes and in this era of reconciliation, co-operation and cross-Border bodies, it would be useful to appoint a representative from Northern Ireland. People from the North have been appointed to the Senate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_6">
          <from>Mr. Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_21">I have concerns with regard to the number of members on the Arts Council. Appointing eight will make it difficult for the Minister to create the broad balance necessary to reflect the wide range of arts under the council's remit. Considering the number of representations that have been made to us, the Minister's job in that regard is going to be difficult. I ask him to consider providing in the committees section of the Bill to make the majority of appointments the responsibility of the Arts Council. The Minister controls the majority appointment of three as against two for the Arts Council. Is it feasible to provide for the three to be appointed by the council?</p>
          <p eId="para_22">The cross-Border programmes have been very beneficial in terms of building relationships between the North and the South. I lend my voice to Deputy Deenihan's amendment which seeks to provide for Northern Ireland representation. I also ask the Minister to reconsider the appointment of eight members rather than 12 which will make it difficult to achieve balance.</p>

          <p eId="para_23">I am slightly in favour of amendment No. 31 in the name of Deputy Deenihan. It is interesting that he uses the word "may" instead of "shall". If we accept the amendment, the wording should be changed to provide that the Minister shall consider the matter of Irish language representation. Section 28(5) provides that the council's staff must be sufficiently fluent in Irish and English. I know of no reason that provision should not be made in regard to council members. If people are not versed in the Irish language, simultaneous translation could be provided. That could be the way to amend the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">No term of office is set down in the Bill for the chairman of the council. We are not told how long the chairman can serve, how often he or she can be appointed or whether he or she can be continuously selected. I do not know if that oversight can be corrected between now and Report Stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_26">Everyone will agree that the best people should serve on the Arts Council, which makes it essential that the Minister be in a position to make the right choices. Proposals that regional, Irish language, particular art form and Northern Irish representation should feed into the selection process are not compatible with how the council should develop. The council can never represent all relevant groups and, in many contexts, an emphasis on being representative can lead to council or board members seeing as their role the looking after of a given group or region. They might not, therefore, take an overview of circumstances and this would not be desirable. It is important that people from a given discipline take an overview in the way it is important that people from the regions look at things from the perspective of the country as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">My emphasis is on choosing the best people. It must be open to the Minister of the day to appoint members purely on merit and ability to do the job without reference to other factors. I accept it is important to achieve some regional balance, but the council membership should not be allowed to suffer because of that. If persons from a given region are good enough to be appointed that is that. It is not desirable that choice should be restricted in the manner suggested. We should have as broad a spread as possible in so far as it can be achieved, but it would not serve the interests of the sector if we were to insert in the legislation restrictions on who should be a member of the Arts Council.</p>

          <p eId="para_28">While I sympathise with the Minister's view, I ask him to give some form of expression to his positive disposition towards regional balance and the appointment of members from the North. The other aspect of the amendment refers to the 1951 Act which stipulated that the chairperson of the Arts Council be appointed by the President. In reducing the number of members of the Arts Council the Minister's proposals also refer to the original legislation. The new council will have eight members while the then council had seven. The reason the chairperson was appointed by the President was that politicians wanted to ensure that the council was seen to be as independent as possible and at arm's length from the political system. It would be a positive gesture to place the appointment of the chairperson in the President's hands. Legislation introduced in the meantime contains nothing to prevent this proposal, neither is there anything in the Constitution to prevent it. If it was right in 1951, it can be right now.</p>

          <p eId="para_29">It would not be desirable for the President to become involved in the selection of the chairperson of the Arts Council. I have been relatively consistent since becoming Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism in terms of my appointments, which have to date been based on merit. If one considers my recent appointments, for example, to the National Gallery of Ireland, I think everyone will agree that Mr. Lochlann Quinn, Mr. Bruce Arnold and Mr. Anthony Cronin are eminent figures in the field of arts and paintings. I will ensure the Arts Council is populated by the best people, not by members of the Fianna Fáil Party. It would be fair if people were to differ with me and argue that my appointees are not the best people for the job, but there will be a good representation on the Arts Council. I have some people in mind at the moment, although not the full complement of the council. I am convinced it is important that discretion be left open.</p>

The current position is that a person can be reappointed as often as one wishes. I am not sure this is such a good idea and, therefore, I would welcome members' views on it. In some organisations, for example, Horse Racing Ireland, there is a roll-over of membership and there is also legislation which forbids the appointment of members to certain boards beyond two terms. This is to ensure there is fresh thinking. I am open to suggestion on this interesting matter. I am not a great believer in the concept of longevity in the context of membership of boards.</p>

It is fair to assume that they, in appointing the three members, would have a broad insight into the range of arts required in these cases. While I accept the Minister will not appoint five members of his party, this is beside the point, which is that the members of the Arts Council, given the depth of knowledge they have in their own field and the arts generally, are capable of appointing committee members.</p>

          <p eId="para_36">I have listened carefully to the Minister. I was previously in a position of appointing boards. All things being equal, my strong view is that ministerial appointment is the best way to proceed. If, for instance, one allows vocational nominations, one tends to get people who are good at getting themselves elected, rather than those with most to offer. With regard to the sub-committees it could equally be advanced that allowing the Minister to appoint the majority on the sub-committee could mean they will feel beholden to him. There is nothing personal in this remark. I am considering how the legislation will operate down the line. If, as happens in many organisations, the Arts Council is divided up into a number of sub-committees, an issue of people being beholden to others will not arise. The issue then is that the council as a body could appoint the other people rather than the Minister. I see much merit in that idea because the council will be in a position to define more clearly the people required, something which should not come within the day to day business of the Minister. The arm's length principle should apply. While I fully support the idea that the Minister should nominate all members of the Arts Council, his role should stop there and the council should decide internally who should be appointed.</p>

In light of the Minister's guarantee that he will choose the best people and ensure there is a regional balance, I have no problem with the proposal.

          <p eId="para_54">A number of interesting issues were raised during the course of the debate. One of them, which we did not get around to discussing because it was ruled out of order, was the gender quota for the council. The recommendation is for four men and four women, which we hoped to raise to six of each in the context of a 12-member council. As Deputy Deenihan pointed out, in regard to any change in the number of members, the amendment will have to come from the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">Is the Minister seriously considering increasing the size of the Arts Council? In regard to the duration of council membership, some people continue to make a good contribution to a board for many years while others do not. A balance has to be struck. Two full terms is probably adequate for any member. It is necessary to have a balance in regional representation as well as in regard to the various branches of the arts, such as having a representative view in terms of the Irish language. It is my experience that many people who are inclined towards the arts also speak the Irish language. An amendment could be introduced to the effect that the Minister, when appointing the council, should have in mind a regional balance as well as a balanced spread within the various branches of the arts, in addition to a consideration in favour of the Irish language.</p>

If council membership is increased to 12, it would automatically follow that the provision in regard to equality would also be implemented. It is important that we put this into the legislation because the experience has been that when it comes to appointments the level of participation by women is not always recognised. Sometimes they do not want to be appointed but the only sure way of improving the situation is by including a specified gender balance in the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_76">In the new Bill, section 14 sets out that the chairperson and the ordinary members will be paid such remuneration and such allowances for expenses as the Minister, with the approval of the Minister for Finance, may determine. While members of the Arts Council, particularly the chairperson, would not seek remuneration, they should be given some recompense. That is more or less standard across the semi-State sector. We will have to examine the issue and see what provision can be made. I am not talking about paying them a fortune. It is often forgotten that people who serve on State boards do a great deal of public service. It is sometimes thought they are delighted to be members of these boards, but they are actually doing the State a favour.</p>

It seems that the period in question was particularly fraught. One cannot restrict the number of meetings. However, if the Arts Council is meeting too often people cannot always be present.

          <p eId="para_96">The next amendment relates to the Freedom of Information Act, 1997. It would ensure that the ban on giving information in this section would not interfere with disclosure of documents under the FOI. We want the Freedom of Information Act to apply to the new council and there would be no restrictions in that regard. The next amendment is to ensure the Freedom of Information Act shall continue to apply to the council. I do not think the Bill provides for that.

Representations were made to us on this issue and the people we met feel the Arts Council has disregarded the traditional arts. The committee should have the right to make funding recommendations to the council. I hope the Minister will give an overview of what he believes to be the position regarding the traditional Irish arts. We have also received representations from the arts officers of local authorities and a standing committee is also necessary for this area. I do not see the need for another committee regarding innovation. That should remain within the remit of the Arts Council.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnODonoghue" eId="spk_69" as="#Minister_for_Arts,_Sport_and_Tourism">
          <from>Mr. O’Donoghue</from>
          <p eId="para_104">We have arrived at what Kelsen, the German philosopher, would have described as the <i>grundnorm</i>. This is a difficult area. The debate on the traditional Irish arts standing committee is quite simple. Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann has argued that it does not receive sufficient funding from the Arts Council and that the proposed standing committee would address this issue. Others in the traditional arts accept that point but oppose the standing committee because it would marginalise the traditional arts and lead to stagnation in the future. We have two conflicting arguments which, ironically, come from the traditional arts sector itself. It will be virtually impossible to ensure that the twain can meet.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">Few would argue that traditional Irish arts have not received the degree of funding to which they are entitled. The sector deserves more funding. That is not to say that Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann is not funded because the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs funds it. In the past, the Arts Council has, in different guises, funded traditional Irish arts.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">Comhaltas Ceoltóirí Éireann has argued that there should be a standing committee with power to make recommendations on funding to the Arts Council. Any such recommendation would be powerful. Against that, the argument runs that this would create a council within the Arts Council, which would not be helpful. Those opposed to the standing committee say that if it is established it will marginalise the traditional arts and lead to their stagnation.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">The element of compulsion may have militated against the Irish spirit but there has been an admirable flowering and growth of gaelscoileanna across the country in recent years which should be encouraged. In recent years the traditional Irish arts have flourished, not just at home but internationally. We have never seen a period in our history where the traditional Irish arts have been so admired across the globe. It has been heartwarming to see, for example, the success of Irish dancing. None of this occurred because traditional Irish arts were compulsory or because there was a standing committee because there is none. We must address why it occurred.</p>
          <p eId="para_108">This is a young vibrant democracy with its faults but it also has much to boast of. Among those things of which it has a right to be proud are its language and traditional arts. Those opposed to the traditional arts standing committee make the point vehemently that this young vibrant democracy should be sufficiently assertive and sure of its place in the world to be able to ensure expression is given to traditional Irish arts without the necessity for a traditional Irish arts standing committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">The standing committees would be in place for as long as the Arts Act. There is an argument that the proposed section, as it stands, is a rigid mechanism. Those opposed to any standing committee make the argument that in five or ten years' time, other issues than the three committees suggested here would become of more immediate importance and would be of greater relevance but there would be no provision for any such new standing committees. Under the legislation as it stands, the standing committee on the traditional Irish arts would be the only one with powers of financial disbursement and there are those who argue strongly that this should not be the case as it would place the Irish traditional arts in a different category to all other art forms. It is argued that it would not be right to ring-fence the sector in that manner because it would stagnate and ghettoise traditional Irish arts. It is important, whatever decision we reach, and we must reach one, that we avoid what happened to the Irish language in the past when it was marginalised from the rest of our culture. Whether I state specifically what I plan to do today is irrelevant.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">The Arts Council has not developed a coherent policy on the traditional Irish arts. The other two standing committees have not been thought out as fully as might be possible, nor indeed have they been sought by any major or significant sector of the arts community. The proposed standing committee for artistic innovation, for example, seems to be relatively curious. I am not sure innovation can be discussed in a vacuum.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">I concur with Deputy O'Malley's point that it is neither accurate nor constructive to place traditional and contemporary as opposites. Where does that leave The Chieftains, Riverdance, Martin Hayes or Sharon Shannon? There are solutions to this debate but they are difficult and could cause much controversy within the sector. Paramount in our considerations should be a workable and imaginative Arts Act for the next 20 years or so and it is in that context and spirit that we will approach possible solutions to the problems outlined. It is important that members of the committee have the opportunity to discuss this matter in its entirety and know the arguments. I have put forward what I consider to be both sides of the argument. I have also indicated that I am not happy with the legislation as it stands on section 21. As there should be change, let us discuss it constructively.</p>
