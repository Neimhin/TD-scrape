          <p eId="para_13">As I set out on the last occasion, the main purpose of this amendment is to ensure that tribunals do not unnecessarily intrude on journalistic and other confidences.  I set out the arguments why the Minister, in so far as I can understand him, has said that essentially the Supreme Court is seized of the same issue and will hand down its decision imminently and that it would be would be wrong for him to accept an amendment in those set of circumstances.  I am not sure that is a compelling argument for a number of reasons.  I recall us legislating in anticipation of a Supreme Court decision on a few occasions in order to secure the ship of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">The Minister says we can revisit it after we get the Supreme Court decision, but we are unlikely to revisit it.  We know that this is the one shot at it.  When I asked the Minister whether he would table an amendment of his own or this one, if the Supreme Court hands down its decision before Report Stage, he refused to commit himself.  I think therefore that this is the one shot we have at it.  Protection of journalistic sources and other confidential information is important in our democratic society.  Paragraph (2) of my amendment is extremely well balanced.  The Minister quoted it back to me on the last day, pointing out that the latter half of it is the negative of the amendment itself, but of course that is not true.  The latter half of it qualifies that privilege.  It is right that it should be qualified that a person cannot be punished or found guilty of an offence in terms of the normal use of journalistic privilege unless the tribunal is satisfied that disclosure of the source is essential in order to protect the constitutional rights of some other person or outweighs the public interest.  If the tribunal is in possession of all the facts and decides that in a particular case it would be outweighed by the public interest, so be it.  It is not negativing it, it is seeking to balance it.  It is a restrictive amendment, far more than some journalists and others would want, but there are good reasons that should be the case.  I hope the Minister has had an opportunity to reflect on it and may feel able to accept it on this occasion.  I am sure he is well aware of the ancient tests for privilege, reaffirmed in our Cook and Carroll case, that laid down four stringent tests.  Those tests would suggest that a fairly high hurdle has to be jumped.  I hope he can accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_15">As I said before, no one is denying — I think it is widely accepted by the courts and people generally — that journalists are entitled to protect their sources, but it is not an unlimited right.  We are trying to improve tribunals which have been dogged by leaks and the misuse of documents that are given in confidence.  For a tribunal to work properly it must have the element of compellability, the ability to force people to come and give evidence, and to discuss with them, even beforehand, the portent of what the tribunal is about.  At the same time, however, it must be done in such a way that the tribunal respects the confidence of people who ultimately it might not call.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">Irrespective of whether there was a Supreme Court decision, I would not be able to accept an amendment along the lines the Deputy is proposing.  I think he knows well why that is the case.  From the point of view of the tribunal, if it wants to compel people and in effect demand compliance with its procedures, particularly on the non-publication of material before it, the amendment would render its task unworkable.  The Supreme Court decision, which I understand is due before the end of this month, may well have significant ramifications for the right of journalists to protect their sources.  I am not saying that we would be hanging on the court's words concerning the portent of this particular amendment.  However, irrespective of whether we were examining this issue after the Supreme Court's decision, Deputy Rabbitte's amendment is confusing in the way it is drafted.  The principle he is trying to get across here is not possible, particularly in the context of tribunals.  It is not possible from a legislative point of view in the wider context.</p>

          <p eId="para_19">I was minded to facilitate the Minister in moving on because he obviously will not accept my amendment.  However, I will certainly not sit here and listen to him say that the amendment is confusing because that is utter nonsense.  Let me read the "confusing" paragraph to the Minister: "(2) A tribunal shall not require a person to disclose, nor shall a person be guilty of an offence for refusing to disclose, the source of any information to which this section applies given by that person to the tribunal, unless the tribunal is satisfied that disclosure of the source is essential in order to protect the constitutional rights of some other person and outweighs the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of the communication."  How is that confusing?  It is qualifying the circumstances in which a person may or may not disclose.  It is a regular feature of legislation, that the right conferred may be qualified.  In this case it is qualified by a person's constitutional rights.  If there could be adverse implications for such rights and it outweighs the public interest in preserving the confidentiality of that communication, it ought to do so.  I do not mind the Minister rejecting my amendment, which he had set his face against from day one, but I do mind him suggesting that it is confusing.  It is not in the slightest confusing.</p>

It could be headed by somebody else and it is not for them to decide.  A tribunal does not decide the constitutional rights of individuals; that is up to a court.  In the proposed amendment, the Deputy is giving a tribunal the ability to decide on the constitutional rights.  He is putting a statutory obligation and is giving a very wide opportunity for anyone to disclose information, but is then curtailing it by using the word "unless".  In effect, however, he is giving the tribunal the right to determine the constitutional rights, but it has no such right under existing legislation.</p>

Section 20(1) states, "...where a tribunal is satisfied that the evidence has already been given to it ... in written form".  There are other ways to present evidence.  Is an amendment needed to cover audiovisual or physical evidence and so on?  That should be reflected in the legislation.  The section deals with evidence in written form.  Is there provision for an international dimension?  Does "written form" apply only to international witnesses or a tribunal with a cross-jurisdictional element?  For instance, if a tribunal was set up to deal with the Dublin-Monaghan bombings, State collusion or human rights abuses, how would the matter be dealt with?  Is there a method by which witnesses could be compelled to present evidence in some form?  Would the tribunal have the powers to travel abroad and sit outside the jurisdiction to take evidence, whether in written form or the other forms I mentioned?</p>

The legislation before us should protect the integrity of documentation submitted and that of the people whose names arise in evidence.  It should be considered a serious breach of law if documents before a tribunal are aired anywhere outside that tribunal prior to its concluding its deliberations.

With regard to subsection (6) an investigator may only make applications to the High Court with the consent of the relevant tribunal.  This subsection relates to a failure or refusal to comply with a requirement made to a person by an investigator.  In other words, the requirement is that of the investigator and not that of the tribunal or the member thereof.

There is no big point of principle involved.

          <p eId="para_112">With regard to amendment No. 54, the tribunal should be able to deal with most threats of prejudice by means of a reporting restriction.  We have had that experience.  Amendment No. 59 refers to the same point as amendment No. 53 and seeks to insert the word "significant".  Amendment No. 60 is another repetition of a point made already.</p>

        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_62" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">

          <p eId="para_113">I propose to take amendments Nos. 53, 54, 59 and 60 together.  Amendments Nos. 53 and 59 are related.  The whole idea of the proceedings of tribunals is that they be held in public, which is merely a restatement of the existing legislation — the Tribunals of Inquiry Acts from 1921 to 2004 as they stand.  The public interest is not served if, from the proceedings of a tribunal there is a risk of prejudice to criminal or civil proceedings that are taken or in progress.  I do not accept that we should attempt to qualify the risk as having to be "significant".  Such a standard would be unacceptable and would, probably, lead to more judicial challenges than would be normal.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">Amendments Nos. 54 and 60 suggest that the risk of prejudice to civil and criminal proceedings could be removed by the operation of reporting restrictions and that the public hearings could, therefore, go ahead.  That would not be a particularly practical solution in that it would, to a certain extent, go against the desire to have proceedings in public.  This takes us back to Deputy Rabbitte's previous amendment relating to journalists' reportage and involvement in tribunals.  To a certain extent, this amendment would curtail their ability in that regard and reporting restrictions might be used on a frequent basis.  That element might be over used in order to do what Deputy Rabbitte proposes to do in these amendments.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_115">I am amazed at the negative manner in which we always write legislation.  We have never managed to master plain English.  It is very difficult to follow the double and treble negatives in this Bill.  I have sympathy for what Deputy Rabbitte was trying to do in his amendment and agree the tribunals should be open to the public as often as possible.  However, in this Bill it is proposed that this be in the opinion of the tribunal, whereas in terms of the constitutional case covered in a previous amendment, the Minister said the tribunal could not make that opinion.  Now, it can make an opinion that it be not expedient to have the tribunals open in certain cases.  I believe this section concerning restricting public access to tribunals should be tied to section 31, where the tribunal would have to seek a direction from the courts to prevent the public from attending.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">Another point I would make is that "open to the public" can refer to more ways than one.  One meaning could be taken as meaning the public could attend.  Another meaning that was covered in the Law Reform Commission report is not dealt with in this Bill.  It concerns allowing the proceedings of inquiries to be broadcast.  The recommendation from the Law Reform Commission — the Minister said previously that most of the recommendations were taken on board — was that the tribunals of inquiry legislation be amended to allow the discretion to permit broadcasting of proceedings as a tribunal considers appropriate, on the basis that in deciding whether to allow filming, recording or broadcasting of the proceedings of the tribunal, "the tribunal shall have regard to the following considerations ...".  The commission went on to list those considerations.  The commission stated that the main arguments for allowing the broadcasting of proceedings were that the public could see what was being done and could have confidence that everything was being done in order to arrive at the truth.  That is the basis of the courts, that justice be seen to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_117">That recommendation is in the report of the Law Reform Commission and was included in its draft Bill in section 17(4).  However, it is not reflected in the Bill before us.  Will the Minister indicate why this was not considered?  I also wish to indicate that I will table amendments on Report Stage to give effect to both this and the previous point I made regarding a tribunal having to get the direction of the High Court under section 31 of the Bill to allow it to restrict access.</p>

          <p eId="para_118">The Deputy is correct that this was considered by the Law Reform Commission and it was one of the recommendations, although a relatively soft one.  It is proposed to continue with the existing legislation which does not include a provision for broadcasting.  The situation will continue whereby it is up to a tribunal to decide itself what will be its <i>modus operandi </i>for public hearings and whether they will be broadcast.  This is the fairest option.  As the tribunal proceeds, it would understand the merit or otherwise of it being broadcast.  There may very well be people coming in to play to the gallery and against the interests of the tribunal, using the opportunity to make life difficult for it.  Coming from our profession, we would all want everything to be in public but there may be circumstances where it might not be in the best interests of the matter in hand to have public hearings.  This decision should be left to the tribunal itself, given that it has been given wide powers by the Oireachtas to investigate.</p>

          <p eId="para_119">Deputy Ó Snodaigh has raised an important point in respect of sub-paragraph 1(<i>a</i>).  In terms of sub-paragraph 1(<i>b</i>), I have withdrawn my amendments because the Minister stated that it would be an intolerably high standard.  He also stated that it would be likely to give rise to litigation as to the difference between a risk and a significant risk.  It seems he is probably correct in this regard and I will think about for Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_120">I think Deputy Ó Snodaigh's point is more important.  To what kind of situation would they not apply?  Section 24(1) states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_121">...a tribunal shall not refuse to allow the public to be present at any of the proceedings of the tribunal unless in the opinion of the tribunal—</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_122">(<i>a</i>) it is in the public interest expedient so to do for reasons connected with the matters the subject of the inquiry or the nature of the evidence to be given,</p>
          <p eId="para_123">Is there any set of circumstances that might not be encompassed by this?  In terms of the recent Mahon tribunal in particular, I can foresee many learned gentlemen on their feet pleading under section 24(1) <i>(a)</i> that the matter be held in private.  Am I reading this correctly?</p>

          <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_124">This is something I will consider for Report Stage.  The Law Reform Commission recommends that tribunals of inquiry legislation be amended to allow discretion to permit such broadcasting of the proceedings as the tribunal considers appropriate on the basis that in deciding whether to allow film recording broadcasting, tribunals shall have regard to the following considerations: the interests of the general public; the right to information; best information; proper conduct and functioning of the tribunal; the legitimate interests of the participants; the risk of prejudice to criminal proceedings; and any other relevant conditions.  We are not at cross-purposes.  The tribunal has that existing power.  The recommendation is that we should put down indicators, which are not conditions, to describe the reasons a tribunal would allow broadcasting of proceedings, such as in the public interest or information, the conduct of its functioning and proceedings, etc., and the interests of the parties.  I will look at this for Report Stage as that might be a better way about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">Under the existing legislation, the decision to allow something to be broadcast would be for the tribunal chairperson to decide and there are no conditions or indication of what issues the tribunal should take into account.  It is at the complete discretion of the tribunal whereas this is actually setting parameters.  That may be what the Deputy wishes, but I would have thought it was better to leave it with the tribunal which would take everything into account.  If conditions are introduced at this stage — the Law Reform Commission has listed four conditions and a reference to any other relevant considerations — there may be circumstances where it may involve something else.  This is a checklist in effect.  I am not sure and perhaps it would be better to leave it to the tribunal if, for example, RTE, TV3 or some other body applied for the opportunity to broadcast.  I am not aware that this request has ever been made to a tribunal.</p>

It seems   that there are two outs in paragraph (<i>a</i>) regarding whether the matter is in any way connected with the matters which are the subject of the inquiry — by definition, it must be connected — and the nature of the evidence to be given.  If I were a senior counsel for a client before a tribunal, I would not have any difficulty arguing or mounting a case.  For example, if a senior officeholder was before a tribunal, the nature of the evidence to be given that might expose him to ridicule or something similar would be sufficient for his counsel to be able to persuade the tribunal that it should be held in private.  If that is what is intended, I am bound to be reading this incorrectly because otherwise it would mean that one could pretty much hold the tribunal in private.</p>

There have been tribunals held under the existing law and I do not think there has been any major issue about the decision of the tribunal to have issues heard in private as opposed to in public.

They can decide that the proper conduct of the tribunal would not facilitate that.  However, other tribunal chairmen might and, depending on the subject matter, they might be happy to ensure that the proceedings are fully recorded, filmed or broadcast to ensure that.  The purpose is to ensure that when tribunals are established, the public and the tribunal chairman are aware that is an option.  We as legislators, when setting up a tribunal, should also be aware of the option for it to be permitted.  Some people might encourage it to be filmed.  As to somebody playing to the gallery, both sides could play to the gallery one way or other, so that is not an argument to prevent it happening.  I will submit an amendment on Report Stage.</p>

The Law Reform Commission report states there are strong arguments both in favour and against.  It states it would not serve the public interest to state definitively that media be allowed to broadcast all the proceedings.  Alternatively they should not be prohibited in all cases.  It then refers to the criteria set down by Dame Janet Smith in the Shipman inquiry.  It is probably following those criteria.  We will look at it.</p>

As Deputy Ó Snodaigh said, it might bring to people's attention the inherent ability of the tribunals existing to broadcast.  I am not sure if the public knows that.

Again, as Deputy Rabbitte said, it might make these tribunals considerably quicker.  I was on the committee that looked into the Fr. Brendan Smyth issue.  That was one of the first committees that was publicised.  While it was great television, it was a great exercise in the public getting an understanding of how the Oireachtas worked and how that issue was dealt with by that Government.  I believe it was the first televising of an Oireachtas committee and it was a very good experience.</p>

          <p eId="para_150">It is important that the matter of representation is defined.  Amendment No. 56 brings an element of clarity to matters in so far as the protection of the rights of a person appearing before the tribunal would be guaranteed.  From that point of view we should spell out in the legislation that a person's full legal rights will be vindicated and protected.  That should form the basis of a decision in respect of representation before the tribunal.</p>
          <p eId="para_151">On a more general level, it is not a question of the number of representatives or the extent of the representation <i>per se</i>.  It is really the restriction on the cost, not the restriction on the numbers.  Obviously it is possible and feasible that applicants or witnesses would have representation.  However, the issue is whether such representation would carry cost to the tribunal and consequently to the taxpayer.  In both this section and section 26 regarding the nature of the representation, we should not be hung up on the matter of numbers as opposed to costs.  It is possible for a witness to have a full team of lawyers, including a senior counsel, junior counsel and the whole shebang.  The issue is whether such costs would be covered by the tribunal and ultimately paid for by the public purse and not the numbers of representatives.</p>

          <p eId="para_152">I am advised that amendment No. 55 is unnecessary.  The relevant well known jurisprudence in the Supreme Court decision in the In Re Haughey case dealt with the issue of the legal and constitutional rights of people appearing before the tribunal.  These include the right to a good name and reputation.</p>
          <p eId="para_153">Amendment No. 56 adds nothing to the text.  The tribunal will decide on the necessity of representation on application to it by the person concerned under section 25(1).  The tribunal will then determine the extent of that representation according to the provisions of section 26(1).  Section 26(1) in effect deals with the issue the Deputy is raising.  There is nothing to prevent lawyers from participating on a <i>pro bono</i> basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_154">Regarding amendment No. 57, I am not sure the efficiency and effectiveness of a tribunal is served by allowing a multiplicity of applications to be made to it.  There is substance to the view that parties before it should get their act together from the start and not contribute to delay and the need to revise opinions already reached by the tribunal.  While I will consider the suggestion between now and Report Stage, I am not sure if we can come up with something.</p>

During our recent history, it would have been better if we had received interim reports with a little more frequency.  If a tribunal, "of its own motion", feels that it wants to make an interim report, this legislation should facilitate that.</p>

We need to examine the matter again, in line with what has been proposed by Deputy Rabbitte in this amendment, to allow tribunals to determine when they make progress reports, interim reports and final reports.</p>

          <p eId="para_214">Amendment No. 69 proposes that a new section 34 be inserted into the Bill to ensure that a tribunal's draft report may be sent to certain people by the tribunal.  The draft report would specify any adverse findings made against the individual and recite the evidence heard in public session on the basis of which the tribunal came to its findings.  The new section 34 draws from existing statute law.  I expect that it will provide guidance in this regard.  I hope it will avoid legal challenges.  Amendments Nos. 69 to 73, inclusive, will insert new sections 34 to 38, inclusive, into the Bill.  The new sections set out the procedure whereby final and interim reports may be circulated to people identified or identifiable in the reports, or part of the reports.  The Office of the Attorney General has advised that the proposed new sections 34 to 37, inclusive, contain similar provisions to those in the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 and are warranted.  Different tribunals have taken different stances on the provision of draft or final reports for persons mentioned therein for comment, although not necessarily for amendment, prior to final publication.  There does not appear to be a definitive legal requirement in existing tribunal legislation in this regard.  For this reason, we propose to amend the legislation more or less in accordance with the Commissions of Investigation Act.</p>

          <p eId="para_215">This clearly is a significant matter, albeit not one which had pricked my consciousness until now.  Sending drafts of a report in advance of publication to persons affected by its contents, while possibly a good development, is a significant requirement.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify whether a draft of a report would be sent to a person in all circumstances.  Does this provision apply only to persons on whom a report's findings may adversely reflect?  Is it correct that not all witnesses who appear before a tribunal will be entitled to receive a draft report?</p>
          <p eId="para_216">Is it not the position that different tribunals have addressed this issue differently?  It has recently entered the public domain that the Moriarty tribunal allegedly sent drafts of some sections of its report to certain persons.  Will the Minister clarify the circumstances in which the amendment would require the circulation of reports to take place?  Is it correct that the approach of the various tribunals to this issue is not uniform and that they have treated it differently?</p>
          <p eId="para_217">The Minister's amendment states: "Subject to <i>subsections (2) </i>and <i>(3)</i>, a tribunal shall, before submitting the final report to the responsible Minister, give a draft of the report, or the part concerned of the draft report, to any person who is identified in or identifiable from the draft report or part, as the case may be”.  Amendment No. 75, a subsequent amendment in my name, reopens this question about whether under the terms of the Constitution and the 1921 Act, the final report should be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, as distinct from the Minister.  The Minister has been around long enough to remember that this issue was highly controversial at one time.  He has a great deal to be thankful for in that regard because it meant his undoubted talents were subsequently recognised when a report was sent to a particular Minister, as distinct from the Houses, with cataclysmic repercussions for the Government in question.</p>

        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_117" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_218">On the <i>modus operandi</i>, different tribunals have adopted different approaches to addressing the final report.  The Moriarty tribunal, for instance, is adopting a particular <i>modus operandi  </i>whereas the approach taken by the Mahon tribunal is a little different.  The purpose of the amendment is to try to avoid such differences.  The amendment follows the terms prescribed in the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004 which states in section 34(1): “Before submitting the final or an interim report to the specified Minister, a commission shall send a draft of the report, or the relevant part of the draft report, to any person who is identified in or identifiable from the draft report”.  It also provides that a person who has received the draft report may submit to the commission a written statement or apply to the courts for a direction.  We are laying down the parameters for the manner in which reports are to be dealt with by future tribunals.  </p>
          <p eId="para_219">On the issue of laying the report before the Houses of the Oireachtas, amendment No. 74 in my name makes it clear that while the report is submitted to the Minister, the Minister has an obligation to cause the final report to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and published in a manner as the Minister thinks fit as soon as practicable after it has been submitted to him or her.  The same procedure applies in the case of interim and divisional reports.  It is normal practice that a report is sent to the Minister and then laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>

          <p eId="para_220">Practise has varied.  I recall recent cases in which the report was delivered to the Clerk of the Dáil rather than a Minister.  There is no point in us pretending that this could not be an explosive issue because it has been explosive previously.  The Minister first receives the report and lays it before the House subsequently.  As the Minister well knows, extraordinary things can happen between a Minister, even one of the probity of the Minister opposite, receiving a report and it being laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">To return to the Constitution, why do we not acknowledge its intention?  Given that the Houses of the Oireachtas set up tribunals, why should they not receive the report?</p>

          <p eId="para_228">The Minister has obligations under the legislation which states in section 34(2): "Where the responsible Minister is of the opinion that the publication of the final report or an interim report of a tribunal might prejudice any criminal or civil proceedings that are pending or in progress, the responsible Minister shall apply to the High Court for directions concerning the publication of the report".  Furthermore, where the High Court receives an application under this subsection, "it shall direct that notice thereof be given to ... the Attorney General, the Director of Public Prosecutions, and each person who is a defendant in criminal or civil proceedings".  There are circumstances in which an examination of the report will be required, for example, in the context of criminal proceedings.</p>

          <p eId="para_230">The Commissions of Investigation Act is quite separate and not a creature of the 1921 Act, yet the Minister is saying he is importing from it the phrase "before submitting the final report to the responsible Minister".  It may well be from that Act but I contend that, as intended by the Constitution, the Houses of the Oireachtas should receive the report of a tribunal they set up.  The Clerk of the Dáil should receive it.  The Minister is pre-empting subsequent amendments in this regard because he is taking for granted that the report shall be submitted to the responsible Minister.  Given the nature of the business we are in, that can frequently be controversial.</p>

          <p eId="para_231">Again, that may well be the case from a political point of view.  Other aspects must be taken into account, particularly the issue of criminal proceedings and whether some of the report's contents work against the DPP in prosecutions and against the role of the Attorney General.  I do not refer to the latter's role as legal adviser to the Government but as protector of the public interest.  There are aspects that must be dealt with.

The Minister, for the good and valid reason that he or she is responsible, accepts that the tribunal was set up on the order of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Therefore, the Minister is responsible and must take into account the other issues, including the ones to which I have referred.  I refer to public interest and the question of whether the Attorney General would have a view thereon, and to the question of cutting across criminal prosecutions.

          <p eId="para_237">One would hope certain guarantees pertaining to certain tribunals could be maintained.  What the Minister is doing is no more than what was done in respect of the sections of the Bill we have already considered, particularly sections 4, 5 and 10, in respect of which the Minister took upon himself powers that heretofore may have been vested in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  It would be entirely inconsistent of the Minister not to table such an amendment now, having regard to the powers already provided for.</p>

Put more plainly, it is the facts established by a tribunal from the evidence received by it rather than the evidence <i>per se</i>, even if given entirely in public, that the responsible Minister needs to have regard to under section 34(6).  This amendment, in seeming to make it mandatory to publish a part of the report, could present difficulties where the part concerned contains, for example, findings and not just a reference to the evidence heard in public.  I suggest that section 34(6) and section 34(7) as they stand achieve the proper balance that is to be maintained between disclosure and confidentiality.</p>

          <p eId="para_373">In view of my revised proposals with regard to the application for a determination of costs by relevant persons before the tribunal, Deputy Rabbitte may wish to withdraw his amendment on the basis that the matters concerned are now set out in a clear and more concise fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">As currently drafted, section 36(3) provides a tribunal with power to award costs against a person where that person has added to the duration of the hearings by knowingly or recklessly providing false or misleading information to a tribunal, or otherwise failing to provide appropriate co-operation when it was in that person's power to do so.  The underlying principle of the subsection is that a person who adds to the duration of the hearings by acting in this manner shall bear all or some of the costs incurred by the tribunal as a result of the extended duration of the tribunal caused by that action.  On that basic principle,  it would be appear that Deputy Rabbitte is <i>ad idem</i>  with the provisions of subsection(3).</p>
          <p eId="para_375">My concern with his amendments is that they will potentially require the tribunal to identify forensically each and every additional cost arising from the actions, and to separate these costs from the costs that would have arisen had the person not acted in that manner.  The effect of the amendments could be to involve the tribunal in a costly and complicated process of determining costs that, but for the actions of the person concerned, would not have arisen in the first place.  They also have the potential to create fertile grounds for legal challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">I am satisfied that the current provisions represent a more sensible and pragmatic approach to the issue.  They allow the chairperson to arrive at a percentage figure, which in his or her opinion, represents a fair estimate of the additional costs incurred.  I would say that my proposed amendments for section 36 represent a better <i>modus operandi</i>.</p>

          <p eId="para_448">Doctors differ and patients die.  My advice is that it is not covered by the Interpretation Act 2005.  That Act only covers the definition of oath, which is stated to include affirmation in respect of all persons entitled by law to make an affirmation rather than an oath.  That begs the question as to whether there is an entitlement to make an affirmation.  The underlying entitlement to make an affirmation is set out in the Oaths Act 1888 which refers only to proceedings which may mean legal proceedings, rather than proceedings before bodies other than courts, such as tribunals.  Therefore, there is a necessity to specify affirmation in the amendment.</p>
