I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, and his officials to the meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">Deputies will recall that at the select committee's meeting of 29 April last, amendment No. 12, which was to be discussed with amendments Nos. 13, 15, 18, 50, 54, 59, 61, 81, 85, 94, 95, 97 to 99, inclusive, 183 and 253, all of which are technical in nature, was withdrawn by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, by leave of the committee and without debate.  He advised the committee that he could not explain the purpose of the amendments because he did not have any speaking notes on them.  When amendments Nos. 15 and 18 were reached at a later stage, they were also withdrawn by leave of the committee.  When we reach amendment No. 50 today I will propose, with the permission of the committee, that the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, group together and debate amendments Nos. 50, 54, 59, 61, 81, 85, 94, 95, 97 to 99, inclusive, 183 and 253.  I will do so because I think we would be better off dealing with those amendments on Committee Stage rather than continuing to withdraw them as they are reached.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_11">In page 16, before section 8, but in Part 2, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_12">8.--The Minister shall establish a website and telephone service, subject to the use of a password or security measure by an applicant for a permission including a visa under this Act, or his or her representative (including a public representative), which will allow any applicant or his or her representative to have ready access to information on the progress of his or her application.".</p>
          <p eId="para_13">This amendment seeks to insert a new section 8 into the Bill.  The new section would require the Minister to "establish a website and telephone service", as described in the amendment, for the benefit of applicants.  It is important that an applicant, or his or her representative, should have easy access to information about the progress of his or her application.  The Minister is as aware as the rest of us that the difficulty of accessing information within the system is a bugbear for all concerned.  Members of the Oireachtas find it almost impossible to access information about the progress of applications.  The applicants themselves encounter similar problems.  The difficulties caused by language and other impediments can make this process absolutely frustrating.  That Members of the Oireachtas cannot find out the stage of progress by lifting a telephone or accessing a website makes it extremely difficult to assist those concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_14">The Minister will be aware that Members of the House whose attempts to access information are frustrated often try to make progress by tabling parliamentary questions.  His officials, not unreasonably, have pointed out that they are smothered in such questions.  The Minister might suggest that there has been some improvement recently, but I am not sure whether that is the case.  I am not in a position to judge the improvement.  All I know is that the frustration in my office continues unabated.  There does not seem to be much improvement.  In this era of information technology, there is no reason one should not be able to find out how much progress has been made with an application.  We are not trying to find out whether a local school will be refurbished, or anything else that might mitigate against the Minister concerned as he or she tries to pull a stroke.  This is a straightforward case of applicants looking for answers about where their cases stand.  I hope the Minister will take this amendment on board.  I understand that one of his ministerial colleagues is broadcasting far and wide that 200 amendments are to be accepted by the Minister.  I should have asked the Minister to make an opening statement to give him an opportunity to take the political credit for their acceptance.  Like my colleagues, Deputies Naughten and Ó Snodaigh, I deserve to be informed if 200 amendments are to be accepted.  I do not doubt that Deputy Finian McGrath has a passing interest in the matter too.</p>

          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_20">I would like to speak about the amendment before the committee.  I spoke last week about the huge frustration evident in many of the e-mails I receive from people in all parts of the country about the ongoing delays in dealing with visa and immigration applications.  This is compounded by the fact that it is virtually impossible to get information on what is happening with an application, the stage it is at and the timetable for completion of the process.  In fairness, INIS has recently introduced a new e-mail service but it falls far short of the parliamentary system and of the system over which the Minister had control in the Department of Social and Family Affairs some years ago, and even the Property Registration Authority, the former Land Registry, which deals with queries via e-mail within three working days.  It is important that this process is speeded up because it leads to great frustration on the part of applicants.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">Deputy Rabbitte's amendment is reasonable.  I hope the Minister will accept it not only on the basis of the points the Deputy has made but in the context of the points I raised last week in regard to the great frustration people experience with the system as it operates at present.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_9">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_22">I support the amendment.  It is a reasonable amendment given the pressure on public representatives and the individuals in question who seek simple answers to questions such as how long it will take for a decision to be made in their case.  If a parliamentary question is tabled one usually gets some indication but those timeframes often shift.  Whereas somebody may be told that it will take 12 months to process his or her application, a year and a half or sometimes two years later, the application may not have been dealt with.  It is that type of frustration that leads many applicants to approach me and others to use our influence, not to influence the decision, but to ascertain the stage the application is at in the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">We are dealing with people who may not have a mastery of the language to enable them deal with websites or understand the letter sent by INIS or the Department.  Other Departments have such a facility.  For all the criticism we make of the HSE, at least the parliamentary advisory groups who deal with questions come back to one within a month or two.  While they do not necessarily answer the questions as put, at least one has some indication.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">The Department of Social and Family Affairs was mentioned.  When one tables a question to that Department one gets an answer before the question appears on the Order Paper.  It is reasonable for us in the House to get an answer which is clear and gives an indicative timeframe.  I am not suggesting that in most cases one can get an answer to the day but a month or two later is acceptable given the scale of the problem of shifting which in some cases, particularly regarding those who are seeking residency, has been great.  Some people were told two years ago that they would have to wait some months but are still awaiting a decision.  I ask the Minister to seriously consider accepting this amendment or to bring forward his own amendment which would allow us to carry out our duties and allow those who made the application in the first instance an opportunity to track where it is at in the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">If one sends a letter by registered post one can track it on-line.  It is a simple process.  If that system applied, one could check how many applications were ahead of a particular application if it is done on a chronological basis.  In that way one would have an indication that one's application was near the top of the list or alternatively that nothing would happen for at least two years, in which case one could keep a watching brief on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_26">I welcome amendment No. 49.  It is a positive proposal and I ask the Minister to consider it.  The idea of the website and the telephone service is a sensible and practical proposal.  Many of us spend much time supporting foreign nationals in their different needs.  Recently I had a few successful cases and wish to acknowledge the joy and security for the families concerned because it meant a great deal to them.  Given that the issue of access to information is important, I ask the Minister to look at the proposal very seriously.</p>

        <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_11">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_27">I wish to make a general point on the Bill and the amendments.  There is no doubt this is major legislation.  My predecessor and I have indicated we are more than willing to look at amendments tabled by the Opposition and that we will propose some similar amendments along the way.  It is beneficial that we have a good debate on some of the amendments tabled by the Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">In regard to this amendment, I concur with previous speakers that generally more needs to be done in response to queries.  One of the first things I did when I came into the Department was to suggest we publicise the fact that Oireachtas Members have a new e-mail service which is working reasonably well.  The service was introduced on 31 March.  Up to 18 April, 307 inquiries were received with 235 completed.  The hope is that answers would be provided to inquiries within a maximum of ten days.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">The point about the amendment is that it is not really necessary to put it into legislation.  I have emphasised to my officials, given the large number of parliamentary questions tabled in regard to specific cases, the importance of responding in a manner similar to that of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.  The system in that Department came about as a result of significant difficulties and complaints about the lack of response at a particular period.  Thankfully, that has changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">To be fair, the position in regard to the whole immigration service and the numbers who have come into the system is a relatively recent phenomenon.  If a Member tables a parliamentary question my officials should respond in such a way that the parliamentary question does not go onto the floor of the House.  If at all possible, the response should be given before the due date for answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">On the face of it, the proposal appears fair but I would refer Deputies to sections 15(2), 16(6) and 18(4) of the Bill which make provision for the notification of certain visa decisions to a visa applicant or his or her representative, by means of a secure Internet process.  Details are listed by visa application number only and no biological details are shown.  This procedure is operated at present on an administrative basis.  We believe it is working well.  It is working well for applicants worldwide.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">In regard to what Deputies have said, I will continue to insist that information is made available as quickly as possible directly to applicants, through their representatives or, in the case of public representatives who make representations, that we accept we can do better in regard to the provision of information.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_12">
          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_33">I am not prescribing my amendment as the only way forward but I am concerned that this issue be addressed effectively.  Notwithstanding what has been said about the new e-mail system, many continue to attend clinics or make contact on the very point that they cannot access information of a routine nature.  The Minister cannot welcome the fact that members on this side and his own backbenchers table parliamentary questions on the subject which should be capable of being answered elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">I do not know where my amendment stands after the Minister's remarks.  He accepts that we need to improve the quality and speed of responses to queries but I get the impression that he does not want a provision to that effect to be included in the Bill.  Sections 15(2) and 16(6) are particular references.  The former refers to visas and covers a relatively narrow area.  Is the Minister saying he might bring forward a regulation to deal with the matter?  The system is clogged up and, despite the best efforts on this side of the House, not working well.  More and more colleagues tell me they will continue to table parliamentary questions because they cannot get answers otherwise.</p>

        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_13" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_35">I repeat my point that legislation is not the place to deal with this matter as it is administrative work and many visa applications are made from abroad.  Substantial investment is being made in a new IT system which I hope the Opposition will support.  It deals with asylum, immigration and citizens' applications and will replace a multiplicity of systems not currently integrated.  The investment will continue throughout the year and the system will I hope be fully delivered in 2009.  It will help in the delivery of information on the progress of applications at a given time but we do not yet have the benefit of it because work is ongoing on it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_14">
          <from>Deputy Pat Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_36">I do not want to delay progress on the Bill if the Minister says the substance of the amendment is being addressed.  If the system needs investment to make it work more efficiently, we would all support it.  We have waited a long time for the Bill.  Once it is enacted, the people sitting around this table, including, I suspect, the Minister's officials, will not want to revisit the subject for obvious reasons.  This is the sixth day on which we have discussed the Bill and we are only on section 8.  If we pass over this matter on the basis that the Minister will deal with it by investment or instigating more efficient procedures, that is fine and I will take him at his word.  Nevertheless, for several thousand people the issue is a constant bugbear and forces them to visit Deputies' clinics and send e-mails with what are, for the most part, routine queries.  Some are more complex and problematic but many are routine in nature.  We should be able to receive a brief and intelligible answer on how the system works that can be understood by people for whom English may not be their first language.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">The issue relates to other questions we have discussed such as family reunification which we discussed the other day.  Many find themselves in this jurisdiction for varying reasons and do not know where they stand.  Despite being an Opposition spokesperson and constituency representative, I cannot give them clear answers.  I do not doubt the Minister's word or his commitment to improve the system through further investment but a provision relating to access to information warrants being set down in an order if he thinks it is not a matter to be dealt with in primary legislation.  In this case it would involve a charter to which people in such circumstances could refer for details of how they could receive information within a reasonable period.</p>

        <speech by="#DermotAhern" eId="spk_15" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Deputy Dermot Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_38">I reiterate that the response system for Members of the Oireachtas is only just up and running.  Although I have only been in the Department for a week or so, I have indicated to officials that they should readvertise it to Members because I am not sure they actually use it as much as we would like.  I have not been immune from the frustration felt by members on the subject of visa applications, as I have received such queries in my own constituency office.  However, I have told officials that we should follow the template used by the Department of Social and Family Affairs and that it should not be necessary for Members of the Oireachtas to table parliamentary questions, incurring huge expense.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">Information should be much more accessible.  The committee might look at what the Department is doing in terms of investment in IT systems.  It is important people are satisfied that decisions are co-ordinated across the various schemes and made in a proper manner and that information is made available to those waiting for a decision on their application.  I do not believe primary or secondary legislation is the way to accomplish this.  It should be accomplished by an administrative scheme because tying ourselves down with too much legislation may be counterproductive.</p>

          <p eId="para_40">I support what Deputy Rabbitte said.  The Minister mentioned the e-mail system and that was a welcome development.  Any level of access to information is welcome but the target turnaround time is ten days, whereas for a parliamentary question it is four days.  The maths do not add up.  If we can receive information through the e-mail system in a timely manner, more Members will use it.  I hope the initiative will be resourced to ensure this happens in order that it can be used as a conduit in getting information to constituents on their applications.  It is important that provision is made for people to access information in a timely manner, either on the Department's website or through its publications.  That is not happening at present and people are experiencing a great deal of frustration.</p>

Is this the sort of information which the Minister might consider appropriate to be included on a visa?  These sections deal with specific issues which can be provided for, as the Minister considers appropriate.  A huge amount of secondary legislation will follow from the Bill.  Other provisions of the Bill will not find their way into secondary legislation but may give rise to ministerial orders, schedules or unwritten rules and regulations.  We must have a clear and transparent system.  People must know the rules, the conditions of their permits and what elements of their applications will be assessed or evaluated.  These things should not be done behind closed doors.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">This issue relates to the issue dealt with previously.  It is of fundamental importance that we have a transparent system.  The existing system is obscure.  There are no clear rules and no information available regarding the conditions under which people enter the country, their responsibilities when they have arrived here or the conditions under which they may remain or be deported.  It should be made clear who gets in, under what circumstances they get in and what are their rights and responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">The Bill makes several references to phrases such as, "as the Minister considers appropriate" or "the Minister may make regulation".  For example, language is of fundamental importance to integration.  If people do not have a basic competency in English they will find it impossible to integrate and migrant populations will lead separate lives, leading to ghettoisation.  This ministerial discretion will lead to a disincentive to integration.  The Bill leaves a great deal of discretion to the Minister.  When the Bill is enacted no Member of the Oireachtas, including Deputy Rabbitte and myself who will have dealt with the legislation line by line, will be able to deal with a constituent's query regarding the application procedure for an entry visa or residency permit.  It is difficult to know what we are enacting because the detail of how this legislation will be implemented on the ground is left to the discretion of the Minister, secondary legislation or some other vague ambiguous system that is not in the public domain.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">The majority of submissions we have received in our inch and a half of documentation, whether from the Law Society, the Human Rights Commission, or some of the non-governmental organisations, raised the issue of the Minister's discretion.  While it is important that the Minister has discretion in some elements of the legislation, and I am not trying to take from that, it is important there is a clear and transparent system, that people know the processes they must go through in order to have their application considered by the Department.  Will the Minister look favourably at these amendments?</p>

          <p eId="para_70">The purpose of this amendment is to make clear in the Bill that a foreign national who requires a visa to enter the country is prohibited from entering this State without first having obtained a visa.  The only circumstance in which a foreign national can lawfully be present in the State is where he or she has been granted an entry permission.  Such a permission would, for example, be granted to a person unlawfully present in the State who claims protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">The amendment closes a potential gap in the Bill in section 23(1)(<i>a</i>)(iii), which is designed to comprehend the entry to the State of a foreign national from Northern Ireland.  In recognition of the fact that we do not have formal systematic immigration processes on the land frontier with Northern Ireland, the Bill provides that a foreign national is not under an obligation to present to an immigration officer immediately after he or she crosses the land frontier.  He or she is required to present as soon as practicable to an immigration officer at an immigration area office for the immigration area in which he or she will have his or her dwelling place within the State.  During the period between the crossing of the frontier and presenting to an immigration officer, the person will not have contravened any provision of the Bill, but the expectation is that he or she will complete the necessary immigration formalities as soon as possible.</p>

What are the practical implications of amendment No. 53 for those coming to this jurisdiction?  Are they more likely to use the Northern Ireland route as a result?</p>

          <p eId="para_123">It has been the case that people have crossed the Border.  The amendment is to reinforce the fact that those who require a visa will commit an offence if they try to do so.  Where people coming into the State do not encounter immediately an immigration officer at a port or an airport, there is a requirement on them to present themselves at the nearest location.</p>

          <p eId="para_134">The Minister spoke about upgrading the IT system within the Department.  That is welcome.  Traditionally, there have been problems in the issuing of visas for third country nationals for entry into Ireland.  For example, I have come across businessmen who travelled to the United Kingdom and then decided they would also like to come to Ireland, perhaps to look at an investment opportunity.  They find they have to go back to their country of origin to apply for a visa to come here.  Naturally, they will not do this if they are in the United Kingdom.  Given that they are just a short hop from Dublin, can some mechanism be put in place to deal with the issue?  I have come across one example of a senior Indian businessman who travelled to the United Kingdom-----</p>

          <p eId="para_136">The individual concerned had travelled from India to the United Kingdom.  While there, he wanted to come to Ireland but the procedure is that he has to apply for a visa from India.  Perhaps a system could be put in place to facilitate such individuals, otherwise business opportunities may be lost.  I am sure the UK authorities have already done a thorough check on them.</p>
          <p eId="para_137">In regard to the issue of visas in the country of origin, sometimes the turnaround time is very slow.  The applicant's passport must be submitted and there have been instances where passports have been lost.  A long-term visa for entry into the United Kingdom or the United States is very valuable and applicants have to reapply if their passport is lost.</p>

We should bear in mind the number of visa applications filed to enable people to visit family members who have been invited to this country to contribute to the economy.  As long as there is no legitimate reason to deny the visa, such persons should be reasonably facilitated.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">Amendment No. 293 would apply the same principle to residency applications.  The main point of amendment No. 63 is the issue of costs and its ethos is to protect vulnerable persons.  We must be very vigilant and on our guard not to discriminate against certain persons.  I have concerns about this issue on the broader international stage.  Each country has an international duty to assist people in need and not to put a money barrier in front of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">I am concerned at the drift in debates at this committee.  We should not confuse poor people with criminal elements.  We all accept that a small minority is involved in crime and that we must be vigilant in that regard.  However, I often become worried at the language used in the debate and about defensive comments that lead us to take our eye off the ball.  We need to treat the vast majority who are respectable people impartially.  It is important we remind ourselves that respect for human rights must be at the core of this legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_183">I oppose both amendments.  The purpose of section 12(4) is to allow for the setting of fees for visas by reference to the criteria laid down in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>k</i>).  The intention is that visa fees be used as a tool to enable the development of flexible responses to immigration needs.  The level of fees set will be determined not by the ability of the applicant to pay the fee but by the assessment of whether the State needs to encourage a particular category of foreign national, for example, a skilled worker or a health care worker, to migrate to the State and, conversely, by the potential immigration risk that may be posed by issuing a visa to a particular category of foreign national.  </p>
          <p eId="para_184">The subsection provides flexibility to impose a reduced fee or no fee on persons coming from particular countries from which health care workers are recruited into the health system in the State and who seek visas for that purpose.  Were there a general right for any person of whatever nationality to come to Ireland, provisions of the type proposed in the amendment would probably be necessary to ensure people were not being unfairly deprived of the means to exercise that right.  However, there is no such right.  Accordingly, considerations in amendment No. 63 do not arise.  The effect of that amendment would be to constrain the flexibility necessary for the effective operation of a proposed visa system and, in the circumstances, I cannot accept it.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">The general means test which paragraph (<i>a</i>) of amendment No. 293 seeks to introduce would neither be appropriate nor workable.  Accordingly, I cannot accept it.</p>

          <p eId="para_213">Until now people may have been refused visas because of the risk that they might remain in the State beyond the permitted 90 days.  We have all come across cases of families, legally resident in Ireland, who were refused visas for, perhaps, a grandparent who wished to come to Ireland to help with a new baby.  The amendment proposes that a bond should not be required in circumstances where a visa would otherwise be granted.  It also proposes that the amount of a bond should be appropriate to the risk of default and also to the financial resources of the guarantor.  The amount should not be sufficient to cause financial hardship to the person resident in the State.  A person who came into the State on foot of a bond could breach the conditions of his or her visa.  The family who entered into the bond might then find themselves in financial difficulty and be obliged to claim social welfare benefit.  No one wishes to see that happen.

In such a case the Department may issue a visa on foot of a guarantee by the relative living in Ireland.

If the bond is set at a high level, the person who enters into it could be obliged to apply for a social welfare payment.

          <p eId="para_246">The Minister might look at it again.  I am not sure he understands the point I am trying to make.  The advice he is receiving is based on the need to protect the State.  I think my amendment does that.  I accept that the amendment may not be perfectly drafted - the phrase "the applicant" may have to be removed from it.  Opposition spokesmen cannot avail of the services of the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  I ask the Minister to examine the proposed new sections 13(8) and 13(9).</p>
