          <p eId="para_5">I did not realise that. That had not been communicated to me. Maybe we could work out arrangements for situations like this in the future. I appreciate that, a Cheann Comhairle.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> I raise with the Taoiseach the anger, anxiety and great surprise at how the statutory instrument introduced by former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, last January has created chaos and mayhem within the bin industry and caused anger and anxiety among householders across the country. There have been claims and counter-claims but essentially bills in quite a number of instances have gone through the roof. In many ways, it highlights the complete lack of transparency in relation to bin charges generally. Quite a number of companies are not transparent at all in terms of their charging regime. The standard charges were increased under the guise of the introduction of the pay-by-weight system. Deputy Kelly signed in the charges on the basis that 87% of people would have their bills reduced but he indicated that the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, were caught hopping.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I do not know whether the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, discussed this with the Taoiseach last January when he signed the instrument or whether there was a discussion on it in the Cabinet because I cannot reconcile his perspective on this at that time with the subsequent view that the Government was caught on the hop by the companies and did not follow through sufficiently.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has brought forward a range of proposals. Members of the House and spokespersons, including Deputy Cowen, asked the Minister to engage with the companies with a view to bringing about a resolution to this debacle. Essentially, there has been a deferral of the charges regime for 12 months. I seek clarity from the Taoiseach on that. Can he guarantee that householders will not have increased bills over the next 12 months? Also, during the next 12 months, will the Taoiseach take the opportunity to initiate a comprehensive review of the current waste collection, management and recycling system and industry? There is a complete absence of transparency and there is no regulator. Will the Taoiseach consider the appointment of a regulator? There is also a lack of competition in some parts of the country while an increasing amount of illegal dumping is occurring. The next number of months should be used as an opportunity to conduct a comprehensive review of this sector, so I ask the Taoiseach to initiate such a review.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_6" as="#Taoiseach_and_Minister_for_Defence">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T14:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_9">I thank Deputy Martin for the question. This controversy has blown up quite recently, following the statutory instrument introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly. Obviously, what the Government seeks, and most Deputies would agree with this, is that people would take the opportunity to think more carefully about the way they deal with refuse and the disposal of waste. The theory and spirit of the legislation was that, as a result of examining what should be put into a black bin, less would be put into it on a pay-by-weight basis, which would mean a reduction in charges for people. In addition, there would be better use of the brown and green bins, as the case may be. In many cases, there are shortages in capacity for landfill and the less that goes to landfill the better.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> In the last couple of days, people were very concerned that their bin charges would rise to a serious extent. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, met with the Irish waste management industry and the majority of those who supply waste services and he has announced a pay freeze, with the support of the waste management companies, for the next 12 months on the basis of the current pricing plans. That means no increase in what people have paid in respect of their last bill. During the second half of 2016, the Government and the waste industry are committed to an intensive public awareness and information campaign to promote the benefits of the pay-by-weight charging model and to support customers in understanding how they can change their waste management behaviour and manage their waste costs better under the pay-by-weight system. That is in everybody's interest as well as in the environmental interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> No later than 1 January 2017 customers will receive a dual pricing bill listing the amount of waste they are disposing of, the costs under the current pricing system and details of what the comparative cost would be on a pay-by-weight charge. They will be given the option to transition, should they so choose, to pay-by-weight charging or to remain on their current pricing plan. People have an option here to reduce the amount of waste they put in the black bin. After the transitional 12 months, the operation of pay-by-weight in the wider waste market will be reviewed to inform decisions on the arrangements beyond 1 July 2017. Also, the Minister has confirmed the commitment of the waste industry to provide a full weight allowance for the 60,000 Health Service Executive, HSE, patients supplied with incontinence wear to reduce their waste charges and the Government's provision of a 50% exemption to the waste industry from the landfill levy in respect of such waste. This point was made last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">These are the changes the Minister wants to bring in. </p>
          <p eId="para_13"> In respect of the issue raised by Deputy Micheál Martin, it is valid to look at the structure and the way the management of waste is dealt with. This issue needs to be looked at. The Minister for communications, climate change and natural resources, Deputy Naughten, will be dealing with it from now on and will be happy to examine it.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">The former Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Kelly, was adamant that there would be a reduction for 87% of households. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has not commented on that one way or the other. The bin companies are saying it is a mathematical impossibility. The Taoiseach was in the previous Government with Deputy Kelly. Surely they discussed it and were all convinced it would bring down waste charges. The opposite has happened and the bin charges have gone way up. Deputy Kelly said the Government was caught hopping. I am trying to find out in between the two how the Government was caught hopping. Perhaps Deputy Kelly might illustrate to us in greater detail how something he introduced apparently caught everybody hopping. It caught the companies, householders and the Government hopping.</p>
          <p eId="para_21"> In a more serious vein, and I am serious about that one, will the Taoiseach initiate a comprehensive review of the industry because there is a lack of competition in certain places and there is a complete absence of transparency on the part of some companies in respect of their charging? Some companies are saying that the pay-by-weight system will encourage cross-contamination of waste and will interfere with and undermine the recyclable material and product that emerges from the system at the moment. Many issues have emanated from this ill-thought-out and poorly implemented statutory instrument, which seems to have been used by some companies, which engaged in below-cost selling to get into the market and to get a significant share, to raise charges excessively and use the pay-by-weight system as a camouflage to do that.</p>

          <p eId="para_24">The spirit of the legislation was that by looking differently at how waste could be disposed of, the charges could be reduced. In other words, consumers or customers would have the option to examine carefully and think about how they would dispose of their waste in terms of green, brown and black bins and that on a pay-by-weight basis, charges could be reduced. Clearly, that was not what was going to happen here, which is why the Minister for housing, planning and local government met with all of the waste management companies and has agreed, with their support, a freeze for 12 months given the other issues that are there.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> The fact that some waste disposal companies in a competitive sense decided to tout for commercial business by offering a below-cost service for waste disposal is a matter for themselves in terms of the competitive nature of the waste disposal industry. If they decided to provide a service at below cost, that is something they have to live with.</p>
          <p eId="para_26"> In respect of the structure, one could have a situation where one could tender for an area and the company that won that tender would then provide the service there. As the Deputy knows, there is a very different system in many places. Some roads would have three or four companies supplying a bin collection service. The point raised by the Deputy that there should be an examination of the entire structure is a valid one and we can initiate it.</p>

          <p eId="para_27">Many people are only just waking up to the reality that the Taoiseach is back in office despite the result of the general election. This latest debacle over bin charges has been a wake-up call for many. It is also a very stark demonstration of the shallowness of the so-called new politics. The reality is that many households cannot afford these bin charges. There is nothing new, politically or otherwise, about bin companies agreeing that they will go ahead with these charges in July 2017 instead of July 2016.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">There is nothing new about the leader of Fianna Fáil opting out of his partnership role to lament the bin charges fiasco even though he has yet to support measures which could annul the statutory instrument that allows these price hikes. It is nothing but the same old story.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> Under the Taoiseach's watch, the then Minister, Deputy Kelly, introduced a statutory instrument which allowed for households to be fleeced by some unscrupulous waste disposal companies. At that time, the Government maintained that the new charging regime would mean that 90% of households would pay less to have their bins collected. It now turns out that, in reality, 90% of families and households will pay substantially more. The companies have agreed to put that off for one year. The Taoiseach says it is to give people more time to think about their options. That is not good enough. Citizens already struggling with the cost of living crises in respect of mortgages, rents, child care, water charges, property tax and car insurance are being hit once again and the Taoiseach advises them that he is giving them a year to think about this. It is yet another increase on top of all the other taxes, costs and charges he has inflicted on ordinary citizens in recent years. It is very clear that this waste management strategy, if it can be called that, will also impact on small businesses and the farming community and there is the real prospect of more illegal dumping across the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> It is very simple. The regulations - part of Deputy Kelly's glorious legacy - were introduced by the stroke of a ministerial pen and they can be removed today by the stroke of a ministerial pen if that is what the Taoiseach wants. Instead of pushing this issue down the road to diffuse a potential political storm, I ask the Taoiseach to make a commitment that new regulations or legislation to deal with this debacle will be introduced by his Government with the assistance of Fianna Fáil this week.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">I thank Deputy Adams for his comment. I listened to his deputy leader saying that anything that would promote the better distribution and management of waste should be supported. Everybody accepts that the less one has to put into landfill in the black bin the better and that better use of brown and green bins will follow through. Deputy Adams wants to jack up income taxes to put more pressure on working families and to have a situation where all of this comes out of general taxation. The Deputy might like to indicate what he means by that in terms of increased income taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> The position is that the Minister has met all the waste management companies. A freeze has been put in place for 12 months. When 1 January arrives and the dual-billing process is sent out to customers, they will be able to see the difference and compare whether the current system or the pay-by-weight system would have a better result for them, depending on what they put into the black bin. They have the option of transferring from one to the other. There are difficulties in terms of terraced houses where there is no room for a bin to go out the back such that if bags were to be done away with, it would obviously cause a problem. That is a matter that can be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> In the broader context of having a more effective way of dealing with waste disposal and collection, perhaps based on a franchise per area, these are matters that should be examined. For now, customers and consumers should be very clear that the spirit of what the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, intended was not being adhered to. Ministers met the waste companies and there is now a solution in place. In the course of the coming months, reflection can be made on the waste management system generally for more effective waste collection and disposal which will reduce the impact of what is going into landfill. Deputy Adams is aware that a number of landfill sites are at full capacity and that many areas around the country now have a shortage of capacity for landfill. Everybody thinking about how they would dispose of waste generated in households will have an impact on that as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> Deputy Adams wants to do away with all the incentives that have been there for ten or 12 years and which people are very pleased about and proud to participate in because it is good for the environment and for the extent of what goes into landfill. It is very good for people to be able to see they are making a contribution to a better country.</p>

          <p eId="para_35">With all due respect, that was a rubbish answer. I asked the Taoiseach a straightforward question as to whether he would make a commitment that new regulations or legislation - in other words, a statutory instrument - to deal with this debacle would be introduced this week and he ignored that question.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> The fact is that households cannot afford these additional charges. A working couple without children, currently paying by weight and who recycle and compost, will not save money under the new scheme. One bin company will increase this couple's standing charge by 108% and the annual cost for their waste services will jump from €84 to €140. That is a 66% increase. Such people do not need 12 months to think about all of that. They know where they stand on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> Households understand what it means to be ripped off. If the Taoiseach is really about new politics, why does he not make a commitment to bring in new regulations to prevent bin companies from hiking up charges, this year, next year or any year after that?</p>

          <p eId="para_46">That is why during the second half of 2016 the Government and the waste industry have committed to a detailed public awareness campaign so that people will understand exactly what options are open to them and how they can reduce their charges for waste. Rather than sending out two bills in July, which might confuse people, on 1 January next year, they will see the comparative price between the current pay regime and what they would be paying under pay-by-weight which gives them the option to choose which one they prefer. Obviously, if one can reduce one's charge by reducing the weight of material put in the black bin, then so much the better. This also takes into account the concerns that were mentioned in respect of people who have particular challenges, notably those 60,000 HSE patients who must have use of incontinence material. That is a significant understanding of the challenge that those people face.</p>

          <p eId="para_48">Over six weeks ago, this Government came to office amid a flurry of talk and promises of new politics. Today, we see the publication of the summer economic statement. In fact, I understand in five minutes' time the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform will make that announcement outside the House. It has been published without any consultation with the Members of this House. Indeed, Members of the House got to read in this morning's newspapers that €300 million is to be made available for additional tax cuts and €600 million, apparently, to be devoted to additional expenditure next year. According to the newspapers this morning, a total of €900 million, therefore, is to be made available in what amounts to the determined fiscal space, a sum which the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council has already described today as "contractionary".</p>
          <p eId="para_49"> We will have a contraction in our economy next year, according to the projections, or at least those that we read about in the newspapers. There is a train of thought among economists these days that because of the experiences of the past while, we should be very risk averse and that amounts apparently to prudence. An aversion to risk must not put at risk the very factors that we need to invest in our economy, if we are to continue to grow and continue to provide jobs for our people. That approach disregards the legitimate demands of the public that an improving economy will impact on their quality of life. We argued in the last election that a ratio of at least 2:1 should be allocated between investment and tax reductions.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">The ratio should probably be more than that to deliver what we need, such as smaller classes, a functioning health system, indexation of welfare payments and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> There is a second aspect of today's coverage in the newspapers that also troubles me. We read today that the Government intends to press ahead with the idea of a rainy day fund. So when we have an urgent need for investment in infrastructure - whether it be broadband, schools, health services or roads - apparently the Government will effectively put money on deposit. Even if it could be used to pay down debt, it would be more reasonable than simply leaving money on deposit.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> I have two questions for the Taoiseach. Does he accept that investment in urgently needed infrastructure makes much more sense than simply creating this so-called rainy day fund, which, in effect, is leaving money unused on deposit with the Central Bank? How does he propose to have cross-party buy-in to the budgetary process if fundamental questions about the fiscal space and the total sums to be deployed are made without consultation with anybody in the House?</p>

          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T14:25:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_53">Deputy Howlin was an esteemed member of a Government that had to make very difficult decisions about changing the direction of the country and bringing it back from an unprecedented recession. He asked two questions. There are five specific commitments in the programme for Government in respect of the economic opportunity that lies ahead. The first is to meet the domestic and EU fiscal rules and the summer statement sets out how that will happen. The nominal budget will be balanced in 2018. Second, there should be at least a split of 2:1 between spending and tax, and the projections are that this ratio is to be maintained each year. The third is that there would be a spend of at least an additional €6.75 billion in delivering additional public services by 2021, with current expenditure in that year projected to be 6.75% higher than 2016. The fourth commitment is an additional €4 billion in Exchequer capital investment up to 2021. We would comply with and exceed the latter by making use of the favourable treatment of capital in the rules so that capital will increase by just over €5 billion. The fifth commitment is the establishment of a rainy day fund. The Ministers responsible for both finance and public expenditure and reform have pointed out that €1 billion per year will go to the fund in the period 2019 to 2021, with a commitment to bring forward proposals to the Oireachtas for discussion on that. It would be a matter for the Government of the day as to whether that should continue beyond 2021 and how it should be used, depending on the circumstances that apply internationally or from an economic perspective.</p>
          <p eId="para_54"> The total amount available to the Government over the five years is estimated to be a cumulative €11.3 billion. Critically, the space for 2017 has increased to €1 billion, with €1.2 billion available in 2018. It means the Government can bring forward some spending for 2017 for the kind of issues mentioned by the Deputy, including infrastructure and social issues, that was not available even three months ago. From 2019 to 2021, the increase will be of the order of €3 billion per annum, arising after the balancing of the budget in 2018. This means the additional capital for 2017 will be €250 million, for 2018 it will be €750 million, for 2019 it will be €1.18 billion, for 2020 it will be €1.38 billion and for 2021 it will be €1.59 billion. That is a cumulative €5.14 billion over the period. This means that many of the priority issues which must be addressed can be brought forward somewhat, as there will be an additional €250 million available in 2017 that was not available in figures from just a few months ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">Obviously, there is a space here and the Minister pointed out how the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council would be involved in discussions about the formation of a rainy day fund, how it might be used and what it would be used for and the opportunities to make proposals in that regard.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_56">I asked about next year's budget. In the programme for Government, we were promised a new budgetary architecture. How can there be consultation or an agreement in respect of next year's budget if its parameters are determined without consultation with anybody? </p>
          <p eId="para_57"> It was always envisaged that there would be a review of capital spend next year. The figures set out by the Taoiseach are very parsimonious in terms of the capacity of the economy to deal with real infrastructural deficits in a way that drives further job creation.</p>
          <p eId="para_58"> In relation to the rainy day fund, the difference between gross and net debt is approximately 10% of GDP. We have notionally bank shares and so on that we will be able to sell, which means a sum of money will be available to the State to invest if we wish. Surely it makes more sense to set up an ambitious capital programme for the next few years to address issues like broadband and the third level deficit and to make a significant spend in terms of education, finishing our road network and investing in health care and child care facilities. Would that not be the wise way to invest money, rather than talking about some rainy day fund?</p>

          <p eId="para_59">There are four hours allocated for the summer economic statements in the House on Thursday. The national dialogue will take place next week and the committees of the House will do their business on the preparation for the budget running into October. Regarding expenditure for 2017, there is a net amount of €1 billion extra, with expenditure of €670 million as against taxation of €330 million. The figures for 2018 are €0.79 billion and €0.39 billion. This complies with the projections for a 2:1 ratio, which I outlined earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_60"> It is true that when Deputy Howlin was in government we did not have the capital to invest in those very necessary facilities. That situation has improved somewhat and it means that for next year, 2017, there is an extra €250 million available, which is a great deal of money, but a small amount in terms of the overall budget. Some of those projects can be brought forward. As Deputy Howlin is aware, the Government has focused on health and housing as two major priorities. There are, of course, others, including education, broadband and other such areas. There are four hours on Thursday for a debate and then we will have the national economic dialogue next week.</p>

          <p eId="para_61">This is my first time speaking during Leaders' Questions, so I will probably go easy on the Taoiseach. Many people in this House have received correspondence and e-mails in regard to bin charges and that whole debacle. I just want to read out one e-mail I got from a chap in the area I live in. I cut it down a little bit. It encapsulates everything that is wrong with these charges:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_62">I want to raise this issue of the new pay-by-weight bin charges announced by Greyhound and other bin companies. I am a full-time carer for my sister, who has Downs syndrome and who suffers from adult urinary incontinence. I need to use my bin daily to dispose of adult nappies and pads. As a result of the new charges, my bin charges will increase from Euro 204 to Euro 304.60. This is a price increase of 50% and in my opinion it is outrageous that this is allowed to happen.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_63">[...]</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_64"> The Dept of Environment stated that 87% of clients would see their bin charges fall. This is clearly erroneous and misleading information.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_65"> I am a life-long environmentalist and I have a compost heap for my green waste. I use my green bin to dispose of all plastics and paper. There is very little else I can do to reduce my own personal liability.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_66"> I hope you can now influence this Government to step in before July 1st and prevent this profiteering by these bin companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> I never thought I would end up in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_68">But I am very proud to represent working people and one poster has stuck in my head for a very long time. It read, "We deserve to live, not just to exist", and that is what is happening to working people in this country at the moment. We talk about a dispensation in this House but there is a dispensation in society whereby working people will not take any more stealth taxes or fiascos such as Irish Water. What is the Taoiseach going to do about this debacle? Will he bring forward legislation to ensure it does not happen again?</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_35" as="#Taoiseach_and_Minister_for_Defence">
          <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T14:35:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_69">Deputy Gino Kenny is welcome and he is as entitled to ask questions as anybody else. He is doing fine. I share the view of the person who sent the e-mail to which the Deputy referred, and who supports environmental efficiency and the proper disposal of waste. I am glad the person points out the issues relating to the disposal of plastic, paper and cardboard in green bins and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> The Deputy also spoke about working families and the Government is really interested in giving working families a break. The former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, introduced a statutory instrument for that purpose so that people would consider very carefully how to dispose of the waste produced by each household. By a better use of the brown and green bins, we can reduce what went into the black bins and, by reducing the weight of what was being disposed of in this way, we can reduce the overall charge. That was not going to happen under the current regime so the Minister met all the waste management companies and put in place a price freeze, agreed with them, which recognises the particular health difficulties experienced by the person who sent the e-mail to the Deputy. Some 60,000 HSE patients around the country have adult incontinence nappies and there is a substantial charge for sending them to landfill but the Government gives 100% to waste companies and 50% to the waste industry from the landfill levy. This measure is a recognition of that person's willingness to comply with good environmental practices and takes into account such people's particular challenges. From 1 January 2017, the person in question will get a dual bill setting out what he will continue to pay under the current regime and what he could save by better management of what is put into the black bin. That is in keeping with the principle expressed by the writer of the e-mail.</p>

          <p eId="para_71">I do not think people are looking for a gentleman's agreement. This gentleman is with Greyhound but that company is exempt from the new charges and is not a part of the Irish Waste Management Association. This man has to stay with his provider so he cannot be exempt from any new charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_72"> I remember when the service was in public control, maybe ten or 12 years ago, but I do not remember any fly tipping, or at any rate it was very rare. Now it is almost contagious across the country and there is a correlation between that and the privatisation of the public refuse service. It will cost local authorities around the country millions and millions to clean it up. This service should not be privatised - it should be in public hands.</p>

          <p eId="para_73">For many years waste collection was operated by local authorities but that has now changed and competition now applies. Deputy Martin raised a valid point when he spoke of the need to look at the entire structure of the management of waste disposal. This could be looked at as different systems are in operation in different parts of the country. In many places there may be only one or two suppliers, while in others there may be three or four waste company lorries providing a service on any one road. Deputy Adams said his party supported making this part of general Exchequer taxation but this would involve an increase in taxes and would put more pressure on working families. It would also do away with all the incentives referred to by the writer of the e-mail to Deputy Gino Kenny such as the proper use of the green, brown and black bins.</p>
          <p eId="para_74">We are very compliant and have moved up the table in so far as the disposal of recyclable material is concerned from a European point of view and the spirit of what was introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, was to improve that further.</p>

Before moving on to the Order of Business, I bring Members' attention to the fact that later on, when the business of the week has been agreed, we propose to allocate one minute per Leader for expressions of sympathy following the brutal murder of Jo Cox, MP.</p>
          <p eId="para_82"> In accordance with the reforms agreed by the House, the Dáil business committee has been established. Its appointed rapporteur for this week is Deputy Clare Daly. I call on Deputy Daly to announce the Order of Business for this week.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">As stated by the Ceann Comhairle, I have been asked to give the report of the business committee, as agreed at our meeting on 15 June.

          <p eId="para_84"> I refer Members to the report of the business committee circulated to Members last week. In relation to today’s business, there are two proposals. It is proposed that:</p>

          <p eId="para_113">The shooting dead of Jo Cox, MP, was an appalling crime against a public representative. A mother of two young children who should have been celebrating her 42nd birthday tomorrow with her husband Brendan and their children, Jo Cox was a talented and dedicated politician with a very bright political future in front of her. The outpouring of grief and dismay at her murder gave a strong indication of the kind of politician, public servant, humanitarian, friend, daughter, wife and mother that she was. To her family, her husband Brendan and their two young children, I know I have the full support of the House and the Seanad in expressing my sincerest and deepest sympathy. This was an attack on our democratic values. Public representatives have to be able to go about their public duty and their constituency duty free from harassment and assault. I dearly hope that such violence will not be repeated.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> I had spoken to a group in Liverpool when the message came through that Jo Cox had been shot on the street just a short distance away. In her House of Commons maiden speech she had made the point that immigrants to Great Britain, including Irish Catholics, had added greatly to the depth and the strength of personality of the people in the area. In her own words, she said: "we are far more united and have far more in common with each other than things that divide us." Go ndéana Dia trócaire ar a hanam.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMartin" eId="spk_60">

          <p eId="para_115">On my behalf and on behalf of my party, I wish to express our deepest sympathy to the family, community and political colleagues of Jo Cox, MP. The murder of a public representative in a democracy is, thankfully, a very rare and shocking event. It is extremely important that we condemn what has happened, but also reflect on it. Quite clearly, the British Labour Party has lost a rising star, a person who was passionate and independent in mind and spirit, who, through her short life, made an extraordinary contribution before she entered politics through international affairs and through Oxfam. She had a deep, passionate commitment to the refugee crisis and the situation in Syria and was a significant critic of the UK's foreign policy and successive British governments' handling of that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_116"> I read an article by John Bew in the <i>New Statesman</i> about Jo Cox's political contribution and what an extraordinary individual she was. The article is headed "Jo Cox might be the best foreign secretary Britain never had." That description spoke to her internationalist approach but also her deep passion about international affairs. Bew says, "She was one of those rare people with a deep moral integrity but no interest in grandstanding or moralising herself."</p>
          <p eId="para_117">In an era when politics can be debased and there is much disillusion about politics, it is very clear that, in the person of Jo Cox, politics gained somebody who was motivated by the very best interests of public good and community. In many respects, she stood in stark contrast to some of the stereotyping of politicians that can go on in the modern world. It is extremely important that we do not stigmatise politicians. In many ways, politicians are overly stigmatised as a group and that can heighten extreme rhetoric which can lead to the most horrific consequences. Our sympathies are with her husband, Brendan, her family and her wider community on an enormous loss.</p>

          <p eId="para_119"> I also extend on my behalf and that of Sinn Féin sincerest sympathy and solidarity to Jo’s husband, Brendan, and her two young children, Lejla and Cuillin. I also want to extend solidarity to my friend, the leader of the Labour Party, Jeremy Corbyn, who has lost a talented, hardworking and gifted colleague, to Jo’s constituents and her many colleagues in the British Parliament. Jo Cox was a remarkable young woman. She would have celebrated her 42nd birthday tomorrow. She had been elected to the British Parliament only a year ago but was recognised as a dedicated activist, as a very articulate advocate for her constituency and for those issues that were important to her.</p>
          <p eId="para_120"> She especially made her mark fighting for the rights of refugees in Syria and those tens of thousands crossing the Mediterranean Sea to Europe from the Middle East and North Africa. She was also a committed campaigner on behalf of the people of Palestine, a compassionate defender of human rights, a believer in equality for women and a fierce opponent of racism, intolerance and injustice wherever they existed. Her murder is a devastating blow to her family and colleagues but also to the British political system agus go ndéana Dia trócaire uirthi.</p>

          <p eId="para_121">As others did last week, I travelled with Deputy Sherlock to Liverpool to campaign in the United Kingdom for the people of Britain to vote to remain part of the EU. During the day, like the Taoiseach, we met with Irish community groups, business leaders and the ordinary people of Liverpool going about their normal day’s work. The sun shone for a while. It also rained. It was like a normal day at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_122"> As one would expect during a campaign like that, some people agreed with us, others did not. While we were there Jo Cox, a Labour MP, was shot and stabbed in Birstall, just 70 miles from where we were campaigning. Word came through to the two British Labour MPs who were with us, and the British Labour MEP, who knew Jo extremely well as a friend and colleague, that she had died. It was very emotional. Jo was 41 years old, a wife, a parent of two young children, a lifelong campaigner for Labour values and it was for her campaigning, because she was in politics, that she was killed. She will live long in all our memories now, including those of us who never heard of Jo before that day. She will inspire us to redouble our efforts to combat extremism and hatred in all their forms. We can have very strong views in our political lives but we should have those views within the boundaries of decency. That is the inspirational message that Jo Cox has left with us. May she rest in peace.</p>

          <p eId="para_123">On behalf of People Before Profit and the Anti-Austerity Alliance, I extend our heartfelt condolences and sympathies to Jo Cox’s husband, Brendan, her two children and all her family and friends.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">Jo's murder was an utterly vile and obnoxious act which must be condemned outright. British politics and the Labour Party in Britain have suffered the loss of a champion of progressive causes.</p>
          <p eId="para_125"> At the time of her death, Jo was preparing a report for the British Parliament on the rise of Islamophobia and aggressive nationalist politics, and the need to challenge them. She had also produced a report on the plight of Palestinian people in Gaza and the need to lift the blockade of Gaza. From the very first day she entered the British Parliament, she spoke out about the need to oppose racism and welcome and acknowledge the contribution of refugees and immigrants in Britain, whether Irish Catholics, Muslims or any other nationality. She was clearly a subscriber to the view that I and, I hope, everybody holds, namely, that there is only one race in the world, the human race. Jo Cox clearly subscribed to that view. It is a shocking wake-up call for us about the dangers of the growth of far-right, racist and anti-immigrant sentiment right across Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_126"> We do not know the exact circumstances or reasons for her killing, but evidence is mounting that the person who was apprehended was associated with some of the fascist far-right in Europe. Whatever our differences on questions of the European Union or policy, in the aftermath of Jo's death we all have to show the strongest united front against racism, intolerance and prejudice in the way that Jo Cox did throughout her life. Her husband Brendan committed in the aftermath of the shooting to fighting the hatred that killed Jo, and we should all commit to that battle in the aftermath of her tragic murder.</p>

          <p eId="para_127">The murder of Jo Cox, MP, was completely and utterly senseless. A person going about her work was attacked and executed in a brutal and horrific way - her killing was an execution. It goes against everything we believe in in a democracy, namely, the right to free speech, protest, different opinions and respect for difference. It is very hard to believe that there could be somebody with such hatred that he could take it out on a person who has been a voice for those suffering through being refugees. She has been robbed of her potential to do even more. I am conscious that she is not alone. As we stand here today, other parliamentarians in different parts of the world have also been murdered, are subject to violence or are in jail because of their political views. I extend heartfelt sympathy to her family, community and political party.</p>

          <p eId="para_128">On behalf of the rural independent group, I want to express our sincerest sympathies to Jo Cox's husband, Brendan, her extended family and her party. This is a grotesque attack on democracy. That a respectable elected parliamentarian who was going about her business in a respectful and respectable fashion was gunned down in this type of horror attack is an absolute attack on the democracy that we all hold so dear. Every one of us is outraged.</p>
          <p eId="para_129"> I thank the Ceann Comhairle for facilitating the signing of the book of condolences in the House. The decision was very thoughtful, proper, right and dignified. When I signed my name this morning, I looked at the picture and could see the brightness in her eyes and her appreciation of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_130">One could see she was full of energy and determination. It was an outrageous attack on democracy that a young life like that - a young mother, a daughter, a wife - could be taken from her family, community and the people she represented.</p>
          <p eId="para_131"> There is a lesson to be learned. I say this in particular to the ladies that are elected to this House. There is one thing I have spotted over a period and it is about time it was put to bed once and for all. Nobody in this House, male or female, should be subjected to vile abuse. That is happening increasingly and it is growing legs. We can all have our political differences. I can object and have a political argument with a man or woman in this House about any issue. I do not care who one is or where one comes from, but under no circumstances should anybody be subjected to vile abuse.</p>

          <p eId="para_138">Everybody in this country, both within this House and outside, was shocked to the core last Thursday afternoon when we heard of the appalling and senseless death of Jo Cox. By all accounts she was a parliamentarian with huge potential and a very bright future ahead of her. It is quite clear from all of the comments that have been made since her death that she was hugely admired and respected by all of her constituents and her colleagues in Westminster.</p>
          <p eId="para_139"> The Taoiseach quoted earlier from Jo Cox's maiden speech in Westminster last year. She made the point that while we celebrate diversity we have far more that unites us than divides us. The most fitting tribute we can pay to her is to be mindful of that fact in all of our dealings as parliamentarians. On behalf of the Social Democrats I extend our deepest sympathy to the husband, children and wider family of Jo Cox and to the wider British Labour Party family as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_140">On behalf of the Independent Alliance, I wish to offer my sympathy to Brendan and his two children on this horrific murder. When I first heard about the attack, I was totally shocked and disgusted that a young MP, a mother, was murdered in such a way coming out of her constituency clinic. It was absolutely horrific. First, a young woman was murdered. Second, a young mother left two lovely children and a husband behind. It was an absolutely appalling crime. Third, from our point of view, an elected politician was murdered. We all immediately identified with the fact that she was coming out of her clinic after trying to help people. As Members of the Oireachtas, we can identify with Jo as a Member of Parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_141"> We all know about her strong humanitarian work, her fantastic work in respect of Syria and her amazing work with refugees. A number of colleagues referred above all to her constant campaigning against racism. That is something about which we should all be very vigilant. From what was said by some Opposition Members of the British Parliament, Jo Cox also had a great ability to work cross-party on issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_142">To the Labour Party, its sister Labour Party in Ireland and its leader, Deputy Brendan Howlin, on behalf of the Independent Alliance I offer our most sincere sympathy. Life is precious and this is a reminder to us all that despite differences, one must be vigilant and must stand up to protect the dignity of and to have respect for politicians. Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the British Labour Party, also is a great man of peace and was a great friend of Ireland in respect of our peace process and Members should never forget that. I again offer my deepest sympathy on behalf of the Independent Alliance.</p>

          <p eId="para_143">Last Thursday was a breaking point. It was breaking point on Thursday morning, when that poster was presented by the head of UKIP, Nigel Farage, which appeared simply to be picking on the fears that exist in Britain on the issue of migration and to be using them to try to get a certain vote in the referendum, which will take place next Thursday. While Nigel Farage stated yesterday that it was not influential in what the assassin ended up doing that lunchtime, all Members are aware that the environment to which Deputy Michael Healy-Rae makes reference is created in part by what all of them say. As the Deputy stated, all Members should commit to considering that issue and to trying to unpick that fear. They should make sure it does not arise and develop in our country to avoid witnessing the creation of that same political environment of fear. Members should do that in honour of Jo Cox.</p>
          <p eId="para_144"> More than anything else, I also thought of the 77 year old retired miner who went to her aid and, from his name, I can only presume he comes from that Irish Yorkshire migrant tradition. Members should remember his bravery and that there are people in society who at the age of 77 will step in to try to save another life. More than anything else, Members think of the husband and, in particular, the two children of Jo Cox because for them it was a breaking point like no other. Members' thoughts and prayers are with them today.</p>

          <p eId="para_146">There is a commitment in the programme for Government to increase each year funding for home care packages and home helps. Some weeks ago, I brought to the attention of the Taoiseach that there appears to be a cap in operation on home help hours nationwide, about which he seemed unaware at the time. Since then, answers have been received to some parliamentary questions tabled that illustrate there are only 12 areas nationwide in which home help hours have not been cut. In the rest of the country, there have been savage cuts and home help hours have been cut in 21 areas, of which Cavan-Monaghan, Meath, Louth and Laois-Offaly were among the worst areas affected. This must be reviewed urgently by the Minister, Deputy Harris, in order that it can be stopped and reversed. It is extremely counter-productive, leads more people into hospital and into nursing homes and is against public policy in general. Given the Supplementary Estimate for health that has been announced, can the Taoiseach indicate whether the commitment in the programme for Government on home help hours will be realised? I have to hand the table of replies and the Taoiseach can see in red all the reductions since 2010, some of which were savage. For example, Cavan-Monaghan has experienced a decrease of 40% in home help hours. I note the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is looking at me in surprise. Similarly, there has been a reduction of 34% in south Tipperary. These are huge figures that have been given in the parliamentary replies to Members.</p>
          <p eId="para_147"> Second, the cybercrime Bill is listed in order that the convention on cybercrime can be ratified.</p>
          <p eId="para_148">Members have already articulated the very serious issue of the appalling activity online and on social media, where people have been targeted with vile abuse, among them politicians, which is totally outrageous and unacceptable. In that context, the Taoiseach might indicate when we can expect the cybercrime Bill to be put through the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_150"> In respect of the home care package that the Deputy mentioned, €40 million has been allocated from the Revised Estimate to deal with this, which is much more than last year and will hopefully allow the Minister to deal with the issues that the Deputy has raised. An extra €40 million has been allocated this time.</p>

          <p eId="para_151">In the programme for Government there are commitments on dealing with suicide prevention and mental health, and I wish to raise a number of very important issues around this. One is a project called WALK PEER, which serves mostly young people who have disabilities and trains them so that they can increase their skills and go forward, if possible, into jobs. The funding for this project has been cut and I want to ask the Taoiseach if he will reconsider that. We have already raised this with the Minister involved and particularly with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who has promised to look at it. I ask the Taoiseach to give it some attention as well. Mental health is an issue affecting every single family across this State and across this island. Suicide is on the increase, yet funding for mental health has been substantially cut despite promises by the Government to do the exact opposite.</p>

          <p eId="para_155">Two weeks ago, I asked about the establishment of the north inner city task force. In the Taoiseach's absence, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, was standing in for him and I asked for details on where the task force stands, its membership, who would lead it and so on. I remain of the belief that in order for this task force to work it needs to have the full support of everybody in the House. I was advised by the Minister that the Taoiseach would communicate with me directly. That did not happen. I contacted the Taoiseach's office again last week and I was advised that I would receive an update by the end of last week. Again, I have received no further contact. I wish to ask the Taoiseach when we will get a full briefing on the membership. I know he has been involved again with community leaders in recent days and that is very good. I believe, and I said so two weeks ago, that this could be a model that we would all buy into, sign up to and fund, whatever Government is in office for the next ten years or so. We could replicate it in other areas of the country. Will the Taoiseach bring the other parties on board in this process and ensure that we have inputs into the composition of the task force? When can we hear from him?</p>

          <p eId="para_156">There is no point in trying to do it from one source only. The Deputy is aware that I met with community leaders in the inner city down at St. Laurence O'Toole's national school. There were contributions there from 30 or 40 people who are leaders in their own areas. Last night, I met with a range of people, some public representatives and some not. I believe it is important to take into account the representatives of all parties. There was a comment made yesterday evening about how the terms of reference were being drafted by a wider group in the inner city. I wait to see what those terms of reference are. I do not know all of the personnel involved in that particular area, though Members commented that it seemed to be a wider group than normal. I indicated that I did not want the task force to try to cover the entire area and that it should be more tightly managed.</p>
          <p eId="para_157"> I will communicate with Deputy Howlin directly and I am sorry that he was not contacted after he raised this issue last week. I hope we will set up a task force that can be a model and a template for any other area in the country by the end of July. I have to go back to talk to some of those other groups. People set out their short, medium and longer-term views. Everybody made this point: the media, with respect to them, would appear in some cases to have branded the entire area as being gangland. The people resent that. There is so much good happening in the inner city area. They ask that people reflect very carefully on what they say and what they write about the people who live across that entire area. That point was made very forcibly by both public representatives and leaders of communities. We will communicate with the Deputy and with everybody else in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_158">Last week, I brought an issue to the House with regard to St. Augustine's special school in Blackrock for children with mild intellectual disabilities. That was following a mobilisation, if one likes, by very concerned parents about the children and plans by St. John of God Community Services to cut HSE funding to vocational services. I was glad to hear that on foot of the protests and campaigning of the families, a stay, as it were, had been put on the plan to cut entirely the vocational services to St. Augustine's special school. Can we get a commitment that it will not just be a stay? According to the report I have read, while there is a stay, it will be reviewed and there will be further consultation, but these cuts in vocational services are still not absolutely off the table. I ask for a commitment that hands will be taken off any effort to take away these vocational services.</p>
          <p eId="para_159"> In addition, the Taoiseach needs to look at some of these services that one might call preventative in nature and that are being funded by the health services generally, which seem to be being cut to move resources towards what might be considered more emergency issues. Of course we need to deal with emergencies, but that should not be at the expense of youth or preventative projects dealing with children with disabilities or, as in a case I have mentioned-----</p>

          <p eId="para_163">The Minister for Health was very annoyed at how this was handled. Yesterday, there was a meeting between HSE officials and the management of St. John of God Community Services at which it was agreed that the current provision of services to pupils and families will remain in place until such time as these proposals are fully teased out or discussed and agreed with the HSE. Parents have to be involved here. St. John of God Community Services recently informed the HSE of its decision to restructure the boarding school element of St. Augustine's School, Blackrock, in line with projected need and the national disability policy of progressing children's disability services. It indicated its intention to close the boarding school service over a two-year period, as only two children remain as boarders and they will graduate during that period. The main area of concern for parents at St. Augustine's has been the proposed changes to the vocational training programme. It is important to emphasise that despite substantial investment by the Department of Education and Skills in services at St. Augustine's in recent years, the HSE has not reduced funding to St. John of God Community Services for St. Augustine's school.</p>
          <p eId="para_164"> Officials were briefed by the management team of St. John of God Community Services on Monday, 20 June. At that meeting, as I said to the Deputy, it was agreed that the <i>status quo</i> would pertain. No changes will be made to funding or services without being formally submitted, discussed and agreed by the HSE. The HSE is reassuring parents that it will continue to work in partnership with the parents, the Department of Education and Skills and St. John of God Community Services in order to find the best possible solution for both young people with disabilities and their families. The Minister has made the point that parents need to be involved in this.</p>

          <p eId="para_165">After a long, hard battle, the Government has thankfully agreed, in the programme for Government, to deliver the re-introduction of local improvement schemes and a new drainage scheme. This is a most welcome development. Local improvement schemes were suspended more than five years ago, which meant that no local authority in Ireland could offer people living on a road on which there might be from two to 20 houses the opportunity of having a local improvement scheme. These schemes are most important. The new drainage scheme and the method for delivering it are also most important. There is no sense in tarring a road unless the water can be drained from it. I am very thankful to the Government for including this new, imaginative scheme in the programme for Government. What commitment will the Taoiseach give on the introduction of these schemes? I also include Údarás na Gaeltachta roads. There was great delivery of funds through Roinn na Gaeltachta over many years whereby roads in the Gaeltacht were tarred.</p>

          <p eId="para_167">It was certainly due to Deputy Ó Cuív and I give him 100% credit for it. We also wish to give credit to this Government for doing the same. There are three matters for the Taoiseach. When will he inform the local authorities of what funding will be put in place for the local improvement schemes, so they can open the schemes? When will the new drainage scheme be put in place and how much money will be given to the local authorities for it? Finally, what type of commitment will the Taoiseach give regarding money for roads in the Gaeltacht under Roinn na Gaeltachta? It is in the programme for Government so perhaps the Taoiseach will tell us what he will do.</p>

          <p eId="para_178">Yes, the support for agriculture in that programme. Another issue is that if the blue card of an animal states that the animal moved more than four times into four different herds, one will get €50 or €60 less for that animal in the factory. This is simply because there were more than four movements for that animal. Then there is the price of fertiliser, plastic, tyres and batteries, even though oil has never been at a lower price. We were always told that the price of oil dictated the price of these items. Why is it that the costs have gone beyond the beyond? Farmers are being driven down into the ground. They are in a desperate state. They do not have a bob or a copper, and the new Minister should know that.</p>

Diversity in our schools is an opportunity for our society, not something by which we should feel threatened. All Members of the House will have heard the anecdotal and factual evidence of parents feeling forced to baptise their children to secure a school place. It is unlikely that any Member of the House would deny that the current situation should come to an end. We have brought forward this Bill because, unfortunately, it has become clear that in the programme for Government the Government appears to be determined not to make provision for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">We have just heard very moving tributes to the late Jo Cox in the context of her fight for equality and fairness. Access to a local school is one of the most important things that a child can have. In the context of the arrangements indicated in the Constitution relating to denominational education, the purpose of this Labour Party Bill is to make provision so that, on a realistic and reasonable basis, our local children can gain access to their local schools, notwithstanding the existence of denominational schools in each area. In my constituency of Dublin West, I must commend all of the patron bodies, including the various religious authorities, and the boards of management and staff of schools for attempting to ensure that every child is welcome in their local school.</p>

I submitted at least three questions. Two were transferred out for reasons unknown to me and my office was only informed yesterday when it was too late to submit more questions. I understand that there is a transition period, but it is extremely important, in respect of the reforms we introduced, that there are at least three questions tabled by the Leader of the Opposition and that this is facilitated as far as is practicable. Even when questions are transferred out, it is essential that facilities are made available to the person to submit more questions within the required time. Otherwise, we are stifling debate, which is not what the reform was about. It aimed to facilitate more debate and allow more discussion, not less.</p>

            <p eId="para_225">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_226"> The UK's decision on EU membership later this week is solely a matter for UK voters. However, those voters include Irish citizens living in Great Britain, voters in Northern Ireland and UK citizens living here. As the UK's closest neighbour, Ireland has a unique perspective and interest in the outcome of the referendum. The Government has made clear our hope that the UK will decide to stay in the European Union.</p>
            <p eId="para_227"> I and other members of the Government have completed a targeted programme of outreach in Great Britain and Northern Ireland to Irish and Irish-connected citizens in the UK who have a vote. Last week, I had engagements in Belfast and a programme of events in Liverpool, Manchester and Glasgow, where I met with the Irish community. I also attended a summit meeting of the British-Irish Council in Glasgow. My programme coincided with the shocking death of Jo Cox, MP, in West Yorkshire, to whom we have just paid our respects. Out of respect for her and her family and in light of the suspension of the two official campaigns, I refrained from issuing any public statements about the referendum. I have no specific plans to visit Great Britain as of now.</p>
            <p eId="para_228"> Ireland will have a clear plan in place to deal with the implications of a UK vote to leave if that is the outcome, which I hope will not be the case. The key priority for Government would be to protect and promote Ireland's interests to the greatest extent possible in the event that the UK votes to leave. We have a whole-of-Government contingency framework which maps the key issues that would be most important to Ireland, dealing with the economy, trade and spending power in the days, weeks and months following a "leave" vote. In the event of that becoming a reality, this would be the framework within which each Minister, Department and agency would manage the policy, operational and programmatic implications that could arise from a UK vote to leave the EU. It will be capable of adapting to changing circumstances, depending on developments in the context of ongoing EU-UK negotiations on new arrangements and bilateral discussions between the UK and Irish Governments.</p>
            <p eId="para_229"> A key priority would be to mitigate as far as possible any potential disruption to trade, investment and jobs. In this regard, many commentators have suggested a period of volatility in the markets and suggested that sterling would suffer losses against the euro. It remains to be seen if this is the case and the extent to which markets have already priced in any degree of risk. However, if a sustained decrease in the value of sterling did transpire, clearly this would have serious implications for our exports. Given the importance of the Irish enterprise sector, the enterprise agencies are factoring this issue into their own contingency planning and are tracking where potential impacts may arise. Enterprise Ireland already has a significant number of programmes available to companies who face competitive threats from various sources. In addition, a key policy priority in recent years for both the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Enterprise Ireland has been to support geographic market diversification.</p>
            <p eId="para_230"> Our contingency framework also contains clear actions on communications and diplomatic contacts. In this regard, I will travel to Brussels next week for the European Council meeting where EU leaders will have a first opportunity to discuss the referendum result, to assess its implications and to begin to chart a way forward. I intend to make a more detailed statement on Ireland's position in my pre-Council statement to the House after the conclusion of these questions.</p>

            <p eId="para_231">It is important to again put on the record of the House the enormity of the potential consequences for jobs, trade, travel, tourism and the agrifood sector in this country. Trade between here and the UK accounts for almost 400,000 direct jobs, and 43% of our exports go to the UK. We know that the ESRI has reported that there could be an immediate reduction in trade of up to 20% if the Brexit vote to leave is carried. Teagasc has also reported that there could be a huge reduction in the value of Irish agrifood exports, ranging from €150 million to almost €800 million. This puts it into context.</p>
            <p eId="para_232"> When I talk to people about this matter, such as people in the business or farming community or members of the general public, they feel that the Government does not have a handle on the plan we will deploy if the vote to leave passes. Have we a plan B? Has any scenario been planned in that instance? Are we hoping against hope that it will not happen?</p>
            <p eId="para_233">Can the Taoiseach give us any kind of reassurance on the contingency planning that has happened? In his initial response he said that the Government has a clear plan in place but he has not given us any real detail. Who has been involved in drawing up this plan? How many Departments and State agencies have been involved? Can we get any kind of an insight into it? The campaign run by the Taoiseach and other political leaders was interrupted by the murder of Jo Cox, which we spoke about earlier, and I offer my condolences to her family and community. The European Movement office tells us of a huge British community here in Ireland that should have been influenced a little bit more. The Irish community in the UK could also have been influenced a little bit more. Will the Taoiseach comment on the contingency planning and give us a little more detail?</p>

            <p eId="para_234">I agree with the Taoiseach that the issue of how people in Britain vote in the Brexit referendum is a matter for voters there but unfortunately, aside from all the other implications, it is a vote which will have a direct impact on the people in the North. Most opinion polls suggest that the vote to leave the EU remains very strong and that the two sides are almost evenly split. I spent Saturday in Belfast taking part in Sinn Féin's day of action across the North calling for a remain vote. The murder of Labour MP, Jo Cox, cast a shadow over this but the response from those I met was very positive. Sinn Féin has real concerns about some aspects of the European Union, particularly the democratic deficit in the decision-making processes. We want a more democratic and social European Union. Nevertheless, to have one part of this island inside the European Union and the other outside will not be good for the island. It is not in Ireland's interest to have border posts or trade barriers. It is also very much the case that the British Government wants either to do away with the human rights elements of the Good Friday Agreement or not to implement equality protocols which are central to it. They will find this much easier to do if they are not part of the EU. I do not know any more than anyone else what the outcome of the vote will be but if it is to leave, the two-year divorce period for the British to negotiate their withdrawal would also be hugely destabilising.</p>
            <p eId="para_235"> Last week, we received a confidential briefing from officials from the Taoiseach's Department on the Government's approach and preparations and I thank the Taoiseach for facilitating that. It emphasised the huge amount of confusion and uncertainty that exists around any process of Brexit. Others in the Chamber have a different view, but for those of us who even reluctantly want to see people remaining in the European Union, we should use this opportunity to express our support for the remain side in the referendum. It is well known that the only Brexit that Sinn Féin wants to see is a Brexit from Ireland of the British Government. I reiterate our strong support for a referendum on Irish unity and our appeal to the Government to support this as part of the Good Friday Agreement. </p>

            <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_237">I was due in Belfast on Friday but because of the murder of Jo Cox, I had to curtail my canvassing, as did Deputy Adams. I am very concerned about the absence of contingency planning. In the discussions I had with the Independents on the formation of Government, it was very clear to us that very little scenario planning in terms of the economy or the impact on agriculture had been undertaken by Departments. There have been some academic papers published but there would appear to be a lot of prayer and hope that it goes the right way as opposed to any considered contingency planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_238"> In terms of the European Council meeting next week, there are two responses - one in the event of a "Yes" vote for Brexit and the second in the context of a "No" vote. If there is a "Yes" vote, it is extremely important that we have a prepared position as a country going into that council meeting. Cool heads should prevail. In the aftermath of Lisbon, we had to move in very quickly to the Foreign Affairs Council to make sure that hotheads did not get their day which would have set everybody back. Likewise, whatever the result, we need cool heads and a considered and reflective view by the European Union and by this Parliament. If a decision to break with the EU is taken, we need calm and cool heads in the aftermath of that and planning and proper preparation of the best strategy for Ireland. Ireland will face unique challenges as a member of the European Union and because of its historical special relationship with Britain in terms of the common travel area, trade and exports which have to be protected in any new scenario. If the vote is "No", which I hope it is, and Britain remains, I would equally suggest that we should seize the moment at the European Council meeting and say to our European colleagues that this is a moment for reflection and a moment when real lessons have to be learned about how Europe is going about its business. There is significant disconnect between the citizens of Europe and the European institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_239"> I have been pointing at this over quite a number of years and there has been a lot of work and research done on this. There have been attempts in terms of the democratisation of the parliament to make it more connected. It is extremely important that the debate in Britain fuels a wider debate across Europe on how we can reconnect the values, principles and ideals of the European Union with citizens on the ground - in other words, the idealism and energy that led to the post-war leaders, the people who saw that nationalist or independent, isolationist pursuits led to conflict, coming together in international partnerships to prevent world wars and horrific consequences. In the bigger picture, Europe has succeeded in that respect. There is a lot of talk about subsidiarity in terms of decision making, but it has not happened. </p>
            <p eId="para_240"> In terms of the hierarchy of decision making, Europe is still involved too much at the lower level of minutiae and detail on the ground which should be left to national parliaments and national Governments. There is a lot of work to be done at the European Council meeting. Irrespective of the outcome, but particularly if it is a "No" to Brexit and Britain remains in the European Union, which is what I believe would be in the best interest of Britain, Ireland, Europe and the world, we should use it as an opportunity for really serious reflection by all across Europe to make sure that the idealism of the original concept is brought back to centre stage of European politics. </p>

            <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_241">We in People Before Profit want absolutely nothing to do with some of the vile and racist forces that are campaigning for an exit from the European Union in Britain, some of whom have stoked up the sort of racist conditions and sentiment that took the life of Labour MP, Jo Cox. We must all dissociate ourselves from that. Having said that, I disagree with the consensus in the House that the way to deal with the virulent rise of racism, prejudice, islamophobia and the growth of far right forces in Europe is to stay in the European Union in the hope of reforming it. Is it not the case that the European Union is the architect of its own crisis and that it has caused the problems that have now produced such widespread disaffection? This is summed up by the comments by Jean-Claude Juncker in January 2015, when the Syriza government was first elected, that, "To suggest that everything is going to change because there is a new government in Athens is to mistake dreams for reality... There can be no democratic choice against the European treaties."</p>
            <p eId="para_242">Is the problem not fundamentally that the leaders of the European Union are saying democracy has gone out the window with the European Union and that that has been compounded with the disgusting racist fortress-Europe policy that has led to the deaths of thousands of people trying to get into Europe? While Europe parades as a beacon of progress, in fact, its own racists policies <i>vis-à-vis</i> desperate people fleeing from Syria involves throwing them back to the Turkish Government, which is now shooting them. Last week, Syrian refugees were shot. Europe has signed an agreement with Turkey to allow that to happen and it is throwing those desperate people back to Turkey to allow it to shoot them. Is it those misguided undemocratic fortress-Europe policies and austerity policies that have created the crisis that is now consuming us? In that context, would we be better off supporting not Brexit but the left exit campaign of saying we want European internationalism - in fact, we want comprehensive internationalism that goes beyond the boundaries of Europe - if we are to undermine and defeat the dangerous forces of racism and the far right that the European Union itself has helped to stoke up?</p>

            <p eId="para_244">Deputies Niall Collins, Martin, Adams and Boyd Barrett raised a number of important questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_245"> In response to Deputy Collins, there is a €60 billion trade across the Irish Sea every year and, obviously, as the Deputy pointed out, 400,000 jobs at stake here - 200,000 on this side and 200,000 in Britain. These are matters of great concern to Irish exporters, many of whom export heavy equipment to Britain and through Britain to other countries. They make the point that if the British electorate were to vote to leave, this would cause an imposition in terms of paperwork, customs or whatever which would lead to inefficiency, time wasting, a lack of competitiveness and probably a lack of jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_246"> Another point is that while people might reflect between our position and Northern Ireland, it actually would be not an Irish border from Dundalk to Derry but a European border because we would be a member of the European Union and Britain would want to withdraw from it, if it made a decision to do so. Obviously, as has been pointed out, that would carry its own implications. It would be a European border as distinct from an Irish border. In respect of Deputy Adams's point, I take that on board.</p>
            <p eId="para_247"> Deputy Martin raised the question of contingency planning. I do not want to set out a strategy here that the Government or the people in Ireland believe that this will be a negative vote and that the British people will vote to leave the European Union because one must wait and see what the answer will be. However, it is important to state that voting takes place on Thursday and it goes on until 10 p.m. that night. The counting of votes starts immediately. By 3 a.m. or 4 a.m. on Friday, one should be in a position to get a prediction of what might happen here. There are no official exit polls being taken, although I understand many of the trading houses and financial institutions have been closely monitoring the situation. I suppose the movement of sterling in itself would be an indication of the way that they may be thinking. The announcement will be made from Manchester of the overall result. Suffice to say that we have been considering all of this and that from 5 a.m. on Friday, the contingency framework that Ireland would put in place here would be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_248"> I want to make it clear again that I hope that the British electorate votes in favour of remaining as a member of the European Union. In the past 48 hours, I feel some sense of a different reflection about this vote from the British electorate and, as I say, I hope they vote to remain. I can assure the Deputies and the party leaders that there is a full-scale contingency programme in place which I hope that we do not have to use. That programme would deal with headline issues, such as the calling of a Government meeting, if that were deemed appropriate, and contact with other leaders in other cities in Europe. However, as Deputy Martin rightly pointed out, there is a need here for level-headedness and a measured response. If the vote were to be to leave, it would not mean that Britain is gone from the European Union on Friday. There is still a two-year window there of negotiations and complex discussions. In respect of our response to such a vote, it would be about the economy, trade, jobs and investment and about whether sterling would remain strong or whether it would collapse, and if so, for how long, what that would mean for Enterprise Ireland and for agencies dealing with small and medium-sized enterprises, and how they would support diversification into the market and beyond through Europe. These are issues that, obviously, would be considered as part of any contingency plan, were such to kick-in.</p>
            <p eId="para_249"> I agree completely with Deputy Martin on the following point. If this vote is to stay, and I hope it is, there is a lesson here for Europe too. One cannot have a situation where the President of the Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, was found to have put in place an infrastructural fund of €400 billion for major projects across Europe and that countries would have the right to draw on that under certain conditions but have the imposition of particular conditions set by EUROSTAT, which is an independent entity, that would mean there would be restrictions on what countries could do, when one can borrow money at a negative or very low interest rate to provide services and facilities for people, such as housing. Approval for a case in Britain has been withdrawn. This does not help the situation. I agree that not everything about the European Union is perfect and that this is an opportunity, if the people in Britain vote to stay, to reflect on the structure of Europe and on when the European Council makes political decisions, how they should be implemented in the interests of their citizens. That is an issue about which I have already written to the President of the Commission and to the leaders, that others are now taking up and that will become an issue for reflection there.</p>
            <p eId="para_250"> Deputy Boyd Barrett quoted from a document. If I heard the Deputy correctly, I think he stated that there was no choice in respect of the European treaties. The treaties are approved or not by the people in the different countries. We had a number of referenda here where the people voted twice in order to have a deeper reflection on the issue, whether on the Nice treaty, the Lisbon treaty or whatever.</p>
            <p eId="para_251"> On the Turkish deal for migration, the problem here, to be quite straight with Deputy Boyd Barrett, was how was one to deal with the people smugglers who have inveigled people to pay serious sums to get on rubber rafts or rickety boats to attempt the crossing to Greece and inevitably end up in the water with many drowned. The intention was that people who would arrive as illegal asylum seekers or refugees would go back to camps in Turkey funded by the European Union but be replaced by legitimate asylum seekers who had moved to Turkey under the refugee or asylum programme. The intention genuinely was around how to deal with the people smugglers who have no care or interest in respect of the many thousands who have drowned in the Mediterranean. That was what the issue was about. I note Deputy Boyd Barrett disagrees with it.</p>

            <p eId="para_265"> I last visited Belfast on Monday, 13 June, when I addressed a conference on "Working Together for Peace and Prosperity", organised by the University of Ulster. I took the opportunity in my remarks to outline the Irish Government’s position regarding the imminent UK referendum on European Union membership. I outlined our particular perspective on the issue, including the importance of avoiding any hardening of the Border in whatever form. Following my speech, I took part in a panel discussion on the issues raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_266"> While at the university I met the vice chancellor, Mr. Paddy Nixon, and a number of community and non-governmental organisation representatives attending the conference, including some of those currently involved with the "Stronger In" referendum campaign. I also visited the newly opened premises of CPL Recruitment at a networking event attended by business representatives. I also took the opportunity at that event to ensure that the Irish Government's position on the forthcoming referendum was understood.</p>
            <p eId="para_267"> I attended the 26th summit of the British-Irish Council on 17 June, hosted by the Scottish Government in Glasgow. The heads of delegation were welcomed by First Minister Sturgeon on behalf of the Scottish Government. She commenced the meeting with a minute's silence to mark the untimely death of Ms Jo Cox, MP. The council reflected on priorities for member administrations and discussed how the council could continue to promote co-operation on issues of common concern. The council also noted that there might be scope for new areas of co-operation based on emerging government and member administration priorities across these islands, many of which have had elections in recent times.</p>
            <p eId="para_268"> In the context of current issues, the forthcoming UK EU referendum was discussed. I clearly set out the Irish Government's position and our programme of outreach to Irish citizens in Britain who have a vote. The Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, met counterparts with particular responsibility for unpaid carers in advance of the summit to consider a detailed paper prepared by the council’s social inclusion work sector. The discussion was then taken forward by heads of administration, where the council agreed that carers are an integral and vital part of society, caring for family, friends and neighbours affected by physical or mental illness, disability, frailty or substance misuse. It was agreed that further sharing of research and good practice in this important area will be pursued by member administrations.</p>
            <p eId="para_269"> The Scottish Government updated the council on the work done in advance of the summit to take forward work being undertaken to review the operation of the council. It also noted the secretariat's end of year report and agreed a new council communications plan for 2016 to 2018. The council also approved publication of the British-Irish Council annual report for 2015, and the next British-Irish Council summit is scheduled for Wales in November 2016.</p>

            <p eId="para_270">I welcome very much the Taoiseach's visit to Belfast. It is really important that the Taoiseach and other Ministers visit the North often and regularly and that they meet people in all the sectors. During the Belfast visit, the Taoiseach went to the new Belfast office of CPL Recruitment and spoke to business leaders, among others, about the importance of encouraging economic growth on both sides of the Border. This is a very important area of potential for people, no matter what part of Ireland in which we live. I will concentrate, if I may, on that issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_271"> There are significant similarities between the two economies on the island and all of us, including Unionists, accept that we work best when we co-operate. They use the phrase, "to our mutual advantage". There are also differences, largely as a consequence of partition, which mean we have two different currencies, tax systems and laws impacting on business. There is a need to stimulate the economies of both parts of the island, which requires greater co-operation between the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government here. In this respect, the work of the North-South Ministerial Council is of particular importance.</p>
            <p eId="para_272"> I understand the last meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council was postponed. Will the Taoiseach confirm when the next meeting will take place? It was also agreed in December at a plenary session that a report would be prepared for the Narrow Water bridge project, to which the Acting Chairman has given his support. The project will significantly enhance business and tourism opportunities between Louth, south Down and south Armagh, as well as the wider Border region. Last week I visited the site of the proposed Narrow Water bridge with the Narrow Water Bridge Community Network, including Ms Caitríona Ruane, MLA, Councillor John Loughran and the Executive finance Minister, Mr. Máirtín Ó Muilleoir. I know the Taoiseach is aware there is very strong support for this on both sides of the Border and from all shades of political opinion. It is across the Border and across communities. It is also included in the Irish Government's capital investment plan for 2016 to 2021 and the Oireachtas committee for jobs, enterprise and innovation recently reported that the bridge is essential to the economic development of the region. Will the Taoiseach confirm if the report for the North-South Ministerial Council has been completed? Will it be published after the council meeting?</p>
            <p eId="para_273"> Will the Taoiseach give some indication of the work that has been done on the issue of target investment in cross-Border economic infrastructure agreed in the Fresh Start agreement? I will be as brief as possible but these include the M5, which will open the north west, including Donegal; the Ulster Canal project; and the north-west gateway. Has there been any progress on sourcing further investment either from the European Union or the private sector for all-island infrastructural projects that would be to the mutual benefit of both economies on the island? Is é sin an méid.</p>
            <p eId="para_274"> Ní aontaím leo siúd a mhol gur cheart na ceisteanna seo a ghlacadh le chéile. The Taoiseach was right and the question on Belfast is very specific. I have other questions on the other matters but I will leave it at that for now.</p>

            <p eId="para_275">I note in the Taoiseach's comments on the British-Irish Council that he referred to the discussion on the referendum. Will the Taoiseach comment on the tenor of the debate? It has, rightly, come in for widespread criticism. It does not surprise me, given that one side is led by the leadership faction in the Conservative Party and the other side is led by the opposition faction in the Conservative Party, with the support of the UK Independence Party. Disgracefully, we have seen finger pointing and blame laid at the feet of immigrants; the most disgusting example is Nigel Farage's UKIP "Breaking Point" billboard. Both sides have framed the debate in such a way that they each speak of immigration and immigrants as though that were a problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_276"> Many community and trade union activists and socialists are campaigning for an exit, but for very different reasons to those I outlined earlier. Their motivation is to defend the welfare State and the National Health Service from the neoliberal drive being spearheaded by the EU, and to stand up against the race to the bottom in terms of wages and conditions in employment being promoted by the European Union elite. I share the disappointment of those activists that the Labour leader, Mr. Jeremy Corbyn, has not pitched in on their side as had he done so the debate would have been decisively won for a "leave" position and immigration would be pushed back and less of an issue. The "leave" side would win, first and foremost, on the basis of progressive politics. Additionally, the Tory Government would be facing a shattering defeat and the likelihood of being driven from office. Will the Taoiseach comment on the tenor of the debate to which I referred at the start?</p>

            <from> The Taoiseach<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_277">We have a genuine interest in the development and stimulation of both economies, and that is why I am glad the Sinn Féin Party supports the opportunity for people to vote to stay as a member of the European Union. Deputy Adams is aware there is €3 billion on the table for peace and reconciliation and cross-Border activities for communities, etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_278">No date has yet been fixed for the next meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council. The Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is going there in the next two weeks and I expect the date will be announced then. That meeting will be hosted in Dublin, as the Deputy knows. In regard to the infrastructure commitments under the Fresh Start agreement, the Irish Government reaffirmed in this agreement its existing commitment to providing £50 million for the A5 western transport corridor serving the north west. A further £25 million was committed to ensure that phase one of the project can commence as soon as the necessary planning issues have been resolved by the Northern Ireland authorities. The Government will provide this money in three tranches of £25 million in 2017, 2018 and 2019. The Government and the Northern Ireland Executive have agreed that construction on the first section of the A5 will commence in 2017, with a view to completion in 2019. The first section will be the route between Newbuildings outside Derry to north of Strabane.</p>
            <p eId="para_279"> In respect of the Narrow Water bridge, the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed to undertake a review of the project, with a view to identifying options for its future development for consideration by the North-South Ministerial Council at its next meeting. Initial discussions by a group of officials, North and South, took place in December. Further meetings have taken place. A report will be provided to the next meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council. In addition, officials from North and South met with people in Newry in April with a view to feeding local proposals into the review of the project. I assure Deputy Adams that the Government remains committed to the concept of the Narrow Water bridge, which has the potential to create jobs on either side, but also to provide a real stimulus to both economies in terms of tourism and the opportunities that exist in that respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_280"> In respect of the Ulster Canal, the Government and the Northern Ireland Executive agreed to undertake a review with a view to looking at how this might progress. It is to be considered, again, by the North-South Ministerial Council at its meeting in Dublin. The Government will continue to explore the development of further cross-Border greenways and blueways, leisure routes, including the Ulster Canal as it is a matter of considerable interest to us.</p>
            <p eId="para_281"> Regarding the north-west gateway, the Government provided €2.5 million to support this initiative, which will be complemented by matching funding from the Executive in the North. A report on the north-west gateway will also be provided at the next meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_282"> Deputy Barry raised the question of the tenor of the debate. At the debate of the British-Irish Council in Glasgow, people from Guernsey, Jersey and the Isle of Man were very concerned that the British electorate would vote to leave the European Union, because this would create real difficulties for them as small economic entities and islands. The debate in general was derailed in respect of the issues that were really at stake. All 27 members of the European Council, apart from Britain, agreed on a number of issues to deal with the question of in-work benefits, which was and is an issue for people in Britain in respect of immigrants. For years and years, Irish people who went to Britain began to work, paid their stamp and got their contribution. It was clocked up for them in Newcastle and when people reached pension age or came back to Ireland before then, they were able to avail of that element of contribution, added to what they had from Ireland, to draw a pension or a proportion of the pension under a bilateral agreement. However, in lower-paid jobs, immigrants were entitled to extra benefits from day one, which was a cause for concern among British people. It was conceded by the European Council that this matter could be tapered over a period of four years. Another question related to child benefit being paid at higher British rates than applied in many of the former eastern bloc countries, where children were not living in Britain but were living in their home country. This issue was also raised in this House on many occasions.</p>
            <p eId="para_283"> On the question of ever-closer union, I agree. I might not agree with everything that Deputy Barry and I have to talk about, but the debate in Britain was derailed. It became very personal, very vindictive and very inter-party. The debate should have focused on issues about the kind of Europe we want, who should constitute that, the potential of a market of 500 million and the potential for political decisions to be followed through to the benefit of the peoples of the 28 countries. I hope when people vote on Thursday that the decision will be to stay. I have seen a strong element of finger-pointing in some social media and in some of the print and spoken media. Until the people actually vote, their decision is not counted. I hope that by 5 a.m. we will have a pretty clear statement as to what they have decided on Thursday, 23 June.</p>

            <p eId="para_285">The British-Irish Council is an integral part of the Good Friday Agreement architecture and it provides an opportunity for the eight administrations that participate to discuss issues of mutual importance and of relevance to the regions and states that make up its membership. I want to come back on the issue that was raised earlier regarding carers. The social inclusion sector of the British-Irish Council had prepared a detailed paper on carers, which was supposed to have been published on the council's website, but it has not appeared on that website so far. Could the Taoiseach either publish it or consider publishing it? It is Carers' Week, which is why the British-Irish Council discussed this matter. From our own experience in this State, the treatment of carers leaves much to be desired. Did the Government make any commitments to improving the situation here at the council meeting? For example, will it provide additional resources to ensure that waiting times for processing applications or appeals will be reduced? I will limit what I am saying just to allow my colleague to get in.</p>

            <p eId="para_286">I appreciate that the establishment in this country is extremely nervous about the prospect of Brexit, as is the core part of the establishment in Britain. That is reflected in the desperation of the Government and its increasing intervention in the referendum. It is the Taoiseach's right to intervene in that debate and I would do likewise if I were in his position. Does the Taoiseach not agree at all that a Brexit vote could open up a significant question about what kind of Europe we have? Does he not agree that it could put into sharp relief the fundamentally undemocratic and antidemocratic nature of the European Union, could provoke a crisis for the Tory Government in Britain and could be an opening to the kind of discussion we need to have about building the kind of Europe that does not just operate for the bankers, the bondholders and big business? That is our concrete experience over the course of the crisis, as opposed to the abstract social Europe which we do not have but which people talk about. Does the Taoiseach not agree these potential outcomes from a Brexit vote would be good from the point of view of ordinary people in this country, in Britain and right across Europe, and would constitute a step towards building a Europe of the millions instead of the millionaires?</p>

            <p eId="para_287">In respect of the discussion that took place at the British-Irish Council, elections had taken place in a number of administrations since the last meeting. Therefore, those who were representing the different areas gave an indication of the priorities of the new administrations and where they saw developments occurring. In our case, we made the point that Government wanted to learn lessons and understands that many people in this country are still very much challenged in terms of the economic situation. We are now trying to use the benefits of a strengthening economy to deal with social injustice, unfairness and disadvantage, as we have talked about in terms of inner cities and the requirement for infrastructure raised by Deputy Howlin in terms of capital investment. These are things that improve the quality of people's lives and make the country a stronger and a better place. At the meeting, I pointed out the priorities as we see them for the time ahead. Then there was a discussion about carers, the need for support and protection of carers and of those for whom they care and the question of mental health and the difficulties that are experienced in many places and across all ages in this respect.</p>
            <p eId="para_288">The meeting took place against the background of a minute's silence in respect of the late Jo Cox, and this tempered it.</p>
            <p eId="para_289"> In answer to Deputy Paul Murphy's question, we will have to wait and see what is the outcome of the Brexit vote. As I said to Deputy Mick Barry, elements of the discussion were directed along the alleyways of vindictiveness and finger pointing and were not really relevant to the question we need to ask about the kind of Europe we need to have. Everything will depend on turnout and on whether people are sufficiently motivated to go and vote. It is important that they know what they are voting for and the consequences of their vote so we will wait and see.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">I welcome this opportunity to address the House in advance of the European Council next week. The outcome of the UK referendum will, of course, determine the focus of the meeting. The current migration situation will also be discussed, as will a range of economic issues. There will also be a discussion on some foreign and security policy issues which the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, will address in his closing remarks.</p>
          <p eId="para_292"> On Thursday, Britain will vote on whether to remain in or to leave the European Union. Next week's meeting will provide a first opportunity for collective discussion of the referendum result and its implications. Clearly the substance and significance of this discussion will depend on which way the vote has gone. This has been a hard fought campaign on both sides. The last few days have been overshadowed by the murder of Jo Cox last week. I was in the UK when this happened and I would like, once again, to extend my sincere condolences to her family, friends and colleagues. She was an exemplary public representative who lost her life doing one of the most important things all of us in this House do, namely, serving our constituencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_293"> From the outset of the EU negotiation process, Ireland committed to playing a supportive and constructive role. In the same spirit, members of the Government have visited Britain to engage with Irish communities there, to encourage them to vote and to explain our perspective on the issues. There have also been several visits to Northern Ireland, for which the stakes are particularly high. I thank all Deputies, including those from the Opposition, who have involved themselves in this effort. It is my hope, of course, that we will continue our EU journey with the United Kingdom, a journey that we began together over 40 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> Whatever the outcome, however, we are ready. In the event of a vote to remain, the next steps are relatively straightforward. The agreement reached in February would take immediate effect and its various elements would be implemented. A framework has been developed on a whole-of-Government basis to identify contingencies that could arise in the event of a vote to leave. This would provide the basis for the intensive work which would be required over a lengthy period across very many sectors. We would work with our EU partners and with the UK to achieve outcomes which protect Irish interests, including co-operation between North and South, as far as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> Were there to be a vote to leave, the European Union and the UK would be entering into a very different area indeed. It would very probably take some time for the path forward to become clear. An orderly and constructive process would be critical but, in all circumstances, Ireland will remain a committed member of the European Union. As a competitive, diversified and global economy, we value our access to a single market of over 500 million people and the benefits our exporters derive from EU trade agreements with other countries. More broadly, we greatly value being part of a Union with other like-minded democracies which share our values and interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_296"> The migrant and refugee situation rightly remains an issue of the highest priority. At next week's meeting there will be another detailed discussion. The EU has developed a range of measures, including resettlement and relocation measures, an EU-Africa fund and an EU-Turkish refugee facility. There has been good progress on the establishment of a European coast and border guard, and a package of other measures agreed with Turkey. Many of these measures are having a positive impact. Reports indicate that the numbers crossing the Aegean Sea, for example, have reduced very substantially since the EU-Turkey deal was agreed in March and this is to be welcomed. However, the route from Libya to Italy remains very perilous. Implementation of some of the measures has, for a variety of reasons, been far too slow. A significant focus of next week's discussion, therefore, will be on implementation and there will be a major focus on the external dimension of the crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_297"> The Commission's proposed migration partnership framework aims at ensuring coherence between EU migration policy and its external and development policies. Overall, we welcome the framework and its focus on working even more closely with countries of origin and transit, as well as countries hosting large numbers of displaced people, and we support its intention to build on existing policies in this area. Ireland continues to make its own contribution.</p>
          <p eId="para_298"> In September 2015, the Government decided to take up to 4,000 persons in need of international protection. There has been good progress on the resettlement of refugees from outside the Union and we are on course to meet our target of 520 by the end of this year. On relocation, progress has been slow, as it has been for all partners, for a variety of reasons outside of our control. Thankfully, implementation here is at last beginning to speed up. Today, I have been advised by officials that the next group of 28 individuals to arrive under this framework is <i>en route</i> from Greece. We wish them well on their journey and look forward to welcoming them to our shores. A further group of 40 individuals is expected to arrive next month.</p>
          <p eId="para_299"> In terms of humanitarian assistance, Ireland has provided over €42 million in response to the Syria crisis since 2011, and has pledged a further €20 million in 2016. Last year, 8,592 men, women and children were rescued thanks to the efforts of our naval vessels in the Mediterranean. The <i>LE Róisín</i> has been on search and rescue missions from 12 May of this year and has rescued 893 people to date. We are very proud of the efforts of her crew and I wish them well for the rest of their mission.</p>
          <p eId="para_300"> The June European Council will address a number of economic issues under the broad heading of jobs, growth and competitiveness. One of these is the European semester and, in particular, the country-specific recommendations issued by the Commission in May. Broadly speaking, Ireland accepts our three recommendations, which cover fiscal policies, jobless households and child care and non-performing loans. We are also broadly supportive of the progress made in streamlining the European semester process.</p>
          <p eId="para_301"> The European Council will also discuss the Single Market. The Commission strategy presented last October was a crucial initiative and was given a strong endorsement by the December European Council. We must renew EU momentum as a crucial driver of jobs, growth and competitiveness. This includes unlocking the full potential of the digital single market, which is the responsibility of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Dara Murphy. We want to press ahead with a high level of ambition, agreeing concrete timelines and delivering results, with the European Council continuing to take an overview of progress. The European Council will also review progress on the European fund for strategic investments. It appears to have had a positive impact but there is a sense that more can be done. All obstacles to productive investment in the economy must be tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_302"> Turning to deepening economic and monetary union, the European Council will look at progress on initial proposals made by the Commission last year, pending the publication of longer-term proposals next year. Our overall position on EMU remains clear. The focus needs to be on full and effective implementation of the wide range of reforms that have already been agreed over recent years. There will be an update on the Union's efforts to combat tax avoidance. Just overnight, Finance Ministers agreed an anti-tax avoidance directive. Ireland has been to the forefront of the implementation of OECD recommendations on base erosion and profit shifting and we have supported the final compromise reached on this directive on the basis that it was consistent with the OECD BEPS report and should respect member state sovereignty on tax issues. Finally, there will be further consideration of the difficult situation in the dairy and pigmeat sectors and Ireland will support efforts by the Commission to alleviate the serious problems faced by many farmers.</p>
          <p eId="para_303"> The June European Council will, therefore, address a number of issues of great importance. Let us hope it will not have to spend too much time on the outcome of the UK referendum. I will of course make a statement to the House following the meeting. I look forward to hearing from Deputies and I will keep leaders updated as we go through Thursday and early Friday morning if there is anything about which they should know.</p>

          <from>Deputy Micheál Martin<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_304">It is important to express our solidarity with the family, community and political colleagues of Jo Cox. The murder of a public representative is a truly shocking event, particularly in a democracy, and many people were genuinely saddened and shocked by the event. The British Labour Party has lost a rising star who was passionate about politics and about issues outside purely party politics throughout her short life. She was a committed supporter of the European Union and an internationalist who had a deep commitment to people all over the world, particularly refugees from Syria and the Middle East.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">While the person who murdered her appears to have been acting alone, the need for us to stand up and defend the principles for which she stood is just as strong. We must also remember that there is always a potential cost when one attacks and stigmatises public representatives as a group. The heightened and extreme rhetoric that often accompanies advocacy in a serious referendum can also create an atmosphere in which people on the margins become more extreme.</p>
          <p eId="para_306"> The vote this week is one of the most important referendums ever held, yet it is one in which we will have no voice. It has the potential to ensure that European democracies move forward in constructive co-operation or it could set off a vicious circle of damaging competition and empower extreme nationalism. It really is as important as that. As a mark of respect for the late Jo Cox and the decision of the two sides to suspend campaigning, I cancelled a speech and door-to-door canvass scheduled last week in Belfast. I would like to reiterate points that I intended making then and that I have made in a series of speeches and statements in recent years. In addition, my party made it clear in its election manifesto that Ireland has a direct interest in the outcome of this referendum. We must be clear on how we see the vote and on how we will react to the outcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> The stakes for progress on this island and between these islands are huge. In the final days, everyone who has a vote should take the time to look at the fundamental issues involved and where the weight of evidence is. Quite incredibly, one of the main leaders of the "Leave" campaign has said that experts should be ignored. Michael Gove, Lord Chancellor and a long-acclaimed Tory intellectual, stated that the British people "have had enough of experts." Yes, each person has to make up his or her own mind, but to say that evidence and expertise are irrelevant is breathtakingly cynical. The simple fact is that a vote to leave the European Union would be bad for this island, bad for the United Kingdom, bad for the democratic countries of Europe and, as all international bodies have said, bad for the wider world. There is no upside to a "Leave" vote other than for the Little Englanders who think they can rescind the past 44 years and return to some illusory past idyll.</p>
          <p eId="para_308"> For all of its many flaws, the European Union has enabled a model of progress among nations that is unprecedented in world history. People can take this for granted if they like, but no one has produced any credible alternative way in which the immense violence and destruction of the world wars could have been overcome. The leaders of the last century who committed us to working together with mutually agreed rules and enforcement knew what they were doing. They saw how everybody standing alone would always end badly. This was not just about leaders on the continent. Look at the words of British and Irish leaders. Look at the words of Seán Lemass, who fought in the GPO in 1916, on how nations on the periphery could only promote their interests and generate prosperity through participation in a rules-based and strong European organisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_309"> One of the things most often missed about why the European Union exists is that it is a construction of a deeply patriotic generation. It was people who had fought and risked everything for the flags of their countries that created and built the European Union. The only people in our countries who opposed membership were those committed to an extreme ideological position. The phenomenon of countries jealously protecting every element of sovereignty, sharing nothing and rejecting international legal commitments is the very thing that caused the catastrophic conflicts of the 20th century. The patriotic generation knew this and set out a different course, and they were vindicated in every way.</p>
          <p eId="para_310"> This referendum is the logical outcome of 40 years of anti-European rhetoric from one group. They have been relentless in attacking the union and claiming that it is responsible for every evil in the world. They have caricatured and hyped every proposal. They have used vivid language and worked tirelessly to set up the fundamentally false idea that one can be patriotic or one can be European but one cannot be both. However, what they seem incapable of is addressing how 40 years of scare stories and predictions of the end of the nation state have been false. Go into any supermarket in Belfast, Brighton or Brussels and one will find that the bananas still have a bend in them and one is still free to choose the basic direction of one's country. The "Project Fear" being run by the "Leave" campaign and certain proprietors of London newspapers has involved talking about a tidal wave of foreigners about to land and fictional piles of money waiting to be repatriated and describing the EU as implementing Hitler’s vision. Without doubt, it is the most cynical and deceptive campaign of our times. Of course, they scream every time the economic damage of a "Leave" vote is pointed out.</p>
          <p eId="para_311"> I hope people will take the time to look at the positive case for a "Remain" vote in the next few days, because it is overwhelming. In terms of economics, the simple and undeniable fact is that to have high employment and living standards we have to trade. This is especially true for everyone living on an island on the edge of a continent. We need guaranteed and fair access to trade. This requires common rules so that companies cannot be artificially excluded and it requires a legal process where their rights can be enforced. Outside the European Union, this right to trade is much weaker and enforcement almost non-existent.</p>
          <p eId="para_312"> The investment case for being in the European Union is equally strong. Every major international company has developed a base within the European Union. European Union membership is an absolute requirement for many major job creation decisions. So far not a single major investor has said it would increase investment if the vote is to leave, while many have said the exact opposite.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> The case for workers’ rights is unanswerable as well. Many of the rules which most annoy the "Leave" campaigners involve basic protections for workers. They prevent a race to the bottom and insist that core standards are protected for all. Nearly all modern protections for women in the workplace have their origins in European legislation. Europe is about trying to create high-wage jobs with decent standards. Being outside the EU pushes the pressure the other way.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> In respect of the economy of this island, there is no possible positive result for a "Leave" vote. It offers at the very least enormous risk and most likely a direct, severe and permanent setback. Trade across the Border and outside the island will suffer. Jobs will suffer and pressures on wages will all be downwards. A tough period fiscally could well become an emergency if the predicted impacts on the Westminster budget happen. One is free to say this does not matter, but one is not free to say it cannot happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> Whatever happens, we must be clear that Ireland will under no circumstance follow a "Leave" vote. The European Union is now and will continue to be a fundamental part of our identity and policies. We believe the two jurisdictions on this island are stronger working together in the European Union, but we will not sign up to the economically, socially and politically destructive anti-European Union agenda of the English anti-Europeans.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> We should note the strong leadership of the Scottish First Minister, Nicola Sturgeon, in the "Remain" campaign and the broad and diverse coalition of groups and parties campaigning on this side. It is also welcome that Sinn Féin has reversed its policy of opposing the EU in every vote taken in the past 44 years and that it has joined the SDLP, the Alliance Party and others in Northern Ireland on the "Remain" side. As for the political case for membership, if one wants to have any influence whatsoever, there is no alternative to working closely with others. Standing alone in glorious isolation, hoping to occasionally be allowed into a room where fundamental issues are discussed is a sure-fire way of being marginalised as a country.</p>
          <p eId="para_317"> Ultimately, the "Leave" case demands that one sees the European Union as a threat to one's identity. Whatever one's personal identity is, they claim that the EU is a threat to it. As I have stated, the EU is actually the direct project of a patriotic generation which wanted to secure the future for their countries and identities and end the threat of extreme nationalism. On an even more basic level, the fact is that no one else and no institution decides one's identity. One decides it one's self, in one's family, community and wider society. The issue is how we find ways of respecting each other's identities - that is, how we end the cycle of seeking supremacy over the identity of others.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> A rules-based organisation, founded on co-operation and mutual respect, is the only way of achieving this in the modern world. Each country retains the fundamental ability to decide on its own successes and failures. We still make mistakes at national level and we can also spark great progress. Our future remains in our own hands. The EU is about opening up new possibilities to us.</p>

          <p eId="para_321"> A vote for "Remain" is a vote for a positive vision of the future. A vote for "Leave" is at best a dramatic risk and more likely a return to a time defined by destructive competition between nations. Such a vote would be cheered by the extreme right and extreme left as well as authoritarian countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_322"> Whatever happens, we should agree that next Tuesday we will have a proper discussion about the next steps and that the Government should present its proposals to the House. At the summit the Taoiseach should be absolutely clear not just that Ireland will remain a member of the Union but also that we are committed to an ongoing programme of constructive reform. This is, now more than ever, essential. We will have to collectively address the growing anti-EU sentiment across Union member from Western Europe in particular. Planning a pathway of real reform measures would address people's concerns.</p>

          <p eId="para_337">Yes. On Thursday, a crucial vote will take place on whether the North and Britain will remain in or leave the European Union. A vote to leave, a so-called Brexit, would have big implications for the island of Ireland and for our two economies. It would lead to the reintroduction of some form of border and customs controls. Partition creates enough problems already without the need for the reintroduction of checkpoints and what some people have called a hard border.</p>
          <p eId="para_338"> In my constituency of Louth, partition creates serious difficulties for business development, investment, farmers, cross-Border shoppers and for communities who live on either side of the Border. The Brexit debate has focused attention on these issues and I call on the Government and the other parties to keep that focus beyond the Brexit vote. It is no coincidence that the Border region suffers most from disadvantage, high levels of unemployment and low investment and much more could be done to reverse this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_339"> We know that more than €1.2 billion is traded each week in goods and services between this island and Britain. Much of that is agricultural produce and there is great potential in this sector. However, farmers are currently facing huge difficulties. Many farmers will find their livelihoods at risk if Brexit is the outcome of the debate and this referendum. It would also mean an end to vital rural development funding, structural funds and PEACE II funding. All of these funds are vital for small and medium sized businesses, community regeneration schemes and community groups. I was at a conference on the Border recently organised by Sinn Féin and attended by people from south Armagh, south Down and north Louth where many of these issues were debated thoroughly.</p>
          <p eId="para_340"> I have already made the point that Sinn Féin wants to see a Brexit from Ireland. However, in the meantime we also want to see an all-Ireland approach to the European Union and, unlike Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, we remain very critical of many aspects of the EU and in particular the profound lack of democracy at its core. We want to see a social Europe, a Europe of equals, in which citizens, assemblies and parliaments have a greater say in formulating policy. It is possible. We want to see a European Union where the rights of citizens and member states are respected on the basis of equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_341"> The Council meeting next week will also provide political leaders with the opportunity to consider the outcome of the referendum, whatever it may be, and to determine how the EU should respond. I look forward to a debate in this House next week also.</p>
          <p eId="para_342"> Yesterday was World Refugee Day and the United Nations has released data which shows the number of people displaced by conflict is at the highest level since records began. The UN records estimate that 65.3 million people are either refugees, asylum seekers or internally displaced at the end of 2015. Despite the Government’s pledge in September 2015 to take in 4,000 refugees, so far I understand only one Syrian family has been resettled in the State under the EU’s relocation programme. If this is true then it is unacceptable. In the face of such an unparalleled humanitarian crisis the Government needs to be doing more to ensure refugees have safe and legal routes to relocate in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_343"> I join with the Taoiseach in commending the crew of the<i> LE Róisín</i> for their valiant work in rescuing people who are in danger on the Mediterranean Sea. However, despite the efforts of these crews, according to the UN over 10,000 people have drowned in the Mediterranean Sea since 2014. Consider the figure of 10,000 people which is the size of a town and these include children and women. Some 2,814 people have drowned this year. That is the size of the crisis. When I hear people talking about the virtues of the EU and I see it against the backdrop of this situation it is very heart wrenching especially when we think of what our own Nation went through with regard to coffin ships and all that went with that. I note that Doctors Without Borders has announced it will no longer accept funds from the EU in protest at the EU's shameful policies on the refugee crisis, particularly the deal with Turkey.</p>
          <p eId="para_344"> I conclude by calling on the Taoiseach to raise once again the issue of Ibrahim Halawa. He is the only EU citizen who is currently facing a trial such as that facing him in Egypt. I wrote to the Taoiseach a few weeks ago on this issue. Ibrahim should be at home with his family and friends. Perhaps the Taoiseach could confirm that he will raise Ibrahim's case at the European Council meeting?</p>

        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_175">
          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_345">Taoiseach, the European Commission is expected to put forward a proposal in early July declaring the EU-Canada Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA as an EU-only deal. This means that the agreement, which will have serious ramifications for every EU member state, will only need to be passed by a qualified majority in the European Council and a simple majority in the European Parliament to be ratified. This approach is an attack on democracy and undermines the sovereignty of member states. It is an attempt to erode environmental, agricultural and labour standards in the EU without its citizens having any real say on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_346"> The legal advice commissioned by Sinn Féin states that any implementation of CETA, which includes an investor state court, will necessitate the holding of a referendum. Has the Taoiseach discussed this with the Attorney General and when does the Taoiseach envisage that this referendum will be held? Perhaps the Taoiseach could clarify if Ireland will argue that CETA will be an agreement of mixed competence. This would mean it will have to be ratified by national parliaments and in some countries by local parliaments. The European Court of Justice has yet to give its legal opinion on the nature of a free trade agreement with Singapore, which will not be expected before 2017. Surely it makes even more sense for the European Commission to make its decision on what type of agreement is being sought by CETA, which potentially is a groundbreaking agreement, after the court's judgment. I ask that the Taoiseach follows through on this logic, acts on behalf of the Irish people at the European Council meeting and demands that CETA is not, as expected, provisionally applied. This would be a logical position.</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> I will now turn to Apple. We have been told that the Apple tax case is due in early July. If the case goes the same way as recent cases involving Luxembourg, for example, then the State could be in line for a financial windfall. Tax would be due that should have been paid to the Irish Exchequer. Am I correct in saying that this Government, like the last one, insists that it will appeal any decision that finds that State aid was granted illegally? This is a bizarre approach and anybody who is listening at home might feel the same way given that the State could expect a financial return as high as €16 billion. Last week we had the farce of this Parliament, at the Government’s behest, objecting to EU moves to create greater tax transparency and now we have the Government saying that Apple’s legitimate tax should not be repaid to the Irish people if the European Commission finds for that. If the Commission says that Ireland is due tax back then we should take it. That would be the view shared by most people, particularly those who have been left with the financial burden of the bailout of banks, investors and speculators. That approach would also be supported by most taxpayers. Any other response is simply unacceptable especially when the State is seeing a lack of investment as was discussed in the House this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">If we want to reinvest we could consider other areas which have been favourable to Apple and its staff, such as water, health services, broadband, housing and transport. There are many ways we can put this money back into the Irish economy, supporting many of these multinationals operating in Ireland whose staff are located here.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> The European Council will discuss EU-NATO co-operation ahead of the NATO summit in Warsaw on 8 and 9 July 2016. This is against a backdrop of NATO’s war games in Eastern Europe, which are at their most intense since the end of the Cold War. The further militarisation of the EU and its gradual integration into NATO are ongoing, but many of us on the left would say NATO is a Cold War relic that needs to be decommissioned, instead of aggressively growing and encouraging more spending on weapons. We need to examine this area of greater integration between the EU and NATO. NATO needs to be stood down, decommissioned and consigned to the dustbin of history.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_176">
          <from>Deputy Joan Burton<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_350">I am conscious that this debate is taking place in the shadow of the murder of Jo Cox, MP, last week, as she was one of those who had argued for a vote for Britain to remain in the EU in this week's referendum.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> The European Union was founded in the aftermath of two dreadful world wars and a period of fascism which saw many millions of people killed. The aim was to bring Europeans together to provide not just common markets but also a framework for prosperity and growth that would enable ordinary people in all European countries to live well and be employed and allow their children to get a decent education and progress. Countries would focus on having good primary social services, whether in health or education, alongside economies that would thrive and include public and private sectors. </p>
          <p eId="para_352"> What we have seen, and what faces the Taoiseach and his fellow members of the European People's Party, is a slow but steady drift of that broad European ideal to the right in several European countries in very difficult economic circumstances, the most scandalous and difficult of which is the widespread unemployment of young people. Many of those countries are prosperous enough on paper and some, like ours, are either in recovery or still in the depths of economic crashes and difficulties. It is understandable that people in many European countries feel that things they or their parents took for granted - constant and continuous incremental improvements in their lifestyle - are put under threat by changes that appear to come from a very remote location, Brussels, and from a leadership that is quite remote from most people, including those in their home countries. It is difficult to convey to anyone who goes to Europe as a Commissioner, as many from here have, that it does not reach citizens and there is a need for a profound change of style in respect of the European leadership. We have had so many and such frequent referendums in this country on major European changes that we are politically used to having to make the case, explain the advantages and likely disadvantages and help people weigh in the balance how they wish to cast their vote. I hope a majority of citizens in the UK, including people of Irish extraction who may be voting this week, will vote to stay. For many, given the difficulties they have experienced, it is a difficult choice and they feel threatened.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> What is the Irish Government’s plan B if the vote does not go as the majority of parties here have urged? It will certainly cause a degree of shock and give rise to change. While I know the Government has been active and I asked the Taoiseach some time ago to have debates here on Brexit, I wonder whether there is a plan B.</p>
          <p eId="para_354"> I mention the murder of Jo Cox because there has been a development in politics of a language of hate as opposed to a language of argument. Everyone understands that politics involves argument, discussion, making choices and reaching decisions in everybody’s best interests. On the extreme right, however, no more than on the extreme left, there is a language of hate which is corroding most of our democracies and inhibiting good discussion that would help us reach better decisions. I have spoken about the spaces on social media which have sought, for instance, to demonise women, in particular, from a wide range of parties who are involved in politics. I know from extensive studies carried out by <i>The Guardian</i> under the campaign entitled The Web We Want that approximately 80% of hate posts are directed against female parliamentarians and approximately 20% against male parliamentarians. If there is an opportunity to discuss this at Council level, it is important that we, as people involved in politics, think about how we might press the pause button on hate speech and vilification, which many - including, unfortunately, some in Ireland and indeed some who have been in the Dáil - resort to, rather than reasoned argument, explanation or persuasion. Argument can be very robust, but when we look back at the 1930s in Europe and the writers of that period and consider what gave rise to fascism, we see that much of what was said was to do with allowing a tone of hatred and vilification come to dominate public discourse. In that case, all of the ills of the world, particularly in Germany, were identified as originating with people who were Jewish and the campaign of vilification and hatred at that time was towards Jewish people. What will happen in respect of Europe this week is very important. Whatever happens, whether it is a narrow win or a loss, the European Union will be changed forever.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">Given that we are, in many ways, Britain's closest neighbour and have extremely close family ties, I would like to suggest to the Taoiseach that perhaps he should use the result, whatever it is, as an opportunity to have a discussion about where Europe is at now. He should focus in particular on whether Europe is an entity that represents the aspirations of ordinary citizens or has been captured by people who are simply interested in business.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> Business has its place and is very important. Foreign direct investment has been the keystone of the recovery of the Irish economy. In fact, what distinguished Ireland from other economies during our recent difficulties was the fact that we continued to have a very active foreign direct investment programme into Ireland. In many ways, it kept the Irish economy going, helped to improve it and enabled it to recover during the most difficult period. </p>
          <p eId="para_357"> There needs to be a discussion because if the European Union put forward further referendum proposals to this country, based on some of the ideals that have been put forward over the past few years in terms of ever-closer union, I am genuinely not sure that people in Ireland would accept any of that. Those of us who support the European Union, in particular women, are conscious of the fact that in a conservative society, as Ireland was in the 1970s, the ideas of the European Union, such as those relating to the equality and rights of women and workers, were an absolute breath of fresh air and were not deliverable at that time in an Irish context. The European Council should pause for reflection.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> Europe has the resources to address the refugee crisis. In the middle of the crisis, Angela Merkel chose to invite people to Germany and said in a very trenchant way that Germany could deal with the people coming in. It is always difficult for people anywhere to have new people integrate among them but Angela Merkel is very clear-headed about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> There have been scenes on the borders of Europe which are not acceptable. We have not seen such scenes since the height of the Second World War. We need to ensure that we play our part. When in government, I made a commitment that we would accept up to 4,500 asylum seekers and refugees and I regret to say that still has not been implemented. I would like the Taoiseach to tell us when he envisages that we will take our responsibilities in that respect seriously.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulMurphy" eId="spk_177">
          <from>Deputy Paul Murphy<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_360">I will speak for five minutes, during which time 125 people will be forcibly displaced from their homes, according to the UN report published yesterday, as a result of persecution, conflict, generalised violence and human rights violations. They will form part of the 65.3 million people who have been forcibly displaced worldwide, a 50% increase over the space of only five years. So many people have been displaced that if they made up a nation, it would be the 21st largest nation on earth. They have been forcibly displaced as a result of crises which largely have their roots in a system of capitalism and imperialism.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> Forced migration is now a dominant feature of the world, driven by war. We know 85% of migrants who come to Greece come from countries that have seen western military intervention. The crisis is increasingly driven by climate change. James Hansen, perhaps the most respected climate scientist in the world, according to Naomi Klein, said that at our current emissions trajectory, we face the loss of all coastal cities, most of the world's large cities and all of their history, not in thousands of years' time, but as soon as the end of the century. Naomi Klein said if we do not demand radical change, we are headed for a whole world of people searching for homes that no longer exist.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> What is the response of the European Union to this crisis? In this treaty, it says it is founded on the rule of law, respect for human rights and democracy. The response is utterly disgusting. Donald Tusk - not Donald Trump - told all potential illegal economic migrants, wherever they are from, not to come to Europe. That is the message from the head of the European Union Council. Even the UN was forced to criticise that, and said to call people illegal migrants is a shortcut by European leaders and that people are coming to Europe because of ongoing wars.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> The deal that has been concluded with Turkey is absolutely disgusting. It is the implementation of Donald Trump's policy in Europe and, in effect, turns Turkey into a massive prison camp with walls. Money from the European Union has been given to a major human rights abuser in order to keep migrants out of Europe. So bad is the situation that it has been condemned by the United Nations, Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The decision taken by Médicine Sans Frontières to no longer accept desperately needed funds from the European Union because of these policies shows how bad the situation is. Its international secretary general said the EU-Turkey deal goes one step further and has placed the very concept of refugee and the protection it offers in danger. </p>
          <p eId="para_364"> What is European Union doing? It is making the Turkish model the generalised model. This is about the externalisation of European borders. The deal it did with Turkey it will now do with 17 other countries and this will be discussed at the European Council. In a communication on the partnership framework with third countries under the European agenda on migration, the Commission states that increasing coherence between migration and development policy is important to ensure that development assistance helps partner countries to manage migration more effectively and incentivises them to effectively co-operate on the readmission of irregular migrants. It goes on to say that the same should be true of trade policies, notably where the EU gives preferential treatment to its partners, and that migration co-operation should be a consideration in the forthcoming evaluation of trade preferences under GSB-Plus.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> Like the old deal with Gaddafi in Libya, the EU will pay 17 countries, many of which have human rights abuses, to deal with the migration crisis. That pushes the problem further and further away. The reality is that one cannot stop migration in a world of deep poverty, inequality, climate change and war. If one tries to stop it, in reality all one will do is kill people. Charles Heller was right about the withdrawal of Operation Trident, which was replaced with Operation Mare Nostrum, when he said that European policymakers have made themselves guilty of killing by omission. It is even more generalised than that. That is the end result of the policy, of which the blocking of aid to Calais is a microcosm.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> If we want a decent world where people are not forced to flee their homes, we have to stop the European Union policies and that of the dominant 1% right around the world. We need to tackle the problems of climate change and end war and co-operation with NATO, which is strongly pointed at in the draft conclusions, and I am interested in hearing the comments of the Taoiseach on that. We need to use the world's resources in the interests of the mass of people to raise living standards and ensure everybody has a decent standard of living.</p>

          <p eId="para_367">In the song "Imagine", John Lennon asked us to imagine if there were no countries and a brotherhood of man. That is the view held by socialists. We do not believe in national borders or frontiers. We believe there is one race, the human race. Frankly, I find it frustrating, to put it mildly, that a previous speaker suggested that those of us who are critical of the European Union and believe that we should exit it can somehow be associated with the vile xenophobia, racism and extreme forms of nationalism promoted by the fascist far right in Europe or the vile group UKIP, which happens to lead the campaign against the European Union and for exit, but on grounds with which we would have nothing to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">We have nothing but contempt for UKIP and the far right. It is most disingenuous for some to suggest that in supporting the existing European Union and arguing for staying in it somehow what we are doing is protecting some beacon of civilised values and tolerance, decency and anti-racism when the opposite is the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> The European Union, as Deputy Paul Murphy has alluded to, is guilty of vile policies of racism against some of the most desperate people fleeing from countries outside Europe from war, poverty and famine and has developed an enormous machine to keep people out, to deny the brotherhood of man, to say Europe is only free if a person is white and European but if that person is not, we do not want him or her. The European Union has developed a significant machine and architecture to keep people from Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere out. Between 2002 and 2013, a total of 39 research and development programmes aimed at policing borders have been implemented by the EU and its affiliate, the European Space Agency, at a cost of €250 million. The projects have been for the development of fingerprint scanners, migrant detection drones, vehicles, satellite surveillance and overground and underwater border patrols, all designed to keep people out. FRONTEX, the EU-wide project for establishing the external borders of the European Union, has spent €1 billion, four times the other amount to which I referred, keeping immigrants out, supported by all the European Governments and European policy. That figure is further dwarfed by the amount individual states have spent policing their own borders as part of fortress Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_370"> It is Europe itself that has given credence and opened up the ground for the far right by treating migrants, immigrants and refugees as if they are a problem, encouraging and giving solace to the more dangerous forces of the far right who then take it one step further. The EU-Turkey agreement is the absolute embodiment of that. It is a sickening agreement whereby we essentially outsource the border control of Europe to a nasty regime that is guilty of systematic, ongoing human rights abuses against its own population. Since we signed the agreement whereby we expel immigrants from Syria and elsewhere back to Turkey, Turkey has started shooting those very people. How could we be in any way surprised that it would do so? We must end the hypocrisy and the tyranny of fortress Europe and give real meaning to words such as “tolerance” and “internationalism” to which many look to the European Union to uphold but which the European Union has not matched with deeds but with the vile policies of fortress Europe.</p>

          <p eId="para_373">Yesterday was World Refugee Day and we know from the UNHCR that some 60 million people have been displaced, with thousands of people fleeing their homes every day. I was struck by a quote from it yesterday which said, “The world commemorates the strength, courage and resilience of millions of refugees”. They are very fine words but the reality is suffering, hardship and terrible human rights abuses of those refugees. The attitude of Europe also leaves a lot to be desired because Europe is pushing people and their suffering away from Europe. In so many cases, it is the imperialistic policies of European countries that are the contributing factors to what is causing people to leave their homes in many countries. It is also the inactivity of Europe, the UN and the role of certain other countries with vested interests that allows the Syrian situation to fester with such appalling results and with no end in sight.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> The EU-Turkey deal on migration is appalling. What it means is thousands of refugees, especially unaccompanied minors, living in unacceptable humanitarian conditions, so much so that the reputable organisation, Médecins sans Frontières, which has suffered so much itself, for example, when 22 of its personnel were killed in air strikes on its trauma centre in northern Afghanistan, that it refuses to take EU funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> Let us look at migration in a pragmatic way and examine whether, if the issues causing people to flee were addressed, people would want to stay in their country of origin. We know that what causes people to leave is conflict, human rights abuses and food insecurity - often caused by famine due to climate change. Food insecurity can also result from trade agreements, which brings me to the economic partnership agreements, EPAs, on which we got a full 20 minute debate in this House. I had an opportunity to speak at the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, group of states joint parliamentary assembly with the EU some weeks ago where I met a number of African parliamentarians. I was struck by two issues, first, the complete lack of knowledge of EPAs on the part of some parliamentarians. They never heard of them yet they are sitting in parliaments that are going to ratify the agreements. That is undermining European credibility that they expect that to happen. Second, I met other parliamentarians who were very knowledgeable about EPAs and see positive aspects to them but they are also concerned that they will undermine sustainable livelihoods, increase food insecurity and the country’s ability to feed itself and then instead of lifting people out of poverty it will plunge them further into poverty, increased dependency on aid and increase migration.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> By being more proactive about food security and ensuring that economic partnership agreements have the interests of developing countries at heart, and not just the driver being European economic growth, we can ensure better sustainable livelihoods for people living in developing countries. If Europe is more proactive on human rights as well, that would play a significant part in people wanting to stay in their own countries. It would also ensure a massive impetus in terms of youth employability which is causing many problems in developing countries. People can have good lives in their own countries. The European Commission must listen to the concerns on EPAs by national parliaments which have to ratify them. I hope the parliaments that do not ratify the EPAs do not face possible fines. European credibility is at stake and the European Council must rethink those matters. I am struck by what President Higgins said yesterday about the European Union. He said it must again come to represent a model of balance between market, society and the environment.</p>

          <p eId="para_377">Attempts to use the horrific murder of Jo Cox to drum up support against Brexit, as the leader of the Labour Party attempted to do, is reprehensible. She seemed to be an incredibly decent human being whose values will be well remembered given her role in dealing with refugees. Against that backdrop and in extending sympathy to her family and friends, we must mark the fact that the number of displaced persons on a global scale has reached 65 million. That is an indictment of Western society in particular and of the European Union which has stood four-square behind US imperialism in intervening in the Middle East in particular. I find it somewhat ironic that people are organising protests against the visit of Donald Trump, reprehensible and all as he is, but nonetheless he is an individual who has never been elected to office in the United States or here yet they allow the visit of Joe Biden, the associate of a war criminal, to come into this country without batting an eyelid.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> Could the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, clarify what we are saying when we go into EU meetings about refugees? Points have been made about the deplorable agreement with Turkey and the scandalous role of that country in terms of human rights, such as building a wall along its southern borders, which makes it increasingly difficult for Syrians to seek safety. We hear from Turkish diplomats that it is to stop extremists getting into Turkey but that does not tally with the brutal assassination and shooting dead of eight Syrians on the Turkish border, three children, four women and one man, last weekend.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">It is known that when Syrians enter Turkey, the reality there is incredibly bleak. While we are told they can get permits now and can get work, everyone is aware that the reality is otherwise. It is that Syrians, many of whom are highly qualified and some of whom are children, are working for a pittance on the black market. A total of 2.6 million registered Syrian refugees live in Turkey, more than half of whom are children. According to UNICEF, more than 80% of those children are not in education, and some of them are working in sweatshops, farms and so on for slave wages. This is the type of fortress Europe that is being built, and the EU-Turkey deal is absolutely draconian and incredibly regressive. The Council of Europe even went so far as to state it "at best strains and at worst exceeds the limits of what is permissible under European and international law". In a further regressive move on Friday, the Greek Government sidelined members of an independent authority that had blocked the deportation of Syrian refugees. The appeals committee had argued that Turkey does not uphold refugee law and therefore is not a safe country to which to return refugees, and I agree with that statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> The EU-Turkey deal and the connected asylum proposals are part of a despicable and systemic attempt to push people and their suffering back off Europe's doorstep. Only two weeks ago, <i>The Guardian</i> published the official European Union documents outlining what is a new migration strategy. To stop refugees from reaching southern Europe from Africa, European leaders actually are proposing to partner with Sudan, the president of which is wanted for war crimes, and with Eritrea, the government of which is accused of crimes against humanity by the United Nations. Is this the type of Europe with which the Government wants Ireland to be associated? This is a replacement for Gaddafi's camps, which used to operate for the European Union. On top of this, I refer to the EU's May proposals to deal with the perceived refugee crisis, which actually is a European crisis for refugees. This is about clamping down on the free movement of people, no matter what the affront to international and human rights laws. Some of the most repressive proposals centre on amendments to the Dublin regulation. To give effect to new proposals, EU members will be obliged to exhaust all avenues to kick asylum applications back to the so-called safe third countries, which they are not, or the first countries of asylum. Does the Minister of State seriously suggest that Sudan and Eritrea will suddenly be designated as safe countries despite clear evidence to the contrary? It absolutely is against all best international human rights law, and, as other Deputies have stated accurately, we are outsourcing our migration control and setting a really poor example. This is causing untold misery to refugees and does not stop them from leaving their countries of origin. As Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan noted, the only way to stop refugees is to stop interfering in their countries. The first thing one can do is to end war and militarism, because nobody wants to move and leave his or her home.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> All Europe is doing is enriching smugglers. One need only read the report published in <i>The Guardian </i>at the weekend about the trafficking of young children in Calais and Dunkirk. There have been appalling violations. What is the Minister of State doing to further the proposition that Ireland could use a process of humanitarian visas? It is a system that already exists and that could be put in place for unaccompanied minors, many of whom are almost on our shores in Calais and Dunkirk. They have been through extreme trauma and are entitled to a safe passage and safe haven. Why is Ireland not leading the charge in this regard? Professor Catheryn Costello hit the nail on the head when she stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_382">By ignoring the predictable need for refuge, Europe creates a humanitarian crisis at its external borders, and a political one as arrivals continue to be chaotic and unmanaged. ... The alternative is to make humanitarian visas accessible, provide people with ... asylum and [so on].</p>
          <p eId="para_383">Is the Minister of State going out and sending his officials to invite people to seek safe haven in Ireland? That is a policy with which Irish citizens would agree.</p>

          <p eId="para_387">Friends who have visited refugee centres in Greece tell me they are not organised and are chaotic. Consequently, I was glad to note in the Taoiseach's comments here that the number of people coming to Ireland under that process is starting to increase. I would appreciate it were the Government to arrange for the relevant officials to brief my party in more detail as to how exactly this will work, obviously outside the confines of the Chamber. I would appreciate acquiring a real and deep understanding of the process and would greatly appreciate it were the Minister of State to ensure this took place.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> Obviously, the Council meeting will be dominated by the outcome of the Brexit referendum to be held in the United Kingdom next Thursday. If I may, I will start thinking of what the debate might be about or what might be the approach at the Council should the United Kingdom vote to remain in the EU. In preparing for this, I encourage the Taoiseach to consider some of the forthcoming items on the Council's agenda and to give thought to how he might use this as an opportunity for enhanced co-operation and for bringing some of those benefits that all Members present have sought from the Union but that are not always delivered. I understand from listening to the UK Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, over the years that he has a particular concern regarding the development of an integrated digital market and an integrated energy market in Europe. These are often what he talks about as the benefits he wishes to take advantage of. On both, I believe there are possible gains for Ireland in taking that agenda and running with it, supporting it or seeking to ensure it serves our needs. As the Minister of State is aware, Ireland has a huge high-tech digital services industry. He also is aware that to get that right, Ireland must be the very best in respect of the protection of citizens' rights, with an ethical digital regulatory system regarding data privacy issues, free access to information and an innovative culture which, in our case, is not simply serving the interests of large corporations or the State. I believe we will work best and be most successful when we have a citizen-centred digital environment augmented by European rules that support it. If there is agreement on Brexit whereby the UK decides to remain - God help us if there is not and it decides to leave, which is a very different scenario - I argue the Taoiseach should seek to take the opportunity to consider that item on the agenda on opening up the full potential of the digital single market and making sure it is fashioned in a way that suits our purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> Similarly, I refer to the investment plan and the European Fund for Strategic Investments. I must declare a certain interest in this because, for the past five years, before returning to this Chamber, I have been working on issues such as the development of the North Sea's offshore grid, which was the area with the largest allocation of funding for Irish projects within the European Fund for Strategic Investments. It is clear that many of the investments for which we had been approved will now not happen because, in a sense, we have stalled in the development of our own clean energy programme. Consequently, I believe there also is an opportunity in this area, should there be an agreement for the UK to stay, to work much more proactively with the UK in the development of a regional electricity market and common infrastructure. In many ways, such development is connected to the digital single market issue because, if we develop such a co-ordinated energy market, there will be significant opportunities in digital services for energy efficiency and so on. This is a second area in which I believe the Taoiseach, if he is proactive, could work with the Prime Minister of the UK to develop our European Union regional market in electricity, which also would benefit us in allowing us to tap into the strategic investment funds that are available. More widely, I believe the Taoiseach should use the opportunity to seek much greater flexibility in the strategic investment area - for example, in the debate in the House last week on housing plans - as to how we would get Europe to agree to some of the investments that must be made. I believe it should be possible for us to radically increase the capital funding for social housing using a cost rental model, which would have a fundable stream. The Taoiseach should use this opportunity at the European Council, hopefully in a positive environment, to steer the European Fund for Strategic Investments in our direction. I commend him to use that opportunity.</p>

        <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_187">
          <from>Deputy Catherine Murphy<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_390">It is fairly difficult to predict the agenda of the Council meeting because the Brexit referendum either will dominate or will not.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">The concern is that it will dominate the agenda and overshadow some of the other issues which are of critical importance, none less so than the refugee crisis. The handling of the crisis by Europe should be at the core of what is discussed along with changing the direction of how it has been handled. The EU has faced two major challenges in recent years: the financial crash and now the refugee crisis. One cannot but look and say it has failed miserably on both fronts. It has failed because one of the founding principles of the EU, as opposed to the EEC, was solidarity, yet one is not seeing that in evidence, certainly in the case of the refugee crisis. Neither was it seen in the response to the financial crash, which was very much about the intergovernmental approach, the strong and the idea of a collection of nation states, which was not what was intended. The EU will fail if it proceeds in that fashion.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> It is essential that the EU is democratic and that solidarity is at its heart. I quote Mr. Jürgen Habermas, whom our President quoted in a speech he gave a few years ago to the European Parliament. He was speaking prior to the refugee crisis. </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_393">If one wants to preserve the monetary union, it is no longer enough, given the structural imbalances between the national economies, to provide loans to over-indebted states so that each should improve its competitiveness by its own efforts. What is required is solidarity instead, a co-operative effort from a shared political perspective to promote growth and competitiveness in the eurozone as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">We did not see that, but it is still possible to see it. There is a willingness from those in power to distance themselves from the humanitarian crisis by referring to it more as a "migrant crisis". It is interesting that al-Jazeera, for example, has refused to use the term, preferring to use "refugee crisis". That is what it is: a refugee crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_395"> There must be a complete shift. Even our own very limited offering of assistance has not lived up to its expectations. The decision to send refugees to Turkey was very shameful on behalf of the EU. We might ask ourselves, "What if it was us?". It was us. We have had big migrations. One can look at the 19th century where people who were poverty-stricken and sick left this country and ended up in other countries, yet the narrative around refugees, migrants or the big exodus that is happening is all about negativity. We celebrate our diaspora and talk about the positive contribution that they can make. However, that narrative is not feeding into the discussions that are going on at the moment with regard to this refugee crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> In the short time that remains, I wish to talk about the European fund for strategic investments. We had a debate here recently where there was a document sent. It was a debate over a couple of days on the stability programme update. Essentially, we told the European Commission that housing was a medium-term risk. We have a housing crisis here and yet we did not properly reflect that in the documents that we sent to the European Commission. Unless we call it what it is and share that information, we are going to run into some difficulties in resolving the problem. Given the level of our indebtedness, we are simply going to have to leverage funds off balance sheet. Some of the large-scale funds are obvious, such as the credit unions, which have money, and others. The European Investment Bank is one of those areas. It is also one of those areas in which we can make sure we do not incur costs on the other side. For example, with regard to the climate issue, there is the choice between the obligation to spend money on fines or to plan not to have fines and do the right thing. The European Investment Bank is going to be critically important in doing some of that work. It is really important that we properly articulate what the needs of this country are and how that European Investment Bank can be something that would be productive and that can be used in solidarity for things that progress us as a people and a continent.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Deputy Dara Murphy)<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_397">I will start by addressing the request from Deputy Ryan for a briefing from the Department. It would of course be the Department of Justice and Equality and we will see that it takes place and that it is in contact. Many of the Members present would be European affairs spokespersons for their parties. Perhaps it might be up to each party to see who they would send. We will make sure that it happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> In the recent reappointments, the Deputy referenced the importance of the digital single market and the energy union. The Deputy is absolutely correct, particularly with respect to energy union as a peripheral nation, as well as the digital single market. They have huge potential for the country, the people who live here and the EU collectively. Both issues have been supported by the UK in the past and we have shown good camaraderie in that space, irrespective of the vote on Thursday. We will be pursuing both of them.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> Clearly, we very much hope that the 28 member states will remain as members of the EU. I acknowledge that, in the main, the cross-party support for that has been very significant. I believe all of the largest of the political parties in this House have played a very measured role in making the case simply, fairly and in a measured way that it is important from an economic of view for our small country that the UK as our largest trading partner remains a member state. More important than the economics are the strong relationship we have now, the difficult period we have travelled together with regard to Northern Ireland and the significantly improved relations. The fact that potentially the only border between the EU and the UK could be in Northern Ireland is difficult and would present difficulties for us. We have a common travel area. We joined the EU together so we have never had a relationship where one was in and one was out of the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> Most importantly of all, as many Members have said, the EU has been a journey that has been shared by many member states since its foundation. We must remember the fundamental reasons for the establishment of the EU. The reason for the first coal and steel agreement, following through to the set up of the European Economic Community, EEC, was to allow the countries to come together to try to work together and avoid a situation repeated in which Europe settles its differences by disputes. To some extent, in that emotional argument, despite the acceptance that the EU has many failings - different parties disagree about those failings - we fundamentally believe that working together from the inside out is the way to work for the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> With respect to the points made about the EU-Turkey deal and the crisis, Deputy Murphy is correct about the distraction that the UK referendum has perhaps provided. I can assure the Deputy and all Deputies of the House that the European Council will continue to focus, irrespective of the vote, on the migration crisis. It is important to acknowledge, and we do acknowledge, that there are very significant issues involving elements of agreements with third countries and transit countries. The deal between Europe and Turkey at its core was to break the business model of the traffickers who have previously been mentioned. Since 1 May, daily arrivals into Greece are down from 1,700 to just 4% of that figure. Since 20 March, seven lives have tragically been lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">This is seven lives too many. However, in January, 89 people lost their lives. The purpose is to stop and break the business model of the smugglers and to discourage people from crossing the sea. This is being done in the interest of trying to save lives. It has not been completely successful but it has gone a long way in that regard. Also, there is an acceptance that a move towards a fortress Europe would be misguided and would be unlikely to work. It is for that reason that discussions with countries of transit and of origin are so important. While some speakers said that countries are being paid off, the reality is that many of these countries are going through severe financial difficulty and money is required to support how they aid and assist migrants when they are in their countries. We must work in that space. Of course, we must also continue to work with and encourage all countries of transit to have the highest standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> I thank the Members for their contributions. It will be Tuesday week, because of the European Council, that the Taoiseach will be back to brief the House after the Council meeting. I echo the commentary that we in Ireland very much hope that the Irish community and the people who can vote in the referendum will look to the great benefit that the European Union has been for all 28 member states, particularly for our small country, and get out and vote. Hopefully, the UK will continue to be a member of the European Union.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Defence (Deputy Paul Kehoe)<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_406">First, I congratulate Deputy Lisa Chambers on her election and on her appointment as Fianna Fáil spokesperson on defence.</p>
            <p eId="para_407"> As the Deputy will be aware, during the economic crisis, recruitment was conducted within a constrained resource envelope, taking into account the need to continue to procure essential systems and equipment for the Defence Forces. Balancing recruitment and equipment investment was essential so as to ensure that the Defence Forces could continue to perform all the functions assigned to them by the Government. Notwithstanding this the Defence Forces, uniquely within the public service, continued to recruit. In addition, very significant investment was made in equipment replenishment, not least the procurement of new vessels for the Naval Service and a range of force protection equipment, including a fleet of light tactical armoured vehicles, for the Army.</p>
            <p eId="para_408"> The Defence Forces are currently engaged in a major programme of recruitment to bring the number of serving personnel back up to the authorised strength of 9,500. More than 600 personnel will be recruited this year and it is planned to recruit 850 personnel in 2017. However, given the numbers leaving, either on retirement or to avail of the opportunities their significant Defence Forces professional skills training offers them in the wider economy, it is likely that we will continue to turn over personnel on an annual basis. As such, it will take time to return the Defence Forces to their full strength.</p>
            <p eId="para_409"> Given the unique and demanding nature of military life, there is understandably a high level of turnover among Defence Forces personnel. However, this is not new. The Defence Forces have always had a large turnover of approximately 500 personnel annually. Moreover, a certain level of turnover is necessary to maintain an appropriate age profile across the Defence Forces as a whole.</p>

            <from>Deputy Lisa Chambers<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_410">The Minister's response appears to be that money has been spent on equipment, that recruitment has continued, albeit that it has clearly not been effective enough to reach the required personnel numbers, and that equipment has been provided for the Naval Service. All of that is very much appreciated but my question was about the retention of personnel. The Minister talked about recruiting personnel to bridge the gap but that is not prevention. It is a cure for the numbers who have already left. How do we keep the personnel we have, the people we have spent a great deal of money training? There is great concern that the early departure of many personnel could affect our Defence Forces' capabilities and operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_411"> The exodus of officers from the Defence Forces could seriously affect our capabilities. According to the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers, RACO, 48 applications are being processed this year in addition to the more than 90 vacancies that already exist. Last year, 76 officers left the Defence Forces. This flight of talent was highlighted by RACO's magazine, <i>Signal</i>, with the general secretary saying that management has disappointingly failed to engage or constructively respond to issues and concerns raised at RACO's conference last year. He also highlighted the pressing requirement to address family-friendly practices and policies to support officers who are continually being re-located. Clearly, the abolition of the western brigade has contributed to that also.</p>

            <from>Deputy Paul Kehoe<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_412">I understand the Deputy's concerns. It is very important that we invest in equipment because we must ensure the Defence Forces personnel have the capability to carry out their role in peacekeeping operations, training and so forth. Equipment is important for that.</p>
            <p eId="para_413"> I take the Deputy's point that there has been a high number of departures. However, in the last number of years, there has been an average trend in that regard and the number is not more now than it was in the past. There are more opportunities for people in the private sector now. The Deputy referred to the number of officers leaving the Defence Forces to go into the private sector. I have raised this with the Department and the Defence Forces but it simply indicates how highly qualified the people who are trained by the Defence Forces are. It is not nice to lose those highly trained men and women to the private sector.</p>

            <from>Deputy Lisa Chambers<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_414">Again, I did not raise a concern about purchasing equipment. I welcome that; we need the equipment. However, our people are our most valuable asset in the Defence Forces. We are currently losing them at an alarming rate and the private sector is benefitting enormously. We pay to train them but we are not doing enough to keep them in the Defence Forces. To state simply that we have always had a high turnover does not justify the problem continuing to exist. We must endeavour to tackle the problem now and ensure we retain those people in so far as we can. Reports indicate that the Naval Service is short of marine engineers and electrical engineers. It can take up to five years to train officers. Many officers in the Air Corps who have amassed significant experience are being headhunted. We are aware this is happening. It is due to the fact that pay and conditions are not good enough to retain those people. In addition, the loss of the western brigade has led to greater relocation of officers on a more regular basis, leading to less family-friendly working conditions. Again, this is a contributing factor.</p>
            <p eId="para_415"> We can and must take measures to address this. I am not advocating that we do not spend money on equipment. We must have equipment to ensure that people can work safely in their jobs. However, we must invest in our people and ensure that we retain them after spending a great deal of money training them to bring them to the very high standard the Minister mentioned. We should keep them in our Defence Forces.</p>

            <p eId="para_416">I have been advised by the military authorities that in line with current public service remuneration policy, there are no specific financial incentive personnel retention schemes in place for the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_417"> The Defence Forces offer a very rewarding and challenging career, which is why people join them. They provide people with opportunities they will not get in any other organisation. All personnel are given the opportunity to acquire professional skills through accredited courses. There are significant opportunities for advancement through promotion. While it is challenging, the opportunity to serve overseas is professionally rewarding and financially compensated. The Defence Forces have been challenged in terms of keeping highly qualified people as the economy grows, with increasing and more lucrative opportunities opening up in the private sector. This shows that the private sector looks to the Defence Forces for highly trained people. It is a concern and something about which I am very much aware.</p>

            <p eId="para_419">The purpose of this question is to ask why Lariam is still being issued to Irish soldiers despite the fact that defence forces in many other countries have banned its use, and to ask when the working group that was set up to look into this matter will report back to the Minister and afterwards to the Dáil.</p>

            <p eId="para_420">A malaria working group was established in January 2011 and reported in April 2013. The group was reconvened in August 2015. The purpose of the group is to review, <i>inter alia</i>, issues arising relating to the use of Lariam, particularly in the context of current and potential litigation. It is to review the Defence Forces' approach to the use of malaria chemoprophylaxis. It is also to ensure that the procedures relating to this continue to be appropriate and in accordance with best medical practice. In addition, the group was tasked with reviewing the use of the drug primaquine as part of the overall medical treatment process for those deployed to malarious areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_421"> As with the group's original report, the current report is being produced in the context of current and potential litigation and is, therefore, legally privileged. I can confirm that the group is investigating all the various allegations surrounding the use of Lariam and is engaging with experts both nationally and internationally. I understand it hopes to complete the report next month.</p>
            <p eId="para_422"> The health and welfare of the Defence Forces are a priority for me and the Department, and this informs my approach to the issue of Lariam. While I am anxious to receive the completed report as soon as possible, I want the group to ensure that it provides as comprehensive a report as possible. Once the report is completed, the group will report back to me with its findings.</p>

            <p eId="para_423">I do not know whether the Minister of State is fully aware of the dangerous and lasting side effects of Lariam and whether he has met some of the soldiers and former soldiers I met at the weekend. They were able to describe in graphic detail what had happened to them and their colleagues and were also able to point to quite a number of other countries that have declared the drug to be one of last resort. The United States Army Special Forces Command has banned its use. Countries such as France, Germany, the Netherlands, Denmark and Canada have either banned its use or use it as a last resort. I have put many questions to a number of Ministers over the years; I believe the Minister of State is the fourth Minister with whom I have raised this question. Ireland still allows the use of a drug that is highly suspect in terms of its use by Defence Forces personnel travelling overseas to represent this country and do good work.</p>

            <p eId="para_424">As the Deputy knows, malaria is probably one of the most dangerous diseases that anyone serving in sub-Saharan Africa can pick up. Lariam has been prescribed by the Chief Medical Officer, who states that it is the safest drug to prescribe to serving members. I am aware that the former Minister of Defence, Deputy Coveney, met a delegation from the action group that is against the use of Lariam in the past 12 to 18 months. Following the meeting, the group submitted a number of questions, which I am currently replying to. I know that the group has concerns about the use of Lariam but I can assure the Deputy that the Department has taken all safety measures into consideration when prescribing it.</p>

            <p eId="para_425">Will the Minister of State confirm that he will meet Action Lariam for Irish Soldiers? At the protest last week, members of the group asked me to ask the Minister of State this question. Can he confirm that Lariam will no longer be issued to our Defence Forces in the near future and update the House on the supports the Department plans to provide to soldiers who have already been harmed by taking Lariam while serving overseas?</p>

            <p eId="para_426">The health and welfare of men and women of the Defence Forces is a priority for me. The choice of medication for overseas deployment, including the use of Lariam, is a medical decision made by the medical officers in the Irish Defence Forces. Having regard to the specific circumstances of the mission and individual members of the Defence Forces, Lariam remains the medication prescribed by the medical corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the very serious risks posed by malaria, which killed approximately 438,000 people in 2015, with 90% of deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa, as reported by the World Health Organization. It is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area. There are no plans to withdraw Lariam from the range of anti-malarial medications available to Defence Forces personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_427"> The Deputy asked whether I would meet Action Lariam for Irish Soldiers. I have no problem with meeting this group. Unfortunately, I was unavailable to meet its representatives at the weekend, but I sent them correspondence. I will meet the group, as did my predecessor, and listen to its concerns. I must outline my number one priority, which is the safety of the members of the Defences Forces whom we send abroad.</p>

            <p eId="para_429">The strength of the Reserve Defence Force, RDF, at the end of May 2016 was 2,134 effective personnel. The 2015 White Paper on Defence confirms that the primary role of the reserve is to augment the Permanent Defence Force in times of crisis and to participate in ceremonial events. The White Paper also sets out a developmental path for the RDF. It provides that the overarching establishment of the Army Reserve, AR, and the Naval Service Reserve, NSR, is to be set at 4,169 personnel, consisting of 3,869 Army reservists and the expansion of the four NSR units from 200 personnel to 300.</p>
            <p eId="para_430"> In addition, the White Paper recognises that there may be professional skills that, on occasion, are not readily available in the Permanent Defence Force. Arising from the fact that there may be individual members of the RDF who, by virtue of their professional civilian qualifications, have the competence to undertake such specialised tasks and fill the skills gap, the Government has decided that a panel of such professionally qualified members of the RDF, to be known as the Specialist Reserve, should be established.</p>
            <p eId="para_431"> A key challenge is to recruit and train sufficient personnel to meet the reserve establishment provided for in the White Paper. The Defence Forces will continue to seek increases to the level of RDF recruitment in 2016.</p>
            <p eId="para_432">It must be remembered that membership of the RDF is voluntary and strength levels are ultimately dependent on how many people volunteer for it in any given calendar year and commit to ongoing active participation in training and other activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_433"> With regard to Garda clearance, as I advised the Deputy recently, applicants to the Reserve Defence Forces are vetted by the Garda central vetting unit as part of the recruitment process. Processing times for vetting of applications can take up to 12 weeks on average. The Deputy will appreciate that in some cases additional inquiries may be necessary and this may result in processing times in excess of the average. For security and operational reasons the Defence Forces cannot comment on vetting processes in individual cases.</p>

            <p eId="para_434">I will outline some of the scenarios I have come across. A number of applicants began the fitness testing and interview process in October 2015. Their Garda clearance forms went in after that in October-November 2015 but some of them have still not heard back. The Minister of State outlined to me that the vetting process rests with the Garda Síochána. I submitted questions to the Minister for Justice and Equality on this very issue and asked her what the turnaround times were for Garda vetting. I was told that the average turnaround time was not 12 weeks but four weeks for 80% of applications. She told me that there were certain circumstances in which additional information may be required and that time could be extended. The 12 weeks that the Minister of State just stated does not marry with the four weeks stated by the Minister for Justice and Equality this month. The Minister for Justice and Equality told me that 80% of applications are dealt with within that four-week period, so it does not explain the ongoing huge delays. Between October-November 2015 and June 2016 some applicants have not heard back. It appears that the issue does not rest with the Garda Síochána unless all of the Reserve applications happen to sit in that 20% that could potentially take longer. Will the Minister of State please explain why he has told me 12 weeks when the Minister for Justice and Equality has told me four weeks?</p>

            <p eId="para_435">I assure the Deputy that neither the Defence Forces nor the Department are holding up applications to the Reserve Defence Forces. As the Deputy is aware, when one applies for the Reserve Defence Forces, one is going into a specific area. I will check with the Minister for Justice and Equality what the average waiting time on applications for Garda clearance is. Given the importance of ensuring the members of the Reserve are fully security cleared before becoming members of the Defence Forces, it would not be appropriate for me to intervene in this process or to seek for such requests to be expedited nor would it be appropriate for me to seek to have specific applications accorded priority over others. I assure the Deputy that I will look into this. I have still to meet with the recruitment section of the Defence Forces. The Deputy raised this with me at a previous meeting and I will come back to her with a reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_436">I have never suggested that applications are being withheld by any particular organisation or individual. I am asking the Minister of State to investigate this because it appears that Reserve Defence Forces applications are taking much longer than anybody would expect. I have the response issued to me on 14 June 2016 by the Minister for Justice and Equality which outlines the number of applications received for the past three years. It shows clearly, in black and white, that 80% of applications are processed within four weeks. The Minister was very clear on that. I can give that to the Minister of State so that he does not need to double check it with the Minister, although he should feel free to do so. Will the Minister come back to me and tell me why those delays are happening? If they are not happening within the Department of Defence or within the Defence Forces but somewhere else, we need to identity from where the problem is originating so we can fix it. If we do not know what is causing the problem, it will persist. </p>
            <p eId="para_437"> From talking to individuals who have actually applied - people I know - I can tell the Minister of State that they are still waiting on responses to applications they submitted in November 2015. It is simply not good enough because those people are currently lost to the organisation. They will not come back to us again. They are very good young people who want to volunteer but we are not letting them volunteer because we are not processing their applications.</p>

            <p eId="para_444"> At the NATO summit in Wales in September 2014, the establishment of the Partnership Interoperability Initiative was endorsed with the purpose of reinforcing the alliance's commitment to co-operative security and interoperable capability development. As a participant in the Partnership for Peace, Ireland is also a member of the Partnership Interoperability Initiative which is now referred to as the Partnership Interoperability Platform. For Ireland, this platform provides a format for consulting and working on common interoperability challenges to enhance our ability to operate with partners in future crisis management operations. </p>
            <p eId="para_445"> Defence Ministers from partners and allies participating in the interoperability platform have been invited to attend a meeting of participating states at the Warsaw summit. Given the importance of interoperability for force protection and effectiveness on operations, I plan to attend that meeting on 8 and 9 July 2016. As Ireland is not a member of NATO, the question of attendance at the NATO summit itself does not arise.</p>

            <p eId="para_446">Given that we are already committed to many UN mandated missions, for which we have a proud record that is acknowledged throughout the world, and also, regretfully, that we have committed to the EU battlegroup, why in God's name would we have anything to do with NATO or its Partnership for Peace at this stage? I see that another Deputy has tabled a question on that issue. Why would we commit money - it costs the Irish taxpayer money to remain committed to the Partnership for Peace - given our commitments elsewhere which are honourable and should be continued in the UN mandated group? Given that NATO is a Cold War relic and should have been disbanded many years ago, it should not be allowed to further threaten the stability of the EU or the stability of the world. Will the Minister of State start the process to withdraw from NATO's Partnership for Peace at this stage?</p>

            <p eId="para_447">We have no plans to withdraw. The primary aim of our Partnership for Peace membership is to enhance the Defence Forces' interoperability with other professional military forces for the purpose of engaging in UN authorised peacekeeping and peace support operations led by the UN, EU or NATO. Participation in Partnership for Peace is fundamental to Ireland being able to meet its obligations in providing professional peacekeepers for international crisis management and peacekeeping operations mandated by the UN.</p>
            <p eId="para_448">This partnership has assisted Ireland in participating in more demanding peacekeeping operations, such as the UN mission to Liberia, the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, and EUFOR Chad. Ireland is also successfully acting as a framework nation in KFOR. That is the reason I and some of my officials plan to attend the PfP meeting on 8 and 9 July. I really believe this will be beneficial to the Defence Forces in interoperability and in being able to look at the way other states operate.</p>

            <p eId="para_449">The Minister of State and I will probably differ on this. We have differed over the years when there have been votes on it in this House. Can the Minister of State see the logic that interoperability suggests increased funding? As we are the poor cousin, in terms of military equipment, the demand by NATO's Partnership for Peace, the EU battle groups and the European Defence Agency is to increase the capability of the Defence Forces. Interoperability brings with it a significant cost to the taxpayer which is covered up whenever one talks about it. It is obscene. Rather than continuing with this, it is appropriate that the Government withdraw from the Partnership for Peace. If the Minister of State is going to the NATO summit, he should indicate our refusal to continue to co-operate in spending on increasing our capability when we are a neutral state.</p>

            <p eId="para_450">NATO's interoperability policy is designed to support the capacity for member countries to act coherently, effectively and efficiently to achieve tactical operational and strategic objectives. Specifically, it enables forces, units and systems to operate together and allows them to share common doctrine and procedures, infrastructure and bases and the ability to be able to communicate better.</p>
            <p eId="para_451"> Interoperability reduces duplication, enables pooling of resources and produces synergies among partners and allies. Partners have played key roles in recent NATO operations in the Balkans, in Bosnia-Herzegovina, in Kosovo and in Afghanistan and it is recognised that there is a need for regular consultations with partners on all issues liked to interoperability. We will also move to a more structured and more coherent use of the existing set of partnership instruments.</p>

            <p eId="para_454">I thank the Deputy for his question and wish him the best of luck in his new role.</p>
            <p eId="para_455"> The 2016 general service recruitment competition closed to applicants on 22 May 2016. At the time of closing, there were 4,590 applications with 15% or 680 of applicants being female.</p>
            <p eId="para_456"> The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_457"> A number of specific initiatives have been implemented to increase female participation in the Defence Forces, including: the Defence Forces have visited many female schools to promote a career in the Defence Forces to women; the Defence Forces have targeted female sports clubs to heighten awareness of the opportunities for women in the Defence Forces; female websites have been targeted as part of the recruitment campaigns; special consideration is paid to women as a target group for recruitment; there is a representative composition between men and women on recruitment and selection boards; and a gender adviser operates to promote gender equality policies and training within the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_458"> Unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties. Women, therefore, play a full and meaningful role in all aspects of Defence Forces operations at home and abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_459"> Notwithstanding these recent proactive initiatives, I believe that there is a need to continue to develop and promote strategies that support increased female participation in the Defence Forces. The White Paper on Defence 2015 noted that "a key impediment in achieving greater numbers of women serving in the Defence Forces is the lack of women recruitment applicants relative to men".</p>
            <p eId="para_460"> Additional initiatives were undertaken since 2014 to promote a career in the Defence Forces to women through outreach to schools and to sports clubs and through social media. The recent 2016 campaign built on these initiatives and was designed specifically to target females through increased engagement in the recruitment process and competition advertising.</p>

            <p eId="para_461">The Minister of State's reply was short on reference to the LGBT community. Is the Minister of State confident that he can attract a sufficient number of women to the Permanent Defence Force and, in effect, double their representation in the force?</p>
            <p eId="para_462"> I understand from quotes in the media that recruitment will be targeted towards women who are sporty, as they are team players and winners. I hope the recruitment process is more targeted and scientific than that. The fitness requirement for the Defences Forces is already in place as part of the recruitment process. I believe we need to broaden the net in this recruitment drive. Our soldiers need to be more than just athletes.</p>
            <p eId="para_463"> As the 2015 White Paper on Defence highlights, we need to make the recruitment of more females a priority in our Defence Forces. We need to reflect UN Security Council Resolution 1325 requiring parties to conflicts and peacekeepers to have a greater awareness of the effect of war on women and this requires a complex skills set which I know the Defence Forces provides. We do not want to inadvertently isolate good candidates from the recruitment process before it even begins.</p>

            <p eId="para_464">Initiatives established in 2014-2015 continue to be developed through active engagement with organisations such as the Gay and Lesbian Equality Network, GLEN, in order to promote the Defence Forces as an employer. This engagement will include an external audit of the Defence Forces by GLEN in terms of organisational culture and diversity in 2017. In addition, work is well progressed on a Defence Forces equality and diversity policy encompassing gender and equality issues, which I plan to publish in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_465"> I am aware of the need to give females every opportunity to join the Defence Forces. I already indicated that the 2016 general service recruitment campaign was designed specially to target females through increased engagement in recruitment processes and competition advertising. This included specific provisions in social media and digital advertising, targeted advertising and the introduction of a female information programme. I can assure Deputy Ryan I am aware of female members of the Defence Forces visiting girl schools across the country to attract female recruits.</p>

            <p eId="para_467"> On another related matter on the recruitment process generally, I received a number of representations in recent years regarding the psychometric testing which takes place. I am aware of two cases, in particular, where individuals passed the fitness test but were unable to proceed in the process due to failing the psychometric tests. I have come across a case in which an individual failed the psychometric test and had to reapply when a recruitment process was opened.</p>
            <p eId="para_468"> Psychometric testing can cut people out of the process, people who in subsequent applications prove to be successful candidates for the Permanent Defence Force. Would the Minister of State consider re-calibrating the recruitment process so that the psychometric test takes place after, or alongside, the interview process and perhaps taking a look at this as part of a greater review of the recruitment process for the Permanent Defence Force?</p>

            <p eId="para_469">As Deputy Ryan will be aware, psychometric testing is important for entry to the Defence Forces, An Garda Síochána and many other organisations. The candidate must have a specific skill set. The psychometric testing is a challenge. I am aware of some candidates passing it online and failing when they go physically to take it in an examination hall.</p>
            <p eId="para_470">That is unfortunate and many people have come to me to say that. The psychometric testing is very important for the recruitment of all candidates.</p>
            <p eId="para_471"> As a matter of policy, the Government believes the military forces of this State should appropriately reflect and integrate the demographics of the whole population. To that end, the Defence Forces are committed to the principles of equal opportunities in employment policies, procedures, instructions and regulations. The Defence Forces operate in an environment without discrimination in all areas covered by Equality Acts. The Defence Forces seek to ensure that the principles of equality are adhered to in the recruitment, induction, employment and daily routines of training, education and promotion. We look to work with diverse communities to give people the opportunity to join the Irish Defence Forces and we are specifically focused on gender issues.</p>

            <from>Deputy Paul Kehoe<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T18:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_475">I propose to take Questions Nos. 19 and 23 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_476"> The Government is committed to maintaining the stabilised strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500 personnel, comprising 7,520 Army personnel, 886 Air Corps personnel and 1,094 Naval Service personnel, as stated in the 2015 White Paper on Defence. I am advised by the military authorities that the strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 31 May 2016, the latest date for which details are available, was 9,137 personnel, comprising 7,310 Army personnel, 733 Air Corps personnel and 1,094 Naval Service personnel. The manpower requirement of the Defence Forces is monitored on an ongoing basis in accordance with the operational requirements of each of the three services. Personnel are posted on the basis of operational needs across the organisation both at home and abroad and not on a regional basis. As there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force targeted recruitment has been and is currently taking place so as to maintain the agreed strength levels. The current general service recruitment campaign, which was launched on 13 April 2016, envisages an intake of 600 general service recruits in 2016 and a further 850 in 2017. This recruitment will be phased over the 2016 and 2017 period in a manner designed to restore the established strength and plans are being put in place to this end.</p>
            <p eId="para_477"> The military authorities have advised of the following intake in 2016 to date. There have been 241 general service recruits inducted in 2016, with a further 150 having completed their recruit training in 2016 following induction in the fourth quarter of 2015. An Air Corps aircraft apprentice technician competition is planned later in 2016. The intake of cadets into the Permanent Defence Force is normally carried out on an annual basis, taking into consideration the operational requirements of the Defence Forces and the resource envelope allocated to defence. There are 75 cadets scheduled to be inducted in the third quarter following the current cadet competitions. The breakdown is 50 Army personnel, 15 Naval Service personnel and ten Air Corps personnel. Direct entry competitions are also held as required from which specialist appointments are filled.</p>
            <p eId="para_478"> Given that personnel can retire from the Permanent Defence Force for a variety of reasons, the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible to accurately forecast retirements at this stage for 2016. However, I am advised by the military authorities that in 2015, 76 officers and 491 enlisted ranks retired or were discharged. Up to 31 May 2016, 34 officers and 193 enlisted ranks have retired or were discharged. In line with human resources policy, there is significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Force due to the requirement to maintain a lower age profile. With the support of the chief of staff and within the resources available, it is intended to retain the capacity of the Defence Forces to operate effectively across all roles and to undertake the tasks laid down by Government both at home and overseas.</p>

            <p eId="para_479">I was told in a written reply in April this year that the serving strength of the Permanent Defence Force, PDF, was 9,146, which is nine fewer than October 2015. The former Minister, Deputy Coveney, stated that budget 2016 includes the provision of €416 million for Permanent Defence Force pay and this would allow for the payment of the full establishment of 9,500 personnel in line with the commitment in the White Paper on Defence. Will this happen in 2016?</p>
            <p eId="para_480"> In October 2014, the former Minister, Deputy Coveney, highlighted that 220 recruits were in training, with plans under way to enlist 180 additional recruits by the end of 2014. Yet in 2015, we dropped a further 140 members. When will we see numbers reach 9,500? Will it be in 2016? If the budget exists for it, why is not being achieved? The Minister of State has spoken about significant turnover, how it has always been that way and that he is very aware of that. If he is aware of the turnover, why is there no foresight and forward planning to ensure we keep those numbers at 9,500 personnel, rather than leaning back on the excuse for not reaching the levels to which we have committed?</p>

            <p eId="para_481">Recruitment of personnel in any calendar year can fluctuate, depending on timing of recruitment, the holding of competitions and establishment of panels, Garda vetting and ongoing operational requirements that can impact the recruitment and training capacity. In 2015, 386 personnel were recruited, with 307 personnel recruited to the general service, 49 cadets for the 2015 cadet competitions, five Naval Service personnel, 19 personnel for the Defence Forces school of music, 24 personnel for the Air Corps, one medical officer and one conductor for the school of music. In 2014, 505 personnel were recruited, although I will not go through the numbers for specific areas in that calendar year. In 2013, 404 personnel were recruited.</p>
            <p eId="para_482"> I assure the Deputy that the Government and Defence Forces are ensuring that we hold at the ceiling of 9,500 personnel, although it is quite difficult at times because of the numbers of people leaving. It fluctuates from year to year. I outlined to the Deputy the number of people we are taking in for 2016 and 2017 to try to bring the level to 9,500 personnel.</p>

            <p eId="para_483">The Minister of State still has not answered my question of when it is expected to reach 9,500 personnel. It is not something that can be arrived at magically. There are ways and means of achieving the number and the Minister of State knows the difficulties in the recruitment process. They exist every year and we must plan to deal with those difficulties, ensure we can overcome them and reach the targets we have set.</p>
            <p eId="para_484"> It was suggested by my predecessor on this bench that some of the defence budget is often held back to deal with an overrun on the Army pension side. Is this true? It certainly seems plausible when the Department's ministerial brief indicates there has been a continuous structural under-provision for the Army pension, resulting in successive Supplementary Estimates every year since 2005. It also indicates that the Department has managed to meet those shortfalls from payroll savings on the Defence Forces, with the example of payroll savings arising from the gap between retirements and the recruitment of replacement personnel. Will the Minister of State comment on that and is it why we see a continued shortfall? Is it deliberate and why have we not reached the target?</p>

            <p eId="para_485">It is the Government's intention to maintain the stabilised strength of the Permanent Defence Force at 9,500, the optimum level to fulfil all roles assigned by government. In this context of the current strength being below the agreed strength as indicated, targeted recruitment is taking place within the resource envelope available to the Department. I am very much aware of the Deputy's concerns in the area about bringing strength to 9,500 personnel but I state again that this depends on fluctuating levels of people leaving from year to year. I cannot say at the start of a recruitment process that X number will leave and they must be replaced. We do our best-----</p>

            <p eId="para_490">My apologies for arriving late. It takes a little while to get from my office over to here.</p>
            <p eId="para_491"> Is there a procedure within the Defence Forces whereby potential retirements are identified as a need for further recruitment, or are they identified as potential savings in the course of any particular year? To what extent can the Minister put in place a procedure whereby there is an automatic kick-in system under which losses or retirements are recorded or anticipated in advance, with a view to making the provision by way of recruitment? To what extent does his reply to the question so far relate to the Army, the Navy and the Air Corps separately?</p>

            <p eId="para_492">The Department and the Defence Forces try at the start of every year to calculate how many retirements they expect in that calendar year. As I have said to the Deputy opposite, that fluctuates from time to time. It is very difficult to say exactly how many will retire. I have already indicated that personnel can retire from the Defence Forces for a variety of reasons and the Deputy will, therefore, appreciate that it is not possible to forecast retirements accurately for 2016 at this stage. However, I am advised by the military authorities that in 2015, 76 officers and 490 members of the enlisted ranks retired or were discharged and up to 21 May 2016, 34 officers and 193 in the enlisted ranks have retired or were discharged. In line with human resources policy, there is a significant turnover of personnel in the Permanent Defence Forces due to the requirement to maintain a lower age profile. I assure the Deputy that we continue to monitor this on an ongoing basis, to the best of the Department's and the Defence Forces' ability, to try to ensure that we replace the number of personnel retiring.</p>

            <p eId="para_493">Is provision made automatically in respect of sensitive areas of the Defence Forces where retirements or resignations might cause a particular void in the structure and strength of the Defence Forces and its ability to respond to particular circumstances? To what extent can provision be made on an ongoing basis to ensure those vacancies are being provided for?</p>

            <p eId="para_494">That is monitored on an ongoing basis, but I assure the Deputy that there are people ready and able to take up whatever positions people retire from. The Defence Forces have well-trained people who are capable of taking over whatever role may become vacant as a result of a retirement. Going back to the Deputy's other question, the current general service recruitment campaign, which was launched on 13 April 2016, envisages 600 general service recruits in 2016 and a further 850 in 2017. I understand that as of 31 May 2016, 34 officers and 193 enlisted ranks have retired or were discharged. I assure the Deputy that this is monitored and if someone is required in a particular role, there are people who have the capability to take over whatever position is required.</p>

            <p eId="para_497">The Minister of State will remember that in the last quarter of 2011 the previous Fine Gael and Labour Party Government decided with the stroke of a pen to close Columb Barracks in Mullingar and in doing so broke a rich Defence Forces tradition in the town. To date, the Department has done nothing to try to secure an alternative use for this fine premises and the facilities that remain there. I want to give the Minister of State an opportunity in the House today to outline his Department's plans for the long-term use of this site.</p>

            <p eId="para_498">I propose to take Questions Nos. 20 and 29 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_499"> Following the closure of Columb Barracks in 2012, my Department has explored a number of avenues to try to secure the long-term future of the former barracks for the benefit of the local community. Departments and other public bodies, including Westmeath County Council, have been invited to declare any interest in acquiring the property. To date no interest has been identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_500"> As the barracks is no longer required for military purposes, the current financial and administrative burden resulting from the retention of the barracks cannot be sustained. The disposal of the property by public auction will be actively progressed in keeping with the Government’s policy and recent practice to dispose of surplus property no longer required for military purposes.</p>
            <p eId="para_501"> In the context of its potential future use contributing to the positive development of Mullingar, my Department remains open to viable proposals to these ends from Westmeath County Council. Having regard to the local community and development interest, I suggest that any local groups should engage with Westmeath County Council to explore such opportunities.</p>

            <p eId="para_502">The first time the Department met Westmeath County Council was earlier this year. Prior to that, there had been no interaction. There are community groups using that facility at the moment - the GAA, the youth cafe, the Organisation of National Ex-Service Personnel - and many more community groups wish to avail of the facility. The simple fact is that the Department cannot expect Westmeath County Council, which already lacks sufficient funding to provide the services it is meant to be providing, to take this on board and open it to a wider community without getting the necessary financial supports from the Department. There is a public meeting this Thursday night, which I have convened to ascertain the level of public interest in the future use of this facility. If a plan were devised, would the Department press the pause button and say it will not put it up for public auction in order to give the community an opportunity to carry out a feasibility study and present the plan? Would the Department look at funding the implementation of that plan into the future?</p>

            <p eId="para_503">The Department of Defence cannot be the landlord to a facility. We have given Westmeath County Council every opportunity to take over the barracks. Officials from my Department have been in contact with Westmeath County Council. I am also very much aware that Deputy Troy has spoken to officials from my Department and this has been outlined to him on a number of occasions. I hope he will be able to recognise that the Department of Defence cannot be the landlord of the barracks for the foreseeable future. As Deputy Troy well knows, the barracks is falling into disrepair and money needs to be spent on it. I understand there are a number of community groups in the barracks at present, but my officials will be in contact with the CEO of Westmeath County Council to ask whether it has a future in mind for the barracks. As Deputy Troy well knows, if State property is going from one institution of the State to another, we can hammer out some sort of a deal on that. I understand there is a public meeting on Thursday evening, but after that meeting, Deputy Troy and others can go to Westmeath County Council and explain their plan to the council.</p>
            <p eId="para_504">I have spoken to officials in my own Department, as the Deputy has, and if there is no proposal we will go ahead with the sale. The proposal would have to come from Westmeath County Council so that it could be the landlord of all the community groups. It is not the responsibility of the Department of Defence to be the landlord for community groups.</p>

            <p eId="para_505">I agree with the Minister that there is a sense of urgency, but why is that? It is because the Department did nothing in respect of this matter for four years but now the Minister of State wants us to have a public meeting on Thursday night and to come back very quickly with a plan. The Minister of State had four years to devise a plan and did not do so, but he wants us to do it in four days.</p>
            <p eId="para_506"> I ask him to press the pause button on this. Tell us on the floor of the House that the barracks will not go to public auction for the foreseeable future. Afford the community an opportunity to bring forward a plan. There are some very good ideas. It can be used for educational facilities or to house the Reserve Defence Force, in respect of which the Department is paying €25,000 per annum to a private landlord down the road. It can be used by the GAA or Mullingar Arts Centre. We want a commitment from the Minister to press the pause button so that the barracks does not go for public auction in the foreseeable future. He should allow an opportunity for community groups to come together to carry out a feasibility study for the long-term use of this facility. They could work with Westmeath County Council and Westmeath-Longford Education and Training Board, which might also have an interest in the building in terms of the provision of post leaving certificate courses or a new secondary school in Mullingar, something that is badly needed. The Minister should enable the community groups to work together to provide what was promised when he closed the facility - namely, that it would remain in community use.</p>

            <p eId="para_508">There is a template in the form of what happened with the barracks in Cavan and Clonmel, which were closed at the same time. Cavan VEC took over Cavan barracks and Tipperary County Council has taken over Clonmel. I believe there are different tenants there now but I am open to correction on that. In any event, both communities were very active from the time their barracks closed in trying to find alternative uses for them. The security costs to the Department of Defence in 2015 were approximately €34,000. If we do not do something with Mullingar barracks and there is an accident, such as someone falling through a ceiling or something like that, the Deputy would be the first person on my doorstep asking why the Department left it in such a state and did not dispose of it. That is why I have taken a personal interest in this case. I am open to proposals-----</p>

That is mind-boggling and the Minister of State should be ashamed to say it on the floor of this House. The Reserve Defence Force wanted to continue to use the facility and would have been more than capable of maintaining it.</p>
            <p eId="para_513"> Nothing has happened because the previous Government gave a commitment that it would stay in community use.

            <p eId="para_531">The health and welfare of the Defence Forces are a priority for me and this informs my approach to the issue of Lariam. As I have already advised the House today, a malaria working group was established in January 2011 and reported in April 2013. The group was reconvened in August 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_532"> The purpose of the group is to review, <i>inter alia</i>, issues arising in relation to the use of Lariam, particularly in the context of the current and potential litigation. It is to review the approach of the Defence Forces to the use of malaria chemoprophylaxis. It is also to ensure that the procedures continue to be appropriate and in accordance with best medical practice. In addition, the group was tasked with reviewing the use of the drug primaquine as part of the overall medical treatment process for those deployed to malarious areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_533"> As with the group's original report, the current report is being produced in the context of current and potential litigation and is, therefore, legally privileged. I can confirm that the group is investigating all the various allegations surrounding the use of Lariam and has obtained advice from leading medical experts.</p>

            <p eId="para_534">I know the history of the report and its terms of reference but I want to see it. It was promised that we would have the report in January this year. Everything has changed utterly and radically on this subject since the last Dáil. At the end of last month the British Defence Select Committee published a highly critical report that recommended banning the use of Lariam by Ministry of Defence personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_535">It stated that at the very least it should be the drug of last resort. We know that Lariam is the third line of choice for the US army in sub-Saharan Africa. Its use is banned in the US Special Forces. We know that members of the Australian defence forces who have been diagnosed as suffering side effects from the use of Lariam can claim compensation and have received an apology. This is critically urgent. We are endangering the lives of those who serve in our Defence Forces. Lariam's use is against best medical practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_536"> I met a man at the protest on Saturday. He had served in Lebanon and been shot in the leg. He served in Kosovo, where he dug up bodies, but did not receive any counselling. He then went to Liberia. He was prescribed Lariam and has suffered dreadful side effects. He suffers from deep depression and psychological problems. This is critically urgent in order to stop other people suffering as a result of it. We need to see the report and we need to stop using Lariam. Stopping its use will put us in line with best medical practice.</p>

            <p eId="para_537">Deputy Daly mentioned the UK defence committee report on Lariam. I am very much aware of the report and its conclusions. However, the use of Lariam by other armed forces is an internal matter for them. It would be inappropriate for me to comment on the policy of other states in this regard. The Deputy may wish to note that the working group invited two of the doctors who provided evidence to the UK defence committee to submit material to it and both Dr. Remington Nevin and Dr. Ashley Croft submitted material for its consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_538"> On the use of Lariam in an Irish context, the health and welfare of the men and women of the Defence Forces is a priority for me. I have never changed that line, nor did my predecessor. The choice of medication for overseas deployment, including the use of Lariam, is a medical decision by the medical officers in the Irish Defence Forces, having regard for the specific circumstances of the mission and the individual member of the Irish Defence Forces.</p>

            <p eId="para_539">This is critically worrying in the extreme. Let us look at the conclusions of the British committee. It stated that there was "neither the need, nor any justification for continuing to issue this medication to Service personnel" unless they can be individually assessed in accordance with the manufacturer's requirements. We know that is not possible in an army setting. The British forces are also concerned with the health of their personnel. Does it not bother the Minister of State that practically every single defence force on the planet has changed its position regarding Lariam except for the Irish Defence Forces, which dig in and refuse to acknowledge what has gone on? There is nothing wrong with saying we made a mistake. There is nothing wrong with acknowledging the wrongdoing. It is wrong, however, to continue with a policy that has been abandoned in other jurisdictions because of legitimate health concerns. We are flying in the face of international knowledge on this issue, yet we carry on blindly. This report was produced in 2013 and the working group was reconvened in 2015. The Minister of State's predecessor told us we would have the report in January. Can we see it, please, or is the Minister of State saying we will never get to see it?</p>

            <p eId="para_540">There are different practices between Ireland and the UK. Our position is that Lariam remains formally on the list of medications prescribed by the medical corps for Defence Forces personnel on appropriate overseas missions to ensure that our military personnel can have effective protection from the serious risks posed by malaria, which killed approximately 438,000 people in 2015, with 90% of deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa, as reported by the World Health Organization. Malaria is a serious threat to any military force operating in the area. It is notable that no member of the Defence Forces, despite the numbers who have served in malarial areas, has died from malaria. The use of and information on medications is kept under ongoing review. However, there are no plans at this time to withdraw Lariam from the range of anti-malarial medications available to the Irish Defence Forces.</p>

            <p eId="para_544">A central plank of Irish foreign policy is support for the multilateral system of collective security represented by the United Nations. In this regard, Ireland has worked to uphold the primary role of the Security Council when it comes to international peace and security. This commitment has found expression in Ireland's long-standing tradition of participation in UN peacekeeping operations. Participation in EU battle groups is another means for Ireland to express our commitment to the UN and its principles.</p>
            <p eId="para_545"> At its meeting of 14 July 2015, the Government approved the participation of five members of the Permanent Defence Force in the UK-led EU battle group, which will be on stand-by for six months from 1 July 2016. The resolution on Ireland's accession to the memorandum of understanding for the battle group was passed by Dáil Eireann on 9 June. The opportunity to deploy a small number of Irish personnel to the operational and force headquarters of the battle group will enable the Defence Forces to gain a greater insight into UK operations and command structures, with a view to potential future participation jointly with the UK in peacekeeping operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_546"> The UK-led EU battle group will consist of participants from Ireland, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, Sweden and the UK. Following a change of Government in May 2016, Cyprus, which had originally intended participating in this EU battle group by providing a small number of staff officers to the operational headquarters, has advised that it will not now be doing so. It is important to note that each participating country retains the right to deploy or not to deploy its forces, irrespective of an EU decision to launch a battle group operation. As such, any deployment of the Irish contribution as part of the battle group will still be subject to a UN mandate and Government approval.</p>
            <p eId="para_547"> I recently gave an assurance to the House that, notwithstanding that Dáil approval is only required in respect of deployments of 12 or more personnel, in the event that a decision by Government might be required on an actual deployment of the EU battle group, I will be happy to facilitate discussion in the House in such circumstances.</p>

            <p eId="para_548">I find the term battle group unsettling. I do not think it appropriate phraseology for a peacekeeping troop. On 18 May, Irish troops participated in the EU battle group. They spent 18 days doing war games on Salisbury Plain. To me, that compromises Irish neutrality. Ireland is meant to be neutral of any aggression. This is NATO-lite. Our troops should not be involved in any acts of aggression around the world. We should pull out of these battle groups, or whatever one might want to call them, because they are a <i>de facto</i> European army.</p>

            <p eId="para_549">I absolutely agree that the term battle group is a misleading and unfortunate term. I have raised this with the Department but I understand that we alone cannot change it. A change in the term would have to go through the UN. The term is a standard, technical military term. Essentially, it is a battalion-size force with support elements including transport and logistics. The overall size of a battle group is approximately 1,500 personnel. EU battle groups have a readiness to deploy, within five to ten days, a range of possible missions.</p>
            <p eId="para_550"> The Deputy raised the issue of our neutrality. The participation in battle groups has no effect on our traditional policy of military neutrality. A commitment to a battle group does not involve any commitment to common or mutual defence. I will state again that any deployment of 12 or more personnel in a peacekeeping or peace enforcement operation will require a UN mandate as well as Government and Dáil approval in accordance with the triple lock mechanism. This is one of the reasons I brought the issue of the EU battle group to the Dáil recently.</p>

            <p eId="para_552">I am not aware of any war games that the Irish Defence Forces have participated in. I assure the Deputy, again, that our participation has no effect on our traditional policy of military neutrality. I am not aware, so far as I understand, that military training of that type is carried out in any battle group. I actually visited a battle group back in 2012 and I can assure the Deputy that the experience the Irish Defence Forces receive from a battle group, and which they can bring back home, is very beneficial to our military organisation, especially for those members who work with other like-minded countries. I understand the Deputy might have his own concerns, but the term "battle group" is unfortunate as it does send out the wrong message about what it is exactly we are participating in.</p>

            <p eId="para_560">Following a Government decision on 12 May 2015, the Irish Naval Vessel <i>LE Eithne</i> was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea on 16 May 2015 to assist the Italian authorities with the migrant crisis. During 2015 two further vessels were deployed, <i>LE Niamh</i> and <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i>, and the deployment was completed on 29 November 2015, with <i>LE Samuel Beckett</i> arriving back in Ireland on 17 December 2015. During that period, 8,592 people were rescued in the Mediterranean Sea by Irish Naval Service vessels. In addition, the Irish Naval Service provided assistance to 1,144 migrants who were transferred from other vessels onto Irish Naval Service vessels and then transported to safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_561"> The Government, on 6 April 2016, approved the return of an Irish Naval Service vessel to undertake humanitarian search and rescue tasks in the Mediterranean Sea. This deployment will involve naval vessel rotation. Subject to the operational demands and requirements of the mission, it is intended that there will be two rotations, with each deployment lasting approximately 12 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_562"><i>LE Róisín</i> was deployed to the Mediterranean Sea on 1 May 2016 and commenced patrolling in the area of operations on 12 May 2016. To date, <i>LE Róisín</i> has rescued 893 people, bringing the overall total rescued by the Naval Service during 2015 and 2016 to 9,485 people. In addition to the 893 migrants rescued by <i>LE Róisín</i>, assistance was provided to a further 683 migrants who were taken on board from other vessels.</p>
            <p eId="para_563"> The role of the Naval Service vessel is to provide a search and rescue capability and to undertake humanitarian search and rescue operations at sea in the Mediterranean.

            <p eId="para_565">I can assure the Deputy that the members of the Naval Service who are carrying out the rescue operations were trained to a very high standard. If one looked at the work carried out in 2015 and to date in 2016 it would give an overview of exactly the training they have gone through for such an operation. Those involved must be commended on the work they have carried out to date, because it is very difficult. They came across two female fatalities in recent days, which can be very difficult for members. However, I assure the Deputy that the members of the forces are given every assistance and all training required to carry out their work on the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
            <p eId="para_566"> I will conclude by saying that the Irish Naval Service is very well served in the equipment it uses and the vessels it operates. Yesterday I signed off on the commission for a fourth vessel. The UK contractors will start building that fourth ship in the next few weeks. The Government's investment in the Irish Naval Service over the last years is very much to the fore.</p>

            <p eId="para_568">The Deputy will appreciate that the mission will be kept under ongoing review in light of developments in the Mediterranean Sea. There has been a significant decline in the number of migrants attempting to cross the Mediterranean Sea in the last week or two. It is unclear whether this is due to the adverse weather conditions or some other factor, but the current plan is to rotate <i>LE Róisín</i> after three months, which would be until some time around the end of July 2016. Deployment of a second vessel at that stage for a further three months will bring this up to the end of October. In the normal course, with the weather disimproving in the autumn, migrant numbers decline further. I had a briefing yesterday from the Department to the effect that there has been a drop in the number of migrants. However, I understand that on the Mediterranean Sea there is quite bad weather at the moment. That might contribute to the number of migrants rescued over the past while. I assure the Deputy that I, as Minister, very much appreciate the work that has been done, and we will keep the situation under constant review. I believe that all Members of the House, both Opposition and Government, very much appreciate the contribution that members of the Irish Naval Service have made in 2015 and in 2016 to date. They have clearly put the Irish Naval Service on the map.</p>

            <p eId="para_570">As the Deputy will be aware, there is currently no provision in the Defence Acts to allow Reserve Defence Force personnel to be deployed overseas. The White Paper on Defence confirmed that the primary role of the Reserve Defence Force is to augment the Permanent Defence Force in crisis situations and to contribute to State ceremonial events. It was also identified in the White Paper on Defence that there may be professional skills that, on occasion, are not readily available in the Permanent Defence Force.</p>
            <p eId="para_571">Arising from the fact that there may be individual members of the RDF who, by virtue of their professional civilian qualifications, have the competence to undertake such specialised tasks and fill the skills gap, the Government has decided that a panel of such professionally qualified members of the RDF, to be known as the specialist reserve, should be established. In tandem with the establishment of this specialist reserve, my Department will identify the options available to underpin the engagement of its members, whose personal circumstances would allow them to undertake required tasks, including on overseas missions where appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_572"> As part of the implementation plan for the wide range of initiatives relating to the reserve in the White Paper, the Secretary General, in conjunction with the Chief of Staff, will in due course bring forward proposals for the operation of such a scheme.

            <p eId="para_574">The White Paper confirms that the primary role of the reserve is to augment the PDF in times of crisis and to participate in ceremonial events. Within that context, initiatives for the reserve outlined in the White Paper state that the potential to utilise the reserve in a voluntary unpaid capacity will be progressed in consultation with the representative associations and that consideration will be given to activating reserve sub-units for short periods of training with the PDF units or other support tasks. Specialist members of the RDF will be placed on a panel as a specialist reserve and, subject to their availability, will be considered for an option to meet specialist skills shortages. The terms and conditions of membership of the first line reserve will be revised to include capping the length of service for members, reactivating the annual paid leave, and introducing criteria for the retention of an effective member and the case for current gratuity will be examined. Consideration will be given to establishing a database of former members of the Army reserve, Naval Service reserve, first line reserve and PDF who could be called upon to volunteer in a crisis by listing these as an active reserve.</p>

            <p eId="para_575">I thank the Minister of State but he still has not answered my question. When will the specialist reserve be established? In respect of identifying the role of the RDF, three times today the Minister of State has told me the role of the RDF. I served in the RDF for 13 years. I know very well the role of the RDF and do not need to be told it three times.</p>
            <p eId="para_576"> In respect of the skills survey to be undertaken, the Minister of State has said his Department will identify options available to underpin the engagement of the specialist reserve. Has he outlined these options? Has he engaged on the particular task about which he has just spoken? As outlined in the White Paper, the Secretary General in conjunction with the Chief of Staff will bring forward proposals for the operation of a scheme that affords a small number of suitably qualified members of the RDF whose personal circumstances allow them to participate in overseas service. Has the Secretary General brought forward such proposals? </p>

            <p eId="para_581">I thank the Ceann Comhairle’s office for allowing time for this topical issue. I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, is here and I congratulate her on her recent appointment. I am sure she will do an excellent job.</p>
            <p eId="para_582"> Over the past nine months numerous parents in County Kerry have contacted me with concerns about their daughters who have received the human papillomavirus, HPV, vaccination to prevent cervical cancer and who believe that serious side effects have affected their daughters as a result. The number of people who have contacted me leads me to believe this may be more than coincidence, but I cannot say that definitively or prove it. It cannot, however, be disproved.</p>
            <p eId="para_583"> I and Deputy Danny Healy-Rae feel that the parents of these young ladies need to be made aware of the potential side effects, of the cases that have occurred and of the people who have linked this vaccination to their illnesses. I have received responses to parliamentary questions showing that the Department has looked over this, that the European Commission has looked into it and a link cannot be proven. To prove or disprove a link would take a long time and a lot of money. In the meantime, at the very least, parents should be made aware of the number of cases of potential side effects and the number of people potentially affected.</p>

            <p eId="para_584">Will the Minister for Health and the Health Service Executive address the concerns of parents in respect of the side effects supposedly caused by the HPV vaccine drug Gardasil, administered to 12 and 13 year old girls to prevent cervical cancer later in their lives? The Minister for Health should inform parents and create awareness about the possible side effects of this drug. They complain of the lack of aftercare following the administering of the vaccine, that they were not given proper information prior to giving permission for their daughters to receive the vaccine, and that they are not listened to or taken seriously by health officials. The side effects listed after this vaccine are swollen glands, aching muscles, unusual tiredness or weakness, tightening in arms, legs and upper body, becoming less active in sports, attending school less, an inability to concentrate, headaches, joint pain and desire to sleep all day, and lack of energy, even to have a shower. This lack of energy leads to weight gain, which is upsetting for teenage girls and causes depression. We are not doctors and do not have technical knowledge but there is too much of this happening and I met a lot of it when canvassing for the last general election and the council election. It cannot be ignored. This has to be addressed and parents need to be made aware of it.</p>

            <p eId="para_585">I wish to convey the apologies of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to Deputies Griffith, Healy-Rae and Lahart. Unfortunately, he is not able to be here and has asked me to deal with this very important matter. I thank Deputy Griffin for his kind words of congratulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_586"> I thank Deputies Griffin and Healy-Rae for giving me the opportunity to provide an update to the House on this very important issue. The HPV vaccine, which was introduced in 2010, protects girls from cervical cancer when they are adults. It is available free of charge from the HSE for all girls in the first year of secondary school. I am aware of claims of an association between the HPV vaccine and a number of conditions being experienced by a group of young women. I want to provide assurances to them and their families that they are eligible to seek medical attention and to access appropriate health and social care services irrespective of the cause of their symptoms. The HSE is currently developing a care pathway for young people who are experiencing symptoms of this type and will be in a position to facilitate access to specialist services tailored to the needs of each individual.</p>
            <p eId="para_587"> It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the same time that they received the HPV vaccine and understandably some parents have connected the vaccine to their children's condition. I wish to again emphasise why HPV vaccination was introduced in 2010. Each year in Ireland around 300 women are diagnosed with cervical cancer and there are approximately 70 deaths per year. The HPV vaccine protects against two high-risk types of HPV that cause 73% of all cervical cancers. The vaccine used in the school immunisation programme is Gardasil and more than 200,000 girls have received it since its introduction. Gardasil is a fully tested vaccine which was licensed by the European Medicines Agency in 2006. While no medicine, including vaccines, is entirely without risk, the safety profile of Gardasil has been continuously monitored since it was first authorised nationally and at EU level.</p>
            <p eId="para_588"> In November 2015, the European Medicines Agency completed a detailed scientific review of the HPV vaccine. The review, in which the Health Products Regulatory Authority participated, focused on rare reports of two conditions, namely, complex regional pain syndrome and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome. The review found no evidence of a causal link between the vaccine and the two conditions. On 12 January 2016, the European Commission endorsed the conclusion of the European Medicines Agency that there is no need to change the way HPV vaccines are used or to amend the product information, which is now binding in all member states. Health care professionals are advised to continue using HPV vaccines in accordance with the current product information.</p>

            <p eId="para_589">I thank the Minister of State for her response, which is very similar to one I received about two weeks ago to a written parliamentary question. We could argue until the cows come home about whether the vaccine works and what causes the side effects. We will never know. I want to be very clear: I am not advocating for people to avail of or refuse the vaccine. I do not want to be responsible for someone not availing of a vaccine which could save her life down the road. However, it is necessary that people be aware of those who have said they suffered side effects. I feel strongly about this because of the sheer number of people I have met who have linked the vaccine to their side effects. In the case of the MMR vaccine it was proved that there was no link to certain side effects, but that does not mean it is not possible with the HPV vaccine. I ask the Minister of State, who has responsibility for health promotion, to at least make sure that people are fully informed, not just in terms of what the manufacturers have stated but of the number of reported cases of possible links between the vaccine and side effects. The least people deserve is to be fully informed in their decision-making on what they think is right for their daughters or what girls think is right for themselves.</p>

            <p eId="para_590">I ask that proper notification be given to parents in the future about possible side effects. We are not asking the Minister of State to take the drug off the market. Parents need to be given the correct advice when the vaccination programme is taking place in schools. Parents should be notified in advance and allowed to make a decision after highlighting to them the possible or coincidental side effects. I am aware of many cases around east Kerry, Killarney, Farranfore and other places in which vaccinations have changed the lives of girls and their families completely. All we are asking is for parents to be given proper information about the potential side effects.</p>

            <p eId="para_592">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me the opportunity to raise a distressing case. It concerns a constituent of mine, the parent of a young boy who was in touch with me. She has a very young family, all aged under seven years. One of her sons, who is aged five, has had ongoing problems with his tonsils since he was approximately two years of age. He has missed a lot of school and when his tonsils are very sore he gets sick constantly, which can go on for between one and three days depending on the severity of the illness.</p>
            <p eId="para_593"> For a number of years his mother was told a viral infection was to blame, but some weeks ago a family doctor suggested that her son's tonsils needed to be removed. To cut a long story short, she was advised that paying a private ear, nose and throat specialist in a private hospital would speed things up. A tonsil checkup for two of her children cost €350.</p>
            <p eId="para_594"> I have been informed that the specialist suggested that the tonsils need to be removed and that it would cost approximately €3,000 to have the procedure undertaken privately; otherwise, her son would go on a waiting list. The family does not have €3,000. The waiting list in Tallaght hospital is at least one year. The principal of the local school wrote to me and the local hospital to outline the fact that the child has missed a lot of school due to sickness related to tonsillitis. The child is falling behind in school and she is extremely concerned about him. She has other children aged under 7 to care for. </p>
            <p eId="para_595"> I have been in touch with Tallaght Hospital and have received correspondence from its chief executive about the patient. The CEO acknowledged the facts around the case in terms of the waiting time. He said a referral letter for the patient was received and reviewed on 13 April and that the referral was triaged as routine. The current waiting time for a routine referral in the hospital is 17 months. The hospital has recognised that this is an unacceptable length of time for anyone to wait for an appointment. On top of this, the hospital is the only paediatric hospital on the south side of Dublin that is accepting routine ear, nose and throat referrals. Demand for paediatric ear, nose and throat services has increased by 51% over the past two years. Things will only get worse, not just for this child but for many others.</p>
            <p eId="para_596"> The CEO confirmed that he has raised this issue with the HSE and, in fairness, a new paediatric ear, nose and throat consultant was approved, but the successful candidate withdrew from the recruitment process and the job is being re-advertised. In addition to there being no locum available for this position, the paediatric sessions from a recent consultant retirement also remain unfilled. The CEO stated that the children's hospital group has approached the HSE to seek support for an ear, nose and throat waiting list initiative with the private sector and is awaiting a response.</p>
            <p eId="para_597">In conclusion, the CEO said the hospital cannot at this time offer the patient an appointment date, and the hospital apologised for that.</p>
            <p eId="para_598"> I have a few questions for the Minister. Under the supply and confidence arrangement between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, it was agreed that the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, would be reinstated. Does the issue I raised come under the remit of the NTPF? The CEO has approached the HSE to seek support for a waiting list initiative in that regard. Tallaght hospital is part of the Dublin Midlands hospital group. Is there any alternative hospital at which the parent in question can seek to get treatment for her son? It is a shame the Minister cannot be here, but I accept that he is unable to be present. What is his response to the issue and what advice can I, as the local Deputy, give to the distressed parent whose child may have to wait another 17 months, which I am sure the Minister of State will agree is completely unacceptable?</p>

            <p eId="para_599">I thank Deputy Lahart for raising this important issue today and for giving me the opportunity to update the House on it. Tallaght hospital provides a full range of ear, nose and throat, ENT, services, including tonsillectomy services, for both adults and paediatrics, with the exception of paediatric ENT airway management. Within the ENT services, tonsillectomy waiting times are not separately identified but are reported on as part of the ENT service overall. As published by the NTPF, the most recent waiting times for ENT services at Tallaght show 278 children and 321 adults awaiting inpatient or day case treatments. Of those, 87 adults and 64 children have been waiting longer than a year.</p>
            <p eId="para_600"> It is clear that the services are experiencing capacity challenges, which is of great concern to us all. In order to address the challenges, I am advised that the hospital has been working with the HSE in relation to the recruitment of ENT consultants. I am pleased to say that two consultant posts are currently in recruitment to fill vacant posts. One of those is a replacement post, providing both adult and paediatric services, while the second is a new post to provide adult ENT services. A further new paediatric consultant post has been re-advertised following a previously unsuccessful recruitment campaign. The posts, when in place, will improve access to ENT services at Tallaght. The hospital is also implementing other initiatives to optimise the capacity of the existing services, including nurse tonsillectomy triage and nurse-led grommets review clinics in paediatrics.</p>
            <p eId="para_601"> In the health system as a whole there has been a considerable and increasing demand for care. We are now seeing in a year approximately 3.2 million outpatient attendances at hospitals, while 100,000 patients have an elective inpatient procedure and more than 800,000 have a planned day case procedure. Clearly, that has increased pressure on waiting times, as the Deputy will be aware, which means that a sustained commitment to improving waiting times for patients across the health service is urgently needed. That is why the programme for a partnership Government commits to continued investment of €50 million per year specifically for the purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_602"> A scheduled care governance group has been established in the HSE to co-ordinate key initiatives to reduce waiting times and the number of patients awaiting treatment. Actions overseen by the group include driving greater adherence to chronological scheduling, relocation of low-complexity surgical procedures to smaller hospitals and administrative and clinical validation procedures to ensure that patients are available for treatment. In addition, each hospital group has been mandated to designate a key person to lead and support waiting list management improvements in order to advance towards compliance with maximum waiting times.</p>
            <p eId="para_603"> I wish to reassure the House that officials in the Department of Health are working with the NTPF and the HSE to urgently address waiting lists across the health service for those waiting longest. The initiatives will be funded by the annual commitment of €50 million, to which I have already referred. The amount includes ring-fenced funding of €15 million in 2017 for the National Treatment Purchase Fund. That will allow us to balance demand and capacity in acute hospital services, including Tallaght hospital, and utilise primary, social and community care services to support the health of citizens.</p>

            <p eId="para_604">The news is reasonable if one were to take a helicopter view of the situation, but the stark fact is in the first paragraph of the Minister of State's reply - that is, that a total of 64 children have been waiting longer than a year for ENT services. I appreciate that the Minister of State has attempted to respond to some of the issues I raised, including whether there is another hospital within the hospital group in which services can be provided. I accept that efforts are being made by the Minister to relocate some procedures to those hospitals. Could the Minister respond directly to the case I raise? There is no good news specifically for my constituent. I wonder what I will go back and tell the parents of the child in question. I could say X and Y is happening from a macro perspective but there is no good news in terms of the specific child's needs being met immediately. I acknowledge the efforts made by the Minister of State to respond but I request that she speak personally to the Minister for Health. I accept that he would not have been apprised of the specific nature of the individual case when he received notice of the Topical Issue but I would be very grateful if he could examine the matter and respond specifically to the case I raise.</p>

            <p eId="para_606">I thank the Minister of State, Deputy English, for coming to the House to respond. I am sharing my time with my colleague, Deputy Fitzmaurice.</p>
            <p eId="para_607"> On 15 June, last Wednesday, County Roscommon experienced another incident of torrential rain, which was also experienced in parts of some adjoining counties, including County Westmeath, where I was driving at the time and had to pull over. The heavy deluge of rain caused widespread damage to a number of homes, roads and bridges, especially in areas such as Curraghroe, Scramogue, Culliagh and Doughill, which were badly affected.</p>
            <p eId="para_608"> Flash floods have affected many communities that are just trying to recover from the heavy rainfall of 2015 and early 2016. Late on Wednesday night I spent two hours visiting my neighbours and friends in the region. At least half a dozen houses were quite badly affected in that kitchens, back kitchens, bathrooms and materials in them were damaged. It is a nightmare situation for families and it is not the first time we have faced such difficulties in County Roscommon. I am a resident of the area and my home was affected, but thankfully we kept the water from getting in the door. It took a huge effort. Those who witnessed the rain said it was the worst they had ever seen. Reports from Met Éireann suggest it was the heaviest rainfall on record, but that has not been clarified.</p>
            <p eId="para_609"> In addition, water has flowed down from Sliabh Bán, where Coillte is involved in a wind farm development. Even though the wind farm got full planning permission and the go-ahead from An Bord Pleanála, local people are concerned about what might be happening there. I do not wish to take up any more time, as I wish to give time to my colleague. I call on the Minister of State to address the issue and to assure me that everything has been checked to make sure the inflow of water is not due to drainage issues on Sliabh Bán.</p>

            <p eId="para_610">As Deputy Eugene Murphy stated, a tsunami of water came down from Sliabh Bán last Thursday evening. In fairness, the council was contacted that evening but one road was taken out completely, houses were flooded, as the Deputy also has noted, and there was chaos in the area. Since then, no one from Coillte has visited the people who were affected by this event and I understand it could be another day or two before that happens. There are many questions to be answered. I walked that mountain last Sunday and while it was stated that one cannot go up the mountain or whatever, I went up through the trees and walked it. Members must read the planning that is involved and to be frank, enforcement must be considered because while the Deputy is correct to state there was a lot of rain, part of that planning refers to events that happen once every 100 years and the amount of rain that was accounted for the other evening was far from that mark. I have video footage and photographs of it and it broke the banks. It came down through the trees and went straight down the mountain. Were one to examine the planning that was meant to have been put in place, one would conclude that attenuation tanks must be placed in dangerous areas right around that mountain or people will live in fear. An 82-year-old woman is unable to enter her house, and silt has gone down through drains for approximately one mile. Farmers' meadows have been blown to the ground. Water came down the main road from up that mountain. Under health and safety and building regulations, there is a responsibility on any site to contain whatever water comes onto it and I seek the proper enforcement of this responsibility. This is the biggest building site in County Roscommon and it must be done right because the people in the area cannot lie in their beds at night in fear of a repeat of what happened the other evening.</p>

            <p eId="para_611">I thank both Deputies for raising this important issue. I got a chance to view the footage of the flooding in County Roscommon through the RTE website and I could see the devastation caused to families and their homes, as well as to the surrounding land. There is no doubt that nothing worse can happen than being flooded, and plenty of Members present have experienced this in recent years. It certainly is devastating and the Deputies are correct that all steps needed to prevent this must be implemented across whatever Departments or county councils are involved. It is as simple as that and everything that must be done to prevent a recurrence undoubtedly must happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_612"> As for my involvement and that of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, through the Department, I wish to take this opportunity to outline the provisions of the planning code in respect of development in general and of Deputy Coveney's role as Minister. Proposals for wind energy developments are subject to the statutory requirements of the Planning and Development Acts 2001 to 2015, as amended, and the planning and development regulations made under the Acts in the same manner as other proposed developments. Planning applications are generally made to the relevant local planning authority with a right of appeal to An Bord Pleanála. However, in the case of wind development proposals such as this one, which meet the statutory threshold criteria for classification as strategic infrastructure developments under the Planning and Development Act, such applications are required to be submitted directly to An Bord Pleanála. There is a compulsory requirement, however, to undertake an environmental impact assessment in respect of wind farm development projects of a certain scale, that is, if they consist of five or more turbines or have a power output greater than 5 MW. This ensures that all environmental impacts, including potential hydrological impacts, of a proposed development are fully considered and assessed prior to the making of determinations on individual planning applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_613"> Planning authorities, including An Bord Pleanála, are further required to have regard to relevant planning guidelines issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000. These include the Department's wind energy development guidelines, which were published in June 2006 and which provide advice to planning authorities on catering for wind energy development through the development plan process, as well as in assessing individual wind farm development proposals and all their effects on the surrounding area. Furthermore, the planning system and planning guidelines on flood risk management published in November 2009 are designed to ensure that where relevant, flood risk is a key consideration in both the preparation of local authority development plans and local area plans and in the assessment of individual planning applications which may have a flooding risk. In this regard, it is a matter for the relevant planning authority to make the appropriate determination on a planning application or appeal having regard to relevant planning guidelines issued by the Department. These guidelines are issued for guidance purposes to assist planning authorities in the performance of their functions. Ultimately, planning authorities, be they the local planning authority or An Bord Pleanála, will make their own decision based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_614"> The role of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, with regard to the planning system is primarily to provide the policy and legislative framework which comprises the Planning and Development Act, the planning and development regulations and a suite of planning guidelines to which, as I have outlined, planning authorities and An Bord Pleanála are obliged to have regard in the exercise of their statutory planning functions. The day-to-day operation of the planning system is, however, a matter for the planning authorities themselves. Furthermore, under section 30 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, the Minister is specifically precluded from exercising any power or control in respect of any particular case with which a planning authority or An Bord Pleanála is or may be concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_615"> On the matter of flooding, my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works, OPW, and flood relief, Deputy Canney, has lead and primary responsibility for the co-ordination and implementation of Government policy on the management of flood risk. The core strategy for addressing the significant flood risks nationally is the OPW's catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, programme, which I understand is being taken forward in partnership with the local authorities at present. In this connection, I am informed that approximately 300 locations nationwide that are being assessed under the programme have been designated to be at potentially significant flood risk. This programme also has been discussed with Deputies at other stages. This involves flood mapping for each of these 300 locations, the development of preliminary flood risk management options and ultimately, the production of flood risk management plans. This programme of draft flood mapping is now in the process of being finalised following completion of the national statutory public consultation phase on 23 December 2015 and work on the options to address flood risk in these locations is under way at present. I am unsure whether the area in question is part of that process but this is a matter Deputies certainly could raise directly with the relevant Ministers and authorities.</p>

            <p eId="para_617">I wish to make one further point and will cut it short. I should also point out in this regard that the priority being attached to addressing flooding generally is reflected in the Government's capital investment plan, which includes a significant increase in the levels of investment in the area of flood relief. Ministers are meeting on a cross-departmental basis to ascertain whether there is a way to fast-track and to spend this investment and the Minister of State sitting to my right, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, also has been involved in those meetings to try to free up resources where they are needed.</p>
            <p eId="para_618"> With regard to local flooding issues, including those in County Roscommon raised today by Deputies Eugene Murphy and Fitzmaurice, these are a matter in the first instance for each local authority to investigate and address. Local authorities are empowered to carry out flood mitigation works using their own resources where appropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_619"> To conclude, the OPW also funds local authorities for small-scale flood relief studies and works up to a cost limit of €500,000 under the minor flood mitigation works scheme. All applications received under this scheme are assessed under the scheme's eligibility criteria, which include a requirement that all measures are cost-beneficial, having regard to the overall availability of funding.</p>

I also can reveal that today, and I believe yesterday, Coillte did start meeting the people on an individual basis. However Deputy Fitzmaurice is correct in his observations on what happened. I have lived in that area for all my life and certainly never have seen any such devastation in my lifetime previously. While it would be wrong and wild to make any allegations against anyone this evening, as Deputies we wish to ensure that everything that must be done under the Planning and Development Acts 2001 to 2015 is carried out. At present in County Roscommon, I am informed that 133 locations are in difficulty with flooding. The amount of money needed to deal with them is €11 million but €4.9 million has been received from the Department and then this event has taken place on top of it. My mother grew up in that area and has seen flooding down through the years. Her family has been there for generations-----</p>

            <p eId="para_627">It must be remembered that submissions were made before this project went ahead, and it was noted at T15 that there may be a risk of flooding at one of the places on the site. The reality is that people have been flooded in their houses, Coillte is ducking and diving at present and people do not know whether to draw down insurance. The point is that were they to draw down their insurance, they would not get insurance again. This is what is going on in the area, and I will stand up and be counted. I went up that mountain the other day. I am from a construction background and I will state clearly that if one takes out 40 ha or 50 ha of trees, if one puts in place 25 m roads and if one brings some of these roads to areas such as those that were earmarked in submissions as being in danger of flooding, one increases the risk.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">It was put into the plan that up to 85 mm of rain needed to be accounted for in areas. We did not have that. That is guaranteed. However, it was not contained on the site and that is the bottom line. There is now silt down the drains. There is a council road completely busted out of it. Someone has to account for it. We need the council to carry out enforcement on this because what has gone on is intolerable.</p>

            <p eId="para_629">I think it is quite clear. Naturally, any planning application judge has to assess all the associated procedures to ensure that all the environmental impacts, including any potential hydrological impacts, are fully considered and assessed in the consideration of individual planning applications. I can only assume that was done. It should have been done. The regulations are there. That is why they are put in place and what the policy is there for. There is local authority planning and there is An Bord Pleanála and it is their job to follow through on procedures. I agree with the Deputy. They need to investigate whether every planning procedure and regulation was followed and whether every condition was adhered to. Deputy Fitzmaurice raised the conditions in this case. Naturally, if one is going to have any construction in an area it is going to have a knock-on effect. That has to be fully investigated. That is what planning laws are there for. That is what the Department is very proactive about.</p>
            <p eId="para_630"> It is a local conversation. From what I can see, if Coillte is involved in discussions, I do not know if the site affects it or not. It is alleged that there are impacts from wind farms on localised flooding in Roscommon. From what I have seen, Coillte is dealing with the local authority to see if its site is in any way involved. It will take corrective action where necessary. Deputy Fitzmaurice has specific planning details and I hope he liaises with the local authority, which is in charge of enforcement. Local authorities have a budget for enforcement. That is their job. As a Minister of State in this Department, I feel very strongly that we have to have enforcement. It is something we have to have. There is no point in having planning laws if we do not enforce them.</p>
            <p eId="para_631"> Ultimately, as I have outlined, it is a matter for the relevant planning authority to make the appropriate determination with regard to a planning application or appeal, having regard to relevant planning guidelines issued by the Department based on the specific merits or otherwise of individual planning applications. The Minister is specifically excluded from exercising any power or control with regard to any particular case, but it is important that all regulations are checked and enforced. On the matter raised by Deputies Murphy and Fitzmaurice regarding flooding in Roscommon, my colleague, the Minister of State with special responsibility for the OPW, Deputy Seán Canney, has lead responsibility and is working on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_632"> Much work was carried out on the CFRAM process and we discussed it on many other occasions as well. Very often, there are simple solutions. The Deputy said that most of the cases in Roscommon would cost about €11 million. Over half a billion euro has been allocated to be spent on flood relief over the next three or four years. That needs to be spent as quickly as possible and we need to work with locals on the ground to spend it and not have any delays.</p>
            <p eId="para_633"> We have the term "one-hundred-year flood." That is possibly going to change. We have had a lot of rainfall this year and we are well ahead of once in 100 years. I assume that all involved in flood relief prevention measures for the future are updating the technology and information in conjunction with our weather services. I imagine that is happening. I will certainly check that, because the one-hundred-year event is becoming too common.</p>

            <p eId="para_634">I have been raising an issue with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, for quite some time now, seeking to get accurate information on the macro-prudential limits on mortgage lending that were introduced by the Central Bank on 9 February 2015. Obviously, the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is aware that the Central Bank called for submissions last week with regard to the review it is carrying out on these limits, as well as submissions on the loan-to-value and loan-to-income limits that it introduced. I ask the Minister to facilitate the publication of the most important evidence there is of the working of these rules, which is the amount of leeway on loan-to-income and loan-to-value that the rules allow for that the banks are actually using. That is critical. Under the existing rules, 15% of qualifying loans can be dealt with as exemptions from the loan-to-value limit and 20% as exemptions from loan-to-income limit. What does this mean? It means, if one looks at AIB as an example, that AIB could have issued €400 million worth of mortgages in 2015 that did not comply with the loan-to-income rules. That is what 20% of their mortgage lending would have been. It would have been about €300 million if it was solely on loan-to-value.</p>
            <p eId="para_635"> What we need to know is whether this flexibility that is built into the rules is being used by the financial institutions and whether it is being completely used. They are sensible rules in my view and should be used to the maximum of their ability in terms of the exceptions that are there. In my view, it is those on lower incomes whom the rules narrowly disqualify, rather than a large number of bigger loans, who should be availing of these exceptions. Thanks to my persistence in seeking replies to parliamentary questions, we see that 11% of the qualifying loans issued by Permanent TSB in 2015 were under the loan-to-value exception, while the Central Bank rules allow for 15%. The Minister has refused to direct AIB to publish its figures. I cannot see why that is the case, because we need all of the information available. Both Permanent TSB and AIB should be publishing these figures in a way that is very easily digestible to the public and that can feed into the review by the wider public and by Members of this House in terms of the evidence-based review that the Central Bank has called for. As long as these figures are unpublished, there must be questions about whether the banks are simply using the rules or whether they are hiding behind the rules and the real problem is that they are simply not lending. We will not know that until we know that they are using the 20% exception on loan-to-income ratios and the 15% exception on loan-to-value ratios to the maximum ability and that they are using them for a large number of people on low incomes instead of for the bigger loans, which would use up a lot of the percentage base.</p>
            <p eId="para_636"> There can be no evidence-based submission without evidence. That is what goes to the core of this issue. We need to be empowered with regard to making an accurate submission. I do not see how I could make a submission not knowing if this exemption is being used or not. If the Central Bank does not want to be accused of running a sham exercise, it must work with the Department of Finance to release these figures. Following the Minister's refusal when I asked again that he direct AIB to release these figures, I wrote directly to the Central Bank and it provided an ambiguous reply saying that it had obligations under section 33AK and EU law, but it went on to suggest that it would publish the figures that I am calling for now so that we can feed into an evidence-based review. The Central Bank says it will publish the figures after the review and the submissions are concluded. I ask the Minister of State if he will facilitate me and anybody else who wishes to have an input into this important review by supplying a crucial part of the evidence, which is whether the banks are using the exceptions that are available to them.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Eoghan Murphy)<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T19:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_637">I thank the Deputy for raising the issue and I am aware of his interest and persistence on this matter. I am glad that he acknowledges that the rules are sensible.</p>
            <p eId="para_638"> The Central Bank's macro-prudential limits on mortgage lending came into effect on 9 February 2015. The policy sets restrictions on the loan-to-value, LTV, and the loan-to-income, LTI, ratios on products that can be offered by mortgage providers. The Central Bank has an independent mandate to promote and protect financial stability and these residential mortgage lending macro-prudential measures were put in place by the Central Bank with the objective of increasing the financial resilience of the banking and household sectors and reducing the risk of bank credit and house price spirals in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_639"> There are a number of exemptions allowed for within the Central Bank guidelines - for example, for mortgage switchers or forbearance cases. The banks are at liberty to use these exceptions to the extent they see fit and will likely do so with consideration to their risk appetite, lending policies and overall strategy. The measures provide that residential mortgage loan approvals issued after 9 February 2015 will be subject to specified LTV and LTI restrictions. Any mortgage loans sanctioned prior to that date are not affected by the new rules even where the mortgage is drawn down after 9 February.</p>
            <p eId="para_640"> Subject to certain exceptions, the restrictions that apply to mortgage lending are: a maximum LTV mortgage of 80% of the value of a principal dwelling house for non-first-time buyers; a maximum mortgage LTV of 90% for a property valued up to €220,000 for first-time buyers, subject to an 80% LTV on any excess value above that amount; a limit of 70% LTV on buy-to-let mortgages; and an LTI limitation of three and a half times a gross annual income for loans only.</p>
            <p eId="para_641"> Certain other types of primary home residential lending fall outside the scope of the new rules. The LTV and LTI limits do not apply to the refinancing of housing loans, switcher mortgages or housing loans entered into in order to address arrears or pre-arrears. Housing loans for borrowers in negative equity who wish to obtain a mortgage for a new property are not in the scope of the LTV limits. However, lenders can exceed the above LTV and LTI thresholds in respect of a certain limited proportion of the overall amount of residential lending, as the Deputy has pointed out. For primary home mortgage lending, up to 15% of new lending as drawn down can exceed the LTV threshold limits in an annual period and up to 20% of new lending can exceed the LTI threshold.</p>
            <p eId="para_642"> The decision of a bank to utilise some or all of these exemption thresholds or not is a commercial matter for individual banks, subject to compliance with consumer protection rules and having assessed loan applications on a case-by-case basis. The banks, therefore, are at liberty to use these exemption discretions as they see fit and will likely do so with consideration to their risk appetite, lending policies and overall strategy. The macro-prudential limits on mortgage lending are designed, implemented and monitored by the Central Bank in its role as regulator of the Irish banking sector, and therefore fall outside the remit of the Minister for Finance. Lenders are required to make regulatory returns to the Central Bank on the lending they make which falls within the scope of the macro-prudential regulations. These returns are provided on a six-monthly basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_643"> The Central Bank has not provided information on such regulatory returns on an individual institution basis; neither has it provided, at least so far, aggregated data on this matter for public information and there is no regulatory requirement for any bank to publicly disclose the value of approved mortgages that are exceptions to the macro-prudential limits. However, in the context of the upcoming review of the macro-prudential rules, officials in the Department will write to the Central Bank to suggest that it would be helpful if the Central Bank could make available aggregated data on mortgage lending since the macro-prudential rules came into operation. This data, if available, would assist respondents in making evidence-based submissions to the Central Bank's consultation process.</p>
            <p eId="para_644"> The Minister for Finance's role, as set out in the relationship framework agreements with the banks in which the State is a shareholder, does not involve him in the relationship between the banks and their regulator. It would therefore be inappropriate, and beyond his remit, for him to direct an individual credit institution to disclose the information sought by the Deputy. The Central Bank has indicated that, while the general framework of mortgage rules is intended to be a permanent feature, arising from this forthcoming review the calibration of these rules can be tightened, loosened or left unchanged in response to its analysis of the operation of these rules from inception through summer 2016. However, it has cautioned that, given the value of a stable rules-based system, any changes to the existing measures will require a high evidence threshold.</p>
            <p eId="para_645"> As laid out in the programme for Government, the Department of Finance will work with the Central Bank in the context of the review of the mortgage lending limits and, as indicated, officials will also engage with the Central Bank on the availability of data to assist the public consultation process. On a more general point, despite concerns that the macro-prudential measures would impact on the level of lending in 2015, data indicate that new residential mortgage lending amounted to almost €4.9 billion in 2015. This represented an increase of 26% on the 2014 new residential mortgage lending figure of €3.9 billion.</p>

            <p eId="para_646">I welcome that the Minister will write a letter to the Central Bank asking it to do exactly as I asked it to do in a previous letter. The Minister mentioned the "data, if available"; he knows the data is available. These are the rules the banks must abide by, and every quarter they cannot exceed 15% or 20% of the exceptions. The data is available. They must have it, record it and report it to the Central Bank.</p>
            <p eId="para_647"> Permanent TSB included the data in its financial returns. Permanent TSB gave the data to the Minister for Finance and he put it on the record of the Dáil. The Minister for Finance is the major, and almost only, shareholder in AIB. While one can look for aggregated data relating to other financial institutions, where we have a 99% shareholding in an institution we should be at least saying, if not directing, that it would be helpful if the bank we own tells us whether it is using the 15% exceptions under loan-to-value and the 20% exceptions under loan-to-income to the full of its ability. This could potentially be €400 million of mortgage lending that could be provided if it is not using it. However, we do not know; we are in the dark. Then we have political parties scurrying about and suggesting that we might introduce measures whereby the Exchequer would pay €1 for every €2 that individuals save, because they are finding it difficult to meet the loan-to-value targets, when we do not know whether the banks are using the exceptions that are allowed for under the rules.</p>
            <p eId="para_648"> We must have some straight talking. Before taking office the Minister was known as a person who talks straight so I hope he will say that it would be helpful if AIB would give the information to the House, as Permanent TSB has, as to whether it is using the leeway provided under the rules. We can deduce from the information Permanent TSB has provided that it is not using the leeway. It is only using 11%. Therefore, what are we doing about the major problem here? People are being frustrated as a result of these rules. They cannot get mortgages because the rules are putting such a constriction on them and we are thinking about coming up with policies that would help them fulfil the rules. I ask the Minister to go beyond writing a letter to the Central Bank. We have already asked for that, and I welcome that a letter is being sent. However, I ask the Minister at least to make a statement saying that AIB should provide the same type of information that Permanent TSB has provided.</p>

Permanent TSB can disclose information if it chooses to do so. That is its choice. However, there is no regulatory requirement on other banks to disclose this publicly. There is a requirement on them to make such returns to the Central Bank. Under the relationship framework agreements with the banks in which we are shareholders, we cannot interfere. We cannot get involved in the relationship between the banks and the Central Bank as regulator, so it would be inappropriate for us to get involved as the Deputy is requesting and to direct them in this manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_651"> However, the forthcoming review is very important. To ensure we can have an evidence-based approach for this House and the public feeding into what the Central Bank is doing as part of that review, it is important that the Department writes to see if it can get the aggregated data from the Central Bank and to suggest that it might be published, because it would be helpful for making submissions to that review and playing a part in it. Of course, it is within the remit of this Chamber through the Oireachtas committees to engage with the Central Bank on this issue, not only under section 33AK but also section 33AM of the relevant Acts, and to have that debate with it directly.</p>
            <p eId="para_652"> It is also important to note, as I mentioned earlier, that mortgage lending has increased since these rules came into effect. Furthermore, these exceptions are not targets. It is for the banks, according to their risk appetite and what they think is prudent in terms of managing their loan books, to allow exceptions under the two criteria where they think it is appropriate and where it makes sense in the overall managing of their loan books. What we do not want is for a bank, where it was imprudent or improper to go to these full exceptions, to do so and put other lending and other customers at risk. We have seen that previously and we have seen its negative consequences.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_654">That Dáil Éireann:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_655">notes:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_656">— the steady increase of charges for waste collection and the removal of waivers since the privatisation of waste management;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_657">— the recent outrageous plans to increase the standing charges for the collection of household waste that are proposed by many private waste management companies;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_658">— the severe hardship these rises will inflict on many households and families, particularly the disabled and those on low incomes; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_659">— the dramatic increase in numbers of households reducing, reusing and recycling over recent years and that the plans to increase these charges flies in the face of the so-called "polluter pays" principle;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_660">calls on the Government to:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_661">— immediately take action to prevent private waste management companies from implementing the planned increases;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_662">— ensure that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government meets with the said companies as a matter of urgency;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_663">— ensure that standing charges cannot be increased out of line with the consumer price index;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_664">— implement rules for maximum pay by weight charges of 11 cent for residual household kerbside waste, 6 cent for food and bio waste and zero cent for recyclables per kilo; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_665">— reinstate waivers for pensioners, disabled persons, carers, all those whose primary income comes from social welfare payments and low-paid workers in receipt of family income supplement;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_666">and makes the following changes to page 13, item (III) in section 20 "Other conditions to be attached to waste collection permits" of S.I. No. 24 of 2016:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_667">— delete "not less than" and replace with "not greater than"; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_668">— insert "and also ensure that any fixed or standing charge does not increase in any one year by an amount any greater than the consumer price index as calculated by the Central Statistics Office" after "of the Act"’.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">This the first Private Members' business for the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit and we considered it most appropriate to raise this issue. In the space of two weeks, after I first mentioned it, the issue has become a national hot potato for the Government. Indeed, it is probably a very good example of the type of Government we have, which is one of obfuscation, suspension and one that fears mass movements and people power. The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Coveney, said a week ago that it did not need another protest movement on the streets, such as the water charges movement. That is exactly what it would get if it did not deal with this issue. An amendment to the motion has been tabled by the Right2Change Deputies which we are happy to accept. There is also an amendment tabled by the Government which I will discuss comprehensively shortly.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> First I refer to the news today that the Government and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, have met with the waste management industry and worked out an agreement which will freeze the bin charges for a year and, through transparency in waste bills over a period of time and a big education campaign, the population will be won over and convinced that it is a great way to go and that it must be done to control the waste management industry. My first response is that we have included in the motion a form of secondary legislation which we are asking the House to pass. The reason is that we do not have an iota of belief in a gentlemen's agreement with an industry which does not contain a single gentleman.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">As a result that gentlemen's agreement will not be worth the paper it is written on. Instead, we need some kind of legislation that puts a cap on the annual charge, or the service charge, as it is sometimes called; that puts a maximum on pay by weight instead of having a minimum for the pay by weight structures in the last statutory instrument; and that reinstates waivers not just for recipients of HSE payments who need nappies, etc., but all disabled persons, pensioners, carers, those whose primary income comes from social welfare and low-paid workers who rely on the family income supplement. We think this important.</p>
          <p eId="para_672"> I went to prison over the bin charges along with 24 or 25 others. I did not go there for the craic. I went there because we were protesting day and night and firmly believed that the reason we needed to step back from the charges was because it would lead to privatisation. What we are witnessing is another Irish Water debacle because that is exactly what would have happened with water had it gone through. Instead of that, we are at the point where this Government is in crisis because of the threat of privatisation of an essential service. The Government is suspending the implementation of the new bin charges, it has become a Government of suspensions. I include the support of Fianna Fáil in that if it votes to back the Government on this on Thursday. Its role will then be shown up as being akin to the role of Fine Gael rather than something separate. </p>
          <p eId="para_673"> We want binding legislation imposed on the waste management industry. In this regard we hope the Government amendment will be defeated. The Government talks about looking at a commitment to a public awareness campaign for the first half of 2016. The commitment that the Government would have a public awareness campaign was given in late 2014 but, of course, it backed off from that because of the number of people on the streets fighting against Irish Water. It is now revisiting that in the hope that people will be sold the lie that pay by weight is the only way to go. In its amendment, the Government has completely ignored that Thorntons has increased the standing charge by 100% while Greyhound has increased it by up by 200%. I have e-mails from people in other parts of Ireland, including Tipperary, which I am sure Deputy Healy will talk about later, where the standing charge has increased by 400%. Can the Minister deal with the question of the standing charge because the Government amendment does not contain a single reference to it? It is all about pay by weight and nothing else. </p>
          <p eId="para_674"> There is another element in the Government amendment that is very worrying. It says that a price freeze for customers for the next 12 months based on their current pricing plans is agreed by the industry. What about young people or anybody who is not on a plan at the moment but who joins a plan within the next 12 months? That is not spelled out. Is the Minister telling us that what is contained here is further discrimination against young people because it is most likely to be young people who are buying a home for the first time, as distinct from renting, who will be the ones who are bound to take up a contract with the waste management companies? We need that spelled out. Will those who will enter into a contract in the next 12 months be penalised and treated differently to the rest of the population who are currently on contracts? </p>
          <p eId="para_675"> The last point to note about the Government amendment is that it relies on a commitment from the waste management industry. There is a series of questions to be asked about this industry. I live in Ballyfermot. A big company called Thorntons operates at the back of where I live. Thorntons bales all the food waste from all of the McDonald's restaurants, hospitals and college canteens in the Dublin area. Thorntons has spent quite a bit of money trying to deal with the pollution that this causes but it has not fully addressed it. Every time we complain to the EPA, we get fobbed off. I have received dozens of e-mails from people as far as Kilconnell in County Galway where Greenstar has left a complete mess of environmental destruction and it is the local authority that is spending the money to clean it up. One could look at Panda in County Meath where the local population has been campaigning to stop a major pollutant being built in its area.</p>
          <p eId="para_676"> A recent edition of "Prime Time" on Indaver in County Kildare showed how this industry is is unaccountable and out of control and is not managed or curtailed by the Government in any way. It is now pushing up the prices for the ordinary consumer by an extraordinary amount and there is no reference to it in the Government amendment or the Minister's public statements. The Minister wants us to sit back and look at how pay by weight might work out but he will not deal through legislation with what amounts to a cowboy industry that has been completely out of control. A total of 41 companies are signed up to the Irish Waste Management Association. This is a small country. One has to ask why are 41 companies are getting in on the act. It is because they are making vast profits. Most of them are registered offshore. We cannot see what are their profits or the tax they pay yet they are coming after the taxpayer to deepen and increase the size of their pockets.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> I ask the Minister and the rest of the House to support this motion and the amendment by Independents4Change because in the immediate term, we need to control these cowboys and stop these charges being implemented. In the long run we must examine the waste management industry in this country, its legacy, what it is up to and where it is going. We need to appoint a regulator and, as I said to the Taoiseach a week ago, a committee to sit on these people and this issue and make sure our society is dealt with in an environmentally friendly way and that the cost is not passed on to those who can least afford it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mick Barry<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T20:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_678">One could say a lot about the events of the last week. One thing one could say is that it has been a shambles from the point of view of the Government. The Minister, who is charged with responsibility for the housing emergency and who should be devoting every minute of every day to addressing it, has had to put it on the back burner and run around trying to sort out a crisis in respect of bins that is of his party and Government's making.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> The last week has also been interesting in that it has revealed who this Government and previous Governments have allowed to take control of the vital bin service industry. These are companies who were prepared to ruthlessly exploit the opportunity offered by the opening of the pay-by-weight window to double prices in some cases and treble them in others and in doing so, to hurt the old, the sick and those on low incomes. If the Government and the Minister attempt tonight to offer a version of "move along now, nothing to see", it will not wash because these events show the need to open up a debate about what is the best way to organise waste services in this State. Something is clearly very wrong with the way they are operating at the moment and change is needed but what change? </p>
          <p eId="para_680"> The Government is operating a crazy model of privatisation. To the best of my knowledge, there is no other country in Europe, apart from Poland, that organises its waste services the way they are organised in this country. It is a model that was consciously chosen by Fine Gael in alliance with Labour in the last Government. Yesterday's report in <i>The Irish Times</i> showed that this was consciously chosen in 2011 when preplanning was taking place for the introduction of pay by weight. At that time, the Government considered and weighed two alternatives. The other alternative was also a privatisation model but one with a greater element of State regulation. It would have meant local authorities having a <i>de facto</i> licence with a competition whereby the service would be franchised out to one operator in a local authority area. That is the model that is used in most European countries. <i>The Irish Times</i> said that in Finland, it produced savings for consumers of up 40%. Fine Gael consciously rejected that model. According to reports, it did so after being lobbied by the Irish Waste Management Association.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">The former Minister, Phil Hogan, as well as being Minister for water charges was Minister for introducing this crazy model of privatisation. The Taoiseach hinted, in his contribution in the House today, that he might consider going for an alternative model along the lines sketched out there with regard to the local authorities but it is too late for that now. The bin service operators, who are known for having trampled on workers' rights and for having ripped up waiver schemes, have revealed themselves to a greater extent than ever before as ruthless profiteers who are probably operating a cartel. It begs the question as to why on earth the Government would allow companies like this maintain control over this vital service in the State. It would be far better to reverse the privatisation programme entirely, give control of bin services back to the local authorities and scratch the bin charges altogether. The Minister would no doubt ask where we would get the money to finance this. There would be very significant savings to be made on the bill picked up by the taxpayer every year for cleaning up illegal dumping. When I was a member of Cork City Council, I was told by senior officials in the environment department that there was a more than tenfold increase in the level of illegal dumping at the time that charges were introduced. This is a hidden cost of privatisation and of bin charges and a form of corporate welfare. It is money which would make a significant contribution towards a publicly owned bin service run by the local authorities. </p>
          <p eId="para_682"> I will focus in my concluding remarks on the issue of wages and conditions in the industry. These workers provide a vital service in society. If bins were not lifted for one week or two weeks, one would see just how vital that work is. It is a story of capitalism, red in tooth and claw and it is not a pretty picture. The average work week for many workers in this industry is 50 to 60 hours a week and it is not unknown for some to work 70 hours a week. After tax, many drivers bring home less than €400 a week and in the case of many operators not much more than €300. A large percentage of the workforce does not receive overtime, sick pay, holiday pay and is organised through agencies. A reasonably fit worker should be able to move 600 to 700 bins in a ten-hour day but workers are being asked to move double that - 1,400 bins a day. It is not possible to do that pushing one bin at a time, which is best practice, so two bins at a time is what is done. There are significant health and safety implications, particularly towards the end of a shift because people are tired, particularly in two-man crews which should be three-man crews. As a result, injury is common and death is not unknown. A lot of this work is put on the shoulders of immigrant workers. Already this year, there have probably been tens of thousands of workers farmed out to the industry through the agencies. Many of the workers last in the job for two, three or four weeks. They cannot maintain it for much longer than that, so there is a huge churn. The Minister met the Irish Waste Management Association but he would do well to meet the workers who work in the trade. If he listened to them, it might open his eyes to the real scandal that is going on in this industry in terms of wages and conditions, which is something that needs to be seriously addressed. </p>

          <p eId="para_683">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' motion. I support the motion tabled by the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit and also support the amendment in the name of the Independents 4 Change which calls for a commission of investigation to examine the waste industry and to explore the potential for local authorities to re-enter the waste collection services.</p>
          <p eId="para_684"> This pay-by-weight bin charges fiasco is yet another spectacular own goal by the former Labour Party Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly. It was not enough to have the debacle of the whole domestic water charges business but the former Minister has now followed that up with another spectacular own goal. The current Minister has announced today that he intends to freeze this pay-by-weight system for the next 12 months. That is simply not good enough - this proposal must be annulled. I hope the proposal in the Seanad later this week will be successful because the whole area of domestic waste charges is a huge rip off of ordinary people right across this country. One has to ask what the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, has promised the waste companies from July 2017 on? I believe they have been promised that they can charge what they like. That is something that ordinary families, already put to the pin of their collar by all sorts of other stealth charges-----</p>

          <p eId="para_686">-----will simply not be able to bear and are not able to bear now. These waste collection firms have used this pay-by-weight system and the privatisation of the services to ensure they have gouged the public and ordinary families. Families with young children, who of necessity produce a lot of waste, are particularly disadvantaged by the whole pay-by-weight system and so too are elderly people who are ill. Carers are particularly disadvantaged as well. It is simply not good enough that in the Minister's amendment tonight he talks about a waiver for the 60,000 Health Service Executive patients supplied with incontinence wear. What about carers, people on basic social welfare incomes, people on low incomes and families with young children? What about large families who are particularly hit by these charges? There should be a waiver for all these categories not just the ones referred to by the Minister. The provision of domestic waste services by local authorities should recommence. At least in that situation, there are public representatives who can have an input into the particular service.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> I support the motion and the amendment by the Independents 4 Change. I call for a real waiver system and for us to ensure that local authorities re-enter this market and that the huge increases in standing charges be stopped forthwith.</p>

          <p eId="para_688">I move amendment No. 2:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_689">To delete all words after “Dáil Éireann” and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_690">“supports the introduction of pay-by-weight charging for household waste collection from 1st July, as the most effective and proven means of managing and segregating household waste, in line with the polluter pays principle, to reduce residual waste going to landfills but also to give households more control over their waste costs, by incentivising people to reuse, recycle and compost better, and providing for more transparency in charging by service providers;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_691">welcomes the following arrangements agreed between the Government and the waste industry to facilitate the effective roll-out of pay-by-weight charging:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_692">— a price freeze for customers for the next 12 months on the basis of their current pricing plans;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_693">— during the second half of 2016, the Government and the waste industry are committed to an intensive public awareness, information and promotion campaign to promote the benefits of the pay-by-weight charging model, support customers in understanding how they can change their waste management behaviour and manage better their waste costs under the pay-by-weight system;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_694">— no later than 1st January, 2017, customers will receive a dual pricing bill listing the amount of waste they are disposing of, their costs under their current price plan and details of the comparative pay-by-weight charge, and they will be given the option to transition, should they so choose, to pay-by-weight charging or to remain on their current price plan; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_695">— after the transitional 12 months, the operation of pay-by-weight and of the wider waste market will be reviewed to inform decisions in relation to the arrangements beyond 1st July, 2017;</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_696">notes the Government’s intention, in advance of 1st July, to underpin the requirements regarding provision of comparative billing information and the pay-by-weight opt-in arrangements through amendments to the relevant Statutory Instrument, and the intention to keep the operation of the price freeze under review, with further legislative intervention being considered, as necessary; and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_697">acknowledges the commitment of the waste industry to provide a full weight allowance for the 60,000 Health Service Executive patients supplied with incontinence wear to reduce their waste charges, and the Government’s provision of a 50 per cent exemption to the waste industry from the landfill levy in respect of such waste.” </p>
          <p eId="para_698"> I will try to address some of the comments which been made so far. I congratulate the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit on their first Private Members' motion and I look forward to many of them. We had some questions on this issue last week and there was some back and forth debate with Deputy Bríd Smith. She signalled this motion and said that she wanted the Government to stop any price increases that may arise after 1 July. The Deputy wanted me to meet the industry with some urgency. She wanted there to be a link between any increases in standing charges and the consumer price index. She wanted to make sure that families were not being targeted unfairly by price increases and that companies would not use the confusion around changes in charging structures as an opportunity to bump up prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">Since then, I have been actively engaging with the industry to deliver most of what the Deputy was seeking while also continuing to prioritise what we need to do in respect of housing. For example, I was at South Dublin County Council talking about housing for two hours yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> On the waste issue, it is clear there was not acceptance of a new charging structure among households across the country, there was a great deal of concern that householders' bills would increase and there was much scepticism and suspicion around the motivation behind some of the new charges that have only been published in the past ten days. I took action in that regard. I asked the industry to meet me at short notice on Friday last. We spent at least three hours in direct discussions around reflecting the concerns and views of this House and the concerns that all parties have expressed here. I made it clear that we would not be proceeding on 1 July with the mandatory introduction of a new charging system, and they accepted that. I made it clear that I wanted a continuing commitment to a switch-over to pay by weight because I believe it is right to do so, for the environment and for households, in terms of encouraging people to segregate and separate waste at source, to use brown bins and green bins, and to minimise the amount of waste that must go to landfill. At present, there is waste coming from the west of Ireland to Kildare because there are not any landfill facilities for people there to use in their own localities. It makes sense, in terms of waste management, to take initiatives that can encourage people to separate waste at source so that we minimise what is going into landfill. Most importantly, we want a system that makes sense for families and individuals who are managing their waste. I have tried to speak to as many people as possible. Nobody who has switched over to pay by weight to whom I have spoken - approximately 20% of households are currently paying by weight - wants to switch back from that system now that he or she has got used to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_701"> We, as a Government, are essentially saying that households are not ready to have pay by weight mandated because of the suspicion around the changes in charging and the potential increases in charges and, therefore, we have called a halt to that. We have said to the industry we want a freeze on all charges for the next 12 months to create a window of opportunity to be able to raise awareness of the advantages and positive elements to a pay-by-weight charging system in the future. We have said that for the first six months during the freeze on charges there will be much activity around raising awareness, education and encouraging people to think about how pay by weight might help them in terms of reducing their bills and the positive contribution that makes from an environmental perspective. However, there is no obligation on anybody and no one has to worry about increased charges in that period. Then, after six months, we are requiring the industry to introduce dual billing, whereby households can look at their bill, see what they are paying and see what they otherwise might pay if they were paying by means of a pay-by-weight charging structure. If they choose to opt-in to pay by weight, they must be given the opportunity to do so. That is what people are giving out to me about delivering. We are talking about moving away from mandating people to switch to pay by weight and instead investing in an education and promotion campaign around what most would accept, if it is working properly, is a much better way of charging for waste and offering people opt-in on a voluntary basis for the second half of that 12-month period, and the companies have agreed to facilitate that. Nobody is obliged to do anything. They can just sit and pay what they have been paying with no increases for the next 12 months, if that is what they choose to do. We want to put it up to the industry, and, indeed, to me, to persuade people to choose this option as opposed to mandating the change, in other words, forcing people to change and trying to force changes in behaviour through charging structures. We have learned lessons to the effect that society does not respond well to such an approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_702"> What we are doing now involves a step-by-step process and a clear commitment to encourage people to choose a pay-by-weight charging system. The evidence is that when people get that option, they do not turn back easily because they like it and they see why it works for them. Following the 12-month period, we have given a commitment not only to a review of where we go on pay by weight but also of the industry and the waste market about which many Members have raised real concerns. We will look at that. The industry is due that full review and the Government is committing to doing that as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_703"> In addition, we have obtained a commitment on a specific issue on which we have been working with the waste industry for quite some time. I refer to families that are affected by a family member who may be incontinent and has incontinence wear or incontinent pads. There are 60,000 people who are affected by that issue in Ireland producing approximately 40,000 tonnes of waste linked to incontinence wear. Clearly, it is unacceptable and unfair to ask those people to pay more in waste charges on the basis of pay by weight. The retail estimate of what would be paid, if one were to look at 30 cent or 35 cent per kilogramme, for 40,000 tonnes is approximately €12.5 million. The industry has agreed not to charge for that and to work with the HSE to ensure that people get allowances to ensure that they are not disadvantaged as a result of issues relating to incontinence. We are responding with the industry to concerns that are being expressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_704"> We are also responding to the concerns expressed in the past week or so in the context of the negative response to the new charging plans that were published. That is what the Government needs to do. When something is not working out, one responds and changes direction. However, the fundamental direction that we are going in is the right direction in terms of encouraging more people to buy in to the concept of pay-by-weight charging.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> Issues around standing charges and the relationship between standing charges and pay by weight can be examined during the review. I accept that we certainly do not want a situation where we are trying to encourage, support and reward a change in behaviour and our actions being undermined by dramatic increases in standing charges. The deal that has been agreed contains a commitment to freeze the entire charge. What we do not want is to freeze one element of it and for the other element to be jacked up. There is a danger of the latter happening if we solely focus on the standing charge and, therefore, encourage waste operators to make margin from increased pay by weight.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> We now have a commitment that we will follow through on in legislation to change the statutory instrument to ensure that by 1 January companies will be obliged to offer pay-by-weight options if their customers choose that. They will also be obliged to have a dual-pricing model so that people can see the detail of the consequence for them of switching over to pay by weight. We have also said quite clearly in the amendment to the motion that if there is any breach of the price freeze, we will introduce primary legislation to deal with that.</p>

          <from>Deputy Barry Cowen<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T20:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_711">I thank AAA-People before Profit for bringing forward this motion. I agree with much, but not all, of what it contains but I acknowledge the role it has played in bringing this issue to a head and in forcing it to be dealt with in conjunction with other matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">The Minister referred to the debate we had last week on foot of a Topical Issue Matter raised by me and many other Members of the Opposition.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> Unfortunately, as previous speakers alluded to, this matter has its roots in the statutory instrument put forward by the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly. Like many other issues dealt with by him and his predecessor in that Department, this has been a disaster. Those involved have been ill-informed, ill-advised and ill-prepared. I notice he stated in recent days that the Government took its eye off the ball with regard to this issue. There was a ball as big as a beach ball on his desk last January and he failed to enter into a process that could have allowed a more informed debate at that time and a more meaningful process that could have led to the solution now being spoken about. It could have prevented the great fear and trepidation that was placed on many people throughout the country. In recent weeks we have been hearing anecdotal evidence of this as the issue developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> A vacuum was created because of the gap in the statutory order and it allowed many collectors to increase standing or handling charges. That was not appropriate and it led to an opportunity for collectors to reach the holy grail with respect to the commitment they made to investors some years ago when they sought market share with rates that were below cost. Ultimately and inevitably, it led to what took place in recent weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_715"> There was a responsibility on us to address the issue and, as representatives, this was said to us in no uncertain terms. From my perspective and that of my party, during the course of that debate, we and many others asked the Minister to take responsibility for the error made and the opportunity created by the Government because of a lack of appropriate legislation or possibilities within the statutory instrument. It was imperative that the Minister met representatives in the industry, brought in his officials and had legal representatives available to him. I appreciate the speed with which he did that. I also appreciate the work of those who engaged with the Minister, and I spoke to some of them in the past few days, reaffirming my party's position on the issue. We wanted the matter addressed properly, effectively and to everybody's satisfaction. We called for space to be created and a transition period with the freezing of prices. Within that space, there should be transparency around the proposals emanating from collectors and information provided to consumers. There was a lack of information available to consumers on the potential of the pay-by-weight system to reward them for improved efforts to recycle.</p>
          <p eId="para_716"> An opportunity has since been created on proposals to allow consumers to opt in, having adjudicated on the system, as mentioned by the Minister. There is a 12-month period for a price freeze and within that there may be opportunities to educate and inform, allowing an opportunity to reward those who engage in recycling. In that time there must be a root and branch review of waste management by the State and its policy in that regard so the sector can be effective in future. If that amounts to the provision of a regulator for the industry, so be it. It is incumbent on the Minister and the Government to ensure this root and branch review is undertaken, with all stakeholders included in the process. Perhaps an all-party committee with responsibility in this area could lead that. Ultimately, there should be feedback to the Department so the Minister can return to the House before the end of the year with proposals that could meet with the approval of the rest of the Members. That is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> From my perspective and that of my party, we sought space for the Minister to take control and report to the Dáil with proposals for reversing the price hikes. The Minister should have industry buy-in to the process. I note the representative association, comprising 75% of those involved, has committed to that, and the other 25%, comprising two providers, has since also given a commitment in that regard. The legislation is hanging over people's heads and will be there in the autumn if there is no follow-through on commitments.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> To be honest, I can ask for no more than that. I cannot be responsible one week and irresponsible the next. I made a firm commitment to those who sought our interference in this matter to hold the Government to account so it would intervene and address the fears of people informed of price hikes of up to 50%, 100% or 200%. That has been achieved. I pay tribute to those involved. I hope and expect that what has been put in place has the potential to resolve this issue. If the same effort, commitment, responsibility and transparency around the issue had been evident last January, we might have subsequently been in a better place. Irrespective of who deserves the blame, as the awful saying goes, we are where we are. There is a duty and a responsibility on the Government to address the issue and I sought that. I wanted interference and a resolution, and what is contained in the Minister's amendment to the motion has the potential to succeed. Its success will be based on continued surveillance and transparency. More importantly, there must be effort and will from the Government, together with others in the House, to participate in a real and meaningful root and branch review. If that happens, when we return to the issue in 12 months, we will have moved on.</p>
          <p eId="para_719"> From my time as a councillor I know it has been 15 years since the initial waste management plan across the regions was proposed. At that time there was much more waste going to landfill than is the case at present; much progress has been made. It would be a retrograde step to reverse that progress now. I am also conscious of the associated costs of the providers or waste collectors when they dispose of waste in landfill. We can consider some of the remedies spoken of at that time, including incinerators in each region, but the cost associated with landfill means many local authorities are now out of that game and could not afford to meet the commitments expected of them, when one considers Environmental Protection Agency licence rules and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> There is a duty of responsibility on us to have clear and real alternatives available so that consumers can be protected in the first instance and have a choice with respect to cost. Those consumers should be rewarded for participating in improved recycling efforts, which can only benefit all of us. Our party asked for this to be addressed and we feel that has been done properly. We hope the process will succeed and we will monitor it no less than anybody else in the House with a view to ensuring those whom we represent get a fair crack of the whip. Those who participate in these activities in the spirit of the original statutory instrument should be rewarded rather than penalised, as was the case when we stood to speak about the issue this time last week.</p>

          <p eId="para_724">I thank my colleague as I have to participate in a radio programme after this. I believe Deputy Paul Murphy is due on "The Late Debate" with me. </p>
          <p eId="para_725"> I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. It may be is a sign of the maturity of this House that we can discuss matters in an open and frank way. We can see how the changes in the dynamic of the Dáil allow an opportunity for people to recognise and respect viewpoints on all sides of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">It is to be hoped, based on the discourse we have had here over the past week, we have found a solution that moves us from this initial impasse. Sometimes issues get out of hand for all the wrong reasons and sometimes we do not discuss the issues in the context in which they need to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_727"> It would be wrong to discuss this pay-by-weight scheme for the disposal of waste without addressing the overall context in terms of the management of waste. Some of the difficulties we are facing now can be traced back to policy decisions taken in the past. Notwithstanding that, it is very clear that the intended approach from this particular initiative has not really happened and is not going to happen. Certain elements of the waste sector within the contracting side are in a position where they are finding it difficult to make a profit as a consequence of decisions they made some time in the past to expose themselves to losses in an effort to gain market share. In my view, a number of companies have used this particular policy change, which has its genesis in the better management of waste, to remedy this. It might be a laudable policy under normal circumstances, but unfortunately at the time of its coming into play that policy decision has the potential to be abused by a number of contractors for their own ends. That has put the appropriate management of waste somewhat at a disadvantage. The principle of pay-by-weight does, in some instances, help to change consumer behaviour. It helps improve the level of recycling, it helps to reduce the overall production of waste and hopefully it gets some people into the mindset of eliminating waste in the first instance. When I say that, I do not mean eliminating waste from the waste cycle, which some have sought to do through fly-tipping.</p>
          <p eId="para_728"> The cooling-off period now in existence and the sense of security created by giving people the security of knowing there will be no increases for 12 months is useful and helpful. I compliment my colleague, Deputy Barry Cowen, for his approach in developing that point, along with others in the House who have fought that case over the last few days. As my colleague has said, there is an opportunity to deal with the issues over the next 12 months. It would not be right for any of us in this House to abuse that period of time to treat this issue as something that has been kicked down the road for 12 months and that we can come back at in 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> We all have an opportunity now to come forward with ideas and there needs to be a root-and-branch review of our whole waste management system. Deputy Cowen has talked about looking at an appropriate structure in which that can be done, whether through a regulator or whatever. There has been a court judgment about the idea of certain areas being hived off and put out to tender, but we have to question whether it is good practice for three bin lorries to be chasing each other in and out of every estate. While I recognise that ensures competition, it may not ultimately give the best value for money to the consumer and may not be the best way to approach our waste business. Maybe issues like that can be discussed and addressed with all sides over the next 12 months. I know some in this House have the view that the only way to deal with the issue of waste is by giving it back to local authorities. That worked and did not work in various instances. Let us look at it if people on one side of the House or other have a view on it, but let us have an open and frank debate about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> I speak with some experience, because the county I represent has been paying by weight for the past four years. Clean Ireland, which provides most of the service there, is one of the leaders in terms of developing technology and reducing costs, notwithstanding the geographic spread of the county. It has been delivering good value for money and can compete very effectively against those who do not participate in the pay-by-weight initiative. There are lessons to be learned from some of the industry and hopefully we can use them to try to solve this problem.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Lahart<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T20:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_731">Last week, when this issue was raised first by my colleague, Deputy Dara Calleary, the impression was that the Minister was not going to meet the companies until today. Whether that was true or not, the fact that he met them as speedily as possible averted a weekend of Deputies being further inundated with anxious queries. The Minister's challenge is, in part, to demonstrate to this Chamber and to the people outside this Chamber that politics can work, this Chamber can work, democracy works, the voices of public representatives work and people do not always have to resort to protest to make their point. Some of the actions the Minister has taken in the last few days have helped to advance that.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> The Minister has spent quite a large part of his speech talking about what we need to do. He is the unfortunate recipient of a ball that was not his to begin with because the question is why none of this was done. He talked about the need to educate people in respect of pay-by-weight. It is a case of closing the stable door that Deputy Alan Kelly opened. Where is he? The Minister is left with the consequences of that. One of his predecessors, Phil Hogan, had committed in 2011 to a waiver system. If such a national waiver system had been in place, it would have allayed many of the fears the public felt. It struck me as the Minister was talking about the need for education and the need to inform people that maybe Deputies on that side of the House are finally getting to understand why water charges were such a big issue. If it had been approached in this way from the start - I have said this in the House before, in one of my first speeches - that could have been so different. I am intrigued as to where the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, is tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> My colleague, Deputy Cowen, has made most of the points. There is no point in repeating them. The reaction from the public, as I have experienced it, is across all income brackets. It is obviously coming from people who are vulnerable and at a disadvantage, people on social protection and pensioners. The last Government gave social welfare recipients and pensioners a €3 increase and in some of the figures that have been supplied to me, even that paltry €3 would have been wiped out in a couple of weeks by some of those charges. The one thing I have become clear about is that despite all the talk about the economy building and booming, there are many people in Ireland for whom the well is dry, who are doing their sums because they have to do their sums because they are watching their pennies on a weekly basis and this was going to impact them significantly.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> I will illustrate one case, which a constituent of mine in Firhouse wrote to me about. I will not mention the company. I know the Minister is familiar with the situation, but some of these statistics have to be put on the record. I know they came up in the Topical Issues debate last week, which I was chairing at the time, when Deputies Cowen and Curran spoke. This constituent says they have used a particular company since the local authority, South Dublin County Council, gave up collecting waste a few years ago. I know the Minister was out there yesterday and was received well, eventually. My constituent is currently paying €19.50 per month, which is a total of €234 per year, and details how much they would be paying based on the average weights of recent bin collections under the new charges circulated by the provider last week. The charges are itemised and go from €234 per year up to €428 per year. I wonder where Deputy Alan Kelly is now.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">I wonder how he did not see this. The Minister has seen it and, in fairness, has responded to it. We will continue to monitor it.</p>
          <p eId="para_736"> How did the companies justify this? The Minister has not told us. What answers did they give him? I presume he asked them a series of questions. Many constituents would like a weights and measures authority to guarantee that the weights and measures quoted on their statements and bills are accurate. Perhaps that could be built into the regulator's position.</p>

          <p eId="para_738">I thank the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit for tabling this Private Members' motion, which Sinn Féin will support, and the Independents 4 Change for their amendment, which we will also support. Listening to the debate over the past number of days has been a little bit surreal. The dramatic hike in proposed bin charges is indisputable. These are not rumours but actual increases in charges, about which we have heard from real customers. In the case of Greyhound, it is a 76% increase, in the case of Thorntons, it is 66%, in the case of Greenstar, it is 80% and in the case of Citybin, it is 126%. These figures come from real families who have given us real figures based on their usage. The most dramatic increase has been in the standing charge. In the case of Greenstar, the increase in the standing charge is 50%, in the case of Thorntons, it is a 108% and in the case of Greyhound, it is 238%. These extra charges have flowed directly from the new regulations introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, in January. While I accept it was not the intention of the Minister for SI 24 to lead to an increase in charges, that is very clearly its effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> The surreal thing about the debate, however, is the idea that a 12-month suspension is the most effective solution to this problem. I listened to the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, on the news earlier today and have listened to him very carefully in the House this evening. He spoke about the need for people to have knowledge of how this new pay-per-weight system is going to operate and to build public acceptance of it. During Leaders' Questions today, the Taoiseach made some very revealing comments. He talked about people thinking more carefully about the way they deal with refuse and the disposal of waste. He said that pay-by-weight would result in people examining what would be put into the black bin and that they would pay less as a result of using the black bin less. There is an assumption at the heart of the approach of the Government and, unfortunately Fianna Fáil, that huge numbers of people do not use the bin system properly and put the wrong kind of material in the wrong waste and that when pay-by-weight comes in and they understand the error of their ways, they will start using the bins properly, meaning savings will be made.</p>
          <p eId="para_740"> The four examples I have quoted are four people to whom I have spoken. I have looked at their usage over a 12-month period and have compared the exact cost under the new regimes from the four companies. However, these are also people who are already recycling all of their recyclable waste. They all compost additional waste to take it out of the bin system. For all four groups of people, there will be no reductions available at the end of the 12-month cooling off period about which the Minister has spoken. Two of the customers to whom I referred use Thorntons and Greyhound and already pay by weight. While Greyhound is not increasing the per kilo pay per weight charge but is only increasing the standing charge, Thorntons is doing so. The increase on its per kilo charge for pay-per-weight for the black bin is 40% under the proposed increase and under the brown bin it is 10%.</p>

          <p eId="para_742">None of these people has savings available under the Minister's scheme. The bottom line is that SI 24 is not fit for purpose and that is why Sinn Féin firmly agrees with the sentiment of the motion. It was not written correctly and it will not have the impact the Minister says it will have. The best thing to tear up the statutory instrument and start again from the beginning. We should sit down with departmental officials and the relevant Members of this House in committee to design a new system. That would send a very clear signal to households that the Minister is not going to proceed with the increases in 12 months' time. There is nothing in what he or Deputy Barry Cowen has said today that will give any reassurance to families, scared by the proposed increases that were going to come into effect this year, that the very same increases will not come into effect this time next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> Sinn Féin will support this motion and the motion being tabled by our Senators tomorrow will allow for the legal scrapping of SI 24. It would force us all to get back around the table and do this right once and for all. I see no reason to support the cooling off which the Minister has proposed and which Fianna Fáil, wrongly in my view, is supporting. On that basis, we are sticking to the position we had last week of scrapping the statutory instrument and of getting back around the table to draft proper regulations that will improve the level of recycling without fleecing hard pressed families.</p>

          <p eId="para_745">I start by thanking the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People Before Profit for bringing forward this motion. Last January, Deputy Alan Kelly, at the stroke of a pen, introduced SI 24. The rationale for this was that 90% of families and households would pay less to have their bin collected. Fast forward, however, to June 2016 and the truth emerges of what the costs will be and it now transpires that 90% of families and households will, in fact, pay substantially more than they were told.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> Let us look at some cases. The first two were raised by Deputy Mary Lou McDonald, the deputy leader of our party. She spoke to a woman called Elaine, a mother of three children, who has a chronically ill husband and is in receipt of carer's allowance. The cost of her bin collection service is increasing from €204 to €360 per year. That is a 76% increase. They cannot afford this. Another woman called Marie, who is in her 80s, lives alone and is in receipt of the State pension. Her standing charge is being increased from €50 to €169 per year, an increase of 238%. She has told us that money is so tight that she will have no choice but to either go without food or burn her rubbish illegally. Is there not something obscene about this for a senior citizen?</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> I have come across other examples in the past number of days, such as a family of six with four children under the age of 12 and one still in nappies. Last year, the flat rate bill with Thorntons was €360 but it gave a discount of 10% for paying online and on time, so the bill came to €324. The family recycles everything they can and all their glass goes to bottle banks. The family used 1,450 kg of black bin waste in 2015. Thorntons shows the weights for the year online if Members want to check this out. If they use the same weights under the new charges from Thorntons, the bill will be €611, an increase of 95%. An old age pensioner living alone, with a garden which he mows on average three times a year, is currently paying €13.45 per month and his bill will go to €24.43 per month under the new Greyhound charges of €3.25 per week standing charge and 23 cent per kilo for the brown bin. His standing charge will go from €69.95 to €169 but he rarely puts out a black bin and if he does, he will pay 35 cent for every kilo, which is a 130% rise. Despite this, the Government has repeatedly said that 87% of households will save money.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> We know that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, met recently with some of the providers and the outcome of those talks does not inspire confidence. What the Minister needs to do is to reverse this bad decision. The regulation was introduced at the stroke of a ministerial pen and it could and should be removed at the stroke of a ministerial pen. The Minister should today sign a new statutory instrument to remove this regulation which will cause so much hardship for families. A new statutory instrument would remove the threat of daylight robbery on the part of bin collection services.</p>
          <p eId="para_749"> While it is clear that the bin companies are taking the opportunity presented by the new legislation to change the standing charges, it is a no-brainer that if one privatises key public services, then the notion of service becomes secondary to the never-ending drive for profit. The Minister must bring forward new legislation, which he is perfectly capable of doing, without further delay. Failing this, we will avail of Seanad Standing Orders which give the Seanad the power to annul a statutory instrument within 21 sitting days of its signing by the Minister. As the Seanad has sat for fewer than 21 days since then, Sinn Féin Senators have submitted a motion to the Cathaoirleach of the Seanad to annul the statutory instrument and regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">Either the Minister acts or Sinn Féin Senators will bring forward the motion to ensure the regulation is annulled. If it comes to this, I hope those in Fianna Fáil and others will support the motion. Sitting on their hands is not an option in this case. The Minister is talking tough but that is not an option either. Either the Government acts or we will do so. Under no circumstances, come 1 July, will ordinary people be fleeced in the way bin companies intend.</p>

          <p eId="para_751">I welcome the opportunity to have this debate. The Labour Party is committed to the concept of paying by weight for refuse charges as an important contribution to the environment. I think Deputy Dooley said it earlier on, but there has been considerable progress in Ireland with regard to how we treat waste and how we reuse, separate and so on and paying by weight is a contribution to that effort. I compliment the Minister, Deputy Coveney, on the fact that he has moved quickly on the issue and has, in effect, dealt with the first two points in the motion by both meeting the representatives of the deliverers of the service and addressing the issue of preventing them from implementing the planned increases.</p>
          <p eId="para_752"> In response to Deputy Lahart, I am the spokesperson for the Labour Party in this area, which is why the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, is not here. In case there is any doubt that he is still the spokesperson, he was the Minister but I have been appointed as spokesperson and am here to speak on behalf of the Labour Party on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_753"> I also wish to defend the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, against the blanket accusations we have just heard. As stated by a couple of Deputies already, this goes right back to way before the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, became Minister. This was first put on the table in 2011 and the actions of the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, earlier this year were simply to bring in a statutory instrument to provide for the pay-by-weight system that had, in effect, been decided on already. Again, I think it was Deputy Dooley who fairly said that the former Minister did not anticipate that the providers of the service - the waste collectors - were going to abuse the statutory instrument by raising charges way above what anyone would have anticipated. It is only in the past few weeks that it became apparent that this was the intention of the providers of the service. In fairness to Deputy Alan Kelly, I am surprised he is not being blamed for the weather or the fact that Ireland did not score against Belgium in the European championship-----</p>

          <p eId="para_757">He did bring in a statutory instrument, but he did not anticipate, as no one else did at the time, how it might be abused.</p>
          <p eId="para_758"> I have some questions with regard to the Government amendment and the statement by the Minister, Deputy Coveney, today. I commend him on the actions he has taken but there are still some outstanding issues, particularly in respect of what exactly he intends to bring forward by way of amendment to the statutory instrument. He referred also to the possibility of legislation. While the representatives of the majority of the collectors have publicly come out and stated that they will not increase their charges over the year, and I know that there has been some evidence that Greyhound and the other provider are also in that space, we need more clarity. In particular, we need clarity from the other two providers that they will not raise their charges over the next 12 months. In that regard, we probably will need either primary legislation or secondary legislation in the form of a statutory instrument.</p>
          <p eId="para_759"> The Dáil should return to this issue in the next few weeks and preferably before 1 July because we need clarity on those issues. We are acting on partial information here this evening. Indeed, when the motion was tabled, the proposers would not have been aware at the time that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, was going to take the two actions he has since taken. That is one point. </p>
          <p eId="para_760"> In the original motion there is a proposal that standing charges cannot be increased at a rate which is out of line with the consumer price index. However, I question the standing charges that are already in place by some collectors. They vary in different parts of the country but, if we are to have a real polluter-pay system to encourage people to reduce their waste, standing charges should be minimal and people should be paying on the basis of how they separate waste or appropriately use the system. While saying standing orders could not be increased at a rate greater than the change in the consumer price index is a helpful measure, we should be getting back to the idea that, if a person is doing everything he or she possibly can to reduce what he or she puts out, the standing charge should be very small. </p>
          <p eId="para_761"> I support the idea that we should examine the possibility of having a regulator because we need to ensure that into the future this is affordable, fair and transparent. As we have different systems throughout the country, there is an argument for having a regulator and I hope that will be examined over the period of the price freeze. </p>
          <p eId="para_762"> I would also like clarity on which Minister will have responsibility for this area. This morning, the Taoiseach indicated that responsibility was moving to the Minister, Deputy Naughten. However, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, has been dealing with it as of now. We could do with some clarity on where exactly responsibility will lie. This issue arises because "environment" was originally left out of all ministerial titles or responsibilities, and I hope the Government clarifies that soon as well. </p>
          <p eId="para_763"> We need to do something about the amount of packaging still in our shops. I know we can leave the packaging behind, but will people really go through their bags of groceries and take off the packaging before they go home? Most people will not. I would like to see some incentives, be it carrot or stick but probably stick, that encourage shops, supermarkets and manufacturers of goods to reduce the amount of packaging they inflict on the householder. This is something that should also be considered. </p>
          <p eId="para_764"> I welcome the fact that those who have to use incontinence pads are included in the concept of waivers. As the Minister, Deputy Coveney, stated, it is true that the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, had begun work on that matter before he left office. There is a case to be made for having some waivers. As Deputy Quinlivan will know, the Limerick city local authority ran a waiver system and people got a certain amount of free lifts. It has been diminished but still exists to some extent. A waiver system that would protect the most vulnerable of households could be introduced.</p>

          <p eId="para_766">The root of the current problem goes back to the decisions made to hand the industry over to the private sector, where the driver is profit and increased profit. Businesses are entitled to make profits but we have questions over the extent of the profit, especially when it is coming from exploitation. We know that some of these companies have their accounts in other jurisdictions, so I really would like to know exactly what they are contributing to our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> As some of us submitted in the amendment, my preference is to go back to the local authority system. Failing that, I agree with the paying by weight. Before this controversy, I was meeting senior citizens, in particular, and people living alone who were paying for weekly and fortnightly collections of their bins which they absolutely did not need. The minimum charges of 11 cent per kg, 6 cent per kg and zero cost are acceptable but the problem arose because we do not have maximum levels. If the driver is profit, the sky is the limit, as we are seeing. It is totally ironic that in a system which, according to the previous Minister, was meant to see reductions for 87% of people, no change for 8.4% of people and an increase for a small number of people that the total opposite has happened. We are also seeing the undermining of efforts by people to cut down and recycle more.</p>
          <p eId="para_768"> State intervention was needed, so I acknowledge the speedy intervention of the Minister. However, the problem is not going away but merely being postponed and we now have a year to examine these issues. </p>
          <p eId="para_769"> Waivers are absolutely vital.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">The north inner city is, in the main, going to continue with bags because there are so many houses that do not have a storage space. However, before the current controversy these people were being harassed by the waste companies to take bins. These bins were being left out on the street and became a health and safety issue. A more creative approach is needed and we need to look at best practice in other countries. Another issue is the amount of waste which is generated through packaging. The big polluters should be paying more.</p>

          <p eId="para_771">I thank People Before Profit and the Anti-Austerity Alliance for tabling the motion and also for accepting the amendment. I am delighted with that. The Minister is not here unfortunately. He did say that he had acted swiftly upon concerns and that what is really at issue here is the lack of education and that a period of freezing of charges is necessary in which to educate the public. The Minister did not act quickly. He was made to act by People Before Profit, the Anti-Austerity Alliance, Independents4Change, by Sinn Féin and then by Fianna Fáil. That is the new Government working and we forced a change. I am not happy with the change because I come from the city of Galway where we had a wonderful service and we achieved the most fantastic recycling rates. As a result we were punished and the system was privatised.</p>
          <p eId="para_772"> Reference was made to research on the best way to proceed. I disagree with my colleague here with regard to pay by weight. We had a wonderful system in Galway where people were encouraged to act in a certain way. Indeed, the people led us. There was a threat to bring in an incinerator and the people of Galway were galvanised, not by the an attitude of not in my back garden, but by an attitude of wanting a better system for everybody. In a pilot project we reached recycling rates of 70%, which have never been met anywhere else in the country. On a regular basis we diverted 56% of waste from landfill. That was with positive encouragement where the people led us. The councillors were led by the nose and, more importantly, the officials were led by the nose. However, the policy of this and the previous Government has been was to privatise the refuse service. I do not agree with this and we should go back to the local authorities running the service.</p>
          <p eId="para_773"> With regard to the amendment put by the Government, it is significant that the Minister, Deputy Coveney has not referred to the legal capacity to place a cap and whether that is possible. The Minister has avoided the issue. He has provided for a review after 12 months but he has not told us what is going to happen in the meantime.</p>
          <p eId="para_774"> I will now turn to the absence from the Chamber by the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly. I have looked at the statutory instrument and at the briefing document. The former Minister told us at the time that there would be a significant reduction in charges for households. He went on to say that big families would suffer but he did nothing to address that aspect. We had a waiver system. I would happily support the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_780">The article goes on:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_781">but experts have assured <i>Waterford Whispers News</i> that given time, the Government will perform enough u-turns and contradictions to sufficiently rile up interest and anger. "Right now you might say ‘oh I’m not bothered by it’, but ... I guarantee you, you will be more annoyed by this stuff than you thought would be humanly possible" [The more the Government go on].</p>
          <p eId="para_782">While that is actually funny, it is not funny that people are at home who are worried sick about the situation. The platitudes from the Minister tonight that everything is going to be okay only mounts to a kicking of the can down the road. In reality we are not any the wiser about what is going to happen because the Government is ignoring the elephant in the room - or the herd of elephants - which is that the situation does nothing to address the massive, underlying, systemic problems with a privatised waste system. One cannot rely on the goodwill of a bunch of bin companies, many of whom are based offshore, to set prices for consumers or conditions for workers. That square cannot be circled.</p>
          <p eId="para_783"> As a result of the privatisation of our system we have bin lorries trundling up and down the streets most days of the week. In some areas it is one company and in other areas companies are threatening to withdraw. We have escalating charges and huge price variations, with companies like Panda and Greyhound centred offshore, brutal wage suppression, illegal dumping and so on. Last year an investigation was promised into this situation on the back of the Greyhound dispute but ti did not materialise. An investigation is overdue. The behaviour of the waste industry would put the Sopranos to shame. It is an outrage and it needs to be investigated properly. The only solution is for waste collection to be restored to the local authorities as a public service rather than a commodity to be profited from. There is no other way.</p>

          <p eId="para_785">I am glad to speak to this motion this evening and I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Coveney on his appointment. I also congratulate the Ministers of State, Deputies Seán Kyne and Damien English on their appointments. Waste disposal has been a huge issue for many years. From my time on the county council my understanding is that the problems are around land fill, the unavailability of landfill and the whole area of recycling. We must try to educate around reuse and recycling.</p>
          <p eId="para_786"> I thank the Minister for his intervention in the current situation. The former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, left us in a fine mess here when he told us all that 87% of households would have a decrease in charges but nobody believed that only himself, and I do not think even he believed it. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has taken the initiative to bring the private operators in for talks and to freeze charges for a 12 month period. The introduction of a billing system is also welcome where customers can see clearly how the introduction of a pay by weight system compares to how they currently pay. They will see displayed clearly how it will affect them and how, if they are recycling, reusing and cutting down their waste, they could bring the weight down and get cheaper bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_787"> Carers must be looked after, as must those who care for people who are using incontinent pads such as the elderly, infirm and younger people who may have disabilities and whose needs are ongoing. We must also think of big families. We are hardly going to put the carers back to washing nappies as they did back in the fadó, fadó. People have to be treated seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_788"> Waste is a huge problem and the polluter pays concept is a proper one. Polluters must be made to pay. We have a huge issue. In my own village last night we had a spring clean - a few months late but the weather last Monday stopped the clean-up then. I salute those who do the Tidy Towns. We had a huge turnout. I compliment the people in the Tidy Towns groups and those schemes who do a lot of work in tidying up litter. We must deal with the people who do not want to pay and who fly-tip and dump and expect the middle class to pay for everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_789"> I wish the Minister well with the proposal and I hope he will have constructive talks. He is passing his baton on to Minister for Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources, Deputy Naughten, and I know he will be well able to handle it as well. However, we must be realistic. We cannot be exporting our waste as we are doing at the moment. We only have weeks left of landfill in the State and it is not an option to export it. It must be looked at sensibly. We must educate our young people and maybe young people can educate us older people who have dirty ways. I will now hand over to my colleagues.</p>

He will be very secure in doing the job that he has been given. He knows I mean that.</p>
          <p eId="para_791"> This is a very important issue. Deputy McGrath has highlighted one specific issue that I want to raise with the Minister and I believe he will be proactive in this regard. When pay-per-weight eventually will come in there will have to be an exemption made for people, teenagers or adults, who have medical problems which mean that there is a use of nappies. That would impose an awful burden on people.</p>

          <p eId="para_794"> We do not want to be nonsensical about waste. In County Kerry an excellent facility was put in at Muingnaminnane by councillors who were ahead of their time but unfortunately now it is lying idle and dormant which it should not be. We want to see common sense prevailing and facilities like that being opened up again which would reduce the cost to the customer, to the people who produce refuse because dealing with it in their own locality is most important and that is what we want to do to reduce the cost to the customer and the people in our locality.</p>

          <p eId="para_795">Yes there was a cock-up in the past few days in respect of the waste collection service but the waste collection services have been unfairly targeted and criticised by many Members. In County Kerry and especially south Kerry we have a wonderful collection service provided by a privately operated company giving local employment and a very punctual service and helping the local communities to deal with waste. It operated what was called the Good Friday clean-up of the whole county, providing a service free of charge to collect bags collected by local voluntary groups along the roads and in the towns and villages. I could not stand over the service providers being tarred with the same brush because we have a wonderful service and we are proud of it. There are two or three more operators in County Kerry and we are very proud of them and this debacle was certainly not caused by them. I want that to be clearly remembered in this Chamber.</p>
          <p eId="para_796"> The local authority is still providing a service in Killarney town and is doing a wonderful job as well. We cannot criticise the providers because it is not fair or right. As Deputy Michael Healy-Rae said, deciding where to go with the waste will be a real problem because we are being told now that it is not cost efficient to go abroad with it any more, indeed it is not wanted. For a long time it was cheaper to go that way than it is now. We need to open up local places like Muingnaminnane around our country so people will have somewhere to go with it.</p>

          <p eId="para_797">We all accept that many of the problems associated with refuse collection originated with the decision to privatise this service. Refuse collection is such a fundamental public service that it does not lend itself to privatisation. While the service run by local authorities was not entirely trouble free it was much less troublesome than the privatised service has become. There is no doubt that we have all seen throughout the country a massive increase in dumping as a result of the privatisation of the service because there has been no recognition by the private waste collectors of ability to pay. In my constituency many people, pensioners in particular, and others on low incomes, were entitled to a waiver. Unfortunately, that was scrapped. In spite of promises by the last Government to introduce a national waiver scheme that never happened of course. We now have another fine mess from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the same Department that brought us Irish Water and the debacle associated with that and which persistently failed to plan adequately for housing demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_798"> When the then Minister, Deputy Kelly, last January announced this measure as an environmentally friendly one, the idea was that people would have an opportunity to reduce the amount of waste going to landfill and would be encouraged to recycle more waste. That is not happening. One has to question the political decisions around that announcement last January and the decision to move to a pay by weight system. There was no poverty proofing when that was done. The plan the then Minister had was to charge people for green bins, to charge people for recycling, which is lunacy. That had to be scrapped in the meantime. Why, for example, was no consideration given to those adults and children who use incontinence wear and the additional cost that would involve for them? None of these factors was thought out and we are now reaping the reward of that lack of planning, forethought and consideration for how this measure would affect people’s daily lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_799"> The then Minister promised us in January that 87% of people would experience a reduction in the cost of their waste charges. That is the standard to which we have to hold this Government. That was the promise given. We want a new system that will ensure that is the case, that 87% of people will benefit from any new regime that is brought in.</p>
          <p eId="para_800"> The kind of price gauging we have seen over recent weeks by the waste companies is entirely unacceptable. Waste operators felt they could get away with it and that the public would think the price increases were due to the new rules. They need to be stopped in their tracks. I am glad there is a moratorium now but we need a solution to this issue not just a postponement of the inevitable. There is a huge lack of transparency around waste collection. Regulations should be set down to provide for conditions for the granting of waste licences so they are not awarded unless there is price and profit transparency. This is a multi-billion euro industry. It has been completely privatised in recent years yet there is little or no regulation of the industry. It is a huge industry. We know there are major question marks about how it is operating at the moment and that the Competition Authority is examining some aspects of the industry. We do not know who owns what within the industry. All the profits are kept offshore. We do not have access to any of the accounts from these companies. That is not acceptable. We should know who owns the companies that are running what should be a critical public service, what their profit margins are, who the beneficial owners are, which company owns which other smaller company, what mergers have taken place and the implications of mergers that are indicated at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_801"> It is a huge area where there has been very sudden deregulation but no regulator has been appointed. There are many questions about how it operates. It has become a free for all. If and when we move to a system of paying by weight what guarantee is there that the machines are properly regulated and calibrated? Who is doing those inspections? We hear about the relevant authority being responsible but that is all of the local authorities. How many times are companies and bin lorries inspected to ensure there is not a further rip-off going on?</p>
          <p eId="para_802">The suspicion is that these companies are operating as a cartel as they all move together to rebuff the public under the guise of the new regime. They had the look of operating as a cartel. There is a need to examine whether a cartel is in operation. As I said, we cannot answer those questions without knowing who owns what companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_803"> We need strong regulation of the sector. My preference is for a return to local authorities, but it is difficult to see the situation being unwound at this stage. Major mistakes were made. If we are going to have a deregulated sector, we must have a very strong regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_804"> We need a national waiver scheme that takes account of people's ability to pay. This was promised and needs to happen this year. The least the waste companies could do is issue an apology for their attempts at price gouging over recent months. They should apologise for the smash-and-grab approach they took to the public. There is a need for the Minister to continue to stand up to them and stop the price gouging.</p>
          <p eId="para_805"> The Minister claimed many people gain from the system. Many people already recycle to the maximum level possible and they will not gain at all. He should bear that in mind. Many people who recycle feel the Minister is being quite patronising. They are doing their bit.</p>

          <p eId="para_807">If the Taoiseach were a football manager and the Cabinet a team, I would strongly advise the manager to rest the team because the players must be worn out from kicking cans down the road. Between water, abortion and now refuse collection, what else is the Government putting off for a year or two? It must be worn out since it took over.</p>
          <p eId="para_808"> I want to recall a few memories from my political life that are very relevant to the debate. The Socialist Party and many others on the left were actively involved in the campaign against the introduction of bin charges, something the Government might recall. Several myths were trotted out about bin charges at the time. In September 2003, the top one was that one would only pay for what one threw away. The Minister might remember that slogan because the Government of the time took out very expensive advertisements to tell everyone this. When waste charges were introduced, people did not pay for what they threw away.</p>
          <p eId="para_809"> Another argument we had thrown at us were that the charges were only €3, €5 or whatever. It was a relentless tirade. The establishment and media, which are generally from a certain milieu, showed the usual disconnect from working class life and hardship they displayed in the water charges campaign. To them, €5 was nothing and they asked what the problem was. We now see the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_810"> I was sent bills by a woman who is now paying €93 for eight bin lifts, which is outrageous and extortionate. The Minister is freezing the charges, but pensioners have asked me on my Facebook page what is being asked of them because they cannot pay. The Minister can kick this can down the road, but we obviously need to return to a system where refuse collection is fully public.</p>
          <p eId="para_811"> Another myth was peddled by the Labour Party in particular. It claimed the Socialist Party led to the privatisation of bin collections. This argument was trotted out on Twitter over the weekend, something with which I will deal in a moment. I remind the Minister how isolated and vilified those of us who fought the charges were. We had two elected representatives, one Deputy and one councillor, who were sent to jail for a month because of their refusal to abandon their communities who opposed charges. In Dublin, 21 people were sent to jail, along with many others in other counties and a pregnant woman. The media and political establishment accused all these people of being lunatics, on the fringes and polluters, even though, as was said, people in this country now recycle more than the EU average. They have nothing to show for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_812"> We were constantly asked what our problem was because the charges were only a few bob. We now see what an absolute encroachment into people's budgets this has become. I commend the bravery of the people who pointed out what would happen. Unfortunately, we lost the campaign, as the Government liked to remind us when we fought the water charges. When we lost the campaign, the charges were bedded down and rose relentlessly and all of the service was privatised. It did not take too long for the greedy private companies to engage in a race to the bottom in terms of the poor unfortunate workers or to go offshore, which practically every one of them has done. Greyhound, Mr. Binman, Oxigen, Panda and City Bin all have offshore accounts in the Isle of Man and other places.</p>
          <p eId="para_813"> I want to provide a few historical facts, in particular for the edification of the Labour Party, on the privatisation of bin services. An article in <i>The Irish Times </i>in October 2003, which was the very month bin charges were fought in Fingal and were beginning to be fought elsewhere in Dublin, reported that more than half of the county and town councils in the entire country had privatised refuse collections. Meath County Council was among the first to do so in 1990. I do not know what the Labour Party thinks. Perhaps it thinks we have a major influence on society, but we were not present on any of those councils. Among the councils that privatised their waste collection before bin charges were introduced were Sligo, Drogheda, Wicklow, Clare and Galway. I do not have time to go on.</p>
          <p eId="para_814"> The last regions where waste collection was privatised were those where people fought them the most, namely, Dublin. Of course, the Dublin county managers all got together, ditched the service and sold it off. As I said, the charges have risen relentlessly. I hope this history lesson is of some benefit to the Labour Party as it goes about its propaganda campaign. I hope it will listen to the anguish of people in terms of the drain the charges have become.</p>

          <p eId="para_815">The mass movement against water charges is set to score two victories in a week. It is forcing the Government to reverse a scandalous effort by private waste companies to hike charges to extortionate levels, and later in the week the Government will be forced to climb down in its effort to inflict water charges on people. The movement against water charges was a child of the movement against waste charges. Many of the people who formed the core of the groups in communities, towns and villages throughout the country were the very same people who fought against bin charges ten or more years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_816"> When we fought bin charges we said they would lead to prices going through the roof, privatisation, a deterioration in conditions for workers in waste collection and increased damage to the environment in the form of fly-tipping, and would be followed by water charges. We were right on every single count. The worst thing about the old politics is that Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil knew we were right and that all these things would happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_817"> As Deputy Coppinger has suggested, the level of dishonesty is extraordinary. I heard it echoed by the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, earlier, and it was repeated endlessly by the Labour Party. The lie is that those of us who fought against bin charges were responsible for privatisation, when in fact the majority of waste collection services in this country were privatised before our campaigns against bin charges even began.</p>
          <p eId="para_818"> Most of the waste charges in this country were privatised in the 1990s. Our campaign only began in 2000 in Dún Laoghaire and in 2001 in Dublin city. The last places in which waste collection was privatised were Dublin city and Dún Laoghaire where there were fights.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">They were privatised everywhere beforehand, just as we had predicted, by the racketeering bandits. What a shower of bandits these guys are. The Minister has said the Government is responding to the concerns raised.</p>

          <p eId="para_821">What the Minister does not accept is just how greedy the people concerned are and what they were willing to do. They were trying and willing to ratchet up charges by between 50% and 200%. All we are getting from the Minister is a promise that it will not happen for 12 months, but there is no promise that it will not happen in the future. We have been down this road before; it happened 15 years ago when we were given all of those promises that there would be waivers, that it would not be so bad and that it would not cost people so much, but it all turned out to be lies. That gives rise to the question of whether we believe charges will be introduced in 12 months time. Is it the case that the Government is colluding right now with the bandits in the private waste companies who wanted to rip people off to the extent I have outlined to ensure they would stay in business rather than that we would have a fair waste collection system? I do not trust the Minister. I am sorry, but I do not. The reason I do not trust him is that in 2012 the former Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, chose the more expensive model - he knew it was the more expensive model - because the private waste companies had told him to do so. Why did the subsequent Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, bring forward a ridiculous statutory instrument that triggered the current situation in the first place? The reason is he was lobbied by the private waste companies.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Deputy Seán Kyne)<recordedTime time="2016-06-21T21:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_831">The Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, outlined the Government's commitment to the principle of pay-by-weight charging for waste in terms of better environmental outcomes and the capacity to allow householders better opportunities to manage their waste costs. Research indicates that more than 440,000 tonnes of waste material could be diverted from landfill under a pay-by-weight charging system and its introduction will undoubtedly assist the State to achieve regional waste targets, in complying with national recycling and landfill targets under EU legislation, as well as making sure we will be well placed to meet future and more ambitious targets, for example, under the European Union's current circular economy package. However, we are aware of the public disquiet in response to the pricing plans proposed earlier this month by the waste industry as part of the nationwide roll-out of pay-by-weight charging and the impact on perceptions of the pay-by-weight system. The delayed release of the price plans, with only a few weeks to go to their coming into effect, has further confused matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> In our meetings and discussions with representatives of the waste industry in recent days both the Minister and I raised concerns about - I sought justification for it - the reported escalation of waste charges for customers, especially some proposed increases in service or standing fees. We do not accept that companies should use the national transition to what is a more sustainable and better means of both charging for and managing waste to resolve long-standing issues concerning a cohort of customers who have unsustainably low waste fees. Although it is less than ideal to alter arrangements so close to the 1 July introduction date, the Government has been quick to act and is prepared to ensure we get it right, even if it means building in a transition phase to ensure a smoother and fairer shift to pay-by-weight charging in due course. The Government has set out a clear and fair way forward that will result in customers paying no more than they currently pay for waste in the next 12 months to avoid significant price increases for some households in their waste bills from next month. The operation of the price freeze by the waste industry will be monitored and if there is evidence that it is not being honoured, the Government is prepared to bring forward further legislative amendments to enforce it.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> Another key part of the solution is that where households do apply the principle of pay-by-weight charging and reduce their residual or black bin waste, they should have the option to change over to a pay-by-weight contract to enjoy the benefits. To some extent, the implementation of pay-by-weight charging is being phased in, with a transition period being introduced to give households time to adapt to the new system and learn how to more effectively manage their waste. In the coming months households will be provided in their bills with details of the amount of waste they are presenting for collection, their costs under their current price plan and details of the comparative pay-by-weight price. In parallel, the Government, in partnership with the waste industry, will drive an intensive public awareness, information and promotion campaign to support customers in understanding the new system, how they can change their waste management behaviour and better manage their waste costs under the pay-by-weight system.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> As the Minister alluded to, the Government welcomes the commitment from the waste industry to provide a full weight allowance to the estimated 60,000 patients supplied with incontinence wear by the HSE. The issue was raised by many speakers and genuine concerns were expressed previously by carers. The issue is being addressed. By arranging to collect the additional weight attributed to non-infancy incontinence wear free of charge, the waste collection companies will significantly reduce the annual waste charges of the households affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> In overall terms, waste which cannot be prevented, if segregated and managed properly, can help to generate products, materials, energy and jobs. Government policy has been framed to minimise the generation of waste and maximise the potential of waste as a resource. Pay-by-weight charging is one policy measure to assist us to make the move to a circular economy. In that regard, I look forward to the coming 12 months when householders will be able to see the benefits of pay-by-weight charging for themselves in managing their costs, the advantages for the State in meeting waste targets and stimulating economic activity and the benefits to the environment through less waste being generated and sent to landfill. That is the basis of the charges, namely, to ensure we try to reduce the amount of waste being produced, being sent to landfill and that will be incinerated. We acknowledged the genuine concerns expressed in many cases and with the Minister and others, I intervened to allay fears and provide a welcome breathing space of 12 months. I hope that in the course of the next 12 months a fairer and better system will be put in place according to the principles of the polluter pays and pay-by-weight charging.</p>

          <p eId="para_836">This morning I listened to Deputy Paul Murphy on local radio and wish to quote what he said about the motion. He stated: "We have thought it through, but it is not our full position." We are once more debating a motion brought before the House which is little more than a political stunt. It sums up everything about the anti-austerity movement and Sinn Féin that protest for the sake of protesting and try to scaremonger at every opportunity. I ask Deputy Paul Murphy and his colleagues what their full position is and if, in fact, it is the case that they have thought it through fully. Does the Deputy have any real alternative that would work or is he and his party simply capable of taking a populist view on every issue that arises? He also suggested this morning that the councils should be in charge of waste collection and that there should be no charge to the customer. From where does he think the councils get their funding?</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> To return to the real issue of domestic waste charges, I have been contacted by many local people about the new pricing modules. The simple truth is that in County Louth - Dundalk, in particular - we have no information on what the charges will be, which in itself is causing great confusion and fear. I urge all waste collection providers to immediately publish details of their pay-by-weight charges in an open and transparent manner. The lack of information is causing unnecessary stress and worry for many and must not continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> The principle that those who pollute most should pay the most is one with which I wholeheartedly agree. I also agree fully with the principle that those who carefully recycle their waste must be rewarded. There is no doubt that the current system under which a fixed amount is paid each month does not encourage those who seek to actively recycle and reduce their waste. For that reason, I agree with the introduction of a pay-by-weight system and the decision not to impose charges for green bin collections. However, I do not agree with the original decision to impose a minimum charge. That was a wrong decision and only allowed waste companies to take advantage of the new regulations. I have said previously that we should impose a maximum or capped charge to be imposed by waste companies. With such a system we could then allow market forces to take hold and, as in every other industry, companies would compete with each other for market share.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">I ask the Minister to reconsider service charges. It is not fair to impose service charges that do not take into account situations in which households would only use the bin collection service on rare occasions. For openness and transparency, the price per kilogram charged for black and brown bins should include all charges. One need only look at other industries such as, for example, the mobile phone market, where a large proportion of users go for the pay-as-you-go option and there is no additional charge over and above the cost of the top-up credit.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> To conclude, I fully support the concept of pay-by-weight for waste collection but would like to see a proper pay-as-you-use system implemented with no additional service charges. I also do not agree with suspending the introduction of the new charging system. What will that achieve? What Members need to do is to implement legislation that allows for the proper introduction of pay-by-weight and pay-as-you-use waste collection services.</p>

          <p eId="para_841">The Government would like this to be a debate about pay-by-weight because that currently is the favoured method of the Government to green austerity measures and that is what it does. However, this is not a debate about pay-by-weight in the abstract; it is about how people over the past month or so have received letters explaining to them - without spelling it out fully - that they would experience massive price hikes. In particular, the standing charges were being doubled or trebled and some weight charges also were increasing. It is about a rip-off of people and price gouging by the companies. This happened because the door was left open through a statutory instrument by the former Minister, Deputy Kelly. Members of the Anti-Austerity Alliance-People before Profit, AAA-PBP, have been stating clearly and attempted in their motion to point out that this door must be closed. I do not believe the Minister is closing the door with the approach he is taking. This is why I do not believe the AAA-PBP is being unreasonable in continuing to criticise the Government's approach. While the Minister is closing over the door a good bit, it is left slightly ajar and in one year's time in particular, it potentially will burst open with these vultures who seek to maximise their profits.</p>
          <p eId="para_842"> The AAA-PBP stated and continues to state the door can be closed clearly, again by the method of a statutory instrument, which freezes in legislation the standing charge and which imposes maximum per weight charges for black and brown and with green at zero. The AAA-PBP's full position, for the benefit of Deputy Fitzpatrick, is clear as I tried but obviously failed to explain in the radio interview. Our full position is for charges to go, for privatisation to be reversed and for the bin services to be brought back into council control because we believe privatisation has been a disaster. The AAA-PBP Members have also tried to use the debate to illustrate this point. However, this is a bad fudge, which is modelled on the bad fudge of the water charges. It is the same process, albeit simply condensed into a short period. The reason this bad fudge will take place and that the Government will get away with it is because of Fianna Fáil. Had Fianna Fáil stuck to its rhetoric on the issue, the Government would be facing defeat on this motion right now, would be facing defeat in the Seanad tomorrow and would have no choice but to move more decisively to close the door permanently, as opposed to it coming back in 12 months' time. As with many such issues, Fianna Fáil holds the key to how this issue will be resolved or, as in this case, resolved unsatisfactorily.</p>
          <p eId="para_843"> How does one explain the position of Fianna Fáil? Deputy Cowen explained in this Chamber that one cannot be responsible one week and irresponsible the next week. This was from a party and a Deputy that obviously loaded us with 42% of the cost of the European banking crisis for which we are still paying. However, I also do not see how it is irresponsible to vote for a motion that encapsulates what is one's political position and what one has been saying. That is not irresponsible, it is democratic for people to express their mandate. The skies would not fall in, were the Government to lose a vote tonight or were it to lose in the Seanad and were it to be forced to bring in the necessary changes. In a radio interview this morning, Deputy Breathnach stated he agreed with the motion, that it sums up Fianna Fáil's position but that the AAA-PBP has some ulterior secret motives and for that reason, Fianna Fáil cannot vote for it with those secret motives being the openly stated case about opposition to privatisation and to charges full stop. These are not credible reasons as to why Fianna Fáil is taking this position. The reality is that what is expressed is that Fianna Fáil is the third leg of the Government and this has encapsulated in miniature, in the space of approximately two weeks, new politics as it actually is. I do not refer to the fairy tale version, whereby everybody forgets about the different ideologies and different class interests that are represented in this House and where everybody agrees, but to the reality of how politics is operating now because the Government continues not to be concerned about the attitudes or the effects of things on ordinary people until forced to be. The only Members speaking in here on behalf of ordinary people are those of the left, with the AAA-PBP to the fore using its Private Members' time effectively in this case. However, the difference is the establishment is extremely weak. It is weak in this Chamber and there is a confident people outside the House who felt able to mobilise and to put pressure on the different parties, with the result that Fianna Fáil then was forced into a position of raising this matter in here and then, just like with the water charges, agreed to a bad compromise and fudge that allows it to come back on the agenda in the future. However, people should draw the lesson that confidence is contagious. We will take this as a partial victory and will move on to further partial victories, all the while preparing to bring about the fundamental change needed, which can only be brought about by building a mass left-wing party to be a voice for and to mobilise for ordinary people and to establish a left-wing government with socialist policies.</p>

          <p eId="para_844">I compliment Deputy Fitzpatrick on his honesty because he really tried to lash the AAA-PBP out of it by stating he does not agree with the move of his Minister to freeze the charges. He does not agree and he believes everybody is happy to recycle, that there should not be a problem and that the AAA-PBP is creating imaginary problems because we do not wish to be positive in anything but are negative about everything. That is the real sentiment of Fine Gael and I note the colour of the Deputy's shirt is a deep blue, whereas the colour of the tie of his colleague sitting below him is a pale blue. I refer to the people who speak nicely to us and try to tell us they agree with Deputy Smith or are glad that Deputy Smith brought this matter to their attention and so on. Indeed, the kowtowing or the Cowen-towing of colleagues from Fianna Fáil was quite similar. It was all very nice, all polite gentlemen, all talking to the gentlemen, so called, in the waste management industry and getting on well with them and getting agreements with them that they would freeze things and would not touch people and would do this, that and the other. It probably is because you know these gentlemen in the waste management industry a little more than personally, that there are relations of whatever sort, political, financial or economic, that go between the major parties and industries.</p>

          <p eId="para_855"> I refer the Minister to a strike that took place in 2014 - not that long ago - by Greyhound workers. It was vicious and was like something out of the Lock-out, where scabbing on a major scale took place. People broke picket lines, a lot of violence was used and the Greyhound workers, who took strike action to defend the limited pay and conditions they had, were bullied and intimidated. What has resulted from that dispute, and I have spoken to some trade union organisers about this, is that throughout the waste management industry, workers work on very low-paid contracts. They are working dangerous hours and as already mentioned earlier, some trucks are operating with two men, generally speaking, instead of three. Whereas the Health and Safety Authority recommends three, two are being used. There are many questions to be asked about the industry and the introduction of pay by weight will increase the working day by at least an additional 80 minutes. That will be offloaded onto the workers who will not receive an extra penny for it because they work on a task basis. There is much to be asked about this waste management industry, as many of my colleagues and Deputies have stated throughout.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">Somebody said something to me today that stuck in my head. Do Members know the song "The Great Pretenders"? It is going around in my head, "Oh yes, we're the great suspenders." That is what this Government is: the great suspenders. It has been suspending every bloody thing since I came in here and well done to it that it is getting away with it.</p>
