          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">The Tánaiste will be aware that the Government has now entered its ninth year. If it runs for its full term, it will have been in office for ten years. That is a decade too long, characterised by a crisis in the health services, rampant crime and the fact that Ireland has become the most expensive country in Europe. This Government has been characterised most by its consistent litany of broken promises. This is an absolute scandal when it comes to carnage on the roads and the Government's ability to deal with transport services. For instance, does the Tánaiste recall the Government's promise in 1998 to roll out speed cameras nationally within two years? Does she realise that seven years later, only three out of 20 speed cameras in the greater Dublin area are in operation at any one time? Does the Tánaiste remember that the Government promised to make 69 offences liable to penalty points by the end of 2003? Does she realise that two years later, only three have actually been enacted? Is the Tánaiste aware that on average, only one garda in every Garda station has been trained in the use of breathalyser machines? Does she realise that the conviction rates between 2001 and 2003 have climbed significantly?</p>
          <p eId="para_2">The result of this inactivity and inability to cope by the Government is that, unfortunately, road deaths continue at a terrifyingly high rate. Already this year, 172 people have lost their lives on our roads, an increase of 12% on 2004. Of course driving behaviour is the responsibility of individuals, but if they believe they can get away with speeding, drunk driving or whatever, they feel safe in so doing. Can the Tánaiste offer any assurance that, almost ten years later, having given a litany of promises, the Government and the Minister will take some action to implement the litany of broken promises, which have resulted in road deaths continuing at a startlingly high rate? Is this not a complete failure on the part of the Government and the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Transport to implement systems and standards which will ensure that all road users know they must be compliant in the interest of public safety?</p>

          <p eId="para_4">I acknowledge that the Government has been in office for eight years. That is true and the Government was returned to office at the last election. However, if we reflect on those eight years, while we can see challenges and difficulties, equally we can see major progress in Ireland. For example, last year, this economy created 72,000 jobs. When the two Government parties came to office in 1997, the unemployment rate was 11% and there was still emigration. Today we have net immigration and an unemployment rate of 4%. When we took office in 1997, 1.5 million people were at work in Ireland while today, there are 1.9 million people at work. Undoubtedly, we have made enormous progress.</p>

          <p eId="para_26">I am disappointed by the Tánaiste's response as she is usually better briefed. She states it is the Government's job to meet these challenges and that it will do so. Obviously, however, there has been a complete failure here. I do not know if the Tánaiste is aware that only 34 extra gardaí have been drafted in this year. Let me provide some examples of where the Government has fallen down in respect of road safety. In 2002, the implementation of 69 offences which were to be liable to penalty points was promised by the end of 2003. Up to this year, only three have been effected. The immediate introduction of a Garda road traffic corps was proposed in 2002. The Tánaiste now states the Government intends to introduce a traffic corps. The introduction of random breath testing was to be extended nationally in 1999. However, in 2005, no legislation to allow for it has been introduced and no roadside drug testing has been introduced. A penalty points fixed charge processing system was to be rolled out by the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, who stated in 2004 that it would become live and active within a few months.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_28">Currently, no operational computerisation of the system has been implemented. The ban on mobile telephones while driving was to be introduced after the announcement in August 2001 by the then Minister of State at the Department of the Environment and Local Government, Bobby Molloy. In 2005, no legislation has yet been enacted to introduce fixed penalties for driving while using a mobile telephone.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">Recently I had occasion to travel by a different mode of transport from Kerry to Donegal and it was an education in terms of the abuse of mobile phone usage by some truck drivers and by many motorists. The Government has fallen down completely in terms of implementation of standards for road safety. There is no compulsory training in place for motorcyclists and 46 have been killed on our roads this year. Motorcyclists comprise 2% of traffic yet 15% of accidents. Is this not an admission that the Ministers for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Transport have fallen down completely on this job, not to mention the absent Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who is in London today? I hope he does not raise the issue he raised at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party last night when he said the building was surrounded and that if he was not let out in an hour, he would have to call in the marines.</p>

          <p eId="para_32">When Deputy Kenny talks about roads, traffic and so on, he does not mention the huge drop in the cost of motor insurance in recent years. When he criticises the Government on matters which are being addressed, perhaps he could acknowledge the progress made in motor insurance costs which are down by over 30%.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">The number of deaths and serious injuries on our roads has been substantially reduced from what it was in the late 1990s. There are challenges for us all in terms of our personal responsibility and there are issues for Government. There were constitutional issues in regard to random sampling and that is the reason it did not proceed. The commitment was to examine the matter. The Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Transport are working closely to address the issues, particularly in regard to a traffic corps to enforce the existing law. If we could enforce the existing law, there would be a huge reduction in the number of road fatalities.</p>

          <p eId="para_34">I remind the Tánaiste that in 2002, in respect of measures to combat corruption in police forces, the Government committed to a package of measures at Interpol, including provision for an annual review of the efficacy of these measures and provision for participation by civil society. Two years later, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform produced the Garda Síochána Bill — an in-house Bill following an in-house agenda. There was no participation by civil society. One year later in 2005, Mr. Justice Morris produced his report. That report made only one major recommendation directed at Government and this House. He said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_35">The Tribunal is much concerned by the lack of any independent body to receive legitimate concerns about Garda behaviour. The provisions of the Garda Bill need to be reviewed by the Oireachtas, so as to satisfy the legitimate disquiet that arises from the Tribunal's study of the documents in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">The Taoiseach spent his time yesterday trying to persuade the House the Minister had taken that into account despite the fact he published the Bill a year before Morris reported. Morris reported last week and the Taoiseach flimflammed, ducked, dived and confused——</p>

          <p eId="para_39">As the leader of the Progressive Democrats, does the Tánaiste stand over this insult to Morris? This is his second report. Her Government would not even agree to a debate on the first report. His major recommendation in this second report is that we review the Bill. The distinguished expert the Minister appointed said he has no confidence in it and the Taoiseach seeks to persuade the House the Minister has taken on board the Morris report. Does the Tánaiste also betray the Morris report? If so, why should Mr. Justice Morris continue with the third module in this extraordinary inquiry?</p>

          <p eId="para_40">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Taoiseach and the entire Government take the findings of the Morris report very seriously and the Minister is already on record as saying he intends to bring forward amendments to the legislation on foot of the recommendations in the Morris report to ensure greater accountability and oversight in regard to the operation of the Garda Síochána. It is a shocking indictment of our democracy that any family should be framed in this way. No democrat and certainly no member of Government could stand over what happened in Donegal and what has been brought to light in the Morris report. The Minister is big enough and courageous enough to bring forward amendments on foot of the recommendations in the Morris report or, indeed, any other recommendations which are brought forward to ensure that where wrongdoing occurs and where shortcomings are identified, they are appropriately dealt with on an independent and accountable basis.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">How far standards in the House have fallen when the Tánaiste rows in behind the mantra the Taoiseach trotted out yesterday. None of that has any meaning. She said the Minister is big enough and strong enough. His mouth is big enough anyway but when it comes to addressing the particular issue, he evades it and the Tánaiste ought to know that. There is no point talking about an Ombudsman commission as it is a contradiction in terms. The Minister only included the Ombudsman, which has been a splendid success in Northern Ireland, because of the significance of the term. He is, in fact, setting up a committee. The Tánaiste will have heard Senator Maurice Hayes comment on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">It is not true the Minister is bringing forward amendments in the context of what we are talking about here. He is bringing forward one amendment, the purpose of which is to make gardaí amenable to their superior officers to answer for their whereabouts when they are supposed to be on duty. Is that the type of advance the Tánaiste spent her years on this side of the House advocating?</p>
          <p eId="para_45">Mr. Justice Morris painstakingly produced a report. The one major recommendation directed to Government is that the Garda Síochána Bill be reviewed. In the interests of society and of decent conscientious gardaí in the force, a review of the Bill is required. It is patently clear if one reads the report which, incidentally, it was clear the Taoiseach had not done, what Mr. Justice Morris advocates. I do not ask this in order to inflict another defeat on the Minister but will the Tánaiste, as leader of the Progressive Democrats, stand over this reneging on Morris and on the major recommendation in his report?</p>

          <p eId="para_49">Recent months have shown labour laws to be pathetically inadequate in vindicating the rights and entitlements of workers in this State. Incredibly yesterday, the High Court said the law prohibits the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment from publishing the report of the labour inspectorate into the vicious regime of exploitation by Gama Construction on its sites. Is the Tánaiste incredulous that the labour laws allow ruthless exploiters of workers, whether Irish or migrant workers, to hide behind the courts and the laws of this land in having shameful truths suppressed?</p>
          <p eId="para_50">It is now clear from not only this but from many examples that vulnerable workers suffering low pay and or oppressive working conditions have no hope of a speedy vindication of their rights from current laws, which favour ruthless bosses who can buy the most expensive lawyers in town, hired guns, and in the meantime intimidate, sack or otherwise silence employees seeking their rights. The industrial relations machinery is totally inadequate to deal with that. Workers are being increasingly forced to find other ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">Workers at Global Mobile Vision, with serious allegations of wages paid late, harassment and bullying, approach the Independent section of the Technical Group, including Deputy Finian McGrath and myself, to try to expedite a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">A major multinational, General Electric, a partner of Gama, in Clonshaugh in north Dublin, sets up puppet companies so that it can set about a legal swindle to compel the IDA to pay it millions of euro for land belonging to the Irish people. It uses the proceeds of this sale to finance its puppet, Diamond Innovations, to force a redundancy deal on 50 workers, whom it bullies and pressurises into accepting, so it can replace them with cheap labour for its industrial diamond enterprises. What does the Minister, Deputy Martin, and the Government do? They rubberstamp this shameful deal.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">This neo-liberal jungle is heavily promoted by the Progressive Democrats and the Tánaiste but is inimical to workers. Will we have a speedy amendment to allow reports of shameful exploitation by the inspectors or otherwise to be published for the Irish people? More radically, will we have legislation providing a mechanism where ordinary workers can detail abuses they are suffering and enable them to get immediate redress, within a week or two, as speedily as the bosses can get their injunctions in the High Court for which they can well afford to pay? What is the Tánaiste's response to the urgent increasing need of Irish workers?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Tánaiste" eId="spk_41">
          <from>The Tánaiste</from>
          <p eId="para_54">We all have to abide by the decisions of the court. The High Court made a decision yesterday in regard to the inspectors' report on Gama, but the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment had already circulated that report to all the relevant authorities, including the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Revenue Commissioners and many others.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">As the Deputy is aware, labour law in Ireland applies to workers, whether they are Irish or foreign, in equal measure. Recently, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment greatly expanded the labour inspectorate. Therefore, it is not always a question of making more law but rather — similar to an earlier question — of enforcing existing laws. The Minister is certainly doing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">In regard to GMV, I understand that matter is being investigated and I am aware it was the subject of an Adjournment debate here last evening.</p>

          <p eId="para_57">The labour inspectorate did an excellent job in trying to out the truth in the Gama affair. I am talking about the rights of all workers, Irish and migrant. The laws under which the labour inspectorate work are totally inadequate. The workers are chasing justice 12 or 18 months down the road in the courts. In the meantime they have been harassed, bullied and sacked from their jobs by their employers. That is the position. Justice delayed in the case of vulnerable workers is justice denied.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">There is a new situation that will be fraught for Irish workers. Eastern European subcontractors are increasingly being used by some bosses in the construction industry to undercut trade union rates of pay and conditions. The Tánaiste welcomed this as a champion of the neo-liberal jungle. She wants workers' wages to be undercut and their conditions to be downgraded. The trade unions should have none of that and should launch a major drive to integrate migrant and Irish workers to defend trade union rates of pay and conditions. However, at the same time we need to force the Government to amend the legislation to provide immediate justice. Just as quickly as a boss can go into the High Court with €10,000 and get an injunction prohibiting workers from seeking their rights, we need such mechanisms that are amenable to Irish workers and all other workers here to secure justice. What is the Tánaiste's response?</p>

That is what I champion.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">We have strong laws in regard to unfair dismissal and constructive dismissal.

While I am always delighted to receive correspondence from the Ceann Comhairle, I would have preferred them to be in a more positive form. In order to facilitate the Ceann Comhairle and the Minister in future, a number of questions were refused on the basis that the Minister had no responsibility to the House. Two Bills are promised, one of which is to extend the remit of the Commission for Energy Regulation and to require it to comply with general policy directions of the Minister. I thought the Minister was supposed to do that anyway. The electronic communications (miscellaneous provisions) Bill is to provide access to broadcasting networks and delivery of contents services to all end users at retail level. Both Bills are the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and are eligible for reply in the House. I ask that these Bills be introduced in the House as a matter of urgency so the Ceann Comhairle is not forced to write to me informing me that my questions are out of order.</p>

Additional protection is offered to staff under the grievance procedure, which is a process that seeks to deal with the complaints of individual members of staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">The protections afforded to civil servants under these codes are certainly comparable to those offered to private sector employees who generally have access to an internal appeal and an independent external appeal in the form of the rights commissioner. Similarly, the Civil Service disciplinary code provides the right to an internal appeal mechanism and also to an independent appeals board.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">As the Bill will amend section 15 of the 1956 Act, it will be necessary to take account of changes to the section of the Act in the Civil Service disciplinary code. Consequently, a new disciplinary code is being drafted, which will be discussed and agreed with the Civil Service unions under the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration scheme. The new code will continue to place strong emphasis on the rights of individuals and will retain the right of the individual officer to an independent appeal in line with good practice in the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">For these reasons, I consider the disciplinary code and the grievance procedure negotiated under the conciliation and arbitration scheme are the appropriate mechanisms to specify the rights of individual officers to fair procedure. I am therefore unwilling to accept the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">The Minister of State seems to be developing a hybrid involving a mixture of internal guidelines for the regulation of disciplinary procedures within the public service along with the application of the Unfair Dismissals Act. To be consistent in that line, I would expect that the Minister of State would also introduce some new options for public servants to resort to the Industrial Relations Act or some of the other general labour Acts that protect employees. Why has the Minister of State decided to extend provisions on unfair dismissals, which is standard labour market practice but not extend to public sector workers other legislative protections, which are generally available to private sector workers? We will end up with a hybrid version with some reliance on internal procedures set out in guidelines and some reliance on the statutory code. My amendment would at least provide for statutory protection for the guidelines now in place. I ask the Minister of State to elaborate on the route he appears to be taking in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_250">Following discussions with the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the advice of the Office of the Attorney General, I have agreed to provide a separate part in the Bill, Part 3 — Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, to bring together a number of amendments which relate directly to the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. In particular, this will set out the tenure arrangements for the staff of that office. The changes, which I am proposing will not result in any significant change to the current policy under the Bill, but will instead clarify the position on the dismissal arrangements for certain key Oireachtas staff, by retaining certain protections currently set out in the legislation affecting these staff. I will explain the background.</p>
          <p eId="para_251">A process of consultation currently applies in respect of the dismissal of certain officers in the Houses of the Oireachtas, namely the Clerk of the Dáil, the Clerk Assistant of the Dáil, the Clerk of the Seanad, the Clerk Assistant of the Seanad, the Captain of the Guard and the Superintendent. This process is outlined in Acts of 1959 and 2003, which relate to the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Under these Acts, a dismissal of established Oireachtas officers may only take place following a recommendation to the Government from the relevant Chairman, such as the Ceann Comhairle in the case of the Clerk and the Clerk Assistant of the Dáil, the Cathaoirleach in the case of the Clerk and Clerk Assistant of the Seanad and both Chairmen in the case of the Captain of the Guard and the Superintendent, following consultation with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. Following discussions with the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission and the advice of the Attorney General, I have agreed that the current process of consultation relating to these officers should be retained in the Bill in recognition of the independence of those officers.</p>
          <p eId="para_252">The effect of the amendment will be to apply to dismissals in the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas the principle of devolved authority, which is one of the central provisions of the amendment Bill, and at the same time retain the process of consultation which is already set out for these officers in the 1959 and 2003 legislation. The proposed amendment supports the significant changes which were introduced as part of an overall series of reforms envisaged under the 2003 Act which is aimed at having a more accountable and better resourced parliamentary system. One of the key aims of the Act is to provide for a handover of the authority and responsibility for the provision of services to the Houses of the Oireachtas and their committees to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. This new arrangement for the Houses of the Oireachtas is in line with arrangements in a number of other parliaments in the EU and elsewhere and reflects the constitutional doctrine of the separation of powers.</p>
          <p eId="para_253">The amendment in this Bill is in line with the central thrust of that Act, which effectively transfers the authority and responsibility for the management of staff to the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission in a manner which is consistent with their constitutional position. The amendment will provide that the power to dismiss the Secretary General, who is also the Clerk of the Dáil, and the Clerk Assistant of the Dáil may be assigned by the Government to the Taoiseach, who may act on the recommendation of the Ceann Comhairle after consultation by him with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. Similarly in the case of the Clerk and Clerk Assistant of the Seanad, the dismissing authority may be also be assigned by the Government to the Taoiseach, who may act on the recommendation of the Cathaoirleach after consultation by him with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. In the case of the Captain of the Guard and the Superintendent, the dismissing authority will again be the Taoiseach, after consultation with the Chairman of Dáil Éireann, the Chairman of Seanad Éireann and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_254">There is no change proposed for other officers within the Oireachtas, other than that the arrangements for them will reflect the new devolved management structures elsewhere in the Civil Service. This means that officers at principal officer level and above will be dismissible by the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission — the relevant Minister for the purposes of the Act — on receipt of a recommendation from the Secretary General of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas, while officers below that level will be dismissible by the Secretary General of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. The proposed amendment therefore provides that the Government can assign the authority to dismiss specific officers in the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas as envisaged under the Bill. In addition, it allows the process of consultation which is provided for under the 1959 and 2003 Acts to be retained. The amendment represents no change for the dismissal of the majority of civil servants within the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, whose dismissals will in future be managed as envisaged under the Bill and in exactly the same way as other established civil servants.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">The provisions which I have outlined will be given effect by the text of amendment No. 22, which amends section 20 of the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act 1959. A further consequential amendment arising out of the new part is to ensure that the Secretary General of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas is treated in the same way as other Secretaries General for the purposes of the Act. Section 10 of the Bill currently amends section 15(6) of the Act to provide that officers either holding a position to which they were appointed by the Government or holding a position as a Revenue Commissioner, are not subject to the disciplinary sanctions set out in section 15. Under the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act 1959 and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003, the Secretary General of the Houses of the Oireachtas is appointed by the Taoiseach on the recommendation of the Chairman after consultation by him with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission. The office holder is therefore not automatically excluded from the provisions of section 15 in the way other Secretaries General are.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">I propose to provide in section 15(6) of the Act for the explicit exclusion of the Secretary General of the Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission from the measures set out in that section, in order to ensure that all Secretaries General are treated in a similar manner. It is necessary to make the technical changes provided for under amendments Nos. 11 and 12 to effect this change and to provide for the insertion of a new subparagraph (6)(<i>c</i>) into section 15 of the 1956 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">The remainder of the amendments in this grouping are technical and are needed to give effect to the provisions which I have set out here. Amendment No. 19 deletes the current section 14 of the Bill which provides that the dismissal of a member of staff at the grade of principal officer or above shall only be on the recommendation of the Secretary General. This provision is now replicated as part of the new Part 3 of the Bill. Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 delete the existing sections 15 and 16 of the Bill, while amendments Nos. 23 and 24 are required to move the existing sections 15 and 16 of the Bill and replicate them in the new Part 3 of the Bill.</p>

Was there consultation with all the individuals who might be affected by this change? What has been the response to those who are affected by the change? The House should be able to consider their views as well as those of the Minister. This is an unusual procedure as he is resubmitting an amendment on Committee Stage, but today is the last day for deliberation on the Bill. The House needs to hear a little more of the consultation that has gone on and the reasoning behind the change so we can be satisfied it is robust.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_221">
          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_261">It is happenstance that I am substituting for my colleague, Deputy Burton, but I am very interested in this matter. I support strongly the idea of devolving power away from the Executive regarding the affairs of the Oireachtas and handing the power over to the Oireachtas itself. However, the original Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act 2003 is lacking in a number of areas and was not robust enough. The Department of Finance loosens its grip slowly and there are overlaps in authority between the Department and the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission when making positive decisions on staffing matters. It is quite outrageous that a relatively junior official in the Department of Finance, such as a principal officer, can second guess the decision of the Oireachtas Commission, including the Ceann Comhairle. That is not good and it should not remain that way. There should be an oversight on public spending, but once the spending envelope is voted by this House, there should be complete discretion given to the House on how staffing is organised. However, that is for another day.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">Was there any discussion with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission on these proposals? The powers to dismiss senior officials in the Houses of the Oireachtas are to be devolved to the Taoiseach. Why is this the case? The Government currently has the authority to do so. If the devolution of authority to the Houses of the Oireachtas is to be effected, then surely the person in authority in this regard should be the appropriate Chairman of each House. According to the amendment, the Taoiseach is to act on the recommendation of the Chairman. Is such a recommendation binding or is there a discretion conferred on the Taoiseach? If it is binding, why is the Taoiseach allowed to exercise the authority rather than the Chairman of each House, as appropriate, acting on the advice of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission? We require clarity on these important issues before we proceed with the debate.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_222">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_263">I am conscious in seeking clarification and debating amendments that we are discussing an office the Minister of State holds outside the Chamber on behalf of the House which will be held <i>ex officio</i> by his successors. Having said that, perhaps the Minister of State can answer the question Deputy Howlin posed on the reasoning behind many of the changes under discussion. In his original contribution, the Minister of State claimed that he sought to protect the constitutional principle of separation of powers, a goal the validity of which every Member accepts. However, if one is talking about direct responsibility falling to a member of the Executive or being exercised on its behalf, questions must be asked as to how that entails a separation of powers. If anything, it represents a reabsorption of powers up the line rather than their wider distribution on behalf of the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Curious wording is used in the Bill to describe those positions for which the Taoiseach is the appropriate authority. It is provided that the Taoiseach can act in respect of the Clerk or Clerk Assistant of the Dáil on a recommendation and following consultation. The Minister of State might take the opportunity to clarify to what extent a recommendation shall be made. Will it be done formally or informally? What is meant by "consultation"? Will a consultation be a formal process in its own right? If, following consultation, it is clarified that a person should or should not be removed from a post, will it remain within the remit of the Taoiseach to revisit a decision? When the power reverts to the Taoiseach, will the officeholder be able to exercise it unilaterally to ignore a consultation process and insist that a person should lose his or her position? If that is the case, many will feel such a power should not rest with the Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">There will be many in the Civil Service who are unhappy that a Bill which deals with the service in its totality treats some civil servants differently from others. The general principle of separation of powers, however, is what makes the case for the approach. The Minister of State must explain the extent to which powers can and should be exercised by the new Houses of the Oireachtas Commission or officers acting on its behalf. If there is a difficulty, should not the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission legislation be strengthened, as Deputy Howlin has already suggested, to clarify legally the principle that the Houses should take care of their responsibilities?</p>

The Taoiseach is the appointing authority in respect of the Clerk of the Dáil or Seanad or Captain of the Guard, in consultation with the Ceann Comhairle or Chairman of the Seanad, and it is appropriate, therefore, that he should be the dismissing authority also.</p>

The provisions accord with existing legislation. As it is not appropriate for the Government to decide on the dismissal of a reasonably junior civil servant, the power will be devolved to Secretaries General. In the event of a requirement to dismiss a Secretary General or other senior officer, power will rest with the Minister or, in the case of the Oireachtas, with the Taoiseach, following consultation, as appropriate, with the Ceann Comhairle of the Dáil or Cathaoirleach of the Seanad.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_278">An issue on which clarification is being sought is the degree to which the Taoiseach has discretion. Will he be bound by the views of the Chair of either House or will he have discretion to deviate from their advice? According to the Minister of State, the appointments in question are made by the Taoiseach. I have not seen reference to such a provision in this or existing legislation in this area and presume it is a new measure. Is the provision set out in the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Act?</p>
          <p eId="para_279">The issue centres on whether the Taoiseach's role is that of a rubber stamp for the sake of legal convenience. If that is so, what is the legal convenience which requires the Taoiseach to act as the appropriate authority rather than the Houses of the Oireachtas? If the Taoiseach is more than a rubber stamp, what will limit his discretion to go beyond the actions recommended to him? Why are we deciding to refer to an outside individual and why does the Minister of State believe the authority should be vested in the Taoiseach rather than the Government?</p>
          <p eId="para_280">While authority rests with a Minister in respect of general service grades above principal officer, it rests with the Government in respect of the heads of scheduled offices. A different approach is being taken to senior grades in the Houses of the Oireachtas, in respect of whom the Taoiseach alone is the appropriate authority. He will act, however, on the recommendation of the Ceann Comhairle or Cathaoirleach. I am not entirely clear why, if an outside authority is needed, the Taoiseach rather than the Government is required to be involved in the circuit or why the Houses of the Oireachtas should not be responsible for its own affairs.</p>

          <p eId="para_283">Will the Taoiseach act, as the statute says, on the recommendation of the Clerk? As I asked originally, is a recommendation binding or discretionary? It is a question which has been posed by others since.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">Why involve the Taoiseach? If we are serious about the separation of powers, why is the Oireachtas not master of its own destiny in the management of its senior staff? There is a difficulty in the approach set out as one of the functions of the Houses is to hold the Government to account. As the procedures operated in the Houses are sometimes advised by the very people who will be subject to the provisions, it is not desirable to provide that the senior officers of the Houses can be dismissed by the head of the Government we are charged to hold to account. For Parliament to work transparently and best practice to be imbued in its workings, it is important that it is seen that the Government cannot sack anybody in regard to the operation of the House, only Parliament itself, acting through its commission or another mechanism that is within the overview and control of Parliament. I hope that is the direction in which we are moving. I do not understand why there is a need to have the Taoiseach involved in this.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">The Minister of State's reasoning is that under a different statute the Taoiseach appoints these officers. I would prefer an amendment to the effect that the commission would appoint senior members of staff on a consensus basis through the Members of the House and through our own procedures. That is the direction in which we should be heading, rather than still giving a role to the Executive <i>qua </i>Executive or worse still to the Taoiseach <i>qua</i> Taoiseach to hire and fire these most senior officials of the Houses of the Oireachtas, if Parliament is to be sovereign and independent of the Executive as the Minister of State said the Constitution requires.

          <p eId="para_290">He has to, as he is our only conduit. No one in this House represents us. The Minister of State has indicated that the consultation in regard to these provisions has taken place with a member of the commission who has a representational role on behalf of the Government parties. Can he confirm if direct and wide ranging consultation has taken place with the commission itself? If it has not, this process deserves further consideration. That consultation should be ongoing.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">Some of the provisions relate to a recommendation followed by consultation. One provision in particular relates only to consultation about the possible dismissal of the Superintendent and Captain of the Guard of the Houses of the Oireachtas. What constitutes consultation under these provisions which refer to the Taoiseach informing the Ceann Comhairle or the Cathaoirleach? Would the mere statement that a course of action is to be followed constitute consultation? Does consultation mean there must be some level of agreement or approval for the action being proposed? Who would initiate the action? Would it be the Taoiseach? Would the initiation be done through the House or the Office of the Ceann Comhairle or the Cathaoirleach? This is very unclear in section 20(1)(<i>c</i>). I would like the Minister of State to provide more clarity.</p>

I am certainly not aware of any such recommendation or discussion taking place at the commission. The net issue is that the Minister of State is now indicating the discretion will reside with the Taoiseach to hire and fire the senior officials of this House. That is not in the spirit of the separation of powers. I seek further clarity because what the Minister of State read out is not what is stated in amendment No. 19, which proposes the insertion of a new section 20 into the Staff of the Houses of the Oireachtas Act 1959.</p>

          <p eId="para_315">I am sorry. It is section 19, amendment No. 22. I beg your pardon. The new section 20(1)(<i>a</i>) of the 1959 Act would read: “In the case of a person who holds the office of Clerk or Clerk Assistant of Dáil Éireann, by the Taoiseach on the recommendation of the Chairman of Dáil Éireann, following consultation by that Chairman with the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission”. The question I asked was if that recommendation was binding on the Taoiseach but the Minister of State has said that the Taoiseach may act. That is not in the section, or is it? Section 20(1) states, “May as respects an established civil servant be exercised”. The power may be exercised by him on the recommendation of the Ceann Comhairle, which implies there is a discretionary power. Is the Minister of State confirming that after this amendment to the 1959 Act has been agreed, there will reside a discretionary power where in the unlikely event of firing — but we are obviously preparing for every eventuality — one of these most senior officials of the House on the recommendation of the Houses of the Oireachtas and the commission, such a recommendation is handed on to the Taoiseach. The actual decision resides with the Taoiseach alone. That is not good separation of powers. It leaves too much discretion with the Taoiseach. I ask the Minister to think again about that.</p>

I do not know whether the chairman or the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission is responsible, but I would have thought they would comprise the ultimate authority if there were to be a separation of powers. However, the Minister of State is stipulating that the Government is the ultimate authority. It may choose to delegate its responsibility to the Taoiseach, who may or may not act on the recommendations and consensus emerging from the Oireachtas. This seems to be a very strange way to run a railway.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">Perhaps the Minister of State was not privy to the consultation on this issue. From what he is saying, I have not gained an understanding of why this is the route we are taking. It may be that the commission did not want the power, thus resulting in the circumstances that now obtain. This is not entirely satisfactory given that we are on Report Stage and there will be nothing more we can do if we agree to the provisions today.</p>

          <p eId="para_365">These are significant changes in human resource management which will impact on the disciplinary procedure in the Civil Service. They provide that each Secretary General or head of a scheduled office will be responsible by virtue of being the appropriate authority for managing all matters pertaining to appointments, performance, discipline and dismissal of civil servants below principal officer level. Each Minister will be the appropriate authority for civil servants at and above principal officer level. Disciplinary action may be taken in cases of under-performance. The range of possible disciplinary sanctions will be broadened to include suspension without pay. Civil servants as office holders, other than those dismissed by Government, will be brought within the scope of the Unfair Dismissals Act and the Minimum Notice and Terms of Employment Act. In order to reflect these changes, a revised disciplinary code is being drawn up. It will be negotiated and agreed with the Civil Service unions under the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration scheme and will replace the existing disciplinary code.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">A number of specific provisions are set out in the legislation, which will be included in the disciplinary code, for example placing the civil servant at a lower rate of pay or reducing him or her to a lower grade or rank. Additionally, the code will contain a number of penalties that are currently being agreed under the Civil Service conciliation and arbitration scheme, for example formal verbal and written warnings, deferral of an increment and debarment from specified competitions or from promotion for a specified period of time, withdrawal of concessions and allowances, and transfer. The Office of the Attorney General has advised that legal authority be provided for any penalties included in the code agreed with the staff side, but which are not specifically spelt out in the legislation. The insertion of this provision in section 15 of the 1956 Act will allow for the creation and the application under the new disciplinary code of less serious sanctions than those set out in the legislation such as, for example, formal verbal and written warnings. This will be negotiated and agreed with the Civil Service unions under the conciliation and arbitration scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">Amendments Nos. 14 and 15 are technical amendments put forward by the Office of the Attorney General. These relate to sections 11 and 12 of the Bill which amend sections 19 and 16 of the 1956 Act, respectively. In the interests of continuity I propose to reverse the orders of sections 11 and 12 so the Bill will amend sections 16 and 19 of the 1956 Act in the correct sequence. This correction of the Bill will be effected by amendment No. 14, which deletes the current section 12. A further provision, amendment No. 15, will re-insert that text above the current section 11, thereby renumbering the text currently at section 11 as section 12. Amendments Nos. 16 and 16<i>a</i> propose changes to section 16. Section 16 of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956 currently provides that an officer shall not be paid remuneration in respect of any period of unauthorised absence from duty. It provides that if any question arises as to whether a particular period of absence from duty is a period of unauthorised absence, the question shall be determined by the appropriate authority. There was much debate on this issue on Committee Stage, and before I respond to the amendments proposed by Deputies Bruton and Burton it is important to clarify a number of points.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">The need to amend this section arose following a High Court ruling on 8 July 2003 in a case involving staff of the Department of Agriculture and Food. The court found that the refusal to perform certain duties in the context of that industrial dispute did not constitute an unauthorised absence from duty within the terms of section 16 as long as the staff concerned were physically present in the workplace, even though they were not carrying out their duties. The court also decided that management could not use the current section 16 of the 1956 Act to remove from the payroll officers who refused to perform core duties appropriate to their grades. The High Court ruling was upheld in an appeal to the Supreme Court by the Minister of Agriculture and Food and the Minister for Finance. In the light of this the Bill was amended on Committee Stage in order to provide in the 1956 Act the power to remove from the payroll officers who refused to perform the full range of duties of their grades. The amendment does not change the provisions in relation to situations where there is a physical absence from the workplace. The existing position is that a civil servant is not paid for a period where there is unauthorised absence from work due to industrial action or where a person is not on annual leave, sick leave or other forms of leave which have been approved. The amendment does not give management any new powers as regards circumstances of this kind involving a physical absence from the workplace. It is designed to deal with a situation where a person is physically present in the workplace, but refuses to perform his or her duties as part of a campaign of industrial action. This may arise where the industrial action involves a refusal to perform certain duties while remaining in the workplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">Until recently, the understanding, based on legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General, was that the reference in section 16 of the Civil Service Regulation Act 1956 to "an unauthorised absence from duty" covered the situation where a person was physically present in the workplace, but was refusing to carry out his or her duties. However, the recent decision means clarification is required. Following consultations with the Office of the Attorney General the text was included, on Committee Stage. Concern was expressed on Committee Stage regarding the penalties provided for under the amendment. The amendment provides only for temporary removal from the payroll for the period of the refusal to carry out the duties of the grade. It does not provide for any other penalties. This is an important point because the High Court judgment in the Department of Agriculture and Food case indicated that action should have been taken under section 15 of the Act. If such a situation were to again arise, and section 16 remained as currently drafted, management would otherwise be required to impose penalties arising from disciplinary action.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">It is also important to confirm that the Civil Service unions were informed of the proposed amendment and that no objections were raised. As regards the proposed amendment, it is important to emphasise that the text which I am proposing echoes the original section 16(2) of the 1956 Act, in allowing the appropriate authority discretion in deciding whether an action or omission of an officer shall amount to an unauthorised absence. Any decision as to whether an officer has reasonable excuse to refuse to carry out certain duties is therefore a matter to be considered by the appropriate authority in the context of making a decision as to whether an officer is taking an unauthorised absence from work. Should the officer dispute the decision taken by the appropriate authority, he or she has the opportunity to consult with the representative trade union and to make representations to the appropriate authority on the matter. The proposed amendment is intended to deal with a situation arising from industrial action. A civil servant refusing to perform duties as part of industrial action, is likely to consider that he or she has a reasonable excuse for so doing, in industrial relations terms. Equally, it is reasonable for the employer to stop paying the civil servant while the industrial action continues.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">In addition, it is a fundamental principle of administrative law that one may assume the powers conferred by statute are to be exercised in a manner that is consistent with constitutional rights and principles of fair procedure. Any attempt by a decision making authority to thwart those principles will be considered <i>ultra vires</i>, that is, outside the powers bestowed on that decision maker by the statute in question.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">Finally, I want to address the proposal that there should be an appeal against the decision of the appropriate authority. It is not feasible to provide for a formal appeal mechanism before removal from payroll, as management must be able to act quickly. Otherwise the employer would be unfairly disadvantaged in an industrial action situation. The reality is that there can be an appeal after staff have been removed from the payroll, and restoration of pay can be sought. There is no need for specific provisions for this to be made in the legislation as there is nothing to prevent representations being made to the appropriate authority by unions or staff about removal from payroll. Where a person feels that a decision maker has exercised his or her powers in an unreasonable manner, it is, of course, open to unions or staff to seek a judicial review. This avenue is open to officers who wish to have the decision of the appropriate authority reviewed by a third party, should resolution not be possible through the internal mechanism I have set out. All of these forms of appeal may be taken only after staff have been removed from payroll, while still allowing staff to respond quickly to industrial action. In the light of these points I do not accept the proposed amendments Nos. 16 and 16<i>a</i>.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_384">While I accept most of the Minister of State's arguments, the position remains unclear in respect of an application for a review of a decision once an industrial dispute ends. The Minister of State appeared to indicate that a mechanism would be available to allow a person to appeal a decision following a dispute but it was unclear what form it would take. He then referred to the use of applications for judicial review, which are not a satisfactory instrument for appealing decisions of this nature. Did I miss a link in the Minister of State's contribution? Will a person adversely affected by a decision who believes the appropriate authority wrongly interpreted a case have an opportunity, under the Civil Service code to which the Minister of State referred, to access an internal appeal process?</p>
          <p eId="para_385">The only outstanding issue is the need to ensure that individuals have a reasonable right to question an interpretation which may have been taken by a superior in deciding that a person was involved in an industrial action. It appears that no proper appeal procedure is available after a decision has been taken.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_314">
          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_386">While I understand the logic of the Minister of State's comments and accept the thrust of his intentions, he has taken an odd approach to this issue. If his amendment is accepted, the section will read: "A period when a civil servant refuses to carry out the duties of his grade shall as respects the civil servant concerned be considered to be a period of unauthorised absence from duty." Rather than engaging in the pretence that a person is determined to be absent if he or she is not doing precisely as instructed, surely it is possible to provide that failure to do one's duty is a breach of discipline. However convenient the provision may be in terms of dovetailing with existing legislation, it appears to be a bizarre device in providing that a civil servant who does not do precisely as instructed — he or she could be doing other things — is deemed to be absent from duty.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">If the Minister of State chooses to take the route outlined in his amendment, will he explain his reasons for choosing this option rather than the more logical approach of simply creating a disciplinary issue for not obeying an instruction? If he adopts this approach, a saver clause will be necessary, such as that proposed in amendment No. 16 in the name of Deputy Burton which proposes to insert after the word "refuses" on page 13 the words "without reasonable excuse". There may be reasons other than those cited by the Minister of State for not carrying out an instruction. For example, an instruction could be improper or health reasons such as exposure to stress could arise. As the recent debate on health and safety legislation demonstrated, a worker may have a myriad of lawful reasons for refusing to take a certain action, including, for example, a belief that it will put him in physical or psychological danger or expose him to undue stress. If the Minister of State proceeds on the route he mapped out, a saver clause such as that proposed in amendment No. 16 is required, notwithstanding the availability of appeals mechanisms under the normal agreements with the trade union movement.</p>

        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_315">
          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_388">I, too, accept the thrust of the Minister of State's argument regarding amendment No. 14. The renegotiation and restructuring of the Civil Service-wide code of practice provides a good opportunity to explain the position with regard to civil servants who have been suspended or temporarily removed from the payroll. Are they subject to the same conditions as those who leave or retire from the Civil Service through a formal process in terms of acquiring other types of remuneration or employment? I have in mind a specific case arising from the Moriarty tribunal and reported in the media yesterday of a senior civil servant who, following retirement, worked for a person about whose tax affairs he had previously made a favourable decision. What will be the position of a person who has been removed from the payroll, forced to leave or temporarily suspended from the Civil Service as regards working with persons on whose affairs he or she has made or will make decisions in the course of his or her normal employment? The Bill is unclear in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">The current code provides that two years must elapse before a civil servant who leaves a senior position may take up a position in the private sector. We are entering a new phase in that we are legislating for temporary absence and cases involving people who have been dismissed rather than retired from their positions. In any case, the two year period between leaving the Civil Service and taking on a new position is much too short and should probably be extended to five years. Will the Minister of State indicate the Government's position in this regard? Does the legislation address the issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_390">I am uncertain as to the reasons the Minister of State believes amendments Nos. 16 and 16<i>a </i>compromise his proposal, given that both amendments appear to strengthen his position by reaffirming the need for independent arbitration when decisions are taken. As Deputy Bruton indicated, it is possible that he has been unable to identify the internal process available to those who have been removed from the payroll. An internal mechanism is not, however, the type of process required by natural justice. Independent third party arbitration is needed for decisions of this nature. Will the Minister of State provide greater clarity as to the internal mechanisms which exist and whether they can be considered independent?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" eId="spk_316" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_391">As I stated, we have learnt from the court judgment, subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court, which ruled that, under section 16 of the current Act, the Department may not remove from the payroll staff who are physically present in the workplace, even if they are not performing their duties. This is an unsatisfactory position. As Deputies will recall, the case in question involved individuals in the Department of Agriculture and Food whose duties were to issue payments to farmers. While they may have carried out other duties and been present in the workplace every day, they did not issue cheques. They knew their action would produce a reaction and ministerial involvement to resolve the issue. The outcome of this court case is the reason the wording included in the amendment specifically covers the requirement on individuals to fulfil their duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">On the issue of appeal mechanisms, while persons removed from the payroll have no right to appeal at the point of removal, thereafter they have the right to make representations to the appropriate authority, whether a trade union or staff. They may also raise matters at special meetings of the conciliation and arbitration scheme. The Bill, therefore, affords a right of appeal and provides two different avenues to seek redress. I am sure any ongoing industrial dispute will be taken into account when decisions are taken on the actions of individuals. It is important that the appropriate Departments should be entitled to remove people from the payroll to provide sanction on them if they are not carrying out their full duties.</p>

Equally, it is reasonable for the employer to stop paying the civil servant while the industrial action continues.

The best advice we have arising from the court decision is that our terminology on the absence of duty is sufficient.</p>

          <p eId="para_395">The Minister of State is going his own way and I will not delay the House by taking issue with him. It is always dangerous, however, to craft law according to one case. The section will apply where someone is not carrying out the duties assigned to him by way of industrial dispute or protest but it applies in other areas as well. That is the nature of drafting statute. There should be a saver clause because the refusal to carry out an instruction when it will put a person at risk, leave him open to bullying or the instruction is improper should be entertained and that is why I suggested it.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The Minister of State's difficulty with the saver clause is that it might be a reasonable excuse to follow the instruction of the trade union, something with which I agree. That said, the wording in the Bill is so narrow as to leave the possibility of sanction for people who have decided not to carry out an instruction for a proper reason other than following the instructions of a trade union in an industrial dispute. I am concerned about the baldness of the wording without the saver clause.</p>

          <p eId="para_414">This is an anti-bullying measure that was discussed at length by Deputy Burton on Second and Committee Stages. It is an extremely serious issue that involves every workplace. We cannot assume any workplace is free of bullying and we need not only clear guidelines and working practices but anti-bullying measures in statute law. There is a code of conduct and a code of practice and people have addressed the issue of bullying in the Civil Service in a serious and structured way. If we are serious about the issue, however, we should refer to it in the statute and be clear that it has the force of law, not just a code of conduct. I hope the Minister of State has had the opportunity to reflect on the matter since Deputy Burton first alluded to it on Second Stage and that the amendment will be accepted.</p>

          <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_415">I support the amendment. It is important that a signal is sent out when the Bill is passed. Unfortunately, we see incidents of bullying with unacceptable frequency, with psychological bullying and intimidation where people feel their prospects of advancing in their careers are being hindered. It is important that a statement of this nature is included. Bullying is becoming especially prevalent within semi-State bodies and we must send this message out clearly in a legislative form.</p>

          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_416">The Civil Service, since May 2000, has operated a comprehensive policy on harassment, sexual harassment and bullying, entitled A Positive Working Environment, which was agreed with the Civil Service unions. The policy emphasises the right of every employee to carry out his duties free from any form of harassment, sexual harassment or bullying and commits the Civil Service to the development and maintenance of a working environment where all employees are treated with respect and dignity. The detailed policy document emphasises the responsibility of managers in ensuring that all staff are made aware of and comply with the policy and outlines the appropriate courses of action to be taken where a complaint of bullying and-or harassment is made by an officer.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">The policy provides for the investigation of complaints by a person unconnected to the parties to the complaints and for the right to apply for a review of the outcome of that investigation by a third party who is chosen with the agreement of the unions and the personnel officer where either party to the complaint is not satisfied with the conduct or outcome of that investigation. The policy is clear that where a complaint is upheld, the personnel officer must consider whether in view of the nature of the complaint and the contents of the investigating officer's report, the subject of the complaints should be subjected to disciplinary sanction. Where this is the case, the full rigours of the disciplinary code apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">The Bill provides the framework within which conduct and performance issues will be dealt with in the Civil Service and makes provision for the imposition of a range of disciplinary actions where allegations of misconduct have been upheld. It is normal practice in employment to develop internal procedures and policies in negotiation with staff unions to give practical effect to legislative provisions. The internal policies provide detailed procedures that ensure management maintains satisfactory standards of conduct and performance and staff are provided with access to procedures whereby alleged failures to comply with these standards may be fairly and sensitively addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">These internal procedures and policies are in line with codes of practice issued by the Labour Relations Commission under the Industrial Relations Act 1990 on grievance and discipline and codes of practice issued by the Health and Safety Authority on bullying and harassment. The procedures are kept under review in partnership with staff unions to ensure compliance with the codes of practice issued under the Safety, Health and Welfare At Work Act 1989, the Industrial Relations Act 1990 and the Employment Equality Acts 1998 and 2004. I am not prepared to accept this amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_336">
          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_420">I am disappointed the Minister of State will not accept the amendment. There is a good anti-bullying code of practice in the Civil Service. Why is the Minister of State reluctant to give it legal acknowledgement? The amendment is reasonable in proposing to insert "that the Minister will take measures to ensure that a ... code of practice to combat bullying and harassment is enforced in respect of all civil servants to whom this Act will apply". That it be kept under regular review is a reasonable request. That non-compliance with the code will be deemed to be a misconduct is also a reasonable request.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">We are becoming more aware of the seriousness of the issue of bullying for the well-being of a range of workers. It would be an indication of how serious the House regards this matter if there was a reference to it in statute law. Is the Minister of State against that and, if so, why? To claim there is already a good code of practice and, therefore, it does not need to be referred to in the Bill is not a reason. The fact that a good code exists is all the more reason it should be referred to in statute law.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_549">3.—References in the Principal Act to the Minister for Education and Science shall be construed as references to the Taoiseach.".</p>
          <p eId="para_550">As we discussed on Committee Stage, the purpose of this amendment is to transfer the work of the commission to the Department of the Taoiseach from the Department of Education and Science. The reason is we believe it is inappropriate that the Department of Education and Science should be the sponsoring body for the legislation. It is also the central Department in regard to the various investigations being undertaken by the commission. The former chairperson of the commission, Ms Justice Laffoy, indicated that during her tenure, it was having a great deal of difficulty getting information from the Department, particularly in regard to the discovery of documents. That is documented in Ms Justice Laffoy's letters to the Department and in her letter of resignation from the commission. That is one aspect of the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_551">The other aspect is a more general one in that it is inappropriate that a Department being investigated, albeit for things which occurred in the past, should be the one providing the support, finance and the legislative backing for the investigations. The spokespersons from three of the Opposition parties have tabled this amendment which shows unity of purpose in this regard and the view of the Opposition that it is not appropriate that the Department of Education and Science should sponsor this legislation and play such an integral part in the investigations.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_344">
          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_552">I repeat what I said on Committee Stage. This amendment is fundamental to the Bill. It is important to remember the Department of Education and Science is being investigated, which is quite unusual. The Minister said on Committee Stage and previously that the issues under investigation happened a number of years ago, with which I agree. However, it is important to remember Ms Justice Laffoy's criticisms are quite recent — they were made in the lifetime of this Dáil. She found the Department obstructed the work of the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">We all hope a new era has dawned, that the Department's attitude towards the commission has changed and that Mr. Justice Ryan is receiving greater co-operation than his predecessor, Ms Justice Laffoy. However, we cannot take that in good faith. While this is in no way a criticism of the Minister, it is wrong that the Department of Education and Science is the sponsoring Department for this legislation. That has shown up the difficulties. Had it not been the sponsoring Department during the tenure of Ms Justice Laffoy, the situation may have been different. Her criticisms were wide-ranging and serious and that must be remembered.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">I intend to press this amendment. As I said at the time of Ms Justice Laffoy's resignation, the Department of the Taoiseach would be a far more appropriate Department. It is also important to remember that many of the victims have expressed a lack of faith in the capacity of the Department of Education and Science to be the sponsoring Department. However, the fundamental issue is that the Department itself is being investigated in regard to actions over many decades and, in a sense, more recently.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_346">
          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
          <p eId="para_556">This issue has been dealt with on a number of occasions and, as I said then, the position of the Department of Education and Science is very similar to other Departments sponsoring tribunals of inquiry, whether the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, etc. I know the Deputies have said it is quite different in so far as the Department of Education and Science is almost a respondent.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">We took on board the criticisms from Ms Justice Laffoy and enormous change has taken place in the meantime, which has been recognised by the commission chairman, Mr. Justice Ryan. He recognises that the Department is responding very quickly to his requests for resources etc. There has been no difficulty in the relationship between the Department and the judge and the commission. It should also be noted that the third report acknowledged that some of the difficulties were caused, or were contributed to, by the commission in that, for example, there was not sufficient clarity in the direction as to what was sought or insufficient time was being allowed for compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Undoubtedly, things have moved on, including from the point of view of the money being provided. Some €10 million has been given to the commission for administration costs and a further €21 million has been provided for administration in the Estimates for this year and for the next two years. The commission has a staff of 53, all of whom were put in place very quickly at its request. We have also addressed any of the recommendations it has made to address any difficulties in the past. The Department recognises that this requires dedicated, substantial staffing and administrative resources, which have all been put in place to ensure we comply with the discovery directions.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">The role of the Department as a respondent is quite clear and separate from it being a sponsoring body. Being the sponsor does not interfere with it taking its responsibilities very seriously. We are working very closely with the commission. It would only serve to delay matters further if this was to move to a different Department. We all want to ensure the work is carried out speedily and efficiently and that is what is happening at present. There is a good working relationship between us. It serves no purpose to try to move this to the Department of the Taoiseach because it would only be for optics and would affect the work of the commission.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_347">
          <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_560">We all accept the Minister is doing her best to ensure her Department complies with everything the commission requires and, as Deputy Enright said, we are not talking about the current Minister. However, we are talking about a principle whereby a Department is sponsoring a commission of inquiry in which it is directly involved and which is investigating it. We are concerned about that principle.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">None of us in the Opposition wants to delay the operations of the commission but I do not see why transferring it to the Department of the Taoiseach would delay its operations in so far as there is agreement on what needs to be done. There has been a great deal of detailed consultation. I do not believe moving it to another Department would delay it. The principle of allowing a Department to be involved in investigating itself is a bad one. It is not something we should include in legislation in the future. The sponsoring Department should be at a distance from the activities being investigated. They are very serious activities in terms of the responsibilities of the Department in the past and its direct role in putting young people into institutions in which they were abused. The Department had that supervisory role and failed thousands of children. It is a serious matter of principle.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_348">
          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_562">I appreciate that as the Minister said, things have moved on. However, if the Department of Education and Science was again of a mind to be less than helpful to the commission, there is no guarantee this would not happen again. That is why we are trying to ensure it is moved.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">I reject outright what the Minister said about delay. The most important thing is that we get this right. It is more than a year and a half since my party leader and I first raised the issue of moving this to the Department of the Taoiseach. Ms Justice Laffoy resigned in September 2003. If there has been delay, it certainly has not been on our part. We have waited a year and a half for this legislation to reach this stage. There was adequate time to make this change. There have been instances where legislation has been brought forward quite quickly on occasions when it suited the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">To cite that acceptance of this amendment would cause a delay is not a valid reason for not accepting it. It is important that tactic is not used. It would not necessarily have to take a long time for such a transition to take place. Such a transition would be in the best interests of the victims involved, of getting at the truth and of ensuring that the Department of Education and Science co-operates fully with the commission in the same way as would a witness giving evidence to it. However, that has not happened up to now, but we hope it will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">The Minister referred to other tribunals but this inquiry is different. The Department has made considerable discovery at this stage. However, we still must guarantee, through this legislation, that everything is done in the best possible manner. Moving responsibility for this matter to another Department is the best possible way of dealing with it.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_566">This matter was raised a number of times by Deputies from all parties. I raised it in the House two years ago and in committee with the then Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, in terms of trust and transparency in regard to the Department of Education and Science and its role as well as that of other Departments such as the Department of Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">The survivors still have huge mistrust of certain officials within the Department of Education and Science and their ability to provide the whole truth and nothing but the truth. The Department of the Taoiseach would command much more respect and recognition in terms of seeking to do a job. That is not taking from the Minister's role in trying to push matters forward. I agree with what the other Deputies said. This is not about causing a delay but about doing what is right. If we reflect on other issues debated in this House in recent weeks, for example, the role of the few bad eggs in the Garda Síochána in Donegal and the need for independent investigation of Garda Síochána activities, the same principle applies here. Self-regulation is no regulation. This is an opportunity to put matters right in the legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_568">I remain to be convinced that a change of name would make a positive difference to the working of the commission. Dedicated staff are working on it in this Department and there is dedicated funding for it. The relationship is good and the process is working extremely well. Were we to change it at this stage, we would have to brief a new group of civil servants and probably have to transfer staff from the Department of Education and Science to the Department of the Taoiseach, and the same people would end up dealing with it. Therefore, this proposal makes no sense. I appreciate from where the Deputies are coming, but if the system is not broken why try to fix it?</p>

          <p eId="para_573">The Minister said that. She said in her opening remarks that she remained to be convinced that such a change would make a difference. It will make a big difference to the victims. They want to be sure that this matter is investigated to the fullest extent and that everything that happened comes out. They want to have absolute confidence in this process. The fact that we are back here amending legislation proves that the system was broken and needed to be fixed. The victims want absolute confidence and faith in this process and the proposed change would make a difference to them. They are the ones who matter, not only the Minister. I wanted to clarify that.</p>

        his plans to deal with the problems facing the scallop industry in the south east (details supplied); and if he will make a statement on the matter.
        [20111/05]

          <speech by="#PatTheCope" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_357">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
            <p eId="para_688">Since January, officials of the Department and I have held a number of meetings with fishermen and processors from the south east who are engaged in the scallop industry. I am keenly aware of the problems facing this sector which are not related solely to fishing effort limits but also to additional challenges posed by high fuel costs and the impacts of implementing the mandatory EU safety requirements for some of these boats.</p>
            <p eId="para_689">The capping of fishing effort is one of the key ways in which we can conserve fish stocks for the benefit of future generations of fishermen. Scallop stocks off our south-eastern coast have declined in recent years. The decision in 2003 to limit fishing effort on scallops as well as for demersal stocks generally was driven by sound conservation reasons and was supported at that time by the Irish fishing industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">The need to achieve a better balance between fleet size and available fishing entitlements has been apparent for some time, particularly in the whitefish sector for which I launched a decommissioning scheme in April. Last Friday, I announced a review of the overall need for decommissioning. This will involve an assessment of the need and extent of the decommissioning requirement for the various demersal and shellfish fleets, including scallops and mussels. This review is to be completed by the end of June and will give an important overall perspective. It will examine the various issues, including eligibility for decommissioning aid where strict EU rules apply. I cannot pre-empt the outcome of this review. It is a planned and structured approach and I look forward to receiving the report at the end of this month.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_358">
            <from>Mr. Perry</from>
            <p eId="para_691">I note the encouragement given by the Department for the development of the scallop industry, the additional licences granted and the encouragement given to people to invest heavily in new fleet. The announced decommissioning was to include scallop fishing. Why was it not included?</p>
            <p eId="para_692">With regard to the appointment of Mr. White on 30 June, will the Government take on board whatever compensation is recommended? I have no doubt that decommissioning is at the core of this issue. Will the Government have the resources to meet Mr. White's recommendations?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_359" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
            <p eId="para_693">A moratorium was introduced in 1999 on the basis that the kilowatt days to be introduced subsequent to that would be based on 1998 to 2002 period. The kilowatt days available this year are somewhat similar to the 2002 figure. I understand the point made by Deputy Perry that the fleet has grown since 2002, particularly in 2003. The moratorium was placed on the acceptance of applications and in 2003 it was decided that those applications on hand, providing they complied with the conditions and criteria, would be approved.</p>
            <p eId="para_694">The kilowatt days are affected because the stocks off the south-east coast have declined and the boats must travel to the English Channel fishing grounds. Members will be aware that fishing days are counted from the time a boat leaves port until it returns and this is the principle accepted in Europe. If fishing days were available off the south-east coast, we would not be in this position.</p>
            <p eId="para_695">I am pleased that Padraig White, former chief executive of the IDA, accepted my invitation to work with the general industry, including the scallop fishing sector. I suggest we await his report.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_360">
            <from>Mr. Perry</from>
            <p eId="para_696">With regard to kilowatt days, the Minister of State referred to 55 days but pressure from the banks lasts 365 days for those who invested heavily as a result of the encouragement given by the Department. What is to become of the proposal put forward by the south-east fishermen in light of the serious negotiations which took place with the Department prior to the appointment of Mr. White? The people in the south east do not want a stop-gap because they are under significant financial pressure and they want assistance.</p>

          <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" eId="spk_361">
            <from>Mr. Kehoe</from>
            <p eId="para_697">I hope the Minister of State is not buying time.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_362" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
            <p eId="para_698">The Deputy obviously pre-empted my reply. I am not in the business of buying time. After 24 years in this House I am not in the business of trying to deceive anybody. I was dealing with the facts of 2003 and the decision did not result from December of last year. There should be no ambiguity about that and December this year will not resolve it either. It is something which we all bought into in 2003. The 4.8 is a proposal which was made by the south and east fishermen and there are many good aspects to their proposals which I could accept. I acknowledge the work of their chief executive and some of them are quite sensible.</p>
            <p eId="para_699">It is a fact that decommissioning is written into the national development plan. It is €8.8 million over the next three years to be approved by Brussels with fairly strict criteria. It focuses on species of fish which must be fished by a limited quota whereas, ironically, there is no quota and no catch limit on scallop fishing. The effort limit is approximately 80% of the effort limit in force in 2003. I acknowledge it is not enough and I would be much happier if there were more days but it is the distance from the fishing grounds that has created the serious problem for us.</p>
            <p eId="para_700">I look forward to working in partnership with the representatives of the industry and with Mr. White to try to overcome the difficulties. I am the first to acknowledge that fishermen face serious difficulties and I want to work with them to find a resolution. I took the only decision that could be taken which was to introduce a number of days between 25 May and 15 June and another series of days have been introduced from 15 June onwards to ensure continuity. I also considered the consistency of landings and the interests of processors.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_363">
            <from>Mr. Perry</from>
            <p eId="para_701">Is the Minister of State aware that 30 June is the final date for scallop fishermen to comply with EU safety regulations? The Minister of State is quite new to the job. Is he aware that in light of the poor performance of the aquaculture sector of the national development plan, the Government has failed to deliver the NDP objectives? Is there a possibility of a compensation fund for those heavily burdened with debt and suffering significant financial pressure as we speak?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_364" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
            <p eId="para_702">I have asked Padraig White to consider all these factors. As an indication of the urgency with which this matter is being treated, I spoke to the fishermen and Friday and Saturday and Mr. White was in the south east on Monday and yesterday to familiarise himself with the situation. I look forward to receiving his report and hope we can eventually reach a satisfactory conclusion. I am aware of the importance of 30 June. Unfortunately I have no control over that date as a European directive defines the standards for vessels of more than 24 metres. Deputies Perry and Broughan along with others have been very helpful in assisting me on Committee Stage to deal with all the other vessels that are smaller than 24 metres. I hope the House will decide to give me the authority to allow more time. Unfortunately I do not appear to have the authority to make such an extension. However, this matter does not just relate to 24-metre scallop fishing vessels, it relates to 24-metre vessels regardless of the type and species of fish. I am aware of the issue and I will work with the Deputy.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_704">I have no function in this matter, as the companies mentioned by the Deputy are private companies. In my capacity as Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources I have no role inapproving the ownership of companies that provide broadcasting services to the public on a subscription basis nor do I license such companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_705">I have made clear in the past that I am of the opinion that Irish viewers will be best served by a broadcasting environment that includes a strong public service broadcasting presence in the form of RTE and an independent TG4, together with private broadcasters. As the uptake of digital television services continues to grow, Irish broadcasters will face increased competition from trans-frontier broadcasters. I expect that Irish broadcasters will continue to seek to reach Irish audiences through a variety of platforms. Currently Irish broadcasters reach their audiences through a combination of platforms including terrestrial, cable, MMDS and satellite. Technological advances are likely to present broadcasters with new opportunities for reaching their audiences and it is to be expected that Irish broadcasters will avail of such opportunities across all available platforms.</p>

          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_366">
            <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_706">In the history of communications in the State we have got at least two major decisions wrong. Some 20 years ago we allowed the cable network to be acquired by RTE and Telecom Éireann, which effectively meant the cable platform was taken over between two other platforms. The kind of developments that took place in Belgium, France and many other countries even including the United States became impossible. Is this not a matter about which the Minister should be concerned?</p>
            <p eId="para_707">Is it in the public interest that the same individual, namely John Malone of Liberty Global, should be in a position to acquire control over the entire cable platform in Ireland while at the same time being the most significant shareholder, after the Murdoch family, in News Corporation, the entity that controls BskyB.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#SeamusPattison" as="#Leas-Cheann_Comhairle" eId="spk_367">
            <from>An Leas-Cheann Comhairle</from>
            <p eId="para_708">It is not appropriate to name people in the House.</p>

          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_368">
            <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_709">Media correspondents in <i>The Irish Times</i> and <i>Irish Independent</i> and others have covered this matter. As the Minister knows this individual is known as the “cable cowboy”. In reality this cable cowboy will control the entire cable platform. The Minister made a fair point in saying we would have a united cable platform. However, in addition he is the second largest shareholder in BskyB in the satellite platform. Does this not therefore allow for a repetition of the mistake made by the Minister’s predecessor 20 years ago and the mistake made by another Minister a few years ago with the sale of Eircom?</p>
            <p eId="para_710">I have also asked questions of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on this point. Is it not the responsibility of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to initiate a Competition Authority investigation? Is it not true, as we have been informed by the media, that an elaborate financial warehousing operation was mounted by John Malone of Liberty Global whereby Morgan Stanley appears to take over NTL to preclude an investigation by the Competition Authority? Is this not a very serious matter affecting competition in our telecommunications industry? In Austria Liberty Global is operating a triple play. We have a television network, pay television, a phone roll out and a broadband roll out. Is it not important to ensure that both platforms be kept distinct?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_369" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_711">The Deputy has raised many questions and issues that are not of direct relevance to the question he tabled and not of direct relevance to my role as Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. As he has pointed out this issue may possibly be one for the Competition Authority. As the Deputy knows the Competition Authority is independent and has undertaken many investigations into matters of competition in a variety of areas without any prompt or direction from the Minister, which is as it should be.</p>
            <p eId="para_712">Any competition concerns raised are unlikely to focus on the competition between broadcasters and rather on the impact on consumers who purchase pay television packages. It is difficult to see how platform ownership issues could impact negatively on broadcasters, which is the area for which I have responsibility. There may be an exception in one area. If the owners of a platform were to act in a discriminatory manner by refusing to carry certain companies' broadcasts, those broadcasters could seek a remedy through competition law. However, that is a matter for the Competition Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_713">When Cablelink, which became NTL, was in State ownership it had a record of non-investment before being sold. Having such an entity in public ownership or ownership other than private ownership does not automatically ensure that investment will take place or that it will benefit the consumer.</p>

            <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_714">The Minister is in office at a critical moment in the history of Irish telecommunications. While it may not become apparent for many years to come, would it not be very serious for us if, in effect, the entire cable platform and satellite platform had the broadcasting market cornered as we move into the era of digital television? I am still awaiting answers from the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. I again ask the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment under sections 16 and 23 of the Competition Act 2002 to investigate the manner in which this transaction has taken place, focusing on the financial warehousing operated by Liberty Global and Morgan Stanley on behalf of the famous cable cowboy, John Malone. It should also investigate whether this is a constraint on media competition under the terms of section 23. When asked what shaped his political strategy, Harold McMillan answered, "Events, dear boy, events." Events in this case could mean that a large part of our broadcasting, cable, broadband and phone network is being taken over by a single company representing a major economic force. The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is the man on the bridge and has responsibility. He should ask the Competition Authority to investigate. The Minister should also investigate the consequence of this for our telecommunications market.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_717">I have no function in the setting of pricing for phone services. The regulation of telecommunications operators, including pricing for mobile services, is the responsibility of the Commission for Communications Regulation, or ComReg, in accordance with the requirements of the Communications (Regulation) Act 2002 and regulations made under the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications.</p>
            <p eId="para_718">Earlier this year I welcomed the publication of a joint ComReg and Ofcom report which was published in January 2005 on cross-Border telecommunications issues. The report covers cross-Border mobile telephone roaming. I am delighted that ComReg and Ofcom have adopted a common approach to tackle this issue of mutual concern to businesses and the public on both sides of the Border. On 24 March 2005 I issued a press release with my Northern Irish ministerial counterpart, Mr. Barry Gardiner MP, following a joint meeting with ComReg and Ofcom, which expressed concern at mobile phone customers being caught by roaming mobile signals along the Border and incurring international charges for what they think are national calls.</p>
            <p eId="para_719">I support the report's call for the mobile operators to enter into joint arrangements on a cross-Border basis to offer customers all-island tariffs. While I acknowledge that a number of operators already offer all-island tariff options, it is disappointing that where these are available they are limited to bill-paying customers and business contracts. I would like to see all-island rates extended to pay-as-you-go mobile users who represent around 70% of the mobile customer base. I appreciate that entering into such arrangements would involve business decisions which are a matter for the operators.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">I have already taken the opportunity in meetings with the operators to raise this issue and will continue to do so. I will also raise the issue with the new Northern Ireland Minister concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_721">The Commission for Communications Regulation and the Northern Ireland communications regulator issued a report in January 2005, as the Minister stated. They were established in 2004 and were set up to examine solutions to inadvertent roaming charges. Despite all the spin, promises and reports, little has been done. A token gesture has been made to business people who can well afford to pay the charges. Two companies provide most of the services, O2 and Vodafone. For prepaid phones, customers pay at least 56 cent roaming charges to make or take a call, while O2 charges 59 cent per minute. This looks like a cartel in operation. There is no incentive to reduce these charges and the companies know that one will charge 25 cent for receiving a text message while the other will charge 49 cent for receiving a text message. This cannot be allowed to continue.</p>

            <p eId="para_724">Does the Minister think it is right that this issue is so grave that a town council would invite all public representatives from the Cavan-Monaghan area to come to a meeting to discuss it? Does he agree that this is hitting people most who can ill afford it? If I am in Northern Ireland but on my way home to the Republic, the strong signal will follow me home and I cannot take a call without incurring international roaming charges. Does the Minister think that is right? There is no real will to address this. We set up a high powered group which has done little about it as the charges are still in place. The report suggests charging €7.50 per month plus VAT to take calls in Northern Ireland, but not to make calls.</p>
            <p eId="para_725">This is a major issue. Residents on the Border are being hit harder than most by the regulation. It is not too bad for someone from the South on a one day visit, but residents in the Border areas live with this daily, including many who can least afford it. Will the Minister address this as a matter of urgency?</p>

            <p eId="para_726">It is being addressed as a matter of urgency. However, one can only go so far on issues like these. I have no powers to direct companies on how much they charge. We have been trying to involve the two regulators and they have been exerting as much pressure as they can. They have been encouraging the companies to introduce an all-island tariff. They have also provided better information for consumers on tariff options and on how to avoid inadvertent roaming. Both regulators are co-operating and they are trying to create joint arrangements North and South.</p>
            <p eId="para_727">We should not concentrate on this in just a North and South context. I have expressed the view to the companies concerned that we should move very quickly to an all-island market in telecommunications companies, similar to the energy market. The UK, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland should be treated as one market. I am not as pessimistic as the Deputy, but neither do I expect something to happen next week. However, the reality is beginning to dawn on these companies that consumers are becoming more aware of these issues. When there is increased competition in the market, people will vote with their feet.</p>
            <p eId="para_728">ComReg has made a decision on the market dominance of these companies, which is being appealed. I cannot say anything about it for that reason.</p>

            <p eId="para_729">I do not think I am being pessimistic, but I am being realistic. Children using a prepaid phone pay 99 cent per minute roaming charges in Northern Ireland to receive or to make a call. A business customer is charged 59 cent per minute. If the two companies are charging the exact same rate, that sounds like a cartel to me. The Minister has spoken about a common approach or entering into joint arrangements, but that is not bearing fruit. Both companies provide services north and south of the Border and I believe they operate in a cartel. We should encourage them to avoid imposing roaming charges.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_732">The telecommunications sector is fully liberalised and regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation. With the repeal of section 111 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 on 25 July 2003, the former licensing regime has been replaced by a general entitlement to provide telecommunications networks and services, including broadband, subject to compliance with standard conditions set out by ComReg in a general authorisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_733">Before providing networks or services to third parties, operators are required to submit a notification to ComReg for the purposes of compiling a register of such operators.</p>
            <p eId="para_734">In March 2004, my predecessor issued a number of policy directions to ComReg on competition, broadband, wholesale and retail line rental, interconnection leased lines and national and cross-Border roaming.</p>
            <p eId="para_735">While access to suitable infrastructure is a major factor in the provision of broadband by the sector, the Government recognised by 2002 that investment by the sector had failed to keep pace with demand. In March 2002, the Government decided to target the widespread availability of open access affordable infrastructure using funding from the European Regional Development Fund and State funding under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The metropolitan area networks, MANs, programme is the mainstay of the Government's broadband strategy and has given the sector access to world-class infrastructure which it could not have afforded to build for itself. Full details of the MANs programme and my Department's other broadband roll-out initiatives can be found on the website <i>www.dcmnr.gov.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_736">It is an indicator of the increasingly buoyant state of the broadband market in Ireland that the ComReg register of authorised undertakings currently lists 169 service providers which offer Internet access using a variety of technologies, including DSL, fixed wireless, cable modem, fibre, leased lines and satellite technology. My Department's website at <i>www.broadband.gov.ie </i>lists 190 different service offers from the sector ranging from 0.256 mbps to 56 mbps. Of those, 25 are priced at €25 per month or less. The number of broadband users is now over 160,000, which represents an increase of more than 400% since January 2004. I am confident the industry can achieve the target I have set of 500,000 broadband customers by the end of 2006.</p>

            <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_737">Is the Minister aware of concern in the industry at the strong possibility that the targets he correctly set are unobtainable despite their revision given the current speed and notwithstanding the number of service providers already in the field? Does the Minister also recognise that the level of access to infrastructure required to achieve his targets does not exist? Does the Minister believe that the lethargy of the regulator's response indicates that the directions of his predecessor fell on deaf ears? Does the Minister recognise the possibility of a long drawn-out argument in the courts and elsewhere on the infrastructure which must be made available to facilitate service providers?</p>

            <p eId="para_738">I take it the Deputy's last question refers to the Eircom court case and the company's appeals to many of the orders which have been made. Whether I agree or disagree with the company is academic as it is entitled to take the action it has taken and we must afford it the opportunity to do so. I assure the Deputy, who has raised the matter before, that I have taken steps to ensure the appeals system will function well in this instance and I will announce in the next couple of days that I will increase the number of people available to the electronic appeals panel. I might as well make the announcement in the House as Deputy Durkan prefers.</p>

            <p eId="para_740">In future, a number of appeals may be heard at the same time to avoid undue delay. If people decide to go to court, I hope their cases are heard by the commercial rather than the normal courts to expedite matters. As Deputy Durkan is correct continually to point out, this is a matter of significant national importance and interest. While I am satisfied the directions of my predecessor are being implemented and pursued by the regulator, appeals mechanisms are in place in this area also which may slow things up. The fault is not with ComReg.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">I dealt with access to infrastructure in my initial reply. I would like to see speedier progress. We saw the example of the local loop unbundling that has been challenged and appealed, which is certainly not the approach I like to see people take. I would like people, especially the incumbent, to accept the process is in the national interest and that they should co-operate fully with it. There is a great deal of business potential in the process for the incumbent and, apart from the competition which comes in, it will be good for the industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">Deputy Durkan also asked about concern in the industry that the target might not be achieved. All these questions are related to one another and I have responded to each. I would be concerned if we did not reach the target which is the minimum required. While we hope there will be a sea change in attitudes, we intend to ensure through ComReg that the benefits of local loop and unbundling and an open market are available to all consumers as soon as it is legally possible. Some of the actions which have been taken over the past two or three years have shown what can happen. The recent report demonstrates that prices for telecommunications have fallen in Ireland by approximately 20% over the past 12 to 18 months as a direct result of deregulation. Companies can well afford to allow them to fall further, which is what we would like to see happen.</p>

            <p eId="para_744">While I am open to suggestion, I do not see what other initiatives are available. We have the MANs programme, school broadband and group and county broadband schemes, all of which are playing a role. Short of moving in and buying the exchanges back or coming to some arrangement with Eircom, which I can imagine would be very popular politically, I do not see what can be done.</p>

            <p eId="para_746">While I am prepared to explore it if necessary, MANs will provide competition for that infrastructure. Eircom will have to make up its mind and decide whether to be in the market.

That is the route we will go if we can.</p>

        [20110/05]

          </question>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_388" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_748">Deputies should be aware that Ireland is the only country in the EU which does not have a national postcode system. A system of postcodes is regarded internationally as a necessary element of a modern, efficient and competitive economy. The Commission for Communications Regulation, the remit of which includes postal services, produced a report following a consultative process in November 2003. The report, which is broadly in favour of the introduction of a postcode system, is a useful contribution to debate on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_749">I am favourably disposed to the introduction of postcodes. The case has been made that a national postcode system would offer significant potential benefits for the postal business, public utilities, businesses and consumers. I established a working group comprised of people with experience of the postal sector and a representative of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which is the lead Department for the Irish spatial data infrastructure initiative, to consider the introduction of a postcode system in Ireland. This group produced its report earlier this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_750">The report found that the introduction of a publicly available postcode could deliver many potential benefits. The purpose of a postcode system would be to improve efficiencies and quality in the postal sector, stimulate mail volume growth, assist utilities and emergency services, address the problem of non-unique addressing and facilitate competition by making it easier for new postal operators to enter the market. These improvements collectively will boost the country's competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_751">Following on from the recommendations of the working group report, consideration of the feasibility, design and implementation of a practical postcode project proposal will be advanced, including establishing the cost of implementing such a postcode and how that cost should be met. In accordance with the recommendation of the working group that project managers be appointed to lead the postcode project, I have asked the Commission for Communications Regulation to appoint the project managers. A national postcode project board, comprising representatives of Departments together with public and private sector organisations, will be appointed by me to assist the project managers with their work and to present a proposal describing in sufficient detail a model that is the most efficient, effective and publicly usable postcode system by 31 December 2005. I expect the new postcode system will be implemented by 1 January 2008.</p>

          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_389">
            <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_752">The Minister did not give any figures regarding one of the most important issues I had asked about — cost. Does he accept it would cost upwards of €6 million for An Post to implement the type of system which the Minister favours? I welcome the fact that we have a chance to discuss this with the Minister on the floor of the House. I raised the matter here in recent weeks but the Minister was unable to be present.</p>
            <p eId="para_753">The report of the postcode working group appears to be ambiguous on the matter. In 21 out of 32 countries where postcodes are in use the post only reaches the delivery office area or a higher level and in eight further countries the post reaches a subset of that. The vast bulk of post in these countries cannot be delivered to the door. Is it not a fact that An Post already has a remarkable geo-directory? I have a guide to the technical data which in effect give a spatial grid reference for every property in the State, including the Minister's house and mine. That being so, is it not incumbent on us to go past the archaic postcode technology used in other countries and to follow the most up-to-date technology? The report is ambiguous and does not provide any detail on cost. Given the struggle An Post has had in recent years, the last thing it needs is an extra €6 million, €10 million or more on its cost base. We are very nervous of the Minister in this regard, given that he is the €50 million man.</p>

            <p eId="para_755">Some €50 million worth of technology is stored in warehouses around the State and we do not know if it will ever be used. We are quite nervous about this. Given that a business case has not been made in the report, is it not the case that the end result will be a facility that will inflict a load of junk mail and such literature on households and businesses?</p>
            <p eId="para_756">It is not true what the Minister said at the outset that this country does not have postcodes. We have had postcodes in Dublin for the past three or four decades.</p>

            <p eId="para_758">Yes, the famous Dublin 4. I live in Dublin 17. Is it not the case that those postcodes have been used repeatedly, especially in the property market to categorise areas and people most unfairly? If it were possible for us to have a postcode which was just as private as our credit card number, as the broadcaster Pat Kenny said recently, should we not do that and use the technology we have rather than return to an older technology which has all kinds of implications?</p>
            <p eId="para_759">I note that the report does not comment on issues of privacy and the socio-economic categorisation of the population. It did not even investigate those areas. Is this something which the Minister and his project team should reconsider before spending perhaps tens of millions of euro on what may turn out to be a madcap scheme?</p>

I hope they can learn from the 32 other countries to which he referred and devise a system that will overcome the pitfalls he has rightly pointed out. I have a level of faith in the people who will be appointed as managers of this project that they will go that step further to make it an effective and efficient postcode system.</p>
            <p eId="para_767">I can only go on what An Post has said to me. It has the geo-directory to which Deputy Broughan referred. I asked An Post if we could translate this into a postcode system but it appears that the geo-directory product is not a postcode system but an address database that is linked to geographical co-ordinates. It provides a unique identifier but An Post informs me that it is not a postcode system. Apart from anything else, I believe postcodes should be a public good. They are a public good and they should be available to everybody. Everybody should have the information on the system. It should not be the property of a private company that wants to make money just for the sake of it.

            <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
            <p eId="para_778">I propose to take Questions Nos. 6 and 13 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">The lost at sea scheme was introduced in June 2001, following consultation with the fishing industry representative organisations, to enable qualifying applicants under the scheme to receive replacement capacity in respect of fishing boats lost at sea between 1980 and the establishment of the fishing boat register in 1990. The closing date for receipt of applications was 31 December 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">Due to the obligation on Ireland to ensure that the capacity of the Irish fishing fleet did not exceed EU-determined capacity limits, the terms of the scheme were quite specific. All applications received were assessed in accordance with the terms of the scheme. The Department is currently engaged in correspondence with the Office of the Ombudsman regarding a specific application under the scheme. Pending the conclusion of this correspondence, I do not wish to comment on the Ombudsman's views. It would be improper of me to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">Due to changes in EU rules that have been introduced since the scheme was launched, it would not be possible to re-open it. The allocation of further capacity under the scheme would now be in breach of EU legislation in so far as vessels would be licensed and entered on the fishing boat register without the removal of equivalent capacity from the register. In addition, this EU legislation prohibits the re-introduction of fishing-boat capacity on the basis of the removal of capacity supported by public aid.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnPerry" eId="spk_408">
            <from>Mr. Perry</from>
            <p eId="para_782">I compliment Jim Higgins MEP on referring this matter to the Ombudsman's office. The Ombudsman's report labelled the scheme seriously deficient and flawed due to way in which it was advertised. This is a very damning statement. Does the Minister of State admit that the system was flawed and that the scheme should have been advertised properly? What is the position on the tonnage and licence of a boat after it is sunk? This is fundamental to the case in question, which we cannot discuss.</p>
            <p eId="para_783">The Office of the Ombudsman made a statement some time ago on the illegal charging of long-term patients in nursing homes. It put down a major marker and the Government ignored it at its peril. The lost at sea scheme was not advertised in the national press. Does the Minister of State not feel this restricted the number of applicants who could have applied for compensation under the scheme?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_409" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
            <p eId="para_784">The Ombudsman's statement that the scheme is both deficient and flawed is in the public arena but I am quite confident that neither the Minister who was responsible nor the officials set out to advertise it in papers that would not be read by interested parties and those whose vessels were lost at sea. I take the point the in the case of a number of the vessels that were lost at sea, family members of those concerned who did not carry on the tradition may not have seen advertisements in the papers.</p>
            <p eId="para_785">The Deputy asked about taking boats off the register. The boats would have been on the register for a specific period — I do not know how long — and eventually they would have been removed therefrom. The boats that were successful under the lost at sea scheme would have added to our capacity and tonnage. The decision in 1990 to establish a fishing boat register has confined us to the upper limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">I am aware of the case in question and I have a fair amount of detail on the background thereto. It would be fair if due process took its course and we awaited the outcome of the correspondence between our office and that of the Ombudsman.</p>

          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_410">
            <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_787">How widely was the scheme advertised? Was it advertised in national newspapers? Is it possible that it was not advertised in the Minister of State's county? Who were the six applicants who qualified for compensation out of 67? Where were they from? It was alleged that some of the beneficiaries of the scheme were from the constituency of the Minister of State's predecessor, Deputy Fahey, Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Will the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, clarify this?</p>
            <p eId="para_788">I commend Jim Higgins MEP on his work in respect of the family concerned in the case in question.</p>

          <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_411" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
            <p eId="para_789">I do not have the details on where the scheme was advertised but from recollection I believe it was advertised in the marine-related papers. Although I do not have this information or the names of the applicants who were successful under the scheme, I will make it available to Deputies Broughan and Perry within the next 24 hours.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DinnyMcGinley" eId="spk_412" as="#Acting_Chairman">
            <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
            <p eId="para_790">We are dealing with a very important issue concerning fundamental rights and natural justice. Any scheme of the kind in question should be characterised by equity. I am sure the Minister of State is aware of families in our constituency who have suffered tragic losses but who are not aware of the existence of the scheme due to the fact that it was advertised in a very limited number of publications, mainly related to the fishing industry. He will understand that families who are no longer involved in the industry due to the loss of family members who were engaged in fishing for generations would not be aware of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_791">The Ombudsman's report, which I, too, read, is fairly damning. Great credit is due to Jim Higgins MEP who was responsible for it. Given the constituency the Minister of State represents, I urge him to respond as generously as possible to the points made by the Ombudsman.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_413" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
            <p eId="para_792">I am anxious that all schemes be advertised as extensively as possible. Although I am not exactly sure of the extent to which the lost at sea scheme was advertised, I was aware of it. I was not a Member of the House at the time but was an MEP. I know of the cases to which the Deputies are referring. The contention is that it was not dealt with at the time and that the application was not received on time. It was received in January 2003 while the closing date for applications was in December 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">The Department has responded fully to the Ombudsman's inquiries and has supplied all the relevant information. At the expense of repeating myself, I must state that the section of the Department responsible for the registration of fishing vessels is in correspondence with the Office of the Ombudsman. I am anxious to ensure that this correspondence is concluded as quickly as possible. I will do my utmost to expedite it but I do not believe this will be necessary.</p>

            <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
            <p eId="para_794">On the lost at sea scheme, does the Minister of State find it surprising that only six out of 67 applicants received compensation? Does he believe this number to be very low? Did I hear him correctly when he said the allocation of further compensation would be in breach of EU legislation? What section deals with the breach of EU legislation?</p>
            <p eId="para_795">We owe a great debt to those involved in the fishing industry and those who risk their lives day and night to service a natural resource off our coasts. It is important that all these people be informed in a very open and professional way. They should have been informed properly about the lost at sea scheme, not just through fishing magazines.</p>
            <p eId="para_796">Does the Minister of State accept that all families involved in the fishing industry deserve the support of all the Deputies in this House?</p>

            <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
            <p eId="para_797">I stated EU legislation prohibits the re-introduction of fishing-boat capacity on the basis of the removal of capacity supported by public aid. That is a fact.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">Having been brought up in west Donegal and realising the importance of fishing, I have great sympathy for those who have lost their vessels at sea. Many of them received no compensation from insurance or the State and I have great sympathy for those people.</p>
            <p eId="para_799">The terms of the scheme were quite specific. I am advised that all the applications received were assessed in accordance with the scheme's terms. When I make the information available to the Deputies, it might do no harm to include the terms of the scheme as well. There should be no misapprehension. I fully appreciate the pressures that many of these people were under. I know many of them. I am not aware whether they applied but if they did and did not receive compensation, it has been a difficult time for them.</p>

            <from>Mr. Perry</from>
            <p eId="para_802">The Ombudsman reported that this was the most flawed scheme ever. There was no preparation by civil servants. It was announced, guillotined and not circulated. The Department could not be happy with this. How can the Minister of State stand over it?</p>
            <p eId="para_803">What happens to tonnage when a vessel is sunk or sold? Does it go back on the register? I believe the <i>Atlantic Dawn</i> is for sale at the moment which was granted a tonnage of 14,000. Will that tonnage revert to the national register as in the case of a vessel that has sunk? Has the Department a list of all fishing vessels lost at sea?</p>

          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_419">
            <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_804">I want to make the same point. The Minister of State indicated that there is no possibility of such compensation under the present situation. Perhaps he would clarify that. This is reminiscent of when the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources examined the allocation of money for marinas, also administered by the Department. The Secretary General and the staff were not able to justify the marinas selected at that stage by the Department. In that era under the then Minister for Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey, it appears that a number of schemes were not operated in accordance with the standards that the Ombudsman and our committee felt should apply to any scheme working in a fair and open manner.</p>

            <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
            <p eId="para_805">I cannot confirm whether the Department has a list of all fishing vessels lost at sea. No doubt, it has a list of those reported to have been lost at sea. However, it became more important to have vessels on the register in recent years when the tonnage became a very valuable asset. If I can obtain that information, I certainly will. I can answer questions generally. If there are specific questions at a later stage, I will deal with them. Tonnage can be sold, provided a vessel is removed from the register and the relevant conditions, in most cases, will attach to another vessel that is taken onto the register.</p>

            <p eId="para_808">——and the idea was a good one. Unfortunately, the issue of state aid raised its head. We have been in discussion with the Attorney General's office for some time and I have asked the assistant secretary to meet the Commission in Brussels this month to try to resolve the difficulties involved. We are providing a reasonable amount of money to various counties to assist them and give them the necessary kick-start. I will report to the House as soon as possible after the meeting in Brussels.</p>

            <from>Mr. McGinley</from>
            <p eId="para_810">The Minister of State and I are aware of one case where a vessel was lost at sea, as is the whole country, and so the Department must know about it also. This was probably the largest fishing vessel every lost off the Irish coast with the greatest loss of life. Those people have not been included in this scheme. It is not necessary to search the Department for details of that particular tragedy that happened 24 years ago. The Minister of State and I are aware of that one.</p>
            <p eId="para_811">Am I correct in saying that of the six vessels granted tonnage in that lost at sea scheme, 80% of the tonnage went to then Minister's constituency, Galway West? That certainly generates more questions about the rationale for the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_812">I never wish to mislead the House. For that reason I emphasise that whatever is in the Department will be made available. I am well aware of the vessel to which the Deputy referred. I was one of the first on the scene when the news broke. I presume he is referring to the vessel that went aground off Cloughglass in our constituency as well as all the others. After a vessel is lost at sea or any accident on the water, a report is prepared for the Department. I am quite sure that all this type of information is available. As regards vessels that could be sold, the entitlements attached could have a number of days within European waters. The Deputy can take it that anything to be done will be in total conformity with the rules and regulations and in accordance with the legislation passed by this House within which we have to operate.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_815">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 191 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">My core policy objectives for the development of the broadcasting sector are detailed in my Department's statement of strategy. These objectives are to create an environment that encourages the maintenance of high quality Irish radio and television services by both independent broadcasters and RTE, to secure a viable future for high quality public service broadcasting and to seek to retain access to a range of high quality programming in analogue and digital form on a universal and free-to-air basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">My key priorities for achieving these objectives include the following: developing the regulatory framework by bringing forward a Bill to provide for the establishment of a single content regulator for public and private broadcasters and to establish RTE on the lines of a company under the Companies Acts; taking steps to establish TG4 as an independent entity; ensuring adequate public funding for RTE and TG4 so that they can deliver on their statutory mandate; building on progress made in maximising the effectiveness of television licence fee collection; developing proposals to ensure that in a digital era, Irish viewers continue to enjoy access to a range of high quality programming; and bringing forward proposals for the future licensing of radio services in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_818">I am of the opinion that Irish viewers will be best served by a broadcasting environment that includes a strong public service broadcasting presence in the form of RTE and an independent TG4, together with private broadcasters.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BernardJDurkan" eId="spk_427">
            <from>Mr. Durkan</from>
            <p eId="para_819">I thank the Minister for his reply. Does the Minister foresee any difficulties arising for terrestrial transmissions in view of the attractiveness of satellite television with the development of modern technology? Is he satisfied that the present structures are adequate to guarantee the integrity of the national broadcasting service while at the same time complying with EU recommendations and comments? How does he see the area of competition being addressed in this context, bearing in mind the necessity to ensure that the Irish viewer and listener has access to free-to-air television and radio to the same extent as previously?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_428" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Mr. N. Dempsey</from>
            <p eId="para_820">I hope I am interpreting the Deputy's question correctly. I do not regard increased provision of satellite platforms for broadcasting as a difficulty. On the contrary, it is an opportunity for all concerned. If I recall correctly, Ireland has the highest satellite-cable penetration of any country in Europe and greater provision will not cause a problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_821">The Deputy's question may allude to the move from analogue to digital terrestrial television which must take place over the next seven years. The Department is preparing for the move, an issue I can address in response to later questions. This change will not pose a threat to free-to-air stations such as RTE and TG4 because I intend to ensure they remain free-to-air, irrespective of how they are transmitted. The switch from analogue to digital technology will enhance the quality of the service and no one will lose out as a result. It does not, therefore, pose a danger to the public broadcasting service and terrestrial television stations.</p>
            <p eId="para_822">The Deputy is correct that current structures need to be examined and changed. This is part of the reason for drafting the Bill about which the Deputy consistently asks. As I consistently inform him, it will, I hope, be available by the end of the year. As he correctly noted, a review of current structures with a view to making changes to meet future challenges is necessary and will form part of the broadcasting Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_823">Ireland is in full compliance with EU directives. I understand the Deputy's question may refer to competition, the use of licence fees and so forth, all of which are the subject of ongoing correspondence between the Department and the European Commission. The bottom line is that the provision of funding from television licence fees or the taxpayer generally does not in any way infringe EU directives. Increasingly, the need to ensure this is done and seen to be done in an open and transparent manner is being raised. Steps must also be taken to ensure it does not distort competition. On foot of the Department's correspondence with the Commission, it is probable that the broadcasting Bill will introduce changes to ensure the process is open and transparent and competition is encouraged.</p>
            <p eId="para_824">I am committed to public service broadcasting and the remit of RTE and TG4. It has been proved, however, that the entry into the market of private sector operators based in or focused on Ireland is good for competition and enhances the standards of public service broadcasting. Competition will keep everybody on their toes.</p>

            <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_825">Will the Department have further consultations to which Opposition parties could contribute on the broadcasting authority Bill? Does the Minister have views on comments made by the director general of RTE, Cathal Goan, at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources in which he attacked the principle that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland might become a super-regulator, given that he maintained, perhaps correctly, that the BCI has not properly regulated the commercial sector in terms of the target set for the provision of news?</p>
            <p eId="para_826">Why was there a hiatus in appointing the board? What criteria did the Minister use when reappointing members of the board? In most organisations one expects to have a board of directors — otherwise one could argue that the organisation in question effectively does not exist. Why was the process delayed?</p>

            <p eId="para_827">Further consultations will take place on the broadcasting Act. I am currently engaged in talks with the Government Whip with a view to ensuring that a Bill such as the broadcasting Bill would be part of a pilot scheme he wishes to introduce on e-government to facilitate online consultation. I want the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources involved in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">With regard to the comments made by the Director General of RTE, irrespective of people's views on the effectiveness or otherwise of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland, the need for regulation and a regulatory body is widely accepted. The new broadcasting Bill will provide for the establishment of an effective independent regulatory body to which RTE will be responsible and answerable. I will not comment on Mr. Goan's views on the effectiveness or otherwise of the current BCI.</p>

                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_836">In page 7, to delete lines 5 to 8 and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_837">"‘(i <i>a</i>) will investigate the role of the courts and the executive arm of Government which exercised statutory powers under the Children Acts and will inquire into the manner in which children were placed in, as day students or residents and the circumstances in which they continued to be students or residents in, institutions during the relevant period,’,”.</p>
          <p eId="para_838">This series of amendments follows from the debate on the role of the Department of Education and Science as the sponsoring Department and the requirement to construe references to "the Minister" as a reference to the Taoiseach, as proposed in amendment No. 1. The amendment proposes to include in the investigation the role of the Government and courts in the cycle of events which led to children being systematically abused in homes and schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">The former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, promised that all areas, apart from the courts, would be open to examination by the commission. The Bill as currently drafted backtracks on even those commitments. The point must be made that the State has a responsibility and its failure to look after children must not just be acknowledged but examined in detail. It is one thing to offer assurances here but the work of the Laffoy commission showed the Department of Education and Science stalling and delaying access to documentation. We have a chance to make it clear that the Government and its institutions will play a full role in the commission's work. The best way to achieve this is to state it clearly in the Bill. Anything less will leave the door open for backsliding and avoidance of responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">I have talked to many people about this, including people I grew up with in Rathfarnham who wound up in institutions such as Daingean for petty reasons. All those people were hurt and had changed as a result of their experience. Those who are still alive carry their anger to this day.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">After the Taoiseach's apology, people thought the can of worms that had been opened in this area of Irish life would be fully investigated, but unfortunately that has not been the case. People talk about their anger and frustration, and the delay with the Laffoy Commission has added to that. Many of them want to tell their story but have not had the opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">I spoke to a man who was put in an institution after the death of his mother. After a year and a half, an uncle started to collect him for visits and he was seriously assaulted from the age of three and a half until he ran away to England at age 16. He used to return to the institution with cuts and bruises, having been beaten black and blue by his uncle, but the man was still allowed to take him on visits.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">I passed one orphanage as a child where the orphans always looked very sad. A girl who was in that orphanage told me how a priest who had abused other children was sent to the institution and given a key to the dormitories. This girl's father was still alive but, for whatever reason, the State took the decision whereby she ended up in the institution. She lives with the resultant problems to this day. She is extremely angry at a system that allowed an abuser to move from one place to another and to abuse her, destroying her childhood. She is a young mother now and she told me that the most important thing to her was that neither her child nor any other child would go through a similar experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">Other people who spoke to me ended up in prison. That was how they reacted to what had been done to them. They were angry with the system, the State and the officialdom that would allow this to happen. They want to open this can of worms and find out why judges sent people to institutions, in some cases for mitching school, robbing orchards or stealing a bike. These were petty crimes that would not have attracted such punishment in a more civilised society.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">Some people told of how they spoke to the gardaí, to doctors who were called in to investigate bruising and to visitors to institutions, but no one listened. Society did not listen then and these people now want us to listen to their stories. They do not want to have to tell them behind closed doors. They also want the State and its institutions that were responsible for the theft of their childhood, the most grave crime outside of murder, to be held to account.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">Many of these people buried their pain, turning to drink or drugs, and some committed suicide. Those whom I spoke to were conscious that many of their friends from the institutions have never had the opportunity to tell their story, making it even more important that they are allowed to do it now to bring closure. They want to understand why a civilised State could allow this to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">This amendment calls for the investigation of the role of the courts and the executive arm of Government which exercised statutory powers under the Children Acts and for the commission to inquire into the manner in which children were placed in institutions as day students or residents and the circumstances under which they continued to be students or residents in the institutions during the relevant period.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_436">
          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_848">In amending the functions of the commission in this legislation, the onus is on us to spell out exactly what they should be. It should inquire into the manner in which children were placed in institutions and the circumstances in which they continued to be resident in those institutions during the relevant period. That would cover a hell of a lot of dirt and pain.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">The commission should also investigate any executive arm of Government that was responsible for the placement of children in institutions. I have heard stories of people escaping from institutions, telling the gardaí and the gardaí laughing at them before sending them back. That is no reflection on individual officers but on society at the time. Inspectors would come into the institutions, which would be immaculate, and they would send back glowing reports. The dirt, however, was hidden under the carpet and it re-emerged afterwards. That is what the survivors say.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">We must specify in the functions of the commission the need to investigate the circumstances where day students and residential students were placed in institutions, sometimes against their will and the will of their parents or guardians and the role played by officials in the Department of Education, the Department of Justice, the Garda Síochána and judges who had anything to do with placing vulnerable children in places where they were subjected to abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">My amendment spells out clearly what we should investigate. In looking at this horrific period, which thankfully appears to be over now, we can sanitise matters, but the Bill should not do that, it should show exactly what happened and what we are investigating. That is why my amendment is as encompassing as possible in examining the roles of the various organs of the State.</p>

          <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_852">My amendment provides for the adequacy or otherwise of the manner in which responsibilities were discharged by persons in authority, including judges. The decision-making process that put so many of these young people into institutions must be part of the commission's work. The judicial process was a central part where decisions were made to incarcerate children for what were in some cases not even offences and in others minor offences. It is appropriate that this aspect, core to the decision to put the children away, in many cases for years, is incorporated into the examinations taking place under the auspices of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse. I hope the Minister for Education and Science will accept this amendment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_438">
          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_853">I support these three amendments. As we are discussing timescales and do not want to delay matters, it must be remembered that the number of people who can give evidence to the commission is limited as the commission is now closed to other people coming before it. In looking into these areas, the commission will only examine those cases already with it. We are not asking for a process that will inordinately extend the lifetime of the commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">Sadly, we come back to the example of the day schools and the Donal Dunne case. There is strong evidence that different arms of State knew what was happening but failed to act. This is not just confined to the Department of Education and Science. There is evidence that other State bodies, including the Garda Síochána who did act in some cases, knew about the abuse. It is important these issues are fully examined at this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">If we wish to reach finality and closure on this issue, every aspect must be dealt with. If only half the story is told before the commission, we will come back to this legislation because some people will not have had the opportunity to tell their full stories. That would be the worst possible outcome. If we do that, we will never reach an end to this issue. It is important that the commission investigates every aspect that needs to be investigated.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_439">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_856">I strongly support Deputy Crowe's important amendment that can add to the legislation. It is crucial to investigate the role of the courts and executive arm of the Government in this matter. We must accept that we have a dark past in how children were treated in institutions. It is a sad and painful past and a nightmare for many of the victims.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">The issue of those victims with intellectual disabilities is not often raised in the House or in the broader debate. This was an extra nightmare for many of those people. With this type of scandal we must be vigilant at all times. There were many occasions when children with intellectual disabilities were vulnerable and had no voice. I have met many of them and their families. It is sad to listen to the stories of how a young person with Down's syndrome or another intellectual disability was destroyed and exploited by an adult in an institution. There is a message for us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">When we are discussing developing services, to ensure this never happens again they must be child-based and not service provider-based. That was the mistake made in the past. People perceived to have problems or dysfunctional behaviour were immediately shipped off to an institution. This must never be a solution again.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">I accept the Minister's point that matters have moved on. I recognise there are progressive programmes in our schools for dealing with staff and child care workers. However, we must remain vigilant as we have learned from this experience.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Nowadays, the high percentage of abuse is not in institutions but in dysfunctional families and among neighbours in communities. We must not be afraid to face up to this, as there is a huge silence on this issue. Like many Members, I have met many victims of abuse in institutions and seen their great hurt in that they were often ignored. Many victims told me that they felt they had to go through hoops in getting their stories heard. The constant denial from both the abuser and the authorities caused much hurt.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">I support all the victims of abuse in institutions. It is important that we hear all their stories, that they are treated with respect and are compensated properly. When we refer to the State, we must remember it must not just look after its citizens but give justice to victims. Many of the victims have ended up with alcohol and drug abuse problems. Society must ensure they get the maximum support and back-up services they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">Society must also examine itself. Massive greed and selfishness is rampant in society. People are too busy going on about the economy. We must never take our eye off the ball, forgetting that children must be nourished and developed in a caring way. Deputy Crowe's amendment is part of that strategy.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_440">
          <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
          <p eId="para_863">Not for the first time I find myself agreeing with Deputy Finian McGrath. However, I will not accept the amendments because the thrust of what they propose to achieve is already covered in the Bill. One of the commission's primary functions is to conduct an inquiry into the abuse of children in institutions, ascertain why it occurred and who was responsible. That mandate includes establishing as complete a picture as possible of the causes, the nature and the extent of physical and sexual abuse of children in institutions and other places from 1940 to the present day. The Executive and the courts had a role to play in the placement and detention of children in institutions. The commission already has the ability to report on this role. I do not propose to accept amendment No. 2.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">The Bill provides for the commission to investigate the various roles of those in authority, including officials attached to various Departments, as outlined in amendment No. 3 in Deputy Gogarty's name. The commission already has a broad range of institutions within its remit, including day schools and hospitals. It is, therefore, not necessary to accept this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">There is always a difficulty when attempts are made to include judges in legislation, as proposed in Deputy O'Sullivan's amendment. It is difficult to do and can be dangerous because of constitutional rights and the separation of powers. Quite apart from the length of time that has elapsed and the difficulties in establishing facts, obviously the independence of the Judiciary is the key issue. Anything said or done in a person's capacity as a judge would have been privileged. However, the commission can examine the general operation of the system and the workings of the courts, rather than examining a particular decision in a particular case. It already has power in the legislation to look at the circumstances of how the children were detained and the manner in which they continued to be detained, without specifying an individual case or judge. Hence, the legislation in the Bill already facilitates what the Deputies are trying to achieve through their amendments, without specifying the particular groups, authorities, executives, courts <i>et cetera</i>, as the Deputies wish.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_866">I accept the Minister's points in terms of the thrust of the Bill. However, I want to see it in black and white and there cannot be any confusion about it. There has been a conspiracy of silence in the past which I hope will be uncovered by this legislation. No stone should be left uncovered and I would have liked this to have been outlined clearly in the Bill. Some individuals, possibly for personal or religious reasons, might be uncomfortable with going down this path but there should be no leeway for anyone who does not wish to investigate these areas of Irish life. There is a major story to be told and although we have heard some of the stories, we have not heard it all yet. This amendment must be included in the legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_442">
          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_867">I support Deputy Crowe's amendment. The Minister has stated that much of it is already included, but in order to avoid doubt, it would be better to include the amendment. Consequently, if an issue should arise as to whether the commission has been mandated and is allowed to investigate this area under the terms of this legislation, it will be clear that it is empowered to do so. It is important that this should clearly form part of the legislation so it is not open to doubt and does not eventually depend on the opinion of a judge in court if the legislation is tested. It would be preferable to see it in the legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_443">
          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_868">I support this amendment and the following two amendments. The Minister mentioned that everything is already covered by the thrust of the Bill. Without wishing to play with words, we must have trust in the Bill. Unfortunately, survivors do not trust the Department of Education and Science, they do not trust the work of the commission to date and do not trust the legislation. It must be spelled out in black and white that, as far as possible, the State is taking action to redress the wrongs that occurred in a transparent manner. The Minister does not support a move from the Department of Education and Science to the Department of the Taoiseach in order to facilitate such transparency. However, the Minister must include the wording to engender trust in the Bill. This is why it must be spelled out and why I support amendments Nos. 2 to 4, inclusive.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_444">
          <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_869">If none of these amendments is accepted, the existing wording will simply state "to inquire into the manner in which children were placed in, and the circumstances in which they continued to be resident in, institutions during the relevant period". This is vague and general language, whereas any of the three amendments — I concede the first two are more comprehensive than my own — are more specific about what actually happened and the process that was followed to incarcerate children. I am not satisfied with the looseness of the legislation's current wording and so I support my colleagues. I hope the Minister will take account of our points.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_445">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_870">I wish to develop a point. Deputy Gogarty touched on the question of trust which is an important issue in the debate, particularly to the victims. Many victims lack confidence and these voices should be and are reflected in the debate today. However, there is also a further question of respect for the victims and survivors which is important and we must ensure it is addressed. Amendment No. 2 demonstrates that respect, deals with the issue of trust and strengthens the legislation because when we discuss the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, we must focus on the central issue of justice for the victims. That is the bottom line and we must continue to remind ourselves of this fact. We must do something that is practical and sensible and amendment No. 2 does this.</p>

        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_446" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_871">Having met the survivors' groups, there is no evidence that they do not trust the Department of Education and Science. Similarly, there is no evidence that they do not trust the current system or the way in which it is developing. Nor was there any demand from them to move this commission to the Department of the Taoiseach — the opposite was the case. The survivors' groups would prefer that the process was facilitated in order to be able to move forward quickly and efficiently. They want to get into a position to be able to move forward with the commission's work.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">Equally, there is no confusion, despite Deputy Enright's suggestion, arising from the legislation's wording, because Judge Ryan has already come out publically and stated that he believes the court system and the executive should be examined. Hence, he recognises not only that this legislation, as it is currently drafted, allows him to do that but he also believes it should be done. Hence, the element of confusion is removed. I have no evidence that the survivors do not have trust in this system.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_879">"(iii) where cases do not proceed to full inquiry this shall be on the basis of clear and objective criteria, decided in consultation with representative groups,".</p>
          <p eId="para_880">I do not wish to rehash the Committee Stage debate on this point, except to state that the points I made then still stand. However, it is important to point out the reasoning behind these amendments, which are broadly similar. When the Taoiseach apologised to victims in 1999, a strong expectation built up that people would have the opportunity to state their cases and get the opportunity to ask questions in some instances. It has been pointed out to me that the vast majority of people who will come before the commission have already stated their case, if one may use that phrase, to some body by now, be it to the Garda, the courts or in some cases, before the commission. However, such people want the opportunity to appear properly before the commission and not simply before a confidential committee for an hour long hearing. This forms an integral part of what the victims, who are what this is about, wanted. The 2000 Act is being amended to remove the obligation on the investigation committee to hear all complaints.</p>
          <p eId="para_881">We seek to ensure selection will be made — I suppose people to not want to call it sampling and that "selection" is perhaps a slightly more polite way to put it — on the basis of clear and objective criteria. The Minister referred to Mr. Justice Ryan's statements. I have much faith in what Mr. Justice Ryan will do but I am also conscious that he is the second person in that job and, for one reason or another, somebody else could be in it before the commission completes its work. We must be mindful of that so we cannot rely on any individual no matter how good he or she may be at what he or she does because he or she may not be in the job in the future. It is important clear and objective criteria are laid down so people know why they will or will not get that opportunity which, until this legislation was published, they thought would be afforded to them. That is an important point.</p>
          <p eId="para_882">Amendment No. 6 requires that the criteria for deciding which cases may not proceed to full inquiry are published and made available to the public. Again, there is a dual interest here. While the victims should know the reason, there is a broader public interest in this issue. While my focus is primarily on the victims, it is also on the fact that people want to know what happened and how this will proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_883">When we debated this on Committee Stage, different reasons were put forward as to why the criteria should or should not be published. I appreciate the Minister did not want to have this so rigid that we exclude people. That is important but I do not see exclusion occurring on this basis. The criteria do not have to be so tied down that people are excluded, but they should be laid out.</p>
          <p eId="para_884">We have also looked for a clear definition of the term "reasonably practicable". That is not defined in the definition section. It leads to changes to what was expected and what was in the 2000 legislation. In the 2000 Act, the function of the commission was to provide for persons who had suffered abuse in institutions an opportunity to recount their abuse and make submissions to the commission. However, the changes here are quite broad and as far as is reasonably practicable, people will have the opportunity to recount the abuse and other relevant experiences undergone by them in institutions. We all have different definitions of "reasonably practicable" and it is important it is tied down so people know what is meant by it.</p>

          <p eId="para_885">Amendment No. 7 is a carbon copy of that tabled by Deputies English and Enright. I support their amendment and the other amendments. Without going back to Ms Justice Laffoy, Mr. Justice Ryan may resign for whatever reason. Ms Justice Laffoy resigned because she did not get the necessary resources. As I said in previous debates, every survivor should be entitled to a full inquiry but that is not what is happening. If we are to move to the new cost-cutting regime, we must have proper, transparent and publicly available criteria to show why cases are not proceeding to full inquiry. That is why I support this amendment, without going into too much further detail.</p>

          <p eId="para_886">I also support these amendments. It is a fundamental aspect of this that, after the apology and the setting up of the commission, one of the fundamental points made to survivors was that they would be allowed to tell their story. What is happening in these proposals from Government and from Mr. Justice Ryan is that many of the survivors will not be allowed to tell their story, other than for one hour, which will not be enough. If we do not amend the legislation to some extent and at least provide criteria, we are fundamentally changing what the commission is doing. Ideally, if a person feels strongly enough that he or she wants to tell his or her full story, he or she should be able to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_887">I made the point previously when we debated this legislation that it is our responsibility as legislators, not that of the commission, to decide what should or should not be in this legislation. I respect Mr. Justice Ryan's position and that he is trying to speed up the process and I respect most of his proposals. However, we have a separate responsibility from the judge in this regard. We have a responsibility to the public, specifically to the people who have survived child abuse. They should not be told that because of the time constraints and resources, some can and some cannot tell their story. That is essentially what will happen and it is sampling by another name. Even if the Minister does not accept these amendments, there should be an appeals system whereby if somebody feels strongly enough that his or her story needs to be told to the commission, there should be some way for him or her to do so.</p>

          <from>Mr. English</from>
          <p eId="para_888">It is fundamentally wrong that not everybody will get to tell his or her story. Different reasons have been put forward. The main reason is the timescale, yet the victims are willing to wait to get the chance to tell their story. They are now being told they will not all get the chance to tell their story, having been told they would. People will not know the reason they have not been picked to tell their story, and that is wrong. As I said on Committee Stage and as Deputy O'Sullivan said, it is up to us to set down the criteria. Once the legislation leaves this House, we will no longer have the chance to change it or to add to it. I see no reason we cannot set out criteria and lay down guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">Personnel may change before the commission completes its work. As Deputy Enright said, there have been changes already and there could be more. It is important victims know why they are being given or not being given the chance to tell their story. That is only fair and it is wrong that doubt remains. People might never know why they have not been picked. I believe one has the chance to object, but as I said on Committee Stage, if everyone questions why he or she is not being given the opportunity to tell his or her story, we could be back to square one.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_890">I do not know any of the individuals involved in this process so I do not have a biased view. However, I support the amendments. This is all about people wanting to tell their story. The question is why are they not being given that opportunity. People talked about a selection process or sampling, but who will say to those people who have been through that trauma, who have been denied their childhood and who suffered abuse that their story of being badly beaten or of being sexually abused has already been heard from ten women or five men? It raises all sorts of questions about whether we are serious about this process if we do not give these people an opportunity to tell their story. Who will decide what is and is not relevant? Will it be the judge and the commission? That is a huge responsibility. I would not recommend going down that road.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">These people who experienced abuse should be allowed to tell their story. I spoke to some people who went down the private route. One woman sat in a room with her husband and told her story while notes were taken. She came out of that room more frustrated and wanted to tell everyone her story. She is looking for an opportunity to go back and tell the world and its mother what happened to her when she was a child. She is wondering whether she is excluded from this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">People want to tell their story but because of timescales, money or whatever reason, they will possibly not get that opportunity, and that is wrong. We set up this process, people were led to believe they would have the opportunity to tell their stories and that all that happened would be uncovered, but now the process is being closed down. I am not the only one saying that but that is how this appears to many people. The Minister may say that none of the survivor groups said this to her but I have talked to individuals involved. I have not talked to the larger groups. People have come to me for whatever reason and they have told me their stories. They want someone from officialdom to listen to what they went through during their childhood. With the way the system is designed, they will not get that opportunity.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHanafin" eId="spk_454" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science">
          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_893">We also discussed this matter fully on Committee Stage. While we are the legislators and determine what goes into law, that should be done from the point of view of ensuring the legislation is workable and will work well. For that reason we are guided by some of the views of Mr. Justice Ryan and of the members of his commission who are doing this work on a day to day basis. When he reviewed the workings of the commission he deliberately avoided imposing selection criteria for cases that would receive the full hearing before the investigation committee. He believed that not only would it be invidious but probably impossible to do so. I did not hear any Member ask what are the criteria one could use. The reality is that the absence of criteria gives the members of the commission great flexibility in who they can call. There is no such thing as having a quota whereby they would call only X number of people, but they have a requirement to be able to get a complete picture of life in a particular school over the 30 year period under investigation. Therefore, they have to cover the range of complaints, experiences etc., and establish who are the people who can give them the best picture of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">Members of the commission have proposed that the investigation commission will interview each of the people who have decided to continue participating in the inquiry. That process had already commenced and is being conducted by members of the inquiry. The amendment to section 4(6) of the principal Act will allow the investigation committee to select so many people for the hearing to enable them to get a comprehensive picture of what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">Regarding amendments Nos. 10 and 11, the purpose of section 6 is to allow the investigation committee to hold meetings in public. It will also be able to hold joint hearings which can be attended by survivors and their representatives and respondents and their representatives. In both cases, the investigation committee will be entitled to work in this way whenever it considers it appropriate. To require it to agree the criteria for holding public or joint hearings with representative groups would undermine the independence of the committee and limit its discretion which it must still by law exercise in a reasonable manner. Only the commission can make a decision as to whether a hearing should be held in public based on the information it has on the content and the purpose of the hearing. For that reason I cannot accept these amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">The commission will act the same way as any other tribunal or inquiry. It will hear evidence on oath from witnesses who have relevant testimony to give and collect documentary material which it will analyse. When sufficient information has been obtained the inquiry members will assess the evidential material and come to conclusions. Only the commission can decide when it has enough evidence. It can only decide this as the hearing process progresses. Requirements will vary depending on the institution being investigated and the level of acceptance by the respondents on the results of the interview process.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">Regarding amendment No. 13, section 7 is intended to allow the investigation committee to call before it people whose accounts it considers will provide it with the greatest possibility of arriving at the truth of what occurred. It is important that the commission has appropriate discretion in carrying out its functions. There are likely to be complainants whose allegations are incapable of leading to a finding of abuse. Requiring the investigating committee to agree in advance with representative groups the circumstances in which this will arise would be an impossible task and one which would hamper its work and independence. For that reason, I do not propose to accept this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">As to what will happen in reality, the commission indicates it is its intention in respect of the great majority of the institutions it is investigating to call to give evidence everybody who wants to do so, but there are five homes which are simply too large to enable it to do that, namely Ferryhouse, Upton, Daingean, Letterfrack and Artane. The investigation committee proposes to hear every witness in every school it investigates with the exception of those five. Not only would it be impractical and difficult to do that in respect of those five homes but it would be unnecessary for it to get what it needs to establish the full picture of what occurred. That is what we are asking it to do. The investigation committee will call whoever its considers can give it the best picture of life as it was over that 30 year period. For example, it does not want to call 20 people from the 1930s and not call anybody from the 1940s or to call 20 people from the 1940s and not call anybody from the 1950s. It needs to have that kind of flexibility over the investigation. It needs to be able to establish the people who are willing to give evidence — that is the reason the first interview takes place — and how much of that will be necessary to hear fully. There is no quota system. The investigation committee can hear some evidence and then decide it wants to hear more, and the way we have dealt with this gives it the flexibility to do that. We are not being too specific on criteria because there might be a difference in how one would apply such to one school over another. The investigation committee aims to be as inclusive as possible to allow it to do its work properly. However, it must be pointed out that everybody concerned will be either heard by the investigation committee or interviewed by the legal team and many will undergo both processes. It is not a case that people will not be heard at all.</p>

        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_455">
          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_899">I am glad we have a little more information available on this Stage than was available on Committee Stage and we have learnt that the institutions this measure will apply to are Upton, Daingean, Letterfrack, Ferryhouse and Artane. The people who went to those institutions run the risk of being excluded. That is cold comfort to those who had the misfortune of going to one of those five institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_900">What the Minister said today in this respect is on the theme of what she said on the last occasion. She stated that Mr. Justice Ryan said it would be impossible to decide on criteria in this regard. This process involves Mr. Justice Ryan and the investigation committee comprising whatever number of people are involved. The members of the investigation committee will spend an hour with people to decide whether they will go through to a full hearing. What criteria will those members have in mind to decide on that? That is what should be outlined in the legislation. The members of the investigation committee, whether they number three, four, five or more, could all have a different notion of what they should be considering and what should form the criteria to allow a person to go forward to a full hearing. It is unacceptable such criteria is not specified.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">The Minister said the absence of criteria allows flexibility within the system. That may be the case but it allows for uncertainty, unfairness, doubt and exclusion. That is what people are really concerned about in this regard. It is important to impress that point on the Minister. Flexibility is one aspect and I said that I do not consider there is a need to be so adamant about the criteria that it is inflexible but I want to provide for certainty, fairness and inclusion and ensure the greatest number of people will be included. To say it is impossible to decide on criteria to determine whether a person should go forward to a full hearing means that neither Mr. Justice Ryan nor the investigation committee will be able to do the job we are setting them to do. This is flawed legislation from that perspective. This is a point that I will have to press.</p>

        <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_456">
          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_902">I return to what I said about Ms Justice Laffoy's resignation. I firmly believe that if the Department gave her the proper resources to carry out the work that we could have full hearings for everybody concerned within a reasonable period of time and we would not have this problem. If I was raped or assaulted or my school friend was thrown out a window — some of the accusations made in regard to Artane — I would like my story to be told. In such circumstances, no one should dare say to me that my story or my interpretation of one individual's role in an institution is not as important as that of somebody else. My experience and pain would be mine: I would have suffered it. Nobody could tell me that my pain was irrelevant. That will be the effect of this sort of selectivity. At the very least the Government should simply explain that because of a lack of resources and the time delay it cannot afford to go into the minutiae of every single experience and this is why we are doing it. One may not like it but at least it is a reason. At present, one does not know whether a person is prejudiced in terms of the role of the investigative committee, why it makes a decision and why person is excluded. Perhaps person is a little more aggressive. People may not be able to deal with their anger or their experiences. Maybe we do not want to have to deal with them in an inquiry. That is the reason criteria should be set out.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">There is another reason, and this is the flip side of the coin, which is that individuals who have been affected by their experiences have accused people within the Minister's Department of being paedophiles. In a small number of cases people have been wrongfully accused of having committed acts on individuals who are making complaints. To find the absolute truth of what happened one needs to examine every story. There is always a case where one small chink of information sends the committee on a different route and gets additional information that may help to prove a person's innocence. The commission should be all-inclusive and all encompassing and, if not, proper criteria should be laid down so that one is seen to be fair and transparent and people can trust the process.</p>

          <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_904">This issue is essentially about power. People were put into institutions in positions of total powerlessness when things were done to them over which they had no control. Essentially we are trying leave as much power as possible with them in their dealings with the commission. In effect what is happening, if none of these amendments are accepted, is that they will not have the power and will not know why they are not being selected and will have no way of ensuring their story is told. If there are criteria as proposed in some of the amendments at least they will know the criteria and will be able to assess whether their story has a relevance to some of the criteria and they will be able to argue their case. At least this restores some of the power. Ideally, everybody should be able to tell his or her full story.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">If we accept there has to be a certain amount of cutting back in the interests of allowing the process to go through in a reasonable timeframe, at least we should give as much power as possible to the survivors. In her response the Minister constantly speaks about what the commission is trying to achieve from the point of view of the commission and Mr. Justice Ryan whereas there is a need for a balance of power between the commission and those coming before it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_458">
          <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_906">It is important that there is openness and transparency in regard to how people are selected. The Minister mentioned Daingean, Letterfrack, Artane and so on and I presume the reason for that is the large numbers. However, there is still the problem of who will be selected. Will it be a person who cannot deal with his or her anger, a person who has a drink problem or a person who does not have a drink problem? How will the selection be made? Somebody mentioned survivors. Some people do not see themselves as survivors but rather as victims. That debate is also going on within the process. Some people see themselves as moving on while others are still caught in that trap in which they were left after coming out of these institutions. There will have to be transparency and some type of criteria but I do not know how one can arrive at that criteria. Certainly, there is a need for some mechanism where a person can tell his or her story or be told why he or she is not being given that opportunity. The mechanism as it is designed will not fulfil that need. There are many people out there who want to tell their story, but we are coming to the point where only some will be able to tell their story.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">Some people who went through these institutions said they were fulfilled and that they did not see any of the problems going on around them. I presume they will be part of the sample selected. How will it rest with those who were abused when another person says it never happened?</p>

          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_908">Deputy O'Sullivan said I keep referring to the commission. This legislation is all about a commission. Were the commission to continue the way it was going, it would take another 11 years to finish its work. That is not just a cost factor from the point of view of the State. Many of the people who would need or want to be able to tell anything may not survive the 11 years. The longer the distance the worse the suffering becomes for people. Everybody in the House accepts that if the commission can get as complete a story as possible and as complete a picture as possible over that long period in a shorter timeframe of work that is what we should try to facilitate.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">In his contribution Deputy Crowe put his finger on many issues by mentioning some people who would have different perspectives and may not be able to give evidence for different reasons. How could that possibly be stated in criteria? The reasons the Deputy has given may well be the reasons a person may or may not be able to tell a full story. Given that the commission has to get the complete picture it has to hear about the complaints and the experiences. It needs to hear about it for each institution over a number of different decades. It could happen that a group of people who were together at the same time in the same place with the same people are recounting the same experience. There may not be any benefit to the commission in hearing all those people tell their story. What it urgently needs is a person from a different timeframe within the same institution who has been dealing with different experiences to tell his or her story to enable the commission do its work. I have no doubt the commission will be sensitive to the people it is dealing with, recognising what they have been through, in selecting those to go forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">The commission must have the flexibility to get the information it needs to produce the report it needs to find out the who, the what, the why the where because that is what we are asking it to do. I have not heard anybody say there should not be a process whereby some give the full story. The alternative is to let everybody continue to do it over a long period. That would be far too difficult for the victims and the survivors.</p>

          <p eId="para_1050">This issue goes to the heart of what the commission can and should be able to achieve. It was the view of the Government in establishing the commission that its inquiry should focus primarily on the wrong or malfunction in the system and not on individual wrongdoers. It should determine what happened at a general level rather than making findings of abuse in individual cases. It is not for the commission to assign blame or guilt for a specific case of abuse, which is for the criminal courts. Were the commission to do so, it could prejudice any criminal proceedings. It is important that we do not turn the work of the investigation committee into mini-trials given that approximately 1,300 cases are listed. This provision will allow the commission discretion in how it does it works by focusing not on individuals but on the general system to find out what went wrong in a system that allowed abuse to take place.</p>

          <p eId="para_1072">This amendment inserts a definition of education services into the section that deals with the body that administers educational grants to people who have been abused. It seems we need some definition of the educational services to be covered. There is a level of dissatisfaction with the administration of the education fund. The Minister will probably tell me that is why she is setting this up on a statutory basis, and I support that, but there will be a level of subjectivity in decisions made by the board unless there is a definition. I would like the definition to facilitate the various kinds of educational experiences that people feel are appropriate to themselves. This all goes back to our original debate on the need for criteria. People need to know why they are being refused and that it is not due to some arbitrary decision by people on the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1073">What will be a quorum on the board? Can decisions be made by a relatively small number of people? There is a certain need for an assurance that those making the decisions will be entirely objective and that every victim will have an equal chance of getting support under this fund. I am speaking in the context of those who have had such experiences. I appreciate that this is a new body, but people's experience needs to be taken into account. These are the people who are directly involved and who would have come to public representatives and given us their views. They need to know that decisions will be made in a proper fashion on the fund. It is a sizeable amount of public money but it is finite. A definition of what constitutes an educational service would, therefore, be appropriate.</p>

There is a concern about the money spent on some of the so-called educational projects. The close association of some people with projects means that a definition would make sense. People need to be comfortable about how public money is being spent. It is not infinite and it is important that it is used for the greatest good.</p>

          <p eId="para_1076">This education fund is worth €12.7 million. It is a substantial amount of money and it should go a long way to meeting the educational needs of the survivors and their families. The needs of each individual will be different so it would be wrong to specify in a narrow fashion which courses should be funded. The independent board will publish the criteria for the payment of grants and make information available on the range of educational services for which grants will be payable. However, if it is too prescriptive we may end up excluding people again. On Committee Stage, I gave the example of the person who got a grant to take driving lessons. That provided the person access to employment and so on. One might not think of driving lessons as an educational opportunity, but it may well have been the education that such a person needed to enable him or her to get a new opportunity in life.</p>
          <p eId="para_1077">The independent board will take on board each application and the needs of the individual. With that amount of money, the board should be able to meet a wide variety of needs. People have done traditional educational courses, but they have also done counselling courses, career training courses, pilot training and so on. The scheme should be flexible enough to allow for that kind of course to be taken.</p>

          <p eId="para_1078">I can see the point the Minister is making. We do not want to be too prescriptive, and driving lessons may be the very thing that someone needs, but in some cases people may need other supports like child care, in conjunction with an educational course. Such flexibility should be granted. At the same time there is a danger in going too far in the other direction and leaving it too open. There should be a system of review to tackle dissatisfaction with the spending of the fund to rein in the board. I would still prefer a specific definition of educational services, even if it was broad. In the absence of that, there should be a way of ensuring that the Oireachtas has an influence if the money is being spent badly and rapidly. If the Minister is not accepting my amendment, will she address that possibility?</p>

          <p eId="para_1079">There is a review system within the board. Should someone not get satisfaction there, he or she can go to the Ombudsman. The board will have to compile an annual report, which must be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. That will give us an opportunity to point out if the fund is being spent too quickly. Laying the report before the Houses gives us an extra safeguard.</p>

I am not sure the amendment achieves fully our aim of ensuring the board is covered as fully by the Ombudsman Act as any other body over which her office has jurisdiction. While we cannot do more today, we may well have further correspondence on the matter by the time the Bill goes before the Seanad. It is up to us to get our Seanad spokespersons to pursue the matter at that point. Further clarification is required on the powers set out in amendment No. 21.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1106">In page 20, between lines 32 and 33, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1107">"34.—Nothing in the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002 prohibits an applicant from disclosing the fact that he or she made an application to the Board and the name of the institution, the category of abuse and injury and the amount of the award that are referable to that application.".</p>
          <p eId="para_1108">As everyone knows, very little information can be disclosed about a person's appearance before the board due to prohibitions set out in the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002. Amendment No. 26 seeks to amend the Act to allow people to disclose the fact that they have made applications to the board and the name of the institution, category of abuse and injury and amount of award referable to such applications. I am not asking for people to be allowed to provide a great deal of information. Many would like to say more about their experiences with the redress board. Permission to disclose the information set out in the amendment would allow them to at least say something. Amendment No. 26 would also serve to provide the public with some information on the operation of the redress board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1109">Much dissatisfaction has been expressed by various sources about the experience of going before the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1110">Some people consider — this has been indicated to me — that their experience was similar to being abused again. I do not say that lightly. Many people have had very bad experiences. They felt they were not given enough time and that the aim was simply to categorise them so as to determine how much money they would get. The overall impression was that the board did not want to hear much from people. People are frustrated that, when they appear before the board, they cannot talk about what happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_1111">While the amendment does not go very far in terms of what people would be allowed to talk about, it would at least allow them to provide some information. If the Minister does not accept the amendment, which is probable, I urge her to take on board some of the representations coming to us in terms of the experience of people who have appeared before the board. Perhaps she could reconsider the legislation and the operation of the board to see if she could make the experience of appearing before the latter more positive. Many people are disturbed at having to go before the board and, subsequently, by their experience of so doing. This is not something I dreamed up, it has been indicated to me directly by people who have undergone the experience.</p>

        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_502">
          <from>Ms Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_1112">This is a reasoned amendment. People have also spoken to me about the trauma they experienced in appearing before the redress board, which is the opposite to what was intended when the Residential Institutions Redress Board was established. What is being sought in the amendment is limited. It avoids calling for the naming of any abuser and, in that sense, it is still protecting the identity of any abuser or alleged abuser. However, it deals with the institution, which is important, because there may have been other people in that institution who were abused.</p>
          <p eId="para_1113">We must bear in mind that the redress board is not a court involving conviction. It is important that people should be allowed talk about the category of their abuse in broad terms and about the amount of the award. The difficulty people have in coming out to a wall of silence is that they do not know if their experience is limited to them or if it is part of a broader experience. Perhaps if they knew and they could talk to other people who had undergone the same experience, they might not feel as traumatised or victimised because they would realise that it was not just something which happened to them and that it was the way the board operated.</p>
          <p eId="para_1114">Due to the fact that we are operating under a cloak of secrecy in terms of the Residential Institutions Redress Board, people do not have any comparisons to make and this makes them feel isolated. It is difficult for them to decide if their award is appropriate. We have seen a few instances of people going to court after an award had been made. However, this was a shot in the dark to some extent. If people knew of the experiences of others, perhaps they would see that the decision made in regard to them was appropriate. The amendment does not go very far but it addresses in some way the issues I have raised.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulNicholasGogartyGP" eId="spk_503">
          <from>Mr. Gogarty</from>
          <p eId="para_1115">Unfortunately, I cannot comment on amendment No. 23 because it has been ruled out of order. Will the Minister take cognisance of the fact that the various groups must have proper representation? There should be no conflict of interest. Concerns have been raised about payments to members, that there might be a little clique which would be seen to work with the Department of Education and Science as opposed to other groups such as Irish SOCA which has taken to opposing the Department in some instances. The operation of the board and the selection of its members should be examined carefully and with great scrutiny.</p>
          <p eId="para_1116">I support amendment No. 26. As stated on Committee Stage and previously in the House regarding payments made by the redress board, rumours have emanated that the highest figure is X amount but we do not necessarily know the position. People are not allowed to indicate exactly what they were paid and why. If, as Deputy Enright stated, they could do so in some instances, they would feel more at peace. People already feel that the State has done them a great injustice. For them to consider that the settlement they have been awarded is paltry and that other people in similar situations are getting more money perpetuates that sense of injustice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1117">If people were able to talk about the amount they received and the category of their abuse without naming abusers, it could enhance the legislation. This returns to my point about trust in the Bill rather than the thrust of the Bill. One must have trust in legislation. Anything that promotes transparency is good. I support the amendment purely in the interests of survivors being able to express to other survivors how the process worked for them.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanCroweSF" eId="spk_504">
          <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
          <p eId="para_1118">I support amendment No. 26. People are already telling their stories regardless of whether they are prohibited from doing so by the Act. Many stories have appeared in the media. A man was on hunger strike outside this building because he rightly felt that what was happening to him was unfair. There were also many other cases. We were told that the awards would be compatible with High Court awards but that is clearly not the case. There is a great disparity between what people are getting from the redress board and what they would get from the High Court. People are advised by lawyers to go down this route and then there is nothing they can do. They cannot appeal the amount awarded.</p>
          <p eId="para_1119">The amendment deals with the reality of what is happening. People are talking about their experiences of what they went through. It would be to the benefit of the process that they would be allowed to do so. It is part of the healing process. If people get a rough time appearing before the board or if they feel they were not listened to, they should be allowed to say that in public. Why should there be a veil of secrecy?</p>
          <p eId="para_1120">There does not appear to be any compatibility between the awards given by the board and what the High Court would award. A number of individuals have revealed to me the amounts they were offered. They were paltry when one considers what these people went through. I do not know what criteria the judge laid down for this. It would be important for people to be able to talk about the institution concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">The Minister referred to sampling from such places as Letterfrack, Artane and Daingean. People who were in those institutions are concerned that these are places where serious abuse took place. Allegations of serious institutional abuse in these places range from rape to possible murder. People were seriously damaged in these larger institutions. It is important that people would be allowed to speak about their experiences. The amendment is a positive one.</p>

          <from>Ms Hanafin</from>
          <p eId="para_1122">It is important to state that the confidentiality clause in the Residential Institutions Redress Act refers specifically to an application to that board, to any dealings with it, to the results thereof and to the awards made. It does not in any way preclude an individual from talking about their experiences within an institution or sharing that information with others. This privacy has suited a significant number of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1123">We are conscious of the fact that some people have experienced difficulties. Officials at the Department of Education and Science are involved in discussions with the survivors' groups about this. We must bear in mind that the board is independent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">If we can help the survivors' groups, we will obviously try, bearing in mind the independence of the board, to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">The privacy clause protects not only those who appear before the commission, namely, the survivors, but also other persons who might be named. It protects them from being hounded by other sources, such as the media, that want to know what happened and how much was awarded. It affords such people privacy so that they can deal with the matter in their own way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">The board does not make any findings of fact, nor does it deal with culpability. It does not consider an individual case or apportion blame to any individual group. It is important, therefore, that cases are not dealt with in public. The board publishes an annual report so information can be made available in a general sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_1127">Contrary to what Deputy Crowe said, there appears to be no disparity between awards made by the board and those made by the High Court. The awards made by the board have ranged from nil to €300,000. This is quite a range. A person can refuse what is offered and go to the High Court. This protection still exists.</p>
          <p eId="para_1128">We understand that the vast majority of people prefer the privacy arrangement that is in place. If there is a way in which we can help these people even more while protecting their privacy and not revealing the amounts awarded, while bearing in mind that the board is independent, we will try to do so.</p>

          <p eId="para_1129">I appreciate the Minister's statement that her Department is taking an interest and is involved in trying to address some of the issues that have arisen while respecting that the board is independent. These issues are serious for some and it is important that the Department have a role.</p>
          <p eId="para_1130">As other Deputies stated, my amendment is quite conservative. It is not seeking full disclosure but the disclosure of very limited information. It puts the onus for disclosure on the applicant so that he or she will not have to have information on himself or herself circulated if he or she does not want it to be circulated. If my amendment were accepted, it would be up to the applicants to disclose the fact that they made the application, the name of the relevant institution and the amount awarded.</p>
          <p eId="para_1131">At present, people are isolated. They do not know if their experience or award is comparable to that of others in their position. This makes it very difficult for them to establish solidarity with others who have had the same experience or to decide whether they have received a fair award.</p>
          <p eId="para_1132">My amendment is quite modest and I intend to press it because it is important to make this concession to people who have appeared and who will appear before the board in respect of what they can disclose.

Everybody knows that the board does not apportion blame or conduct a trial in any sense and that it assesses what is said and makes a decision on payment. I do not understand why naming an institution would automatically be considered as apportioning blame. We know payments are being made to people who resided at one of a list of institutions. I forget how many are on the list but it is a finite number. Therefore, every payment involves apportioning blame to an institution on the list. I do not understand how the naming of an institution implies that there would have to be a right to a full court hearing.</p>

          <p eId="para_1152">This is related to construction work. There were discussions on Committee and Report Stages in this House and subsequently in the Seanad. Arising mainly from discussions in this House, I introduced a new section 17, which addresses some of the difficulties that were pointed out at earlier stages. One of the concerns was that the responsibilities of people who commission construction projects should be more clearly set out, as well as the duties of construction contractors. This is a framework section setting out general obligations. The details will be dealt with in the regulations. However, this section addresses some perceived difficulties with the previous wording.</p>

In the context of the regulations I ask him to include the manner in which training takes place for workers on construction sites and elsewhere. There are obligations on employers, but also on training agencies and people who are listed as trainers. This has been brought into disrepute in recent times. I am not going to oppose anything the Minister of State is trying to do in this section. It is a step forward, but I ask him to give an undertaking that when the regulations are being drawn up he will bring them to the attention of this side of the House for discussion before they are finalised.</p>

          <p eId="para_1157">There are two questions about the regulations and when they might be in place. Considerable work has been done on the regulations. Originally it was intended to update the regulations under the previous legislation. However, since this Bill was close to being passed, it was felt it would be more appropriate to update them in the context of the new legislation. Some work has been done. There are areas of disagreement, one of which only came to my notice today, which may occasion a little more delay than I had previously anticipated. Considerable work is being done in that area, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">The other point about regulations, was raised by Deputy Hogan, as regards training. I want to acknowledge that this has been raised by the Deputy on a consistent basis and has drawn people's attention to the entire area of training and to the difficulties that have been experienced. I am not sure at this stage to what extent it is appropriate to include the issues of training in the building regulations. It might well be that it is in the general purpose regulations or elsewhere. However, I will certainly follow up the point he has made, wherever appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159">The other question concerned inspectors. We have not had a major difficulty as regards the number of inspectors. There was a drop in inspections last year because people were on other duties to do with the Presidency and so on. There has been a substantial increase this year and the targeted inspections have been particularly successful. They have been targeted at specific employments and also specific geographic areas. The Health and Safety Authority has informed me it is very satisfied at the outcome in that regard. One of the great changes to arise from this Bill is that individual employees will be empowered in a manner which had not been the case previously. To some extent the responsibility devolved on safety officers in the past. That is likely to change under the new Bill, where responsibility devolves on everybody to a greater extent than heretofore.</p>

The Bill currently requires employers to review their risk assessment and safety statement at least annually. This amendment removes that requirement, leaving just the obligation to review the assessment and statement when there has been a significant change or when there is reason to believe that one or other is no longer valid. It has been pointed out to me, as it was in this House, that there are a great many workplaces where there are few or no risks and where the level and nature of risk does not change over time. It was clearly seen that the requirement to change the safety statement annually was particularly burdensome and had no clear benefit.</p>

          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_1167">I have been contacted by several health and safety officers as regards the amendment the Minister of State introduced in the Seanad on this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168">Practitioners who ensure there are proper health and safety standards in the workplace are alarmed by the removal of the requirement for an annual risk assessment, the cornerstone, in their view, of vigilance in health and safety. I have received faxed memoranda from practitioners who attest from personal experience that the annual assessment is extremely important. One such memorandum states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1169">The only way to ensure that these proper safeguards are maintained in the workplace is to review the safety statement on an annual basis in order to safeguard workers. Risk assessment for each workplace has also played a major role in accident prevention so with this amendment the only requirement to carry out a risk assessment would be in cases of significant change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170">This raises the question as to what constitutes significant change and who determines that. It is not particularly onerous to have an annual obligation to carry out an assessment. If nothing has changed, the annual risk assessment will, by and large, address the same issues as on previous occasions. We should have regard to those at the cutting edge of providing a safe environment for workers and proceeding with this amendment is a matter of concern.</p>

          <from>Mr. Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_1171">I share the reservations expressed by the previous speaker. While I accept the Minister of State's argument as it applies to an office environment or similar passive setting which does not generally change from year to year, I am concerned by the use of the word "significant". For example, an employer in the chemical industry could decide that a change is not significant. How will the significance of a change be defined? Of late, we have become aware of wayward employers, albeit a minority who have used ambiguity such as this as an escape clause. How will this issue be addressed? How will the word "significant" be defined and who will adjudicate in practical terms on what is significant? Will inspectors have the authority to do so? How will the provision be policed?</p>

          <p eId="para_1172">The case outlined by Deputy Howlin has been made to me by some people, while the converse case, that the previous practice to review safety statements annually — even in circumstances in which they should be reviewed much more frequently or where significant changes have taken place — has also been made. I agreed to the amendment on the basis that placing emphasis on significant change rather than a requirement to have an annual assessment, which has no meaning in a large number of employments, is the better course of action.</p>
          <p eId="para_1173">The specific issue raised by Deputy Morgan will be dealt with under regulations for the chemical industry, which are under preparation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174">Before Deputy Howlin arrived, I responded to Deputy O'Sullivan on the issue of building regulations. I indicated to Deputy Howlin last week that these were at an advanced stage and that I expect to introduce them as soon as possible following the enactment of the Bill. It came to my attention today, however, that considerable disagreement has arisen with regard to an element of the regulations. While this may not delay matters interminably, it may delay the introduction of the regulations for a little longer than I anticipated last week.</p>

          <p eId="para_1176">I wish to re-examine this amendment. The Minister of State noted that risk assessments may be required more frequently than once a year. While I have no difficulty with that proposition, provision should be made to require an assessment to be made at least once per annum. If the Minister of State is amenable to providing that a risk assessment be undertaken annually or where significant change has taken place, I would have no difficulty. The problem is that an employer may take the view that no significant change has taken place, with the result that no risk assessment will take place for years. The latter would be dangerous.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177">The Minister of State pointed out that views have been presented to him from each side of the argument. I can only counsel that when dealing with health and safety legislation, he should err on the side of caution and have particular regard for practitioners on the front line who know how to create a safe environment. If they are of the opinion that this amendment is dangerous, the Minister of State should have regard to their view and not proceed with it.</p>

Although the proposal to introduce a regulation to address issues such as the definition of the word "significant" is reasonably fair, provided it can be introduced quickly, the Minister of State reinforces my point in indicating that this will be done as soon as possible and that he is doing his best in this regard. In the absence of regulation, is it possible to speed up the process and deal with the issue here and now? Can it be addressed by means other than this amendment?</p>

Now that we are aware of them, we will be able to make progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180">To return to the central point at issue, Deputy Howlin indicated that safety representatives have contacted him to express concerns about the amendment. While I understand their concerns, practitioners have made the point to me that, heretofore, our culture has to a large extent depended on safety officers. In the context of the legislation, we are trying to empower and encourage all workers to get involved in this area. It has come to my notice that the practice has been to have a glance annually at the safety statement, sign it off as updated and ignore significant changes made in the interim.</p>

          <p eId="para_1182">Subsection (1)(<i>c</i>) of the proposed new section empowers the inspectorate to require that a safety statement be amended. Throughout the legislation, considerably more pressure is placed on employers to be vigilant and take account of any changes in the risk which arises. On balance, the amendment serves the purposes of the Bill better than the previous provision did.</p>

          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_1183">The Minister of State has not made a coherent argument to support his conclusion. He stated that under subsection (1)(<i>c</i>) of the amendment, an inspector, in the course of an inspection, can give a direction. Unfortunately, as the Minister of State is aware, we have few labour inspectors and health and safety inspections are infrequent. If, as a result of the amendment, we must rely on an inspection to find flaws, it will be a hit and miss provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1184">The notion of an annual risk assessment is good. It is like a spring clean in that one is required to undertake an assessment and one is aware that it is approaching. Deputy Morgan and I have not heard who will determine what is significant in the event of the removal of the requirement to carry out an assessment, except where there is significant change. How will it be determined? Is it possible that safety assessments will not be carried out for years in certain employments where practices, by and large, are not thought to change, even if the fabric of a building may be different, new technologies or work practices may have been introduced or certain areas may have degenerated in the meantime? Who will determine what triggers a risk assessment?</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">Surely an annual provision is preferable to the proposed provision given that it provides certainty that the assessment will take place. If an assessment is required more frequently, as instanced by the Minister of State, this can also be provided for but we should not remove the requirement for an annual risk assessment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1186">Until now, the practice has been that an annual review was undertaken and that was it. I would prefer, in the context of this legislation, that people would undertake a review when there has been a significant change in the matters to which a safety statement refers. I will not give a detailed treatise on the word "significant" but, in the context of this Bill and the extent to which it empowers employees and protects them when they raise issues of health and safety, I am confident that any significant change of which employees are aware or which arises in employment will be brought to an employer's attention. I would much prefer if an employer had an onus on him or her to take account of changes.</p>

The requirement for an annual report is seen as more than adequate and, as a result, there is no emphasis on monitoring the work place and ensuring that anything which changes leads to a review of a safety statement or risk assessment. That is the kind of culture I am aiming to introduce following the enactment of this legislation. In many circumstances, the annual review is an exercise that has no great benefit and becomes an excuse for not doing what ought to be done in circumstances where a change occurs.</p>

            <p eId="para_1331">The objectives I have set out in regard to public order, vulnerable groups, protection and combating alcohol abuse are being addressed by encouraging the consumption of food with alcohol, countering the trend towards superpubs by encouraging the development of venues where alcohol is accompanied by food and promoting coherence between the planning and licensing codes and strengthening the role of local authorities in licensing matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1332">The whole question of binge drinking is one part of what we are addressing today. I was reading last night's speeches and I was particularly impressed with Deputy Hayes's contribution. Leaving aside his diversion with alcopops, the whole question of binge drinking and superpubs and the need for alternative forms of recreation for young people was addressed by him in a pertinent way. I am informed that as far as binge drinking is concerned 16 to 18 years olds are not the problem but rather those in their 20s and early 30s. A huge number of people live at home. We have all heard of families — most of us have children who are in their early 20s — whose children are at home and who cannot afford to get married and buy a house. These are the people, not the very young, who tend to go to superpubs and partake in the drinking that is so damaging.</p>
            <p eId="para_1333">Somebody said the way to get around this problem is to put a roof on the country so that people can play sports. We are trying to do that. In an area close to where I live a competition is run every year called tag rugby. For two months during the year young men and women together play tag rugby two nights per week. It is an alternative to what they would otherwise do, which is drinking in these pubs. They are not comfortable at home all the time. It is great to see the Government, particularly the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, putting so much money into the sports capital programme because that is where it is needed to ensure that there is an alternative.</p>
            <p eId="para_1334">I grew up in a pub where 50 years ago I picked up bottles and glasses. Bottles of Guinness were drank at that time because the pint was not looked upon as being of the same quality as it is today. Excessive drinking was a problem then. There are no quick-fixes. This has been an issue in society for many years. We are here to legislate and the Bill which is going through is an aid for society to change the culture. No Bill will change the way people consider drink, whether it should be taken in excess or moderation. Society has to do that. We as leaders within our communities and GAA clubs have a responsibility. There is a bar in every GAA club and those clubs have a responsibility to change the ethos and culture that is developing there. I am not picking on the GAA, it does a huge job throughout the country with sports, but the pub culture in that sporting activity must be looked at.</p>
            <p eId="para_1335">The Bill goes a long way to put the structures in place that will assist society and the leaders in our communities to change the culture of excess to one of moderation. I commend the Minister for his work on the Bill and I support the amendment.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaeSextonPD" eId="spk_574">
            <from>Ms Sexton</from>
            <p eId="para_1336">I take this opportunity to thank the Minister for his extensive contribution last evening. In outlining the main objectives of the proposed intoxicating liquor Bill and the reforms it contains, he dealt comprehensively with the substance of the original Opposition motion.</p>
            <p eId="para_1337">I would, however, like to expand on one point in the original motion and the implications on public health. There is a reference to the link between the increase in availability of alcohol and greater consumption. This point is integral to the licensing issue and to what the Government is setting out to achieve.</p>
            <p eId="para_1338">According to the strategic task force on alcohol, there was a 41% increase in alcohol consumption <i>per capita</i> between 1989 and 1999. During that period there was no increase in licence numbers. There was also a huge population growth during that time. What this reveals is that even though the number of outlets might remain steady, it is the nature of the outlet, combined with the drinking behaviour, that contributes to increased consumption. In light of this, the only sensible approach is to tackle the two issues specifically, the nature of the outlet and drinking behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_1339">On the first issue the extinguishing of a licence in one location to be rekindled in another has played a major role. A small rural public house may close and in its place we get a 2,000 capacity, late night, urban city, drinking venue. The number of licences remains constant, but the amount of alcohol consumed rockets. It is the nature of many new establishments to provide the simple service of allowing as many people as possible, mostly younger people, to drink as much as possible as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1340">Sweetened alcoholic drinks based on strong spirits are sold in ever-increasing numbers to younger people in venues where music is deliberately played at a high level to discourage chatting and encourage drinking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1341">Clearly it is not the preferred route that this type of establishment becomes more prevalent in an unfettered way. Alternative venues and surroundings for the consumption of alcohol are desirable. I doubt any Member would challenge that point. The proposed Bill suggests that local authorities should assess the suitability of premises for the sale of alcohol. It seems reasonable that the size in square footage of the premises should be linked to the granting of a licence. Perhaps the amount of square footage should be capped in some cases. If joined-up policy between the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is required, that is what we should pursue. However, the nature of drinking premises is just one important aspect of this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1342">This brings me to the second issue, that of drinking behaviour. Setting aside the obvious difficulty of enforcement, the restrictions which currently apply to restaurants under the 1988 legislation can only be described as unreasonable. Restaurants can and should provide the type of surroundings I referred to earlier, more conducive to sensible consumption of drink in conjunction with the serving of food. Currently one cannot have a drink while browsing a menu, can only drink when the order is taken and must finish that drink within 30 minutes of finishing the meal. The food and drink must be paid for at the same time. This makes no sense.</p>
            <p eId="para_1343">If we are to encourage more sensible drinking behaviour, unreasonable and outdated practices such as these must be removed. I commend the Minister for addressing these and related, issues. Making it more amenable for people to spend an evening, and I mean the full evening, in a restaurant which serves their preferred alcoholic drink in conjunction with a meal is preferable to the superpub and café bar models. It is not surprising that this was the preferred option of the Minister from the outset.</p>
            <p eId="para_1344">I refer again to the strategic task force on alcohol. We as legislators have a duty to ensure that the law is suitable and adequate. This is our responsibility. It can be a difficult task when it comes to changing people's behaviours. Speeding and drink driving are classic examples of how legislation on its own has failed to encourage people to drive more carefully. The same problem exists with drinking habits and the law can only do so much. Responsibilities must be shared among individuals, parents and the wider society.</p>
            <p eId="para_1345">The drinks industry also has a responsibility and the task force has highlighted such issues as improved training of bar staff, availability of food, lower priced non-alcoholic and low alcohol drinks and the removal of drinks promotions as some of the ways in which the drinks industry can help reduce alcohol related problems. I welcome the proposals for addressing these matters by those in the industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1346">Low alcohol drink attracts a lower tax rate and the industry should promote drinks with lower rather than higher alcohol content as a means of reducing intoxication. Given the scale of the short and long-term implications of binge drinking, a partnership approach is the most desirable way forward. Alcohol consumption, particularly but not exclusively among younger people, has detrimental health and social outcomes for the individual and in many cases their partners and wider family. I am satisfied that where legislative reform can play a part in tackling this issue, the Government is taking the necessary action.</p>

            <p eId="para_1347">It requires a great deal of time to deal with this issue but I am aware we are all under pressure. I welcome the attendance of the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Seán Power. It is a reminder that the public's concern about alcohol related disorder and health problems must be recognised. The safeguards and proposals intended to combat these problems are very necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_1348">I speak as a Dáil Deputy from Dublin South-West which includes the major town of Tallaght. I mention this because Tallaght has fewer pubs than most country villages. I know this because I have counted them and I am easily an expert on this subject although there are pubs in Brittas, Firhouse, Greenhills, Templeogue, just to embrace all the constituency. I have frequent contact with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform not only to try to ensure there are more gardaí in Tallaght and a new Garda station constructed there but also to raise issues with him which are of concern to constituents. People who come to my eight clinics held every week and to my full-time office in Tallaght village talk to me about alcohol related disorder and the problems of concern to them. I received many calls in recent weeks about café bars.</p>
            <p eId="para_1349">Those Members who read <i>The Irish Times</i> will have noticed I am mentioned in that newspaper. I am delighted whenever I am mentioned in <i>The Irish Times </i>because it does not often happen. I am referred to in a letter to the newspaper this morning in which a constituent complains that I am supporting anti-social behaviour orders. It is true I support them and I will tell the House the reason. People tell me they are no longer prepared to tolerate their lives being disrupted and their windows being broken. My constituency is not unique in this because all Members can say it is an issue throughout the country. It is important we stand up and be counted on this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1350">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is being brave. He attended the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting last night and proved that he is not afraid to take on challenges. I was thinking of Deputy James Breen at the time as it is always good to see new faces at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting and I look forward to seeing even more of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_1351">This has been a funny week regarding this issue. When the Taoiseach was in CityWest in Saggart, which is close to Tallaght, on Monday night, he made the point that this process has been concerned with consultation even though sometimes we are consulted to death. We have been consulted and, in fairness to the Minister, he has engaged in a great deal of consultation on this subject. He understands what people are saying and it is important that we now go forward.</p>
            <p eId="para_1352">I had hopes that some compromise could be reached regarding the vote on this Private Members' motion, bearing in mind that the Minister is doing what Fine Gael wants him to do.</p>

I believe his proposal requiring all off-licences to have written policies and control procedures in place will increase awareness of the rules on sales to under 18s and will hopefully increase the vigilance of licensees with a view to combating such sales.</p>
            <p eId="para_1357">I am pleased the Bill prohibits drunkenness and disorderly conduct in licensed premises as well as the supply of intoxicating liquor to under 18s and its consumption by them. The Garda Síochána will be allowed object to a renewal of licences and nightclub permits where there has been public disorder or other breaches of the licensing law. I support this measure. In the interests of allowing time for other Deputies to speak, I am happy to concede now.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_1358">It is good the House is debating this issue but I think the opportunity has been missed by many to deal with the real problem, namely, the abuse of alcohol.</p>
            <p eId="para_1359">In 2000 the Government established the Commission on Liquor Licensing which has produced four reports, the final one of which was published in April 2003. The mandate for that commission was to review the liquor licensing system and recommend a new system which would meet the needs of consumers while also taking account of the social, health and economic needs of citizens. The final report made a number of recommendations relating to combating drunkenness and tackling the problems of under age and binge drinking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1360">In January 2002 the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, established a strategic task force on alcohol and requested it to make recommendations that were evidence-based and would prevent and reduce alcohol-related harm in Ireland. The task force reported last year and made a number of important recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1361">Alcohol is the biggest problem to be confronted by this country. We have been far too tolerant in the past and we have a love-hate relationship with alcohol. Our tolerance may have created many of the difficulties. There is now more awareness of the dreadful hardship it causes for many families and now is the time for action.</p>
            <p eId="para_1362">I ask Members to be more positive in their contributions as I know some were rubbing their hands with glee when they heard that Fianna Fáil backbenchers were opposed to a certain proposal from the Minister, Deputy McDowell. The issue is bigger than that. In fairness to the Minister, while he explained last night in the House that the proposal came from the commission, he and the Government are attempting to change a culture.</p>
            <p eId="para_1363">This country has had a culture of drinking for a long time. When a baby is born his head must be wetted with a drink and the same occurs at baptisms, weddings and funerals. We want to wish people luck and those occasions are always associated with drink. Events such as Holy Communion and Confirmation are celebrated by children being brought to the pub as if that were a child's ideal day out. It is more to do with meeting and fulfilling the needs and habits of adults rather than children. Very few families have not been affected by alcohol. We are very much aware of the problem it creates. I compliment the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, on his proposal, which sought to change the culture so that people could drink more in moderation than to excess as so many do at the moment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1364">I had the honour of bringing the report of the task force on alcohol before the Cabinet recently. The Government gave approval to implement the recommendations that come within the remit of the Department of Health and Children and other Departments were also asked to implement the recommendations within their remit. We will establish a committee including the industry to consider how we can work together to implement these recommendations in a positive way. Later this year my Department will produce its action plan outlining the measures we intend to take in dealing with the problem. The committee will consider three areas in particular, binge drinking, drink driving and under-age drinking. It is important to involve the industry and social partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_1365">Much work has been done behind the scenes and the Department is working with other people involved in the industry including those in advertising. We have reached an agreement with broadcasters on a code of practice so that alcohol advertising is restricted in its content and volume. Alcohol advertisements can only be broadcast at certain times and cannot be broadcast, for example, during children's programmes. Those involved in the industry have become more conscious of their obligations and working with them will ultimately produce the best result. However, we have a big job ahead of us.</p>
            <p eId="para_1366">The past decade has seen many changes here. For the majority of people this means having more money in their pockets, which in itself has changed and influenced drinking behaviour resulting in an increase in alcohol-related harm. Ireland had the highest increase in alcohol consumption among European countries between 1990 and 2002 when alcohol consumption <i>per capita</i> increased by 41%. During that period the majority of other European countries had little or no increase in their alcohol consumption. A European study showed that adults in Ireland have the highest reported consumption per drinker and the highest level of binge drinkers when compared with other European countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1367">Alcohol related harm does not just affect the drinker. We tend to believe the drinker is the only one harmed when we see excessive drinking. Unfortunately, the statistics are all too evident. We have domestic violence and violence in the streets. We often have cases of people filling in for a work colleague, who missed a day's work, came in late or left early, which is all related to alcohol and its effect. Despite the tendency in the media to focus on under-age drinking, the vast majority of alcohol-related harm happens among the adult population. It is unfair to point the finger at the young people and accuse them of all the ills associated with alcohol. Some 25% of people presenting at our accident and emergency departments are there because of alcohol-related incidents. This is an enormous drain on our resources and we will need to change the way we behave and treat alcohol.</p>
            <p eId="para_1368">Between 1992 and 2002 more than 14,000 people died from the five main alcohol-related mortality causes, namely suicide, cancer, alcohol-related poisoning, liver cirrhosis and alcohol abuse. If those people had never drunk or drank less, the majority of them could be alive today, which shows the impact alcohol consumption has had on their families. Alcohol does not just affect the person consuming it, but also the wider circle of family, friends and often a community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1369">We have a number of recommendations on which we intend working. In many cases we will work with social partners and those involved in the drinks industry to get their co-operation in implementing the recommendations. It is the biggest problem confronting the industry and if people have positive suggestions it is important for them to come forward. It is in the best interest of the nation to tackle this problem immediately and in a serious way.</p>

            <from>Mr. Nolan</from>
            <p eId="para_1370">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the motion this evening. When Fine Gael Members tabled this motion I am sure they were unaware of what was going on within the Government parties. I commend the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the way he has dealt with the problem and specifically the proposal for café bars. The Minister confirmed to our parliamentary party meeting last night that while it was not his intention to proceed with a café bar licence, as it had been recommended in the commission's report he and his Government colleagues felt it could not be excluded from the heads of a Bill, which had been discussed at a Cabinet meeting some time ago. He advised us that his preference was to extend the restaurant licensing system and this will be included in the new legislation to be published later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1371">All the speakers so far have focused on the drinking culture here. If the controversy of the past two weeks has done nothing else it has highlighted the difficulties our society faces, particularly the difficulties encountered by our younger people. Every week our provincial and national newspapers report the effects the abuse of alcohol is having on our society. It is causing heartbreak and hardship. I am sure every Member of the House has attended funerals where the abuse of alcohol resulted in death. It is very hard to see families so affected. We have an onus to update our legislation and this debate is a forerunner to the debate we will have later in the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1372">A number of television programmes have recently highlighted the problem, which is not unique to Ireland. We see the effects it has on other European countries. However, because of the culture and tradition of hard drinking here, we must tackle the problem now. We have a better educated population and with the co-operation of the drinks industry, the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children, and the Garda something can be done. If this motion has done nothing else it has triggered a debate, which is good in itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_1373">I am glad the Minister has decided to drop the café bar proposal. Publicans and vintners as a group have taken considerable stick in recent days from various commentators. They have been accused of being greedy and selfish. Of the publicans I know in County Carlow, 99% are hard-working, decent, honourable business people trying to earn an honest living in an unfavourable climate. I know of many rural pubs that do not open until 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. People are struggling to make a business out of their pubs. They tell me their children are disinterested and do not want to continue in the business. We may be too critical of publicans. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this and hope the Minister introduces his legislation sooner rather than later.</p>

            <from>Mr. Healy</from>
            <p eId="para_1374">The last paragraph of this motion calls on the Government to provide the necessary resources and direction to the Garda to ensure that existing legislation is enforced and public disorder related to so-called superpubs is tackled consistently. At 2 a.m. in every village, town and city during weekends thousands of young people with nowhere to go spill on to the streets from these pubs and nightclubs. This results in serious alcohol related anti-social behaviour. It is time the Garda had the resources to install closed circuit television cameras in large towns and villages. In south Tipperary, such towns include Clonmel, Carrick-on-Suir and Tipperary town. I call on the Minister to speed up the process by which closed circuit television cameras will be installed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1375">The Minister often spoke of recruiting 2,000 extra gardaí, but only 34 extra have been recruited this year. We need additional manpower to police the streets. Ambulance personnel are fearful for their own safety during situations like the ones I just described. They will not even get out of the ambulance until gardaí arrive. We have 39 gardaí in the Clonmel area, which means there are at most seven gardaí on shift at any one time. That is simply not good enough.</p>

            <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
            <p eId="para_1376">This is primarily a health issue. The concept of café bars is not a bad idea. The difficulty is that we already have too many alcohol outlets in this State. We have 13,000 pub licences which is equivalent to one pub for every 260 adults, compared to one pub for every 780 adults in Britain. Yet we think Britain is full of pubs. The addition of more pubs would have sounded the death knell for rural pubs, many of which have closed already.</p>
            <p eId="para_1377">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was quoted in this morning's newspapers as saying that he disagreed with the task force report on alcohol, which details the over-availability of alcohol in Ireland. The Minister rubbished the opinion of the medical experts such as Dr. Joe Barry, a distinguished specialist and lecturer in public health in Trinity College Dublin and who was a member of the task force on alcohol. The Minister now knows more than the medical experts and more than the task force that reported on alcohol. There may be medical degrees available up lamp-posts in Dublin. The top of a lamp-post is like the famous salmon of knowledge touched by Fionn MacCumhail and which imparted to the Minister some extraordinary knowledge to which none of the medical experts are privy. Did something happen up that lamp-post in that rarefied atmosphere?</p>
            <p eId="para_1378">The Bill, as published, is basically flawed. It needs to be re-examined and some questions need to be asked. Does the Minister support the report of the strategic task force on alcohol? Does the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children support the report? If they do not — their body language suggests they do not — that raises very serious issues. Does the former Chairman of the Joint Committee on Health and Children, Deputy Batt O' Keeffe, support the report? Will the Government deal with the alcohol problem? It is about availability and a plan. Does the Government have a proper plan?</p>

          <speech by="#TonyGregory" eId="spk_584">
            <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
            <p eId="para_1379">If the proposed introduction of café bars was motivated by a desire to change the emphasis of the alcohol drinking culture from one centred in pubs more or less exclusively involving alcohol, to one which provided a mixed environment that involves food and drink giving a more relaxed atmosphere for everyone, then it was a good idea. However, the idea would require significant cultural change to be implemented. A glass or two of wine with nutritious food is far preferable to endless pints of beer. The big difficulty with the idea, however, was that it involved a major increase in the number of outlets dispensing alcohol, as the café bars would be in addition to everything else. Most international evidence suggests that the more alcohol outlets in existence, the more alcohol related problems are created. The strategic task force on alcohol recommended restricting the number of outlets selling alcohol. In other words, the most successful way to reduce harm is to reduce the number of outlets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1380">Regulation and restriction is never popular. As the Minister has now decided to allow all restaurants sell all kinds of alcohol, he should perhaps oblige all pubs to sell tea, coffee and snacks during all opening hours. We really need a national alcohol strategy, with local and regional structures put in place to implement that strategy. Perhaps alcohol, being the most harmful of all legal and illegal drugs, should be combined with drugs and dealt with in a unifying way by the existing national and local structures currently dealing with illegal drug problem. It is time at least to implement the recommendations of the strategic task force on alcohol.</p>
            <p eId="para_1381">One aspect of the alcohol problem causing major concern in communities that I represent, is the spiralling increase in the availability of alcohol from supermarket outlets. This is fuelling a very serious social problem and causing damage to the health of young people and to the wellbeing of communities. It is the source of many of the problems of anti-social behaviour now being experienced. The Minister should look at that issue and attempt to address it.</p>

          <speech by="#JamesBreen" eId="spk_585">
            <from>Mr. J. Breen</from>
            <p eId="para_1382">I am disappointed, but not surprised, by the now frequent and absurd U-turns by the current Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The latest fiasco surrounding legislation on outlets selling alcohol is another example of how this Minister and the Government are displaying a lack of cohesion and leadership on important issues in our society. They cited the need for a healthier society and the protection of young people from the danger of alcohol abuse as some of the main reasons for the legislation initially proposed. The Minister stated that there was a need for honest debate rather than opportunistic posturing on how best to address the problem of alcohol related harm in our society. Does that mean that up until now, the Minister did not engage in honest debate? Did he engage in any debate at all?</p>
            <p eId="para_1383">The evidence of the revolt by Government backbenchers suggests that not much consultation occurred and the hurried proposals, probably sponsored by corporate Ireland, were quickly abandoned when the feelings of backbenchers were made known. Were the views of the health and education sector listened to at all? The proposed legislation was all about money. There was no interest in providing for better education about alcohol for young people. There was no mention of the provision of better recreational facilities for young people as an alternative to pub culture. Instead of offering young people better facilities for youth clubs and sports clubs, the Minister proposed to increase the number of facilities that offer alcohol.</p>
            <p eId="para_1384">The traditional Irish pub is not the cause of binge drinking by young people. Such pubs are usually well run establishments and are well supervised. The emergence of the greed of the superpub is one of the factors that has encouraged binge drinking. While the philosophy of getting people drunk as quickly as possible before throwing them out to let more punters in is all too prevalent today, the Minister has not seen fit to include restrictions on superpubs. The advertising and sale of alcopops, which are strong alcoholic drinks laced with sugar to make them attractive, are designed to encourage binge drinking. The main target group is young people, but the Minister does not propose to ban their sale. Advertising and sponsorship of sports by drinks companies increasingly encourage young people to drink alcohol.</p>
            <p eId="para_1385">While the Government claims it wants to protect young people and educate them about alcohol abuse, it has failed to include education and health proposals in its legislation. No additional spending in these areas is proposed. The Government has twisted itself into a knot to meet the growing needs of corporate Ireland and does not care about people who need help. The Minister is reported in a newspaper today as saying he did not accept that someone having a few beers would be any more likely to commit suicide. A few pages later, the same newspaper reports from the Dublin Children's Court that the Health Service Executive does not have the resources to find an appropriate residential therapeutic replacement for a 13 year old boy who has tried to kill himself three times. When will the Government cease introducing damage-limitation legislation and pandering to the media and corporate Ireland and take constructive action on this issue to help our society?</p>

          <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_586">
            <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
            <p eId="para_1386">I not convinced the motion or the amendment goes to the heart of the action required to address the use of alcohol in Ireland. I am the first to admit the issue is difficult and requires the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to square the circle between health and competition concerns and to unravel the historic mesh of licensing laws which control the sale of alcohol. The emergence of the superpub has been the most significant change over the past 15 years in terms of where we consume alcohol. Planning authorities, county managers and politicians did not see this one coming. I was fortunate enough to be at the heart of the change when I lived close to Temple Bar and saw what was happening. I saw beautiful, small, intimate pubs, which epitomised the product we offer tourists, demolished, ransacked and cleared out of the way to be replaced with drinking dens with all the atmosphere of an airport departure lounge.</p>
            <p eId="para_1387">It was a crime against the people of Ireland and everything I hold dear about the country to give the cartel which controls the licensing industry free rein to expand licensed premises to double or treble their original sizes. It was not good enough to stand idly by, but I watched my colleagues on Dublin City Council, Bord Fáilte, Dublin Tourism and Temple Bar Properties lay themselves down and give publicans whatever they wanted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1388">It is correct to have restrictions on alcohol, a drug that must be considered carefully. The continuation of the <i>status quo</i>, however, will not suffice. Licences are in the hands of a small and incredibly wealthy group of publicans who live in a country in which a licence to pull pints amounts to a licence to print money. I applaud the Minister’s determination to modernise our licensing laws because the law is an ass in its regulations on the sale of alcohol, which have existed for two centuries. It is crazy that a city the size of Tallaght has a mere handful of pubs when one cannot walk across the street in Temple Bar without passing one. We must tackle this state of affairs head on. I would love to see the number of superpubs reduced while the emergence of café bars is facilitated. The Minister must reduce the number of drinking halls if café bars are to thrive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">People say time and again that we are not like the French, Italians or Spanish, but at the heart of the average Irish person is significant envy for the Mediterranean lifestyle. Irish people greatly admire the Mediterranean ability to sit down after work and have a glass of beer outside a small local pub where one knows the person behind the counter and he or she knows the people. In Italy, where I lived for a year, one is certainly not served a further drink if one has had one too many. There is a role for the publican in existing legislation in controlling drinking, which clearly provides that a publican may not serve someone who is intoxicated. Publicans and off-licences are turning a blind eye, which is why the law must be adequately enforced.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">We must modernise our licensing laws. I made a detailed submission to the Commission on Liquor Licensing five years ago in which I expressed the opinion, perhaps because of my background as a town planner, that planning laws were adequate to deal with licensing arrangements, especially if permits to trade were granted for limited periods. While I am still not convinced we need a great deal of control over the sector, we must enforce the legislation we have enacted. I plead with the Minister to adequately enforce existing legislation. The Irish people are ready for café bars provided sufficient controls are implemented.</p>

            <p eId="para_1391">Sinn Féin welcomes the fact that the café bar proposal has been dropped. It was supposedly aimed at changing drinking culture, addressing binge drinking and related public order offences and countering the trend towards superpubs. The Minister, Deputy McDowell, failed to demonstrate how the creation of another category of licensed premises would achieve any of this, given that pubs already serve food and many of them are making the changes necessary to accommodate that.</p>
            <p eId="para_1392">It was ludicrous to suggest that the drinking culture could be changed and that people could be induced to go out for meals with drinks rather than have drinks alone, by means of a change in the licensing laws. The law would have created more outlets for alcohol consumption in addition to existing pubs, including superpubs. This undermined the argument that it would address over-consumption of alcohol. The case is well put that it would not and that has been recognised by the Minister of State's colleagues in the Fianna Fáil Party in the coalition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1393">The ill-fated proposals of the Minister, Deputy McDowell, ignored the reality in smaller towns and rural districts, like the constituency of Cavan-Monaghan which I represent, where many small, family-run pubs which the Minister supposedly favours are closing down. In Castleblayney alone, five pubs have closed which were operated by and sustained families for generations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1394">I participate in this debate as my party's spokesperson on health because alcohol should be seen first as a health issue. It is very disturbing that the Minister gave no weight to the opposition to his proposal on café bars on health grounds from the Government's strategic task force on alcohol, the Irish Medical Organisation and the national alcohol policy adviser to the Department of Health and Children. In that regard it was reported today that the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting last night heard the Minister, Deputy McDowell, who must have been a guest speaker, dismiss Dr. Joe Barry of the strategic task force on alcohol as someone who wanted to give syringes to drug addicts in prison. I challenge the Minister to come to the House and repeat exactly what he said.</p>
            <p eId="para_1395">If the report is correct, it is yet another contemptuous dismissal by the Minister of a very serious proposal, that is, needle exchange in prisons, which in other countries has proven to be an important method of addressing infections such as HIV and hepatitis C and the danger of injuries to staff from concealed needles. Once again the Minister displayed his refusal to listen and learn by treating a serious issue in this offhand manner. The extent of his ignorance of effective drug policy is perhaps best illustrated by his plan to introduce mandatory drug testing of prisoners at a time when the Scottish prison system is scrapping a similar programme because it leads prisoners to switch from cannabis to heroin use.</p>
            <p eId="para_1396">The debate we should be having is one on our society's attitude to alcohol and how that drug is regulated. Our first concern should be public health. Alcohol related illness affects far more people than alcohol related anti-social behaviour and neither are acceptable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1397">This is all-Ireland men's health week called for by the Men's Health Forum. I commend it on its initiative. In its excellent report, Men's Health in Ireland, it highlights how men, particularly young men, are more at risk from the dangers of alcohol consumption. The sharp increase in alcohol consumption in this State over the past decade is reflected in a rise in drink related illnesses, including cancers, and in deaths. This aspect of the alcohol debate gets far too little attention. We need resources to educate people about the dangers. The Fine Gael motion calls for existing legislation to be enforced to tackle drink related public disorder. We concur with that view. We do not need new laws.</p>

            <p eId="para_1400">This is a topic we could debate for hours. Our friend from Tallaght, Deputy O'Connor, asked why we could not reach a consensus on this motion. I agree with him. I would like to know which part of our motion the Government could not agree with. The first part of the motion called on the Minister to abandon his plans for the licensing of café bars. That is no longer an issue. The next point refers to putting in place a co-ordinated approach at Government level for the preparation and implementation of a national alcohol strategy. I am not sure what is wrong with that. I thought we would all agree with it. Why did the Government not agree with it? It must be the third point, to provide the necessary resources and direction to the Garda to assure that existing legislation is enforced and public disorder related to so-called superpubs is tackled, with which the Government disagreed. It is down to resources. That must be the main reason. Deputy O'Connor is probably gone back to Tallaght but if he is listening, that is the sticking point.</p>
            <p eId="para_1401">I wish to clarify one point. Last night, the Minister consistently referred to young people and alcohol. I am delighted the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Seán Power, clarified that it is not just young people who abuse alcohol. We might be the most visible because we are out in towns late at night but other people drink at home. Many people who leave pubs are full of alcohol and cause a great deal of trouble at home. It must be clarified in any debate on alcohol abuse and binge drinking that it does not just concern young people. I hope the Minister, Deputy McDowell, will clarify his comments in this regard at a later stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1402">I am delighted the Minister has backed down on his proposal for café bars. I am sure it was embarrassing for him but I admire a man who admits he is wrong. I was full of admiration for the Minister's admission that he was wrong until I discovered he had claimed it was not his idea but that it came from the Commission on Liquor Licensing. He only put it forward because the commission wanted it. That is a load of baloney. He has been talking about it for the past two years as a solution to binge drinking.</p>
            <p eId="para_1403">I do not believe that café bars and a change of culture would change our binge drinking problem. If the Minister wants to have deregulation and more licences we will debate that, but it should not be disguised as a solution to binge drinking because that is not the case. That is one of the reasons this side of the House has opposed it. Although the Minister has hailed his proposal as a solution to a problem, that is not the case. It is merely delaying tactics on behalf of a Minister who cannot get results. He introduces debates which continue for hours and garner publicity for himself rather than tackling the real problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1404">If the Minister wants to introduce deregulation in future we can debate that but we should solve the problems we have first. We should deal with existing facilities first and with alcohol abuse. If we are to have more outlets we will need more people to manage them, police them and so on. That is a debate for another day.</p>
            <p eId="para_1405">I regret that the Minister did not use the opportunity yesterday to debate alcohol. He stated that we must have a debate on alcohol. We have given him the chance with this motion to debate alcohol and alcohol abuse but he decided to spend ten or 15 minutes last night telling us about his new Bill which he will introduce in a few weeks. He will spend another half hour talking about it then. Nothing new is proposed in the Bill. Its purpose is to regularise matters and correct things that are already happening. His radical proposal to change alcohol licences in restaurants is happening anyway. Most restaurants have any amount of alcohol one wants which can be served with food. He is not doing anything great or achieving results. I wish he would debate alcohol with us some day, as he has proposed. I have asked for such a debate for two years, as have colleagues of mine. We cannot get a proper debate on alcohol abuse. There is no point in the Minister saying he will do it if it does not happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_1406">Deputy Jim O'Keeffe referred to areas in which the Government is failing so I will not dwell on that apart from pointing out that a number of years ago, the current Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, announced the Government was determined to tackle the problem of alcohol abuse through a combination of education and deterrents. There has been no change in recent years on either of those fronts. The Government is failing but I will not spend time on this area as I wish to put forward some ideas which could solve the alcohol problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1407">Deputy Ardagh complimented Deputy Hayes's speech, which was an excellent contribution on the problems of binge drinking. We must ask why binge drinking happens. There are a few different reasons for it. First, there are not enough alternatives. If people had more things to do they may not choose to go drinking. Second, people appear to do all their drinking in one or two days now whereas in the past they used to do it over four or five days. People now drink more on the days they go out for different reasons, including the price of alcohol, the cost of taxis etc. We must deal with that. There is a shot culture in which people drink several shots at the end of the night to get a buzz. We must find a way to tackle this. It is important to provide people with alternatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1408">We must decide what constitutes binge drinking. I read that most people assume binge drinking is four drinks. Another view is that seven half glasses of beer amounts to binge drinking, which is three and a half pints. My grandfather used to drink two bottles of Guinness and a whiskey every day. I do not think he was a binge drinker but according to this calculation he was 75% of the way there. He would be delighted to be called a binge drinker at 91 years of age. Let us have a real debate.</p>

            <p eId="para_1410">We are talking about abuse of alcohol, not having a few pints and a bit of fun. We must tackle the trouble on the streets but before we do so we must have an honest debate. First we must establish what we are talking about. My concerns mainly relate to the abuse of alcohol by young people or those drinking to excess at home, those who cannot handle drink, the people who cannot stop at six or seven pints but have to get into such a state that they cause trouble for themselves or others. I worked in a bar for ten years and the most trouble I encountered was from people aged over 30. I rarely had trouble with people under 20.</p>
            <p eId="para_1411">People are very concerned about trouble on the streets. It is obvious that we need more gardaí to tackle this problem. Many towns are waiting for decisions on funding for CCTV. We must consider staggering pub closing hours. I am not sure that the way forward is to tell everyone to leave pubs at 12.30 a.m. or 1 a.m. I would welcome a debate on this. I do not say I am right or wrong but we should discuss the matter. The other countries to which the Minister refers on the Continent which do not have a drink problem have staggered closing hours. Bars in those countries are open longer hours than here. People do not leave bars at the same time and end up meeting and beating each other on the streets, which happens here. Let us discuss this matter and examine if it would be worth changing closing time here.</p>
            <p eId="para_1412">A change to pub closing times might also have the benefit of doing away with the rush at closing time to drink twice as much alcohol as was consumed in the previous four hours. In the last hour people buy four or five pints and a couple of shots which they drink in half an hour to beat closing time. We must get away from that culture. If we took the pressure off and allowed people more time to drink they might drink more slowly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1413">I urge the Minister to facilitate a debate. We seek a national strategy to tackle alcohol. Let us have a proper discussion on this matter. Those who are interested can contribute and those who are not interested can stay out of the debate. Let us debate the issue and come up with solutions. I have a page of other ideas which I would like to go through. We should give it a shot and examine what we can do.</p>

            <p eId="para_1416">I welcome the opportunity to debate this motion. When we discuss alcohol we focus on problems with young people in particular. My experience of young people is that they are absolutely brilliant in their behaviour, in how they work and respond to pressure. We tend to highlight misbehaviour rather than excellent behaviour. Young people behave much better than we did in our day. This is worth stating.</p>
            <p eId="para_1417">We rightly link alcohol abuse and violence, including street violence. However there is a lack of awareness of the relationship between alcohol and another type of violence, that is, violence towards the self, which includes suicide and suicidal behaviour. Alcohol is implicated in 25% to 50% of suicides. The report of the National Parasuicide Registry shows that 42% of cases of parasuicide involved the taking of alcohol. This is more common among men than women.</p>
            <p eId="para_1418">Irish figures for general hospitals show that 30% of male and 8% of female patients were identified as having alcohol abuse or dependency problems. Post mortem studies have consistently reported that one third or more of those who die by suicide meet the criteria for an alcohol use disorder.</p>
            <p eId="para_1419">Dr. John Connolly, consultant psychiatrist and secretary of the Irish Association of Suicidology, who has written extensively on this subject, states the relationship between alcohol consumption, suicide and suicidal behaviour has been well established by robust research. There is a clear association between <i>per capita</i> consumption of alcohol and the suicide rate in any country. The higher the level of consumption of alcohol, the higher the suicide rate. Alcohol consumption levels can explain the difference in suicide rates between countries and different areas in each country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1420">Alcohol impacts on suicide rates in a number of ways. It leads to depression, which is a major factor in suicide and suicidal behaviour. In addition, depressed people frequently turn to alcohol in the mistaken belief that it will improve their mood. In many people alcohol has a biphasic effect, initially causing a feeling of well-being which is soon followed by dysphoria.</p>
            <p eId="para_1421">Traditionally, the lifetime risk of suicide associated with alcoholism was thought to be between 3% and 7% and the risk for major depressive illness approximately 15%. The co-morbidity of depression and alcohol abuse greatly increases the risk of suicide and suicidal behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_1422">A third factor that must be considered is the ability of alcohol to impair judgment and reduce inhibition, thereby increasing risk-taking behaviour. This may well result in an impulsive suicide and suicidal behaviour, most frequently in the young. Alcohol causes cognitive constriction and reduces problem-solving abilities. These are common features of suicidal persons. There is no doubt that a small number of people who have suicidal ideation take alcohol to give them the courage to complete the suicide.</p>
            <p eId="para_1423">Suicidal behaviour and alcohol abuse and misuse have many risk factors in common. In itself, alcohol misuse can result in many of the major risk factors for suicide and parasuicide, including depressive illness, family breakdown, the disruption of confiding relationships, unemployment, homelessness, loss of status, isolation, aggression and impulsive behaviour. Unfortunately, in Ireland excessive alcohol consumption has come to play an unwarranted role in all social occasions. It appears we cannot celebrate or grieve without alcohol. Heavy drinking is tolerated too easily. Alcohol is relatively cheap and readily available.</p>

            <p eId="para_1424">Fine Gael is calling on the Government to put in place a co-ordinated approach to the preparation and implementation of a national alcohol strategy. It must also provide the necessary resources and direction to the Garda to ensure that existing legislation is enforced and public order related activities are tackled in a consistent way throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1425">The clear thinking of the Fine Gael Party, together with the anxiety of 40 Fianna Fáil backbenchers, has forced the Minister to abandon the so-called café bar approach. It is already clear that we have an alcohol problem in this country which will have major effects on the health of the nation in coming years unless we come to grips with it. It is absurd to suggest that providing further access to alcohol through café bars is a solution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1426">In recent years, the closure of Garda barracks in many rural towns is such that late-night drinking and other activities outside food outlets in the early hours of the morning have become some of the major sources of anxiety in these areas, especially for the elderly. In May 2002, the strategic task force on alcohol, commissioned by the Department of Health and Children, informed us that, in the ten years to 1999, alcohol consumption <i>per capita</i> soared by 41%. It also informed us that in 2000 our alcohol consumption was second only to that of Luxembourg, at a rate of 11 litres per head compared with the EU average of 9.1.</p>
            <p eId="para_1427">The second report by the task force, issued in September 2004, stated categorically that the Government's aim should be to reduce Ireland's total <i>per capita</i> consumption to the EU average and that to do so, it should restrict any further increases in physical availability of alcohol, including by putting restrictions on the number of outlets and the time of sale.</p>
            <p eId="para_1428">Once again it is clear that the Government appoints committees to provide advice and ignores same. I am not a teetotaller and I enjoy the company of people in bars and lounges to some extent. However, if the Government is serious about its commitments, it must decrease rather than increase the number of places where alcohol is available and restrict the times at which it is available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1429">The Minister advises immigrants seeking asylum, who are under extraordinary pressure, that they are telling cock-and-bull stories but his stories about providing 2,000 extra gardaí were such. All we are doing is replacing those gardaí who are retiring on normal grounds and those who are leaving the force through frustration. If the 2,000 extra gardaí were in place and civilian personnel were used for other duties, there would be no need to close five Garda barracks in five towns in my constituency and that of the Ceann Comhairle.</p>

            <p eId="para_1430">I am glad the Government has responded so positively to this motion. Rarely has a motion been so effective. It has resulted in a complete U-turn, not really by the Minister but by the Government. The Government must take responsibility for the café bar idea as much as the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_1431">The most important issue concerns the control of outlets selling alcohol. I agree with the vintners that there are too many outlets selling alcohol in the country and that, as a result, it is difficult to control its consumption. The standard and customer service of the outlets should be improved and they should be subject to further regulation. While there are varying opinions on opening hours, I believe the issue should be revisited, regardless of whether it means closing premises earlier, as I would suggest, or extending opening hours.</p>
            <p eId="para_1432">The issue of health is not discussed enough. When I worked as a PE teacher, the school in which I taught had a module on health education every year. The abuse of alcohol was always discussed in this regard. Very little education on alcohol consumption and abuse is being provided in schools. There is an <i>ad hoc </i>approach whereby experts are invited to schools for one day to talk to pupils about the dangers of alcohol consumption, but this is not enough. Young people should be reminded of the damage that alcohol does not only to their physical health but also to their mental health, as outlined by Deputy Neville. Its effects on one’s kidneys, liver, heart and other organs are well known among medical professionals but not among the general population. People do not understand the effect alcohol has on their bodies until it is too late.</p>
            <p eId="para_1433">In the limited time available, I wish to emphasise that young people under 18, because they cannot go into bars, need some place to hang out. The concept of a coffee bar rather than a café bar should be explored. Young people under 18 should have places to go where, for instance, they might go to a centre with coffee and milk shakes and other facilities. Those facilities are not available in towns and the Minister of State should appreciate that this should be encouraged.</p>
            <p eId="para_1434">In the Fine Gael document, Ireland — a Night in the Life, which described how anti-social behaviour is hurting communities, one of the recommendations deals with hang-out spots and what they should be. We want to encourage the development of ventures such as coffee shops and restaurants which are more teenager friendly. If possible, such premises should include outdoor seating, picnic benches and so on. These premises should ideally be equipped with facilities such as pool tables, computer games etc. Such initiatives should operate to the mutual benefit of both parties, providing a viable business opportunity for one and a mature yet safe social environment for the other.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O’Malley)</from>
            <p eId="para_1435">I apologise for the inability of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, to be present. He had intended to be in the House for the entire debate. It was scheduled in his diary but, unfortunately, due to the death of his mother-in-law, Mrs. Eilis Brennan, he cannot be present and he apologises.</p>
            <p eId="para_1436">I have listened carefully to the contributions of the Opposition Members during the debate and, having done so, I agree wholeheartedly with the Minister, Deputy McDowell, when he said that while some of the contributions were good, others appeared to be posturing. What comes across all too clearly is the unsavoury spectacle of vested interests masquerading as public interest and a sad attempt to use a serious problem confronting society as an opportunity for petty political point scoring. The public will not be fooled, however, by the opportunistic posturing of the Opposition. I have not heard many original ideas from the Opposition, nor have I detected evidence of such in the combined contributions of the comprehensive approach its Members supposedly favour. Instead, we have been treated to an incoherent mixture of concerns about the health of the public and the health of the pub trade.</p>
            <p eId="para_1437">Contrary to what Opposition parties and certain public health experts have said, the proposals for reform of the licensing laws being brought forward by the Minister and the Government take account of public concerns in seeking to reduce the extent of alcohol related harm in society. The proposed Bill contains numerous safeguards intended to combat alcohol related harm. The Bill will extend the jurisdiction of the District Court to all applications for retail licences and nightclub permits and will give specified notice to all parties, including the health authorities as well as members of the public, as well as the right to object in open court to the granting of such licences or permits. The Bill proposes to streamline the system for renewing licences and to classify the right of objection of the public to such renewal. Health authorities will be specifically mentioned as having the right to object to any renewal. This health authority role was recommended by the strategic task force on alcohol.</p>
            <p eId="para_1438">As the Minister stated last evening, the Bill will strengthen existing provisions designed to combat sales of alcohol to under age persons. For example, in future an applicant's knowledge of the licensing laws may be taken into account by the court in deciding whether to grant a certificate. This is the first time this has been done and is a welcome new initiative. In addition, all off-licences will be legally required to have written policies and control procedures. Again, this is an important innovative measure. Not having these procedures and policies will be an offence in law. The Bill will create a new offence of being in possession of a forged or altered Garda age card. A fine of up to €3,000 or up to 12 months' imprisonment will apply in the event of conviction for such an offence. Penalties are being increased to improve deterrence and promote compliance with this procedure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1439">I want to say something about the simplistic notion that has been advanced by some Opposition Members that restricting the number of outlets supplying alcohol somehow restricts its availability. This is demonstrably false. In its interim report of May 2002, the strategic task force on alcohol stated that between 1989 and 1999 alcohol consumption <i>per capita</i> in Ireland had increased by 41%. This happened despite the existence of restrictions on the availability of any new licences. We might ask how this has come about. The strategic task force supplied the answer when it stated that changed drinking patterns have been influenced by enormous changes in our society, changing lifestyles and expectations, more disposable income, the lessening of parental control and a very strong focus on consumerism. I broadly agreed with the task force’s analysis.</p>

            <from>Mr. Ring</from>
            <p eId="para_1450">I listened to the Minister of State and he had not much to say. The senior Minister, Deputy McDowell, had a good deal to say about café bar licences, but we found out who likes the pints and who likes the wine. The Progressive Democrats members like the wine but they are not going to have the cafés, and the Fianna Fáil members like the pints and they are going to have the pubs. That is who won this argument.</p>
            <p eId="para_1451">I want to tell the Minister of State that this Government is over. It was decided yesterday at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting. They do not want the Progressive Democrats any more, so there is going to be a new coalition of Fine Gael and Labour. When we get into Government we will deal with this problem properly. The sooner we get in the better because the current Administration has made a mess of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1452">I listened to the Minister, Deputy McDowell, the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil and this was deregulation by the back door. They got away with it with the pharmacies but will not this time because the publicans are a powerful lobby. The Fianna Fáil Party knows about lobbies because its members hold their clinics in pubs, as I do, although I hate to say it. I wish we could hold them elsewhere, but we cannot. They know that publicans would deal with them in the next general election.</p>
            <p eId="para_1453">The backbenchers have won the battle on this one and the Government is over. Deputy Healy-Rae and the other Independent Members should be getting ready for the next six months because this Government is over. The Minister who always boasted he would not back down had to do so yesterday. When he went into the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party meeting he had to back down. I thought they were all dead for the last three years because there was not a word from them. This was the first issue on which they stood up and were counted. When the vote is taken, I hope these backbenchers will walk up the stairs with us or use their little fingers to ensure that this legislation is dead and buried forever.</p>
            <p eId="para_1454">The Minister of State who has responsibility for health was very concerned about smoking but did not show much regarding alcoholic drink. Drink is the greatest killer in Ireland and the main reason for family break up, yet we have done nothing about it. The reason is the Government's vested interest in terms of taxation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1455">No licensed premises should be open after midnight. The decision of the House three or four years ago to extend opening hours was a national disgrace for which we are paying a price in terms of anti-social behaviour throughout the country. We see people come out of licensed premises at 1 a.m., 2 a.m. and 3 a.m. when they should be in bed resting before work the next day.</p>
            <p eId="para_1456">Why can Ireland not be like America where people when invited to a party from 8 p.m. to 11 p.m., arrive at 8 p.m. and leave at 11 p.m.? In Ireland, when one is invited to a party which is to begin at 8 p.m. and finish at a specified time, it will not start until 1 a.m. and will probably not finish until 3 a. m. This is the kind of culture the Government and everybody else have promoted for the past 20 years. It is time to get serious about drink. The Government must have a proper campaign and policy on the abuse of alcohol because it is destroying families, communities and the country. It is time we woke up and realised we have a serious problem.</p>
            <p eId="para_1457">No sporting organisation should accept sponsorship from drinks companies. We should promote healthy living and sport and should not depend on Guinness, Budweiser, Bass or any such company for sponsorship. The House should legislate to provide that if sporting organisations accept this kind of sponsorship, they will not receive lottery funding from the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_1458">I hope I had a little more to say on this issue than the Minister of State. The Government must get real and tackle our serious alcohol problem. Opening more cafés and bars and providing for more licences will not resolve the problem but create further difficulties.</p>

            <p eId="para_1459">I will start where Deputy Ring left off. This was a bad week for the Government parties. The Billy the Kid, western style, cavalier approach taken by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was seen by everybody for what it was — it had nothing good, bad or different behind it. The image of the Minister of State's senior colleague having to put on shin guards before coming out of a meeting of the Fianna Fáil Parliamentary Party yesterday speaks volumes for the cohesion of the Government.</p>

            <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
            <p eId="para_1461">It was the worst ever performance by the Progressive Democrats Party. If I was the Minister of State, I would be in Limerick knocking on doors. He will soon have to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_1462">Having listened consistently to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform since he took office, he appears to have a monopoly on wisdom during every debate. He is the best man I have ever seen putting across a case, which, as a senior counsel, he is trained to do. Nevertheless, he always does so on the basis of what he thinks is right and never goes to the trouble of finding out what the stakeholders want. On this occasion, the café bar proposal appeared sexy, the kind of thing that would suit people in Dublin 4. The Minister soon found out how sexy it was when he went in among the wolves yesterday.</p>
            <p eId="para_1463">I would love to discuss the issue for much longer but only have a couple of minutes to speak. The main issue is one of enforcement. While we have no great shortage of laws, somehow we appear unable to ensure compliance with them. The Minister of State, like me, has been around for long enough to know that. In the dead of Friday and Saturday nights, not only in Dublin but in small towns and villages, the doors of discos open to let gangs out on the street. Can one expect two gardaí in a patrol car — if the town is fortunate enough to have such — to be able to control a group at 3 a.m. or 4 a.m.? Can the Minister of State imagine the effect this has on elderly people trying to sleep at that hour of the night?</p>
            <p eId="para_1464">The Progressive Democrats Party was returned to Government specifically on the basis of its proposals to ensure we got a handle on anti-social behaviour. It promised to increase Garda numbers by 2,000. I heard its leader, the Tánaiste, state this morning that Garda numbers were increasing all over the country. Garda strength has increased by a total of 47 gardaí in the three years since the Minister of State was appointed to his current position. The remainder of the additional recruits replaced gardaí who retired.</p>

            <p eId="para_1468">The public is waiting in the long grass for the Progressive Democrats this time because people know in their hearts and souls that the party has been in Government during a period when the coffers of the Exchequer were bursting with money but has chosen to look after its own golden circle and forget about elderly people and young people who need leadership.</p>
            <p eId="para_1469">Although I am one of those who genuinely believe we should have strict laws, on the other hand, I started my career as a youth officer with a youth organisation. The nation, but specifically the Government, should be ashamed of our lack of action to ensure young people have alternatives to the pub. We only scratch the surface. Foróige, the National Youth Council of Ireland and similar organisations have a wealth of ideas but our towns and cities are short of the resources to implement them. Although the Government has the resources, it chooses to deploy them in a different way, as is evident from the tribunals. When the big day comes this is one of the reasons the Minister of State will sit on the Opposition benches.</p>

          <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_617">
            <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_1470">The House has had a very good debate on the Fine Gael Party motion calling on the Government to abandon the plans of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to licence café bars. It is clear the proposal is dead and buried.</p>
            <p eId="para_1471">Fine Gael follows the views of health professionals on the connection between further alcohol outlets and more alcohol abuse. The Minister, on the other hand, followed Fianna Fáil backbench Deputies and ended up with his theoretical social engineering project shot down in flames as Fine Gael had demanded.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472">My party opposes the Government amendment which deletes two other important proposals, namely, the need for a co-ordinated approach at Government level to the preparation and implementation of a national alcohol strategy and the need to provide the Garda with the necessary resources to enforce licensing legislation and tackle public disorder.</p>
            <p eId="para_1473">While the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has had his wings well and truly clipped, I have not noticed any sorrowful tears in evidence as a consequence. He has not been gracious in defeat, having refused to accept the genuinely held views of many, not only on this side of the House, that more drink outlets leads to more alcohol consumption and that his suggestion that café bars would lead to the end of binge drinking was pie in the sky. Many outside the House, including experts in the field, shared this view.</p>
            <p eId="para_1474">Even worse, to save face the Minister tried to con the public that he was never fully behind the café bar idea and, subsequently, that he was replacing his proposal by what he described as a radical reform of the licensing regime for restaurants. This, he stated, had been his preferred way to proceed in the first place. Then we had the <i>dénouement</i> when we found out this was another cock and bull story when he was exposed as having merely put forward a minor proposal from, of all organisations, the Vintners Association of Ireland. To crown the matter, the Minister came into the House and excoriated those alleged by him to be in the pockets of vested interests, namely, the same vintners. He did not even notice the irony of his presentation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1475">The Minister should stop insulting the intelligence of the public. He tried this when he announced his phantom 2,000 extra gardaí and presented a brand new traffic corps which, on investigation, was shown to include the same number of members of the Garda today as it had when it was being rebranded. He now expects the public to believe that replacing the redundant café bar proposal with a minor proposal from the licensed vintners amounts to radical reform. It is not radical, it is ridiculous. The Minister and his Progressive Democrats are becoming progressively redundant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">Now that issue is out of the way, we should look to the future. Apart from the points well made by my colleagues about this Government having to face an election soon, serious issues remain to be addressed, such as the need for a co-ordinated alcohol strategy. One of the greatest failures of this Government is that although such a policy was produced by the rainbow Government almost ten years ago, nothing similar has been put in place. This country has suffered since, with enormous increases in consumption and associated problems. We will pay dearly for the failure to implement that strategy. The promises made on enforcement, extra gardaí and resources for them have not been fulfilled and, as a consequence, there is additional alcohol abuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">This motion is reasonable and the very least the Government can do at this stage is to accept it in full.</p>

            <p eId="para_1610">According to the Central Statistics Office, over 11,000 people died in 2002 from cardiovascular disease. It is estimated that outside the hospital system, 6,000 people will suffer cardiac arrest this year. Up to 99% of these patients will unfortunately die. At present, survival prospects are down to 1%. For every one minute delay in treating a cardiac arrest patient, there is a 10% reduction in survival chances. There is almost no chance of survival after a ten to 12 minute delay awaiting treatment. If a patient receives defibrillation, the chance of survival increases to 60%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1611">Ireland is lagging behind the developed world in the promotion of community-based defibrillators. By comparison, in mainland Europe, a cardiac arrest patient outside of the hospital system has up to a 60% chance of survival. Likewise, in the US there is a 60% survival rate. We regularly hear about tragic sudden deaths. This year it is estimated that 6,000 people will suffer from cardiac arrests, and unfortunately only 60 will survive. The Minister is aware of the chain of survival concept which consists of early access and involves recognising that a person is in cardiac arrest and calling 999 immediately, early cardiopulmonary resuscitation, early defibrillation and early advanced care.</p>
            <p eId="para_1612">It is essential that every link is as strong as possible because the chain of survival is only as strong as its weakest link. It is worth noting that the first three links take place at the location of a cardiac arrest before professional emergency medical attention is given and that often only the final link of early advanced care is administered by emergency medical technicians or in hospitals.</p>
            <p eId="para_1613">There are excellent examples of how the availability of defibrillation machines in places where people congregate has saved lives. Dublin Airport installed defibrillation units last year. Since installation, there have been four incidents where they have been used and credited with saving lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1614">Defibrillation units are installed in Croke Park, RTE in Montrose and Leinster House. Only two weeks ago, Shannon Airport installed three public access units. It should be the accepted norm that these devices are available and accessible throughout the workplace and at locations where people congregate in large numbers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1615">AEDs are similar to fire prevention systems in that they are devices which communities and companies should have, but hope not to have reason to use. Unfortunately, while companies spend hundreds of thousands of euro on elaborate fire systems, many do not spend the relatively small amount required to purchase an AED unit and train staff in its use. Many experts agree that we need to reach a stage where public access AED units are as commonplace as the familiar fire extinguisher.</p>
            <p eId="para_1616">The chain of survival is only as strong as its weakest link, and at present the weakest link is access to defibrillators. In the United States, AED units are carried on all fire engines and in every police squad car. In Ireland, on the other hand, only a handful of fire engines carry AEDs, and it will be years before every Garda car has one.</p>
            <p eId="para_1617">Communities across Ireland are willing to install these units, but need encouragement and financial support by way of grant aid to make it possible. I urge the Minister to wait no longer but to take decisive action. An AED unit placed strategically in a community ensures that the weakest link in the chain is significantly strengthened. A national programme to encourage public access is needed. The Department should initiate a funding scheme for structured voluntary and community groups which comply with established criteria. With equipment, training and accessories, the average total cost of installing such a unit is €5,000. A sliding scale of funding for groups would act as a significant incentive in promoting wider availability of AED units. Community and voluntary groups face huge obstacles such as difficulties in receiving public liability and medical indemnity insurance cover, the high costs of initial training by professionals and ongoing training and maintaining the interest and commitment of volunteers over long periods of time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1618">Making more people aware of sudden cardiac arrest and improving access to defibrillators permits an increase in the survival rate for many people. I call on the Minister to take immediate steps to establish a national AED access programme to provide financial assistance for equipment and training to the live-saving and invaluable work being undertaken by community and voluntary groups across the country. Such a scheme will give every cardiac arrest patient the best chance of survival.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. S. Power)</from>
            <p eId="para_1619">I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. I thank Deputy Lowry for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline details of the work in progress to potentially reduce the number of sudden cardiac deaths in the community.</p>
            <p eId="para_1620">I am advised that the provision of community-based cardiac defibrillators or automated external defibrillators, AED, including their placement, the ongoing training of relevant personnel and community volunteers and related issues are being examined by the recently established task force on sudden cardiac death. The task force, chaired by Dr. Brian Maurer, was established in September 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1621">In its terms of reference the task force was asked to define sudden cardiac death and describe its incidence and underlying causes in Ireland. It was also asked to advise on the detection and assessment of those at high risk of sudden cardiac death and their relatives, and to advise on the systematic assessment of those engaged in sports and exercise for risk of sudden cardiac death. The terms of reference also asked the task force to advise on maximizing access to basic life support, BLS, and automated external defibrillators and on appropriate levels of training in BLS and use of AED and on the maintenance of that training; identifying priority individuals and priority groups for such training; identifying geographic areas and functional locations of greatest need; best practice models of "first responder schemes" and "public access defibrillation" and the integration of such training services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1622">The task force is also to advise on the establishment and maintenance of surveillance systems, including a registry of sudden cardiac death and information systems to monitor risk assessment and training and equipment programmes. In addition, it is to advise and make recommendations on other priority issues relevant to sudden cardiac death in Ireland and it is to outline a plan for implementation and to advise on monitoring the implementation of recommendations made in its report.</p>
            <p eId="para_1623">I am advised that the task force has engaged in an extensive consultation process with key stakeholders, including relevant groups and bodies. As part of this process, the task force wrote to a number of organisations earlier this year seeking their views and suggestions on how the task force's objectives could be achieved. The task force also placed an advertisement in the national media on 11 February 2005 inviting submissions from interested members of the public and private, professional and voluntary organisations and other parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1624">I understand that over 80 submissions were received and that most of those who made submissions were invited to participate in a consultation day on 7 April at which these issues were discussed further. Another consultation day was held on 13 May 2005 on issues relating to the task force's fifth term of reference, which is to advise on the establishment and maintenance of surveillance systems, including a registry of sudden cardiac death and information systems to monitor risk assessment and training and equipment programmes. This involved some task force members meeting representatives of the Irish College of General Practitioners, the Central Statistics Office, the Faculty of Pathology and others.</p>
            <p eId="para_1625">I understand that the task force has received active co-operation and support from all those consulted. I am advised that the report is now being prepared and should be completed by the autumn. Its recommendations will inform future policy in this area.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_628">
            <from>Dr. Upton</from>
            <p eId="para_1626">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for providing me with this opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment. This is a case of a ten-year old girl who has been a patient in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, since she was approximately 11 months old. She has been assessed by a number of different psychologists, both clinical and educational, and by a consultant neurologist. Her parents are completely frustrated that she does not receive treatment but only a series of assessments. Their understanding was that their daughter would be given some professional treatment. However, the child was given a number of referrals which turned out to be mere assessments. The only substantive treatment offered was that her mother was given some exercises to carry out with her daughter. The child's mother was most co-operative and happy to do the exercises but felt that they were totally inadequate by themselves and in no way substituted for full professional intervention and treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1627">According to her parents, the main concern is that the child does not receive treatment. Following an assessment by an occupational therapist at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, the parents were advised that there was little chance of their daughter receiving other than an assessment because no other occupational therapist was available at the hospital. Later, they were informed that their daughter might get treatment in the community. They were also told that a referral was sent to the St. John of God services. They were unaware of this arrangement and did not receive correspondence from the St. John of God services to confirm that their daughter was on any of their waiting lists.</p>
            <p eId="para_1628">Their frustration with this toing and froing was underpinned by the fact that they were told in May 2003 that their daughter's case had been discussed by the child psychiatry department in St. James's Hospital and the head of occupation therapy in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children. Consequently, their understanding was that their daughter was third in line for occupational therapy in Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children and would be seen within months. Nothing has happened and their daughter is without any intervention apart from assessments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1629">I understand that the girl is now on another waiting list for assessment, this time with a different consultant paediatrician with a special interest in disabilities. The initial appointment is not until 1 December 2005 and this girl must wait a great deal longer for treatment. It is imperative that this child receives appropriate treatment rather than more assessments. It is not acceptable that the treatment recommended by a number of professionals is not available and that the parents of this ten year old girl are fobbed off indefinitely. For each day, week or month she is without the appropriate treatment, she is being further disadvantaged and excluded and is dropping further behind in school.</p>
            <p eId="para_1630">I ask the Minister to address this problem and put in place the facilities and systems needed. The girl has a number of learning difficulties. She needs occupational therapy as well as additional resource teaching, for example. She has not received any adequate services in her ten years and, as one can imagine, this is not acceptable for this girl's welfare and it is very frustrating for her parents. I would be grateful for the assistance of the Minister on behalf of this girl.</p>

            <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
            <p eId="para_1631">I thank Deputy Upton for raising this matter on the Adjournment. I am responding on behalf of my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney. Under the Health Act 2004, the Health Service Executive has responsibility to manage and deliver or arrange to be delivered on its behalf health and personal social services. Service at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, are provided under an arrangement with the executive.</p>
            <p eId="para_1632">In regard to the specific issue raised by the Deputy, the Department is advised that the person concerned was referred to the occupational therapy service by one of the hospital's consultant paediatricians. The patient's family was offered occupational therapy for the child on an outpatient basis in September 2004 and treatment commenced the same month.</p>
            <p eId="para_1633">Following her assessment sessions, it was recommended and agreed that the child be referred for ongoing multidisciplinary intervention in the community. She was referred to the St. John of God services in Inchicore. The referral was sent by the hospital to St. John of God services in December 2004. In May 2005, St. John of God services notified the hospital that it was not in a position to meet this request but that if the consultant wished to refer the child for full-time day services, this could be examined. It is understood the matter was due for discussion at the St. John of God admissions committee meeting on 13 June.</p>
            <p eId="para_1634">Pending the outcome of the meeting, Our Lady's Hospital will request the relevant area medical officer to investigate an alternative community-based occupational therapy service to meet the child's needs. It is the opinion of the health care professionals at the hospital that her needs would best be met in a community based multidisciplinary occupational therapy service rather than in an acute setting.</p>
            <p eId="para_1635">The Department has asked the parliamentary affairs division of the health service executive to examine the issues involved in the hospital care and community care of this patient and to provide and up date to the Deputy at the earliest possible date. I take on board what Deputy Upton has said and appreciate the urgency of the matter. It is of no benefit to the child if this matter is left hanging. Action is necessary. I will make further inquiries in the coming days and will come back to the Deputy with further information.</p>

        <heading>Dairy Sector.</heading>
        <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_630">
          <from>Mr. Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_1636">I wish to share time with Deputy Wall.</p>
          <p eId="para_1637">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue. Dairy farmers' incomes are declining rapidly as a result of falling milk prices and escalating farm costs. In 2005, dairy farmers are less well off compared with 2000 by €10,000. In 2000, the standard size dairy farmer generated the average industrial wage. However in 2005, the standard size dairy farmer generates half the industrial wage, that is, €15,000 compared with €30,000. In that period, the burden of input costs has gone up dramatically. The cost of feedstuffs has gone up by 7%, fertiliser by 9%, fuel and electricity by a massive 35%, much of which is due to a lack of Government intervention and a lack of competition in the electricity market, and veterinary expenses by a whopping 44%. If the Minister gets her way later this year in regard to prescription only medicine, they will increase significantly again.</p>
          <p eId="para_1638">The falling milk price is due to a combination of the Common Agriculture Policy reforms and lower market returns from cuts in the EU dairy market supports. Unless definitive action is taken at EU level, profitability of the Irish dairy farming sector could be heading to zero, or non-profit, by 2008 when the single farm payment is taken out of the calculation. It must be recognised that the dairy sector is a hugely important element of our economy. In 2003, the dairy sector accounted for the largest share of gross agricultural output at 30.5%. In monetary terms, this gross output at producer prices came to €1.4 billion. However, the future is bleak.</p>
          <p eId="para_1639">Existing dairy farmers face a situation where non-active dairy farmers, merely by taking their single farm payment, could end up better off than those actively farming. New entrants without a decoupled payment will find themselves in a situation where it will not be viable for them to enter the dairy sector. When the current differential between those leaving the dairy sector and those new entrants coming in is taken into consideration, there is a massive fall off in the number of active dairy farmers and it could lead in future to regional quotas not being filled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1640">It is imperative action is taken at European level to ensure there is an adequate EU budget for the dairy sector and that it is maintained at market levels which will sustain dairy farming into the future. Dairy product prices cannot be allowed to fall to intervention prices as set out by the mid-term review. We need urgent sustainable market prices to be put in place for dairy products to ensure there is an adequate return on the huge investment which many dairy farmers have put into dairy production.</p>
          <p eId="para_1641">Since January of last year, there has been an 88% cut in supports for casein and a 77% cut in supports for skimmed milk powder. Unless immediate action is taken at European level, the Commission will keep the budgets at this level and will not support these products going forward. It is important we have a price equivalent to the Irish Dairy Board of 31 cent. That is set as the baseline going forward in regard to supports for the dairy sector. The debate between the UK and the EU in regard to budget rebates should not be used to fudge this issue and reopen the negotiations on CAP. Agreement has been reached and it must be maintained and the 31 cent level must be our target going forward.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_631">
          <from>Mr. Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_1642">I thank Deputy Naughten for giving me the chance to contribute. Dairy farmers' incomes are under severe threat due to a combination of a fall in milk prices and increased costs. The fall in milk prices is due to a number of factors. The principal factor in recent times has been the massive cuts in market supports. Since January of last year, the EU Commission has used every opportunity to cut dairy market supports. Casein production has been cut by 88% and SMP export refunds have been reduced by 77%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1643">Unless there is definite political direction by the EU farm Council, the EU Commission will bring about a collapse in EU dairy product prices down to the so-called intervention prices set by the mid-term review agreement. These prices were never intended as normal market prices but were set as doomsday prices when the Commission would be forced to act. If these prices were to come about, profitability in dairying by 2007 would be virtually non-existent. The Minister, who has already raised this issue at the farm Council, must make this a priority for Ireland at EU farm Council meetings.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. B. Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_1644">I am glad to have the opportunity to debate the current situation in the dairy sector and to inform the House about the comprehensive set of initiatives taken in recent weeks to emphasise Ireland's strong opposition to the European Commission's management of the EU dairy market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1645">Both at Council of Ministers and at bilateral meetings with the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development and other Ministers, the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, has consistently challenged the progressive reductions that have been proposed by the Commission and the negative effect these proposals are having on the competitiveness of the EU dairy sector. In particular, I am concerned about the impact these reductions in aids and subsidies are having on the ability of the Irish dairy industry to export dairy products to third countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1646">At the Council of Ministers meeting of 30 May, the Minister specifically raised this matter and secured the support of a number of other member states with which we had bilaterally raised our concerns and which shared our point of view. During the discussions, the Minister very resolutely argued that decisions at the milk management committee were causing severe pressure on the ability of the sector to compete in international markets, which had been carefully built up over decades and with which the EU dairy industry and Ireland in particular had established a very successful trading partnership.</p>
          <p eId="para_1647">The Commissioner was told that the reductions in aids and subsidies represented a far too aggressive market management approach by the Commission. The Minister particularly emphasised the recent reductions in casein aid and export refunds for butter and skimmed milk powder. The Minister urged the Commissioner to ensure the delivery of greater market stability in the period ahead when the further institutional price reductions of the 2003 Luxembourg Agreement are due to be implemented. Stability in this period is absolutely essential so that the industry is capable of concluding sales contracts and setting raw material prices in a stable commercial environment as we move into the third quarter of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1648">While the Commission management of the market for dairy products is a factor in determining price signals for raw material producers, it is nonetheless important not to lose sight of the fact that milk price is determined by a number of other factors, including the international market for dairy products, the type of products being produced, their market destinations and the efficiency of production and processing. Producer prices for milk in Ireland have remained stable in recent years despite reductions in intervention prices for butter and skimmed milk powder. These reductions in institutional support prices have resulted in farmers being compensated in 2004 to an amount of €60 million or 1.2 cent per litre. Further compensation of 2.4 cent per litre, amounting to €120 million will be paid this year as part of the single farm payment introduced as a result of the Luxembourg Agreement on the reform of the CAP.</p>
          <p eId="para_1649">The key for Ireland, and the area we directly influence, is internal competitiveness. Clearly aids and subsidies at EU level are essential ingredients in our relative competitiveness on world markets and we will continue to remind the Commission of this key fact in its market management decisions. We cannot escape the fact that there are internal structural impediments in our domestic dairy sector that need to be addressed so that we remove the factors that inhibit growth and development. These matters need to be addressed in a more purposeful manner at primary and secondary level and in terms of matching product mix with emerging market and consumer demands.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Smith</from>
          <p eId="para_1652">At farm level we must look at increasing the scale of operations, reducing costs where possible, and encouraging a profitable future in the sector for the next generation of dairy farmers. While the mid-term reform of the CAP has ensured the extension of the quota regime until 2014-15, it is imperative now, more than ever, to assist those who wish to expand their operations within this new environment. The 2005 milk quota restructuring scheme as well as other changes to the milk quota regulations introduced are part of a two-year restructuring programme for the purchase and sale of quota. The purpose of the programme is to allow dairy farmers to plan ahead with greater certainty, thereby enabling the restructuring programme to operate more effectively having regard to the need for more competitive milk production.</p>
          <p eId="para_1653">At processor level too there is a need for greater rationalisation. The industry here is competing against much larger enterprises that are increasing their scale at a faster rate than we are. Dominant players have emerged in countries such as Denmark, the Netherlands and New Zealand and these are models of scale and operation that will challenge our industry as world trade liberalises even more in the next WTO agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1654">While we move forward in our internal structural reconfiguration I remain convinced that a combination of internal supports and competitive levels of export refunds are vital components of a balanced set of aids and subsidies that will maintain market share and provide the vital competitive edge to ensure that the EU can utilise its internal milk surplus. I have impressed upon the Commission, as has the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, that unless these supports are viewed in a market context rather than a budgetary one, they will be less effective in meeting their commercial objectives and will miss the current opportunities to expand EU markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1655">The Minister, Deputy Coughlan, has taken a leading role in bringing other member states who share our view on the Commission market management policies together to make a collective stance on these issues. We will continue to exert every possible pressure on the Commission to achieve a satisfactory outcome for the Irish dairy industry in terms of enhanced industry competitiveness and stable farm incomes.</p>

          <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_636">
            <from>Mr. Boyle</from>
            <p eId="para_1656">I am especially grateful for being allowed to raise this Adjournment matter at this stage and I express my gratitude to the Minister of State for his patience in waiting to respond to this issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1657">While I accept this is not a matter for which the Government has direct responsibility, the raising of this issue will give the Minister of State an opportunity to outline the Government's concern about the deterioration of a vital element of national infrastructure and to outline what measures the Government intends to put in place to make sure that in the future this country has a rail infrastructure that is fully utilised.</p>
            <p eId="para_1658">I speak as a representative of Cork South-Central with Cork being the main destination of the transference of material by freight. There are three return journeys from Dublin to Cork and, I understand, one from Dublin to Limerick and one from Dublin to Ballina each day. Each train journey carries freight equivalent to that which would require 20 articulated trucks to transport it. By removing this service Iarnród Éireann, at a stroke, will instantaneously be responsible for at least 160 extra vehicles travelling on the Cork-Dublin road and Dublin-Limerick road as far as Portlaoise and 120 vehicles entering Cork city through elements of road infrastructure such as the Jack Lynch tunnel, with the impact on the environment of increased vehicular emissions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1659">Transportation of freight by road is not even a good use of State resources in that information given to me by the Secretary General of the Department of Transport indicates that the construction of rail track, particularly on previously used lines, is about one eighth of the cost of developing motorway systems. The cost of the M50 upgrade would be equivalent to the cost of opening the western rail corridor. If that project is to mean anything, it must have full value added benefit in terms of ensuring the rail track is used to transport goods as well as people. I have yet to hear a valid reason from Iarnród Éireann for this decision. I do not believe it can be justified in terms of making engines available to transport more people around the country because freight is invariably transported at night when the rail network is not otherwise being used.</p>
            <p eId="para_1660">If we are to reach the full potential of our rail system, the Government needs to make an important strategic decision. If Iarnród Éireann as the Irish rail authority is not prepared to provide this service, the Government needs to decide whether it needs to establish another State company to do that work using the existing rail network or to undertake a tendering process whereby private companies can put in place a rail infrastructure to provide for the transport of freight.</p>
            <p eId="para_1661">Under the Government we have moved from a position where 89% of freight was transported by road to one where 92% of freight was so transported to the current figure of 96% of freight being transported by road. Environmentally, socially and economically this is the wrong road — pardon the pun — to take.</p>
            <p eId="para_1662">Following this decision by Iarnród Éireann, I hope the Government and the Minister of State representing it will use the opportunity presented to put a more sane transport policy in place that would benefit the economy, justify the existence of rail stations and ensure that trains carry not only people but goods well into the future.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Callely)</from>
            <p eId="para_1663">I thank Deputy Boyle for raising this issue. Along with the Deputy, Deputy Cooper-Flynn has concerns regarding the freight business and she is concerned about the implications this has for industry in the Border, midlands and western region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1664">Deputy Boyle mentioned the rail service in Cork where Kent Station is located. As a Minister of State at the Department of Transport, I am delighted to inform the Deputy that we have good news for him about the refurbishment and redevelopment of Kent Station into which we are happy to invest a considerable amount of money. It is a station to which I frequently travel and I recognise the need for its redevelopment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1665">The Deputy mentioned the western rail corridor and Deputy Cooper-Flynn has also raised that issue with me. I hope we will have good news for her under the rolling out of our ten year investment strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1666">It is my policy that Iarnród Éireann should remain in the rail freight business and I am aware that it has made great strides in restructuring this element of its operations. The Strategic Rail Review, commissioned by my Department and published in 2003, contained a comprehensive examination of the rail freight business and its realistic potential to support economic development and contribute to a sustainable environment. Iarnród Éireann, in responding to the challenges contained in the review, held wide-ranging consultations with business interests throughout the country, including the west, to identify those freight activities which are best suited to rail transport. The company has developed a business plan based on a strategy with regard to freight which is to break even by 2006, increase the profitability of existing profitable business, withdraw from those businesses that are heavily loss-making and target trainload traffic.</p>
            <p eId="para_1667">Approximately 50% of the overall freight deficit incurred during 2004 was as a result of the transport of small numbers of containers per rail movement. To place matters in perspective, this business accounts for less than 10% of freight revenues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1668">Iarnród Éireann remains keen to provide economically viable container transport by rail on the basis of full trainloads, point-to-point. In this context, further effort is being made to reinstate a point-to-point Ballina to Waterford trainload service, which initially promised carryings of three trainloads per week but which has not operated since August 2004 owing to lack of available traffic.</p>
            <p eId="para_1669">The company has made significant progress in growing the rail freight business in areas where it holds a competitive advantage over road haulage. I support some of the comments made by Deputy Boyle in that regard. Investment has recently been approved for a wagon modification programme and delivery of a new railhead at Milford, County Carlow, in the context of an agreement to increase beet transportation by providing growers and Irish Sugar with extra services. Volumes will more than treble from the 2005 season onwards. An extra mineral ore train per day will commence for Tara Mines at the end of the year. Coillte pulpwood traffic remains buoyant with a year-on-year increase in volumes of pulpwood by rail from the north west to Waterford. Although some market pressure is growing in respect of Iarnród Éireann's keg distribution service, the company is committed to continuing to provide this service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1670">Iarnród Éireann continues to pursue a policy of growing its rail freight business where opportunities present. I hope there are Members who may be able to assist in some of those opportunities. However, as in all businesses, the company must adjust the freight business from time to time to reflect market realities. I support the position which has been conveyed by Department officials to Iarnród Éireann.</p>
            <p eId="para_1671">Since 1999, Iarnród Éireann has invested more than €1.5 billion in rebuilding the railways, with Government and EU support for the investment programme delivering improvements in new trains, upgraded infrastructure and customer facilities. While such investment has focused on improving passenger services, the investment in improving rail infrastructure also has a direct beneficial impact on freight activities. It remains the Department's priority that any additional Exchequer subvention should focus on expanding passenger services to meet the continuing unmet demand for such services in seeking to address the adverse social and economic impacts caused by traffic congestion.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_640">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1690">I propose to take Questions Nos. 9, 19, 28, 41, 43, 47, 76, 198, 208 to 211, inclusive, and 242 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1691">My Department is responsible for the promotion and development of renewable energy including biofuels and I am committed to the development and promotion of a biofuels market in Ireland's transport fuel sector, and to the development of alternative fuels which can contribute to emissions reductions and security of supply.</p>
            <p eId="para_1692">In 2004, my Department secured an amendment to the Finance Act 1999, which provides for the introduction of a pilot scheme for mineral oil tax relief for biofuels which is designed either to produce biofuel or test the technical viability of biofuel for use as motor fuel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1693">A scheme under the Act has been agreed between my Department and the Department of Finance and received State aids clearance from the Commission in March 2005. Under the scheme, mineral oil tax relief may be granted for pilot projects producing up to 6 million litres of pure plant oil, 1 million litres of biodiesel and 1 million litres of bioethanol.</p>
            <p eId="para_1694">The scheme was publicly advertised as a competitive "call for proposals" on 20 April 2005 and the closing date for receipt of applications was 13 May 2005. A total of 34 applications were received under the call for proposals by the closing date. Applications were received under all three categories of biofuel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1695">The proposals are currently being evaluated by my Department and Sustainable Energy Ireland. It is therefore anticipated that my Department will be in a position to make recommendations to the Department of Finance shortly. The Department of Finance will then consider these recommendations and revert to my Department with a decision at which stage my Department will be in a position to communicate decisions to all applicants. The scheme is an initial measure designed to stimulate market development.</p>
            <p eId="para_1696">Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, was established under the Sustainable Energy Act 2002 to promote and assist in the sustainable production, supply and use of energy in support of Government policy. A number of SEI research, development and demonstration programmes are currently in operation across all sectors of the economy addressing these strategic objectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1697">SEI is also funding a number of biomass projects and studies through its renewable energy research development and demonstration programme. Under the programme, SEI offers capital grant aid for biofuels market demonstration projects in the pure plant oil, biodiesel and bioethanol categories. Funding of €250,000 has already been awarded by SEI to one company, which is demonstrating the feasibility of producing and selling vegetable oil locally as a transport fuel. It is intended that further grant aid will be available under the programme for biofuel demonstration projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1698">In addition to the existing demonstration project, SEI has provided grant aid to Teagasc for a study to establish testing procedures for oil quality assurance in the use of pure plant oil. The results of this study will guide the production and quality assurance of pure plant oil and will be critical to building market confidence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1699">SEI has also published a resource study on recovered vegetable oil and animal fats, which provides comprehensive information on the extent of this resource in Ireland and its availability for the purposes of biodiesel production.</p>
            <p eId="para_1700">It is anticipated that the initial fiscal and grant-aid support measures will lead to market penetration of biofuels of 0.13% within two years, and will replace over 6 million litres of imported fuels. I have had initial preliminary contact with the Minister for Finance about the possible scope for scaling up fiscal support for biofuels. Further measures to increase market penetration over a longer timeframe are also being considered in consultation with all of the relevant Government Departments. A liquid biofuels strategy study was published by Sustainable Energy Ireland in December 2004, and provides comprehensive details on the potential for the development of a biofuels market in Ireland and options to stimulate the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1701">The national climate change strategy sets out the strategies and targets for meeting Ireland's Kyoto commitments. Implementation of transport initiatives in the national climate change strategy is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Transport. My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has lead responsibility for Government policy on meeting Ireland's target under the Kyoto Protocol. I understand that work on a review of the national climate change strategy, taking account of developments since its publication at the end of 2000, is currently in progress in his Department and will be completed in the coming months.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1711">I propose to take Questions Nos. 10, 15, 48, 51, 70, 75, 172, 213 and 218 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1712">The latest available broadband figures from Eurostat relate to 2004, and are now almost six months old. They show, however, that Ireland is placed 20th of 26 countries in respect of broadband connections for all enterprises. The figure in respect of large enterprises is 79%, placing Ireland in 16th place. Eurostat also reports that 92% of all Irish enterprises have access to the Internet, which is 9th in the table, while for large enterprises the figure for Internet access is 100%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1713">The level of Internet access for households is 40%, or 11th place in the table, and about 25% of these have a broadband connection. The number of broadband customers in Ireland is increasing rapidly, and is now over 160,000, which represents an increase of more than 400% over the January 2004 figure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1714">The provision of telecommunications, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg. ComReg's register of authorised undertakings currently lists no less than 169 companies offering Internet access services in Ireland with a wide variety of service levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_1715">My Department's website, <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>, gives prices, service levels and contact details for each service provider offering a wide range of broadband products from 0.256 megabits per second to 56 megabits per second, using a range of delivery platforms such as DSL, fibre, fixed wireless, leased lines, cable and satellite. There are broadband technologies currently that can deliver broadband to any customer in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1716">The rate of broadband uptake is dependent on a combination of factors. These include access by the private sector service providers to suitable infrastructure, as well as competition between broadband service providers and demand conditions for broadband in the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1717">The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide in association with the local and regional authorities, and offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities to become self-sufficient in broadband through the county and group broadband scheme, which has already attracted 129 proposals covering over 500 communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1718">The provision of broadband to all primary and post-primary schools in the country has now begun, and will be completed by the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1719">Full details of the regional broadband programme can be found on my Department's website, <i>www.dcmnr.gov.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_1720">The Government's broadband target is to be within the top half of EU countries by the end of 2007. I have set the industry a target of 500,000 broadband customers by the end of 2006, and I am confident that this can be achieved.</p>

            <p eId="para_1723">I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 190 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1724">A migration to digital television is under way in most EU countries. Different technologies apply to the broadcasting of television services and new technologies are emerging all the time. I expect that all television broadcasting will eventually be on a digital basis. This will provide benefits to viewers, including more channels and better quality pictures and sound.</p>
            <p eId="para_1725">With regard to television broadcasting, Ireland's primary television stations are available throughout the country on a range of platforms including terrestrial, cable-MMDS and satellite platforms. New platforms, such as ADSL, may emerge in time.</p>
            <p eId="para_1726">Television stations are available on a free-to-air basis through analogue terrestrial transmission. Free-to-air digital terrestrial television is not yet available in Ireland, though provided for under the Broadcasting Act 2001. Over time, the analogue terrestrial network will have to be upgraded to a digital network. In this regard I have asked my Department to develop a digital terrestrial television pilot project this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">Digital cable-MMDS and digital satellite multi-channel services are currently available in Ireland on a subscription and pay-per-view basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">RTE and other broadcasters have been reacting to the advent of digital television on an ongoing basis. RTE and other broadcasters are making their services available across a range of platforms. In general broadcasters are seeking ways to distribute, improve and add to their services using new technical and commercial opportunities provided by digital television.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1740">I propose to take Questions Nos. 12, 16, 66, 100, 171, 174, 199, 212, 222, 223 and 240 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1741">The 13.2% target relates to all renewable energy and is not based on wind energy alone. Taking account of the mix of technologies, this would require about 1,400 MW connected. Statistics for 2003, the most recently available at this time, quantify the outputs by renewable energy technologies in the electricity market as 4.4% of total electricity generated. By technology it was approximately 2.5% from hydro facilities, 1.7% from wind powered plants and the remainder from biomass powered plants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1742">The output from wind powered plants as measured in these statistics was based on 189 MW of wind powered plant connected. However, that figure has since increased to just over 400 MW completed with a further 175 MW under construction. I am satisfied, therefore, that there will be a significant year on year increase in these statistics.</p>
            <p eId="para_1743">In the course of the work of the renewable energy development group a wide spectrum of views and opinions were expressed by various parties including the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER. The CER wrote to me and expressed the view that additional wind energy projects can be developed without special support. It did not suggest that there is no need to develop the wind energy sector at this time. In the interests of clarity and transparency, I put that letter out for consultation and several replies were received. There was no support for the CER view and I am proceeding with a new support mechanism.</p>
            <p eId="para_1744">On 7 April last I announced, in outline form, the next support programme to further increase the contribution to electricity production from renewable energy. This new programme will move away from the competitive tendering model to a fixed price scheme. Given that we are moving to this new scheme I have no proposals to offer any additional or alternative support models as part of this specific support programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1745">The target of 1,400 MWs includes large-scale hydro projects constructed by the ESB, other renewable energy plants already built or under construction, new projects which will build under the AER 5 and 6 support programmes and the additional capacity which will be supported under the new support mechanism.</p>
            <p eId="para_1746">The 1,400 MW target will therefore be delivered by a combination of biomass, hydro and wind powered technologies. Historically, the biomass category, as defined in the AER programme, could accept biofuel proposals. However, in the short term at least, biofuel proposals are more likely to be developed within the support measure I have launched for use in transport which is addressed in my reply to another question today. Wave energy is less developed as a technology and qualifies for support under the R&amp;D programme operated by Sustainable Energy Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1747">Although the competitive tendering element has been removed for the new support mechanism, a quantitative limit will continue to apply and a competitive element remains as required under section 39 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. It is necessary therefore that the detailed terms and conditions of the new support mechanism are published and accessible to all potential applicants on an equal basis. I am not in a position therefore to give any specific commitment regarding capacity allocations to any particular technology or category of technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_1748">My officials have had discussions on general points with representatives of project developers, some suppliers and financial advisers and with CER. Again, it was not possible to give any formal commitments on any detailed points to any of these parties in advance of publication of the terms and conditions. However, where it is practicable to accommodate the views of the various interests this will be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_1749">The published prices in the new support mechanism are the other item of intense interest. The prices must strike a balance between the interests of both developers and consumers. Project developers, in discussions with my Department, have accepted that the CER decision on revised connection charges will have a significant impact on the cost base of new projects. I intend to finalise proposals for consideration by Government this week.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1755">I propose to take Questions Nos. 14, 94, 206, 207 and 231 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1756">My colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, has lead responsibility for Government policy on meeting Ireland's target under the Kyoto Protocol.</p>
            <p eId="para_1757">The energy sector will make its contribution to meeting our obligations under the Kyoto Protocol through participation in the EU emissions trading scheme. The scheme entails capping CO2 emissions on a path to Kyoto compliance from participating sectors and is currently in the 2005 to 2007 pilot phase. The second phase of the scheme from 2008 to 2012 will match the Kyoto commitment period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1758">The problem of dealing with fossil fuel dependence as carbon constraints become more pressing is not unique to Ireland. At an international level, energy policy is increasingly focusing on the development of alternative renewable energy sources, increasing energy efficiency and managing energy demand in response to the need to limit CO2 emissions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1759">Insofar as our fuel use and dependence on CO2 emitting fuels is concerned, the Government continues to be committed to the maintenance of a balanced fuels policy in the interest of security of supply and intends that this balance is maintained for the future. Fuel mix is an important component in security of supply. Ireland has relatively little by way of indigenous fossil fuel resources and is dependent on imports for about 80% of fuel for electricity generation. The coming on stream of the Corrib gas field will change this dynamic but without future gas discoveries the change is not likely to be significant in the long term.</p>
            <p eId="para_1760">We are committed to increasing electricity generated from renewable sources to a minimum of 13.2% of total consumption by 2010 in line with EU requirements. I have already announced that future support for renewable energy will be on the basis of a fixed price as opposed to rounds of competitive tendering, and I expect that wind generation will remain the dominant technology in the short term for delivering this target.</p>
            <p eId="para_1761">The report of the renewable energy development group, which I intend to publish shortly, will form the basis for future policy decision on the increased penetration of renewable technologies in the electricity market. While we want to maximise the potential use of renewable energy in our fuel mix, it is necessary to recognise that in addition to technical issues there is an additional cost involved and that we need to achieve a balance between the price effect and the balance of our fuel mix.</p>
            <p eId="para_1762">I consider that a more structured approach to energy research and development has an important role to play in developing our renewable energy capability beyond wind. We are assessing responses to a consultation paper which I published recently and will take account of those responses in formulating a new approach in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1763">Energy efficiency has a significant role to play in reducing energy demand and is often described as the cheapest and cleanest method of meeting this objective. Our primary energy intensity, the ratio of primary energy consumption over GDP, has been decreasing since 1990 with the average decrease being 3% per annum. The structure of the economy, fuel choices for electricity generation and real energy efficiency gains have all played a part here. It is essential that we continue to build on this successful base by raising awareness right across the economy and bring about a step-change in the way that we use energy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1764">Biofuels are an alternative renewable fuel source for the transport sector and Sustainable Energy Ireland is funding a number of biomass projects and studies through its renewable energy research, development and demonstration programme. We are currently assessing applications in our recent call for proposals under the biofuels mineral oil tax relief scheme and expect to be in a position to make recommendation to the Minister for Finance shortly. Ireland is starting from a very low production base and this scheme is an initial measure designed to stimulate market development. Further measures to increase market penetration over a longer timeframe are currently being considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_1765">Our fuel mix for the future will also be influenced by the development of a single electricity market on an all-island basis and also by the Government's decision to approve the development of an east-west electricity interconnector with Wales. Increasing the critical mass of the electricity market and developing interconnection north-south and east-west are critical developments to take advantage of the scale of an all-island system as well as access to the UK market through a new interconnector. This project is being pursued by the Commission for Energy Regulation and will, in all likelihood, result in a 500 MW interconnector between ourselves and the UK. This will give us access to electricity from the UK and also improve our capacity to increase the level of renewable energy on our own system.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_645">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1777">I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 18, 68, 71, 81, 113, 192, 194, 195, 196 and 197 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1778">There will continue to be a key national role for An Post, both in delivery of mail and as a quality service provider through its nationwide network of post office outlets. The market for traditional postal and post office services is changing globally and meeting customer needs has become more important than ever.</p>
            <p eId="para_1779">In order to remain competitive, An Post needs to make the best possible use of its long established and trusted brand name and deploy its resources in a manner which continues to serve existing customers' needs and attracts additional customers for a range of new services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1780">There is agreement that change is required if the postal services of An Post are to adapt to the modern business environment and to continue to offer a top class nationwide delivery service to the customer into the future. To progress the change agenda, an exhaustive process of negotiation between An Post management and An Post trades unions, with the assistance of the State's industrial relations machinery, has been ongoing for some time. To keep up the momentum of the process and in an effort to resolve all remaining difficulties on collection and delivery arrangements, the outstanding issues are currently being dealt with in the Labour Court with a view to agreeing a way forward that will see the company placed on a secure financial footing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1781">With regard to the post office network, this Government and the board of An Post are committed to the objective of securing a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network through a strategy of maximising the volume of both public and private sector business handled by the network. This is set out in the programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1782">The challenge for the company is to develop a strategy that satisfies the needs of existing customers, while attracting new customers into the post office. An Post has already had some success in winning new business and continues to benefit from a considerable amount of Government business, especially in the areas of social welfare payments and savings products.</p>
            <p eId="para_1783">To ensure that our post offices remain competitive and attractive to customers, future strategy must satisfactorily balance the social benefits of a nationwide post office network and the ongoing electronic technology issues that now face the future of the network. With this in mind, An Post has started working on a new business model for the network, which will involve a substantial upgrade of IT systems in order to offer EFT functionality to social welfare recipients and a wider suite of financial and other services to new and existing customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1784">The Deputies will also be aware that An Post has just launched a process seeking proposals from financial institutions with a view to developing and expanding the range of financial services available through An Post. This development presents an important opportunity for the counters service to grow, win new lines of business and acquire the technology and other resources necessary to face the challenges of the future. The company has recruited advisors to assist with the process and hopes to move it to a conclusion by the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1785">On the issue of upgrading of post offices, the automation of the network was completed in 1997 and it had only been in very exceptional circumstances, such as an existing automated office closing and its equipment being transferred to a suitable neighbouring location which transacts significant volumes of welfare business, that further offices were automated since then. However, I am convinced that An Post's long-term strategy must satisfactorily address electronic technology issues in a comprehensive fashion. I have asked the management to develop such a strategy and in the interim, a pilot project will see ten small post offices computerised. In a separate initiative, the company, in conjunction with the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, is working on an initiative to automate nine island post offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1786">With regard to post office closures, it is only when a suitable candidate for a vacancy cannot be found or where there are no applicants that a post office is closed.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1788">The proposals to which the Deputy refers relate to the establishment of a Community Fisheries Control Agency. At the EU Fisheries Council in March 2005, final agreement was reached to establish this agency. This agency is the logical progression of the common fisheries policy as it has developed since the early 1980s.</p>
            <p eId="para_1789">All available scientific information indicates the necessity to support the sustainability of certain fish stocks through conservation and control measures. The emergence of recovery plans for key, high-value fish stocks such as cod has pointed to the need for transparent multinational co-operation in fisheries control activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1790">I would like to outline, for the Deputy's information, some of the key functions of the new agency. The main function will be to organise operational co-ordination of fisheries control and inspection activities by member states. It is envisaged that this will be achieved through the development and application of joint deployment plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_1791">Under these plans, the control resources of a number of different member states may be assigned to control certain fisheries and this may include the use of multinational teams of inspectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1792">The best use of Community control resources in such a co-ordinated way will yield greater transparency and will help to ensure that threatened fish stocks will be protected and will recover. It is very important that our fishermen have every confidence that conservation and control is being applied evenly and effectively on all European fleets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1793">Ireland is fully supportive of the establishment of this agency. We believe it provides an improved capacity to conserve valuable fish stocks for the benefit of all fishermen. Following the Council's agreement, detailed work is now under way to make the agency an operational reality as soon as possible.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1809">I propose to take Questions Nos. 21, 22, 27, 65, 72, 82, 89, 109, 173, 176, 181 to 184, inclusive, and 220 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1810">I have no function in regulating pricing for phone services, market access or market share.</p>
            <p eId="para_1811">The regulation of telecommunications operators, including pricing for mobile services and market access, is the responsibility of the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, in accordance with the requirements of the Communications Regulation Act 2002 and regulations made under the EU Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications.</p>
            <p eId="para_1812">As Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I have responsibility for overall telecoms policy. My main goal in this policy is to create conditions for sustainable growth and competition that will benefit the economic and social development of Ireland and facilitate competitive services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1813">It is my belief that improving the market conditions to enhance competition is the best way to drive down mobile phone charges to the end user. The more competitive telecoms services that are on offer, the better in the long run for consumers, the sector and the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1814">In March 2004 my predecessor issued policy directions to ComReg, including a direction on competition. The direction on competition mandates ComReg to focus on competition as a key objective, with a particular focus on competition in the fixed and mobile markets and to implement, where necessary, remedies which counteract or remove barriers to entry and support entry by new players to the market and entry into new sectors by existing players; and to have particular regard to the following also: market share of new entrants; ensuring that the applicable margin attributable to a product at the wholesale level is sufficient to promote and sustain competition; price level to the end user; and the potential of alternative technology delivery platforms to support competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_1815">ComReg has, as one of its key objectives under the Communications Regulation Act 2002, the promotion of competition in the exercise of its functions. Competition in the fixed and mobile markets will drive down prices for consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1816">I have no information to say that Irish mobile charges are generally the highest in Europe. However, ComReg's quarterly key data for the Irish communications market for Q4 2004 indicates that the Irish mobile operators' average revenue per user is the second highest in Europe; Switzerland has the highest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1817">The Deputy will be aware that in February 2005 ComReg designated Vodafone and O2 as having joint dominance in the wholesale mobile access and Call Origination market. Following on from this, in March of this year, ComReg placed an obligation on Vodafone and O2, requiring them to provide access to other companies on their networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1818">Vodafone, O2 and Meteor have notified me that they wish to appeal to an appeal panel, ComReg's finding of joint dominance and the resulting obligations imposed by ComReg on Vodafone and O2 to give other operators access to their networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1819">The number of broadband customers in Ireland is increasing rapidly and is now over 160,000, which represents an increase of more than 400% since January 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1820">The rate of broadband uptake is dependent on a combination of factors. These include access by the private sector service providers to suitable infrastructure, as well as competition between broadband service providers and demand conditions for broadband in the economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1821">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg. ComReg currently lists no less than 169 companies offering Internet access services in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1822">The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide in association with the local and regional authorities, and offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities to become self-sufficient in broadband through the county and group broadband scheme, which has already attracted applications from over 150 communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1823">The provision of broadband to all primary and post primary schools in the country has now begun, and will be completed by the end of this year.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1825">No final decision has been made on the question of acquisition of an emergency towing vessel, ETV, capacity for Ireland. The matter is still under consideration in the Department which is examining options on how the service could be delivered in the context of both the very significant costs projections and complex operational requirements associated with the provision of ETV capability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1826">In 1998 the then Department of the Marine and Natural Resources commissioned a study to investigate the feasibility of deploying ETVs around the coast. Following an assessment of the study, which was published in 1999, it was decided that Ireland should have access to ETV capacity and that the Department would consult with the Departments of Finance, Defence and the Environment and Local Government on such matters as cost effectiveness, location, financing, operational aspects and possible other uses. It was also decided that Ireland and the UK would consult on the possible sharing of an ETV to cover the east coast.</p>
            <p eId="para_1827">The Department set up an internal working group to manage and progress this consultation process. The working group concluded that ETV capacity should be provided to service the west coast and, separately, to service the east coast. They also recognised that the provision of the service would be very costly. In both cases a public private partnership process was recommended.</p>
            <p eId="para_1828">In the east coast case it was further recommended that a joint Ireland-UK approach might be adopted. I am conscious of the importance of bringing this matter to a satisfactory solution in the overall context of maritime safety and coastal protection. However, in examining how the ETV proposals outlined can be pursued the Department must have regard to the very significant costs involved as well as the cost benefits associated with such a facility.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1830">I am aware of the report on an electricity supply strategy for the UK published last month and referred to by the Deputy in his question. The report emphasises the importance of investment in energy research and development, suggests that large-scale non-carbon electricity generation will be needed to meet the UK's ambitious CO2 targets and urges a review of the existing regulatory structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1831">The themes of the report are certainly interesting, but in considering the potential ramifications for energy policy here, it is important to put things in perspective. There are critical differences in size, market structure and development, and fuel mix between the electricity sector in the UK and ours, so recommendations and solutions that might be appropriate for the UK's market would not automatically be appropriate here.</p>
            <p eId="para_1832">There is an increasing focus internationally on developing non-carbon energy sources as a response to climate change. In order to meet that challenge there will need to be technology development in carbon sequestration, the development of new renewable energy sources and a step change in energy efficiency and demand management.</p>
            <p eId="para_1833">One parallel we would have with the recommendations in the report relates to energy research and development. There is a need to focus on innovation by better co-ordinating and supporting research, demonstration and development and ensuring it is aligned with policy goals of energy efficiency, development of renewable energy sources and lowering of carbon emissions. We have already issued a consultation paper on the future structure of energy R &amp; D and are assessing the responses that will inform the development of a new energy R &amp; D strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1834">I have launched a major consultancy study into the Irish electricity market and, in addition, I and my Department have commenced to look afresh at all aspects of energy policy with a view to publishing a policy document at the beginning of 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_1868">While the decision as to whether or not a channel will seek a licence to broadcast from within the Irish State or from outside the State is a matter for the channel concerned, a number of considerations must be borne in mind.</p>
            <p eId="para_1869">Under Article 2 of the television without frontiers directive a channel is deemed to be under the jurisdiction of the State in which it is established. In that regard the directive sets out criteria which must be applied when deciding on jurisdiction which relate to the transmission frequencies used, the location of the head office, where the editorial decisions are taken and the location of the workforce. Thus if Channel 6 locates its head office in Ireland and editorial decisions are made in Ireland then under the television without frontiers directive that channel falls under Irish jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1870">A further consideration under Recital 14 of the television without frontiers directive relates to the right of Ireland to take measures against a television broadcaster that is established in another member state but directs all or most of its activity to Ireland if the choice of establishment was made with a view to evading the legislation that would have applied to the broadcaster had it been established in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1871">Under the Independent Radio and Television Act 1988 and the Broadcasting Act 2001, an application from Channel 6 seeking a television broadcasting contract in Ireland would be a matter entirely for the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1875">I propose to take Questions Nos. 29, 42 and 110 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1876">The Deputies should be aware that Ireland is the only country in the EU which does not currently have a national postcode system.</p>
            <p eId="para_1877">The Commission for Communications Regulation, whose remit includes postal issues, produced a report which followed a consultative process held in November 2003. The report is broadly favourable to the introduction of a postcode system and is a useful contribution to the debate on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1878">I am favourably disposed towards the introduction of postcodes because of the case made that a national postcode system would offer significant potential benefits for the postal business, public utilities including the emergency services, business and consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1879">To this end I established a working group comprised of people with experience of the postal sector, together with a representative from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which is the lead department for the Irish spatial data infrastructure initiative to examine the issue of the introduction of a postcode system in Ireland. This group produced its report earlier this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1880">The report found that the introduction of a publicly available postcode could deliver many potential benefits. The purpose of a postcode system would be to improve efficiencies and quality in the postal sector, stimulate mail volume growth, assist utilities and emergency services to address the problem of non-unique addressing and facilitate competition by making it easier for new postal operators to enter the market. These improvements collectively will boost the country's competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1881">Following from the recommendations of the working group report, consideration of the feasibility, design and implementation of a practical postcode project proposal will be advanced including establishing the cost of implementing such a postcode and how that cost should be met. In accordance with the recommendation of the working group that project managers be appointed to lead the postcode project, I have asked the Commission for Communications Regulation to appoint the project managers. A national postcode project board, comprising representatives of Departments, together with public and private sector organisations, will be appointed by the Minister to assist the project managers with their work and to present a proposal describing in sufficient detail a model that is the most efficient, effective and publicly usable postcode system by 31 December 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1882">The precise nature and format of any proposed postcode system has yet to be decided but I understand it is possible to allocate a code to every delivery point in a town land in a methodical way so that every person who is aware of the coding convention can identify where a specific delivery point is situated in relation to another delivery point or to a reference point. This enables the retention of the current address both in English and Irish irrespective of spelling. A postcode also overcomes the data protection-privacy issues that arise when a person's name and address is stored on a database in order to identify a specific delivery point. In its deliberations, the project board will take these matters into consideration when arriving at its recommendations for a postcode system.</p>

            <p eId="para_1885">This study will enable me to determine the approach to be adopted in providing the station house and I have asked the Department to ensure that this work is undertaken as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1886">I would also like to take this opportunity to inform the House that, with the objective of strengthening the coastal units around the coast, I have decided to carry out a comprehensive review of the Coastguard volunteer service. A steering group is now in place in the Department, which includes representation from the volunteers, and they are finalising proposals for the issue of an invitation to independent consultants to tender for the review work. The consultants will be required to complete their work and report before the end of this year.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
            <p eId="para_1888">The Deputy's question refers to new EU quota rules as being the basis for recent protests by scallop fishermen. There are, however, no quotas on scallops, in contrast to other key whitefish species. The issue on scallops concerns the management of fishing effort, the framework for which was agreed at EU level in 2003 with the support of the Irish fishing industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_1889">The need to establish a better balance between fleet size and available fishing entitlements is not confined to the scallops' fleet. The difficulties in the whitefish fleet are in fact of longer standing and accordingly there is a particular concentration on that fleet where quotas have been severely cut in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1890">For that reason, I introduced a decommissioning scheme for whitefish vessels in April. When I met the scallop fishermen in early June, I explained this policy context and the necessity to concentrate the available funding of €8.8 million on the whitefish sector. The whitefish sector has indicated its view that substantial additional funding will, however, be required for that fleet alone.</p>
            <p eId="para_1891">While the problems in the whitefish sector are of longer standing, I accept that issues exist also in the shellfish sector, including scallops. It has therefore been decided to undertake an immediate and urgent review of the decommissioning requirement for the various demersal and shellfish fleets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1892">This review is to be completed by end June and will give an important overall perspective. It will examine the various issues involved including eligibility for decommissioning aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_1893">I cannot pre-empt the outcome of this review. It is a planned and structured approach and I look forward to receiving the report.</p>

            <p eId="para_1920">My core policy objectives for the development of the broadcasting sector are detailed in my Department's Statement of Strategy, 2003-2005. These objectives are: to create an environment that encourages the maintenance of high quality Irish radio and television services by both independent broadcasters and RTE; to secure a viable future for high quality public service broadcasting; and to seek to retain access to a range of high quality programming in analogue and digital form on a universal and free-to-air basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1921">My key priorities for achieving these objectives include the following: developing the regulatory framework by bringing forward a Bill to provide for the establishment of a single content regulator for both public and private broadcasters and to establish RTE on the lines of a company under the Companies Acts; taking steps to establish TG4 as an independent entity; ensuring adequate public funding for RTE and TG4 so that they can deliver on their statutory mandate; building on progress made in maximising the effectiveness of television licence fee collection; developing proposals to ensure that in a digital era Irish viewers continue to enjoy access to a range of high quality programming; and bringing forward proposals for the future licensing of radio services in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1922">I am of the opinion that Irish viewers will be best served by a broadcasting environment that includes a strong public service broadcasting presence in the form of RTE and an independent TG4, together with private broadcasters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1923">In time all broadcasting platforms will move to a digital basis. Digital television services are available in Ireland through a number of cable and satellite networks. Digital television offers opportunities for Irish viewers to avail of an increased number of broadcasting services, including new services of particular relevance or interest to Irish audiences.</p>
            <p eId="para_1924">Ireland's terrestrial network is currently an analogue network. I expect that the terrestrial network will be updated to digital in time, and in this context I am currently developing a digital terrestrial television pilot.</p>

         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources</b>
        his reaction to the recent announcement in An Post’s 2004 annual report that the company recorded a pre-tax profit of €7 million for 2004; his views on whether the company is justified in seeking up to 1,500 redundancies in view of such profits; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1935">The financial outturn in 2004 for An Post resulted in operating profits of €1.8 million and an overall profit for the financial year of €6.5 million. This is attributable in large part to a policy of controlled financial management, in line with the recovery strategy that the company implemented throughout 2004 and the non-payment of Sustaining Progress awards and the company's policy of not filling vacancies restricted growth in labour costs in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_1936">The small profit in 2004 reverses the loss-making situation for the years 2001 to 2003 inclusive and represents a significant turnaround from the operational losses of €42.9 million experienced by the company in 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_1937">Deputies should note that, while this return to profit is a welcome development, there is no room for complacency and 2004 was a challenging year for all involved in An Post — the board, the management and the employees — and difficult cost cutting decisions had to be made. To attempt to build a brighter future for the company, negotiations under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission continued throughout the year and although progress has been slow, I believe that with the continued co-operation of all parties, an agreement can be reached that will set the company on a firm financial footing for the future. The importance of the current negotiations coming to a successful conclusion cannot be stressed enough.</p>
            <p eId="para_1938">Changes in the collection and delivery operations area are critical to addressing the company's precarious financial circumstances. In this regard, An Post is seeking approximately 1,350 voluntary redundancies in collection and delivery together with changes in existing work practices. In particular, there is a need to cut existing overtime levels. The changes will increase operational flexibility and significantly reduce the company's existing cost base. Such changes will enable the company to provide a cost effective mails service and a quality of service standard which meets customer expectations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1939">The financial results in 2004 have provided a foundation on which the company can build. An Post has a statutory mandate to be financially viable and this needs to be reflected in the planning and actions of the company moving forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_1944">With the repeal of section 111 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 on 25 July 2003, it is no longer necessary to obtain a licence before providing telecommunications networks and services, including broadband.

            <p eId="para_1949">Work is continuing on the development of legislative proposals that will form the basis of a new broadcasting Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_1950">The priority issues to be addressed by the legislative proposals are: the establishment of a single content regulator for commercial, community and public service broadcasters; the establishment of RTE as a company under the Companies Acts 1963 to 2003; the provision of a statutory mechanism for future adjustments to the level of the television licence fee; and the development of the right of reply mechanism, allowing persons whose reputation and good name have been damaged by an assertion of incorrect facts in a television or radio programme to gain redress.</p>
            <p eId="para_1951">It is intended that the proposed single content regulator will combine the existing regulatory functions of the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland and the RTE authority, as recommended by the Forum on Broadcasting, and as such will play an important role in the regulation of RTE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1952">I note that in its submission to the Forum on Broadcasting in 2002, RTE accepted the need for independent monitoring of public service broadcasting and welcomed in principle the establishment of a broadcasting authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1953">I understand that the concerns recently expressed by the Director General of RTE centre on the recognition by any new regulator of the specific public service remit of RTE.</p>
            <p eId="para_1954">My intention in framing the legislative proposals will be to ensure that the broadcasting regulatory environment recognises this remit and continues to encourage the parallel development of high quality broadcasting by Irish public service, commercial and community broadcasters.</p>

            <p eId="para_1956">The decision to transfer the services of the Marine Rescue Co-ordination Centre from Dublin was taken on foot of a study of the Coastguard undertaken by independent consultants. Reflecting advances in modern communications technologies, the consultants recommended that the Coastguard should operate two control centres as opposed to the three centres that exist at present. Communications technology today is such that the geographical location of the co-ordination centres is less important now than in the past. This approach will have the effect of achieving significant cost savings, thus enabling other elements of the Coastguard service to be developed, which in turn will lead to further improvements in our marine emergency response services nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_1957">The objective is that the remaining two centres will be developed to handle all emergencies around our coast, including the Dublin and east coast area, on inland waters and in relation to mountain, cliff and cave rescue.</p>
            <p eId="para_1958">I would like to emphasise that the capability of the Coastguard to co-ordinate and manage incidents will not be diminished as a result of relocation away from Dublin and I would also like to stress that the decision will not affect the emergency response resources that are available to the Dublin region and the east coast on the ground.</p>

            <p eId="para_1961">I propose to take Questions Nos. 49 and 225 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1962">Since my appointment as Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, I have made it one of my priorities to continue the efforts of my predecessors in securing the development of the all-island energy market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1963">On 22 November 2004, in conjunction with my then Northern counterpart, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Mr. Barry Gardiner MP, I published the framework for the all-island energy market. This document is basically a blueprint for the development of the market and sets out the principles in accordance with which the market is to be developed. Most importantly, it also sets out a detailed list of priority objectives to be achieved if an effective all-island market is to be established and identifies time-scales within which this needs to be done.</p>
            <p eId="para_1964">Since the publication of the framework document, both regulators, North and South, have been engaged in developing the high-level principles governing the creation of a single electricity market, SEM. This has involved widespread consultation with industry and other relevant bodies and a final decision on this matter was issued by the regulators last Friday. The regulators are now continuing their work in developing the precise detail for the operation of the SEM by July 2007, the date set out in the framework document.</p>
            <p eId="para_1965">At the same time, officials from my Department, with their colleagues in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Investment, have been examining what needs to be done in order to put in place the necessary legal framework that is required to underpin the SEM.</p>
            <p eId="para_1966">I can confirm that I met the new Northern Ireland Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Investment, Ms Angela Smith, at the Energy Ireland Conference in Dublin on Monday of this week and have arranged to meet Minister Smith again later this month on 21 June in Limavady, where we will be meeting with members of the joint steering group that is driving this process forward. This group comprises representatives of the two regulatory authorities as well as officials of both Departments, North and South, and the meeting will provide an opportunity for both Ministers to receive a detailed progress report on the work to date. I expect that Minister Smith and I will issue a joint statement at that time reconfirming our commitment to the process and identifying new initiatives to be taken within the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1967">The question of the operation of the existing North-South interconnector is a matter for the two network operators, North and South, and is not one in which I have a function. I understand that the interconnector is suffering from knock-on-effects from a transformer failure; there are no problems with the interconnector itself. I expect that the agencies concerned will rectify problems as soon as technically feasible.</p>

            <p eId="para_1971">The Government's ports policy statement, which I launched in January 2005, states that the continued operation of many of the regional harbours under the outdated provisions of the Harbours Act 1946 is unsustainable on the grounds of good governance. The policy statement reiterated the view that most of these harbours would best achieve their potential through their transfer to local authority ownership or, where this is not possible, through sale to the private sector. In harbours where significant commercial traffic exists consideration will be given to bringing them under the control of a port company.</p>
            <p eId="para_1972">The Department is working with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to advance the implementation of the ports policy statement with regard to the transfer of regional harbours to local authority control. It is intended to arrange for the transfer of the designated regional harbours to their respective local authorities, where appropriate, and to proceed individually in conjunction with the relevant local authorities and harbour authorities, having regard to local requirements in each case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1973">On 17 May 2005, I met with the chairman and other members of Sligo Harbour Commissioners. At this meeting the position in accordance with the ports policy statement was outlined and it was explained that in the case of Sligo Harbour the Department's proposal is that it be transferred to Sligo County Council. It was explained that an order to be made under section 88 of the Harbours Act 1996 would be required to give effect to the transfer. Section 88 provides that I may, with the consent of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, by order transfer all the property, rights and liabilities of scheduled harbour authorities and every member of their staff to the relevant local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1974">On 1 June 2005, Sligo Harbour Commissioners sent a letter to the Department in which they request me to establish, by order under section 87 of the Harbours Act 1996, a port company in respect of Sligo Harbour. A substantive reply to the commissioners is currently in preparation by the Department. However, the position remains as set out above.</p>

With the changing market environment in which these bodies now operate and the consequent competitive, regulatory and governance demands, chairpersons have found their roles to be increasingly challenging and time-consuming. It is also the case that attracting suitably talented individuals with wide experience in the private sector could become difficult if competitive remuneration were not put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_1979">In these circumstances my Department made a case to the Department of Finance that the chairpersons of a number of the commercial State-sponsored bodies under the aegis of my Department should be compensated for extra attendances. The Department of Finance was not prepared to agree to this request in all cases except one on the basis that it was not accepted that circumstances had changed since the standard fees were last increased in 2001 such as to justify an increase.</p>

            <p eId="para_1989">The digital hub project, managed by the independent Digital Hub Development Agency, has been and continues to be successful in attracting digital industry tenants and operates a number of significant community, educational and promotional initiatives as part of its role. Government funding of approximately €52.4 million has been used to purchase properties for development in the site. A further amount of €2.2 million has been spent in building a state-of-the-art broadband ring around the hub area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1990">In addition, current funding for the agency to an amount of €8.2 million for the years 2001, 2002 and 2003 was provided. Since then the digital hub has used an overdraft facility, which currently stands at €2.5 million, to meet its costs until its long-term development process is in place. I am currently exploring options with the agency to deliver the property development project in a timely manner. When completed the project will deliver 500,000 sq. ft. of enterprise, learning and educational, residential and retail space. A steering committee with membership from the various stakeholders including the Office of Public Works has now been set up under the chairmanship of this Department to drive the process forward. While the larger hub site is being developed, the agency is space constrained, given the high number of tenants. Parts of the former Media Lab Europe, MLE, building are now being utilised by the hub on a temporary basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_1994">In March 2004, my predecessor issued a number of policy directions to the Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, relating to competition, broadband, wholesale and retail line rental, interconnection-leased lines and national and cross-border roaming. The number of broadband customers is increasing rapidly, and has now passed 160,000, an increase of over 400% in just over a year. ComReg lists 169 service providers offering Internet access in Ireland, and I am satisfied that this indicates a healthy growth in the broadband market here. The rate of broadband uptake is dependent on a combination of factors. These include access by the private sector service providers to suitable infrastructure, as well as competition between broadband service providers and demand conditions for broadband in the economy. The Government is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access metropolitan area networks, MANs, in 120 towns and cities nationwide in association with the local and regional authorities, and offers funding assistance for smaller towns and rural communities to become self-sufficient in broadband through the county and group broadband scheme, which has already attracted 129 proposals covering over 500 communities. The provision of broadband to all primary and post-primary schools in the country is now under way and will be completed by the end of this year. Full details of the regional broadband programme can be found on my Department's website, <i>www.dcmnr.gov.ie</i>.</p>

            <p eId="para_2000">The Deputy will be aware that the developers' plan of development for the Corrib gas field approved by the then Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Frank Fahey, in April 2002 was in relation to an onshore terminal and this is what was covered by the statutory approval granted. I would like to inform the Deputy that a decision on the company's application to install and commission the onshore pipeline is at an advanced stage but is not yet finalised. Both the quantified risk assessment, QRA, and the Johnston report, to which I have referred previously, will form part of this process. In so far as there may be issues in the QRA that need further clarification, elaboration or even additional material, Mr. Andrew Johnston, assisted by other independent consultants, will be providing the necessary advice to my Department. A tender competition was initiated for the selection of a consultant to carry out a review of the QRA. The company, which was successful following this tendering process, was the British Pipeline Agency, BPA. When I became aware that the company selected by means of a tendering process to undertake the QRA review is owned jointly by BP Oil UK Ltd. and Shell UK Oil Ltd., in the interest of ensuring confidence in the independence of the process of evaluation of the safety aspects of the pipeline as addressed by the QRA version F and considering the public concerns and sensitivities on this issue, I instructed officials of my Department to initiate a further review of the QRA immediately. A consultant has been appointed to carry out the recommissioned review of the QRA and I expect to receive his report shortly. I have already put the QRA version F into the public domain in north Mayo and it has also been published on the Department's website. I intend to do the same in relation to the recommissioned QRA review. It is my intention to progress consideration of the application for consent to install the upstream pipeline in an open, balanced and informed manner and to the highest international standards. My decision to publish the full suite of documents mentioned above, prior to my making a decision, will hopefully allay local fears in regard to the safety of the pipeline and the process being adopted.</p>

            <p eId="para_2010">The Department's policy is to engage consultants only in the following circumstances: where specialised knowledge or expertise, which is not available in the Department or elsewhere in the civil or public service, is required for a temporary period; where a need for objectivity and-or independence is deemed essential; where a consultancy study is required by an external body, for example, the European Union; where a specialist study-project must be completed within a very short time scale; and where the specialised knowledge or expertise may be available within the Department but performing the task "in-house" would involve a prohibitive opportunity cost and-or would be impractical, for example, if staff engaged on other essential duties would have to be diverted.</p>
            <p eId="para_2011">The Department is particularly mindful of the value for money imperative and the need to deploy and develop in-house skills and services as far as possible in order to minimise the requirement for consultancies.

            <p eId="para_2017">I am aware of the survey in question and I very much welcome the new mobility in the electricity market.</p>
            <p eId="para_2018">Liberalisation of the electricity market has proceeded on a phased basis since February 2000 under the regulatory oversight of the Commission for Energy Regulation, the independent regulator for gas and electricity, in accordance with the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. On 19 February this year the market opened fully to competition. This is over two years in advance of the July 2007 deadline set down in Electricity Directive 2003/54/EC.</p>
            <p eId="para_2019">All customers are now eligible to source their electricity from any licensed supplier and the entire market becomes contestable. Scope now exists for all customers, household and non-household alike, to seek out keener prices in the competitive market. The switching between independent suppliers shows that business customers are price and quality sensitive and having a choice of supplier is allowing them to make the decision on what best meets their needs. I welcome the fact that companies are exercising their right to choose their optimum supplier as an indication that the liberalisation of the market is working.</p>
            <p eId="para_2020">My objective is to have in place policies and a regulatory environment, which will deliver a competitive energy and electricity market leading to the lowest sustainable prices. That said, locational disadvantages and some settled policies, such as the burning of peat and the support for renewable energy, place upward pressure on price. I expect that the major consultancy into electricity which commenced recently and the recent publication by both regulators of the single electricity market proposals will assist us in policy evolution towards a more competitive market.</p>

            <p eId="para_2044">I am favourably disposed towards the introduction of postcodes because of the case made that a national postcode system would offer significant potential benefits for the postal business, for public utilities, for businesses in general and for consumers, and facilitate the provision of a wider range of services to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2045">On the issue of junk mail, I would like to point out that An Post is statutorily obliged under section 12 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 to satisfy all reasonable demands for postal services throughout the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2046">The public receives a wide variety of mail from a number of sources, some of which could be regarded as unsolicited mail, including unaddressed mail material, which may also be delivered by operators other than An Post. An Post itself provides two services called Postaim and Publicity Post Material which allow businesses to address correspondence about their products and services directly to individuals or alternatively to have unaddressed publicity brochures delivered to houses in a particular area. Furthermore, one person's junk mail can be another person's great bargain or vital piece of information that they need.</p>
            <p eId="para_2047">Measures are already in place to manage the impact of direct mailing. Under section 2(7) of the Data Protection Acts 1988 and 2003, individuals have the right to request that they be removed from any direct mailing lists used by businesses. Householders also have the option of limiting the amount of unsolicited mail they receive by completing a mailing preference service form requesting that their names be removed from mailing lists controlled by members of the Irish Direct Marketing Association. The form, available from post offices, goes directly to the Irish Direct Marketing Association and only applies to addressed mail sent by their members. It has no bearing on mail from any other source or unaddressed mail.</p>
            <p eId="para_2048">I have no intention at this stage to introduce additional measures in respect of direct mailing.</p>

            <p eId="para_2071">The Higher Education Authority, on my behalf, recently launched a competitive tendering process for the establishment and management of a national digital media research and innovation centre, the National Digital Research Centre, or NDRC, to be located in the digital hub.</p>
            <p eId="para_2072">The centre will complement existing Government initiatives focused on digital media and technology enterprises and assist in the development and growth of the digital hub district. As well as having a clear educational research focus supported by a strong link with a third-level institution, this new centre will provide a focal point for the development of a wider research and innovation "ecosystem" relevant to and including the digital industry itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_2073">The centre will have a strong industry input and affinity, married with an imperative for commercialisation, with a particular focus on Irish-based industry. There will be an emphasis on interdisciplinary research and innovation and a focus on demonstrating solutions in an industry context.</p>
            <p eId="para_2074">The call for proposals will consist of a competitive two-phase structure, entailing a short-listing expressions of interest stage, followed by a comprehensive tendering process. A number of expressions of interest have now been received from higher education institutes, private sector entities and consortia. An independent panel will assess these on 21 June with a view to drawing up a short-list of candidates that will be asked to submit full tenders.</p>
            <p eId="para_2075">Digital media is at the cornerstone of the Government's information society agenda. The NDRC, together with existing activities and initiatives in the digital hub district, represents the type of value-added activity that I believe will contribute to Ireland's future at the forefront of the knowledge society.</p>
            <p eId="para_2076">Subject to a suitable candidate emerging from the competition, meeting the strict criteria set out above, it is proposed to establish the new centre towards the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2081">Prices charged for broadband services vary, depending on bandwidth and other factors. My Department's website, <i>www.broadband.gov.ie</i>, lists the monthly subscription fees for 190 broadband service offerings, ranging from 0.128 Mbps to upwards of 56 Mbps. Twenty-five of those service offerings are priced at €35 per month or less, which is close to the EU average for such services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2082">The number of broadband customers in Ireland is now over 160,000, an increase of more than 400% since the beginning of 2004, while the Commission for Communications Regulations, ComReg, register of authorised undertakings currently lists 169 Internet service providers offering services in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2083">This is an indication of the vigorous growth in the broadband market here, which is being assisted in no small way by the investment of up to €200 million of Government and ERDF funding under the NDP in metropolitan area networks and other broadband infrastructure initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_2084">I have set the industry a target of 500,000 broadband customers by 2007, and I believe that target can be achieved.</p>

            <p eId="para_2086">An Post is a commercial State body and the question of pay increases in the company is one in which I have no function.</p>
            <p eId="para_2087">An Post has a remit to be financially viable and following significant losses, which amounted to €43 million in 2003 alone, An Post management invoked the "inability to pay" clause provided for in Sustaining Progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_2088">The key challenge for the company is to return to long-term financial stability. In this regard, An Post unions and management have been involved in intensive negotiations with the assistance of the State's industrial relations machinery in a bid to agree a recovery plan that will put the company on a sound footing. The question of Sustaining Progress related payments was addressed in a Labour Relations Commission, LRC, brokered process. The LRC-appointed assessors issued their report last week. I understand that the report concludes that An Post is currently in a position to pay a 5% payment under Sustaining Progress and that the company has undertaken to do so by the end of this month. I also understand that the assessors' report finds that An Post cannot afford any further elements of Sustaining Progress or the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress, other than in the context of securing finalisation on rationalisation and restructuring requirements. I understand that the An Post unions are in disagreement with the findings of the report and that the matter will be referred to the Labour Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_2089">An agreement on a viable recovery plan will enable An Post to deliver quality services to our citizens, while at the same time providing sustainable well-paid employment for its staff.</p>

            <p eId="para_2094">Fishing boats are not licensed on the basis of individual species of fish. For the purpose of licensing the fleet is divided into five segments: pelagic, beamer, polyvalent, specific and aquaculture. Each segment provides for a certain level of entitlement as regards species but those entitlements may be subject to further restrictions such as quotas, area preclusions, etc. In principle boats licensed in all segments other than the aquaculture segment can fish for scallops. However, in practice the number of boats actively engaged in that fishery is much lower. Vessels in the specific segment of the fleet are restricted to fishing solely for bivalve molluscs, including scallop. A moratorium on the granting of additional licences in that segment was introduced in 1999, other than in the case of applications which were already on hand at the time of that decision. To date in 2005, a total of 12 dredgers have targeted scallops and the total engine power of these vessels is 7,118 kilowatts.</p>

            <p eId="para_2096">All merchant vessels of any significant size must be registered. There are over 140 ship registers in operation worldwide. Ship registers impose obligations on ship owners regarding maintenance, crewing standards and certification of those matters by the flag state or inspection bodies duly authorised by the flag state.</p>
            <p eId="para_2097">My responsibilities in regard to enforcing these obligations are confined to Irish registered ships; the operation of other ship registers is governed by applicable national and international law. Within the European Union there is freedom for ship operators to go on any EU membership ship register or on any third country ship register. I have no statutory function in relation to seafarers' wages.</p>
            <p eId="para_2098">The particular ship referred to by the Deputy is not registered on the Irish ship register. Obligations on the ship's owners regarding maintenance, crewing standards and certification of these matters are appropriate to the flag state concerned, which I understand in this case is St. Vincent and the Grenadines.</p>
            <p eId="para_2099">Foreign registered vessels using Irish ports are inspected regularly by the marine survey office of the Department in the exercise of Ireland's port state control obligations. These inspections are aimed at ensuring that such vessels are maintained and operated in compliance with international safety standards laid down by the International Maritime Organisation, IMO, and, in relation to seafarers' social conditions, by the International Labour Organisation's, ILO, maritime conventions, together with relevant EU initiatives in the maritime area. Deficiencies identified are brought to the attention of the owner and flag state administration and may have to be rectified before the ship continues its journey.</p>
            <p eId="para_2100">Ireland participates in EU, IMO and ILO discussions on seafarers' welfare, supporting proposals aimed at improving their terms and conditions of employment. Ireland will continue to support efforts in all appropriate fora to enhance working conditions for seafarers and will continue to enforce safety and operational standards through the port state control framework. The Department is not aware of any proposed EU legislation that would be intended to impact on the pay and working conditions of seafarers aboard the vessels to which the Deputy refers.</p>

            <p eId="para_2118">I propose to take Questions Nos. 97 and 189 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2119">Ireland's primary television stations are available throughout the country on a range of platforms including terrestrial, cable and MMDS and satellite platforms. A migration to digital television is under way in most EU countries. I expect that all television broadcasting will eventually be on a digital basis. This will provide benefits to viewers including more channels and better quality pictures and sound.</p>
            <p eId="para_2120">Free-to-air digital terrestrial television is not yet available in Ireland. Over time, the analogue terrestrial network will have to be upgraded to a digital network. In this regard I have asked my Department to develop a digital terrestrial television pilot project this year. Digital cable and MMDS and digital satellite multi-channel services are currently available in Ireland on a subscription and pay-per-view basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2121">The availability of an increasing number of television channels via digital satellite is having and will continue to have a major impact on the Irish broadcasting landscape. The fact that many of these channels are not subject to Irish regulation is also a factor.</p>
            <p eId="para_2122">A significant increase in the numbers of channels available to viewers does not necessarily mean that viewers will be offered a corresponding increase in the nature and range of the programming on offer. I am clear that in a digital era there will continue to be a central role for both RTE and private broadcasters in delivering high quality programming that is of interest and of relevance to Irish audiences.</p>

            <p eId="para_2124">Work is continuing on the development of legislative proposals that will form the basis of a new broadcasting Bill. The priority issues to be addressed by the legislative proposals are the establishment of a single content regulator for both private and public service broadcasters as recommended by the forum on broadcasting; the establishment of RTE as a company under the Companies Acts 1963 to 2003; the provision of a statutory mechanism for future adjustments to the level of the television licence fee; and the development of the right of reply mechanism, allowing persons whose reputation and good name have been damaged by an assertion of incorrect facts in a television or radio programme to gain redress.</p>
            <p eId="para_2125">While still in development stage, it is not anticipated that the legislative proposals on enactment would significantly impact on RTE's existing levels of licence fee or advertising income. With regard to the provision of a statutory mechanism for future adjustments to the level of the licence fee, the approach under consideration involves reviews by the proposed single content regulator of: on an annual basis the achievement by RTE of its programming and change management commitments; and on a five year basis of the adequacy or otherwise of the licence fee to support public service broadcasting. The output from such reviews would be a recommendation as to an appropriate adjustment to the level of the licence fee. Annual reviews along similar lines were carried out by independent consultants PricewaterhouseCoopers in 2003 and 2004.</p>

            <p eId="para_2133">During my recent address to the Irish Postmaster's Union annual conference, I outlined that in an age where we as a Government are committed to delivering quality customer services, people must be allowed to choose their preferred method of payment. I pointed out that over 65% of new social welfare recipients opted for alternatives to the post office because of the convenience of electronic funds transfer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2134">It is now clear that electronic funds transfer, or EFT, functionality is going to play a greater role in service delivery to social welfare clients. It is important, at the same time, that the post office retains its position as a delivery point for welfare payments. With an eye to the future, An Post has started working on a new business model for the post office network, which will involve a substantial upgrade of IT systems in order to offer EFT functionality to social welfare recipients and a wider suite of financial and other services to new and existing customers. Pending progress on the system upgrades, I have agreed with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs that, for the moment, all payment options will receive equal standing on social welfare forms and that the Department of Social and Family Affairs will not actively push EFT for social welfare clients.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
            <p eId="para_2139">In January of this year, I launched the Government's ports policy statement. The policy statement aims to better equip the port sector and its stakeholders to meet national and regional capacity and service needs. One of the key challenges that lies ahead is the provision of adequate in-time port capacity, particularly for unitised trade. The policy statement sets out a framework to ensure that capacity needs are identified, planned and progressed in a co-ordinated manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_2140">As an initial step, the Department has sought information from the commercial ports which handle unit load cargo on key projects identified by them as essential to deal with anticipated capacity deficiencies to 2014 and beyond and whether the ports see these as being funded from their own resources or in partnership with the private sector. In its response to this request, Drogheda Port Company has provided information to the Department concerning its proposal for the development of a new deepwater port at Bremore. The timeframe for the proposed development and the preparation of a detailed business plan are matters for Drogheda Port Company in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2141">As indicated in the policy statement, it is intended to prioritise a range of projects catering for unitised traffic at our commercial ports from an overall economic national and regional perspective, as opposed to the perceived requirements of individual ports. To that end, the Department will be procuring expert and independent assistance from consultants to refine the criteria to be used for project evaluation, to draw up a uniform template for submission of detailed project proposals and to subsequently evaluate and rank the projects submitted as a basis for the Department's recommendation to Government. The terms of reference for the proposed consultancy are being prepared by the Department at present.</p>

            <p eId="para_2143">Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, which was established as a statutory agency in May 2002, implements a wide variety of programmes on energy efficiency and renewable energy on behalf of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2144">Under SEI's House of Tomorrow Research, Development and Demonstration Programme, HOT, financial support is directed at encouraging developers of housing, both new-build and refurbishment, to incorporate design and technology features, which deliver significantly superior energy and CO2 performance. By targeting developers of schemes of houses, from the private or social housing sectors, the aim has been to establish over a number of years a nationwide network of accessible examples of more sustainable energy design and technology practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2145">With the accompaniment of other promotional measures by SEI, this is intended to encourage a sufficient degree of market replication, without subsidy, to elevate energy performance standards across the wider housing stock. This targeted approach is also designed to be an administratively efficient method for deployment of public moneys.</p>
            <p eId="para_2146">To date the programme has committed over €7.5 million funding to 39 projects comprising a total 1,818 housing units, all featuring an integrated approach to energy supply and use that achieves performance of at least 20% better than current building regulations and in fact, in the majority of projects, 40% better. The range of sustainable energy technologies employed within these demonstration projects includes the following: condensing boilers in 1,236 homes; solar water heating in 344 homes; heat recovery ventilation in 176 homes; geothermal heating systems in 143 homes; and wood pellet boilers in 93 homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2147">Funding for SEI is determined on an annual basis. SEI submits a proposed work programme for the coming year along with a budget for each of its programmes, such as the House of Tomorrow programme, to my Department. Any increase in funding required for these programmes would have budgetary implications and could only be considered in the light of the overall budgetary requirements of SEI and the level of funding available to my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_2152">I propose to take Questions Nos. 106, 116, 187 and 188 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2153">It is important to differentiate between television broadcasting services and the platforms on which they are made available. RTE and TV3 are, for example, available on analogue and digital cable systems, digital MMD systems, the analogue terrestrial network and BSkyB's digital satellite system. Ireland has, therefore, a number of channels available on a satellite platform. We do not, however, have any satellite platform operators based in Ireland nor is it likely that this will happen in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2154">However, the availability of an increasing number of television channels on the satellite platform is having and will continue to have a major impact on the Irish broadcasting landscape. Under the television without frontiers directive, member states must ensure freedom of reception and shall not restrict retransmissions on their territory of television broadcasts properly regulated in other member states. While this has been the case for many years, recent technological developments which allow transfrontier broadcasting services to insert area-specific advertising have increased the potential impact on broadcasting services in smaller member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_2155">In Ireland's case this is evident by the number of UK channels which now broadcast specifically Irish advertising. While this may result in Irish channels receiving a smaller share of the Irish advertising market, it may also reduce Ireland's ability to apply Irish broadcasting standards to broadcasting services which are primarily aimed at Irish viewers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2156">In that context, Ireland, along with a significant number of other member states, favours an amendment to the television without frontiers directive whereby broadcasting services which originate in one member state but are intended for reception primarily in another member state should be subject to the broadcasting standards which apply in the member state in which the service is received.</p>
            <p eId="para_2157">This is an issue which Ireland intends to vigorously pursue in the forthcoming discussions on the review of the television without frontiers directive which is currently being conducted by the European Commission.</p>

However, I can confirm that the company is engaged in a major network renewal programme involving expenditure of approximately €3.5 billion in the period 2000 to 2004 and it is my understanding that further expenditure of an estimated €3.3 billion is being proposed for this programme for the period 2005 to 2009.</p>

Many of the recommendations arising from these reviews have been implemented, with particular regard to winning new business, including extra banking and new utility business. An Post has started working on a new business model for the post office network, which will involve a substantial upgrade of IT systems in order to offer electronic funds transfer, EFT, functionality to social welfare recipients and a wider suite of financial and other services to new and existing customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2170">There is widespread recognition that the best strategy to sustain the post office network is for An Post to continue adapting to customer needs with a view to retaining existing customers, while at the same time developing services to attract new customers.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. B. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2205">Respect for children as a global ideal has been affirmed by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. The Convention on the Rights of the Child was ratified, without reservation, by Dáil Éireann on 21 September 1992, the document of ratification being deposited with the Secretary General of the United Nations. The convention entered into force for Ireland on 21 October 1992.</p>
            <p eId="para_2206">The publication of the national children's strategy, Our Children — their Lives, in 2000 is a major initiative to progress the implementation of the convention in Ireland. The strategy is rooted in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and it sets out an ambitious set of goals and objectives to guide children's policy over a ten year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2207">The issue of express inclusion of children's rights in the Constitution is a matter which has been given some consideration in recent years. The Constitution review group, CRG, in its report published in 1996 considered a number of articles of the UNCRC, namely, article 7 — name and nationality; article 3 — best interests of the child; article 9 — separation from parents; and article 18 — parental responsibilities, all of which make reference to the best interests of the child. In its published report in 1998, the CRG recommended that the Constitution be amended to include the welfare principle, and to provide an express guarantee of certain other children's rights deriving from the UN convention.</p>
            <p eId="para_2208">The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution is currently carrying out a review of the Articles in the Constitution dealing with the family. This follows upon a long-standing request from the Department of Health and Children to consider a constitutional amendment to underpin the individual rights of children. The committee has stated that the study of children's rights is in the context of an examination of the place of the family in the Constitution. The committee is studying the case law that has been developed under these Articles, the report of the Constitution review group, 1996, referred to above and the report of the Commission on the Family, 1998. The committee also has available to it submissions on the family from interest groups and individuals to the Constitution review group and has sought public submissions in relation to the issues. Both the National Children's Office and the Adoption Board, which are under the aegis of my Department, have made submissions to the committee pointing out the commitments contained in the UN convention and the need to protect the rights of children in any proposed amendments to the Constitution.</p>
            <p eId="para_2209">The outcome of the deliberations of the committee is awaited. I understand that the committee has received a very large number of submissions from a wide range of organisations and individuals. It is anticipated that the committee will be in a position to report later this year.</p>

The Health Service Executive has put in place the necessary administrative arrangements for the introduction of the GP visit cards. It is intended that a public information campaign will be undertaken which will indicate the process to be followed by applicants to obtain application forms and to have their eligibility assessed by the HSE.

The new chairperson of the board, whom I appointed on 14 March 2005, has been asked to address the backlog of appeals as a priority. To facilitate more frequent meetings of the board, I brought in new regulations on 7 April 2005 allowing for the appointment of up to ten medical practitioners to the board of appeal. There are currently seven medical practitioners on the board of appeal, and I hope to make further appointments shortly.

            <p eId="para_2293">An Post has just launched a process seeking proposals from financial institutions with a view to developing and expanding the range of financial services available through An Post.

The company has recruited advisers to assist with the process and hope to move it to a conclusion by the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2296">Prices charged for broadband services vary, depending on bandwidth and other factors. My Department's website, <i>www.broadband.gov.ie, </i>lists the monthly subscription fees for 190 broadband service offerings, ranging from 0.128 Mbps to upwards of 56 Mbps.

This is an indication of the vigorous growth in the broadband market here, which is being assisted in no small way by the investment of up to €200 million of Government and European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, funding under the national development plan, NDP, in metropolitan area networks and other broadband infrastructure initiatives.</p>

            <p eId="para_2302">I propose to take Questions Nos. 148 to 150, inclusive, and 152 together as they refer to the EU Commission's investigation into the funding of RTE.</p>
            <p eId="para_2303">Following a period of investigation, the EU Commission forwarded an Article 17 letter to the Irish authorities on 3 March 2005 setting out its preliminary views in regard to the compatibility of the funding arrangements for RTE with the requirements of the EU treaty. In arriving at its preliminary views, the Commission followed the principles it set out in a published paper entitled Communication from the Commission on the application of State Aid Rules to public service broadcasting. In that paper the Commission outlined the questions it would ask in establishing the existence and nature of the State aid and the compatibility of that aid with the relevant provisions of the EU treaty.</p>
            <p eId="para_2304">As regards the presence of State aid, the Altmark judgment sets out the conditions under which State resources paid to an undertaking would not be defined as State aid. As Ireland accepts that the funding of RTE involves State aid, the Altmark judgment does not apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_2305">In regard to the compatibility of such State aid with the EU treaty, the Commission assesses whether the public service remit of the broadcaster is clearly defined; the remit is properly entrusted and the broadcaster is independently supervised in regard to its performance in fulfilling that remit; and the amount of aid is proportional, that is, no more than is necessary for the broadcaster to fulfil its public service remit.</p>
            <p eId="para_2306">I can confirm that the Commission has come to a preliminary view in regard to each of these issues, including the question of whether RTE is in compliance with the requirements of the transparency directive. The letter also includes a number of recommendations which the Commission considers must be implemented before the aid scheme can be regarded as compatible with the EU treaty.</p>
            <p eId="para_2307">I must stress that the views of the Commission set out in the Article 17 letter are preliminary in nature and should not be regarded as the final decision of the Commission. The outcome of the process is subject to ongoing formal and informal contacts and is a matter of negotiation between the Irish authorities and the EU Commission. Accordingly, it would be inappropriate for me to make any detailed comments on the contents of the Article 17 letter at this point.</p>
            <p eId="para_2308">I can confirm, however, that Ireland forwarded a response to the Commission on 30 May 2005. The Commission is currently examining that response to see if it adequately addresses its concerns. Because of the nature of the process involved I do not propose to publish Ireland's response at this time. If the outcome of the procedure requires legislative changes, I will bring such changes forward in the context of the proposed Broadcasting Bill.</p>

Tenders for the QRA were invited from four companies with requisite competencies. The company, which was successful following this tendering process, was British Pipeline Agency Limited, BPA.</p>
            <p eId="para_2323">Following media queries on 25 May 2005 my Department became aware that the company selected to undertake the QRA review is owned jointly by BP Oil UK Limited and Shell UK Oil Limited. Notwithstanding that, BP Oil UK and Shell UK Oil Limited own the company jointly, BPA remains of the view that there is no conflict of interest. While I accept that BPA has completed the review in a fully professional and objective manner, I remain conscious of the association of Shell UK Oil Limited with BPA by means of its 50% ownership of the company and I regret that this situation ever arose. In the interest of ensuring confidence in the independence of the process of evaluation of the safety aspects of the pipeline as addressed by the QRA Version F and considering the public concerns and sensitivities on this issue I instructed officials of my Department to initiate a further review of the QRA. I can confirm that my Department has engaged a consultant to carry out a further review of the QRA.</p>

            <p eId="para_2341">The escalation of fuel costs, as a result of global economic and political conditions, remains a matter of concern for all sectors of industry, including the fishing industry. It is important to note that the fishing industry, in Ireland and throughout the European Union, already receives favourable treatment in the form of a full rebate on excise and VAT on marine fuel, if the enterprise concerned is registered for VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_2342">In terms of assistance to fishermen to ease this problem, there are strict EU rules in relation to public aid which state:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2343">State aid which is granted without imposing any obligation serving the objectives of the Common Fisheries Policy on the part of the recipients . . . and which has the effect of reducing the recipient's production costs or improving the recipient's income is, as operating aid, incompatible with the common market. The Commission intends to apply this rule with rigour to all operating aid, including aid in forms of tax relief, or of reductions of contributions to social security or to unemployment benefit systems.</p>

            <p eId="para_2356">Under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003, the sea-fishing boat licensing authority is prohibited from granting a licence in respect of a sea-fishing boat unless an independent survey confirms that the boat is safe and seaworthy. The sea-fishing boat licences for many fishing boats expire on 30 June 2005 and this provision applies to any new licence granted in respect of such boats. In the case of sea-fishing boats which are 24 metres or more in length, owners are obliged to have a certificate of compliance with specified safety requirements laid down under EU law before a new licence can issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_2357">Many mussel vessels, which engage in fishing for mussel seed, are within this category and must, therefore, satisfy the requirements for a certificate of compliance before new sea-fishing boat licences can be issued. They also require a mussel seed allocation in order to engage in fishing for mussel seed. All sea-fishing boat licence-holders in this category, including mussel dredgers, have been reminded of the requirements. It is not possible to indicate at this stage the number of mussel dredgers which will not be in a position to meet the safety requirements to enable them to fish for seed this season.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_2383">I propose to take Questions Nos. 214, 229 and 239 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2384">The telecommunications sector is fully liberalised, and regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg. With the repeal of section 111 of the Postal and Telecommunications Services Act 1983 on 25 July 2003, the former licensing regime has been replaced by a general entitlement to provide telecommunications networks and services, including broadband, subject to compliance with standard conditions set out by ComReg in a general authorisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2385">Before providing networks or services to third parties operators are required to submit a notification to ComReg for the purposes of compiling a register of such operators. In March 2004 my predecessor issued a number of policy directions to ComReg relating to competition, broadband, wholesale and retail line rental, interconnection and leased lines, and national and cross-border roaming.</p>
            <p eId="para_2386">Access to suitable infrastructure is a major factor in the provision of broadband by the sector. However, recognising that investment by the sector had failed to keep pace with demand, the Government decided in March 2002 to target the widespread availability of open access, affordable infrastructure, using ERDF and State funding under the NDP 2000-06. The metropolitan area networks, or MANs, programme is the mainstay of the Government's broadband strategy, and has given the sector access to world-class infrastructure that it could not afford to build for itself. Full details of the MANs programme and my Department's other broadband rollout initiatives can be found on the website <i>www.dcmnr.gov.ie</i>.</p>
            <p eId="para_2387">As an indicator of the increasingly buoyant state of the broadband market in Ireland, ComReg's register of authorised undertakings currently lists 169 service providers offering Internet access using a variety of technologies including DSL, fixed wireless, cable modem, fibre, leased lines and satellite technology. My Department's website, <i>www.broadband.gov.ie, </i>lists 190 different service offers from the sector, ranging from 0.256 Mbps to 56 Mbps, and 25 of those offers are priced at €25 per month or less. The number of broadband users is now over 160,000, an increase of more than 400% since January 2004, and I am confident that the industry can achieve the target I have set it of 500,000 broadband customers by the end of 2006.</p>

            <p eId="para_2389">The Government and the board of An Post are committed to the objective of securing a viable and sustainable nationwide post office network through a strategy of maximising the volume of both public and private sector business handled. The policy is set out in the programme for Government. The challenge for the company is to develop a strategy which satisfies the needs of existing customers while attracting new customers into the post office. An Post has already had some success winning new business and continues to benefit from a considerable volume of Government business especially in the areas of social welfare payments and savings products.</p>
            <p eId="para_2390">To ensure our post offices remain competitive and attractive to customers, future strategy must satisfactorily balance the social benefits of a nationwide post office network and ongoing electronic technology issues. With this in mind, I have asked the management of An Post to develop such a strategy. The company has started working on a new business model for the network which will involve a substantial upgrade of IT systems to offer electronic funds transfer functionality to social welfare recipients and a wider suite of financial and other services to new and existing customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2391">An Post has just launched a process seeking proposals from financial institutions with a view to developing and expanding the range of financial services available through the An Post network. This development presents an important opportunity for the counters service to grow, win new lines of business and acquire the technology and other resources necessary to face the challenges of the future. The company has recruited advisers to assist with the process and hopes to move it to a conclusion by the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_2393">It is becoming increasingly obvious that energy efficiency and conservation bear on the activities of every Minister. My ambition is to bring about an increase in the priority given to it. Government policy on the conservation and sustainable use of energy is directed through Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, which was established under the Sustainable Energy Act in 2002 as an independent non-commercial State body. SEI and its programmes are funded under the current national development plan and the economic and social infrastructure operational programme to end 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2394">SEI is responsible for focusing on the deployment of energy efficiency and conservation measures across all sectors of the economy. Its programmes include an extensive consumer information programme, a warmer homes scheme to address fuel poverty in low-income households, an industry programme to encourage better energy management and energy efficiency in the industrial sector, a public sector programme designed to produce model energy efficient buildings in the public sector and the house of tomorrow programme which provides grant aid for the building of groups of energy efficient homes. In particular, I am actively encouraging the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works to make energy efficiency an important design criterion for building projects for the decentralisation programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2395">Analysis of statistics shows a relative decoupling of Ireland's total primary energy requirement from economic growth, especially since 1992. This success is due to changes in the structure of the economy and improvements in energy efficiency, which have also meant reductions in energy-related CO2 production. The development of alternative energy in Ireland has, to date, been supported under the alternative energy requirement, AER, programme administered by my Department. A renewable energy development group was established in 2004 to advise on future options on policies, targets, programmes and support measures to develop the increased use of renewable energy in the electricity market to 2010 and beyond. Based on the work of the group, I was able to announce last April the outline of a future support mechanism based on a fixed price proposal in place of competitive tendering. In addition, the support which was previously tied to contracts with the ESB will now be accepted from any licensed supplier. I also indicated that wind powered technology will remain the dominant technology in reaching this target.</p>
            <p eId="para_2396">In parallel to the ongoing work of the renewable energy development group, a number of other strategy and policy groups have examined alternative and sustainable energy sources. The work of both the bioenergy strategy group and the combined heat and power policy group has fed into the renewable energy development group.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_2398">Our electricity system is currently linked to the system in Northern Ireland by three interconnectors, one between Tandragee and Louth, one between Strabane and Letterkenny and one between Enniskillen and Corraclassy. The main interconnector, which is between Tandragee and Louth, has a physical capacity of 600 MW of power with 100% standby capacity. The interconnectors enable trade of electricity between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland and, through the Moyle interconnector, Northern Ireland-Scotland, with Britain to provide a more efficient, integrated electricity system on the island of Ireland. The interconnector capacity available for trading between the jurisdictions is less than the physical capacity of 600 MW.</p>
            <p eId="para_2399">When allowance is made for dealing with faults such as those caused by thunderstorms, the grid capacity in both systems and system security, the capacity available for trading in a North-South direction between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland is typically 330 MW. This can be less at times for technical reasons. The two smaller interconnectors are not available for trading as they are connected to weak parts of both networks and are used for local network support only.</p>
            <p eId="para_2400">In November 2004, my Northern Ireland counterpart and I endorsed the regulators' plans for a second North-South electricity interconnector. When operational, the second interconnector will increase the power transfer capacity between North and South, facilitate increased trade in electricity and further enhance security of electricity supply and competitiveness. It is estimated that the interconnector could take up to eight years to complete depending on the route and speed of planning consents. ESB National Grid and Northern Ireland Electricity are currently developing proposals on route options, planning permissions and other technical issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2401">The Commission for Energy Regulation has appointed a consortium to advise on the financial, technical, commercial and procurement aspects relating to interconnection of 500 to 1000 MW capacity between Ireland and Wales. Phase 1 of the project, which is scheduled to be completed before the summer, will look at procurement options, routing, capacity, ownership and operational parameters. A consultation process will be undertaken with all parties who have expressed an interest to date. A decision on how best to take the project forward, whether on a regulated or a hybrid regulated merchant basis, will be taken at the end of phase 1. The consultancy should report to CER by end of June and it in turn will report to me in July or August having assessed the implications of the report.</p>
            <p eId="para_2402">East-west interconnection remains a fundamental part of the electricity strategy for Ireland, as endorsed by Government. The project will provide the increased security of supply, competition and integration of the Irish electricity market into the wider European energy market.</p>

            <p eId="para_2404">There are currently nine petroleum exploration licences awarded to petroleum exploration companies; one reserved area licence, 21 licensing options and 11 petroleum prospecting licences. The licences are additional to the Kinsale, Seven Heads and Corrib petroleum leases. A licensing round in the north-east Rockall Basin closed on 31 May 2005. The results of the round will be available shortly. The next licensing round will be in the Slyne-Erris and Donegal basins with a closing date of 15 March 2006.

            <p eId="para_2407">Several projects have been initiated by my Department under the aegis of the e-Government project. The Department has invested considerable time in designing and implementing the infrastructure upon which to build quality e-Government services to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_2408">Some of the projects are as follows. Minerals application processing system, MAPS, is an online application for prospecting licences and is in place and accessible from the Department's website at <i>www.dcmnr.ie</i>. The Department plans to expand on the MAPS framework to bring further prospecting services online, including tracking of applications for licences and geographical information systems, GIS, services. The integrated fisheries information system, IFIS, went live in March 2005. Together with the release of MAPS, the IFIS brings together the infrastructure and back office work done by the Department which paves the way for the introduction of further business applications in 2005-06. The system caters for licensing and registration of the fishing vessel fleet and the recording and reporting of catch data to the EU. Phase II — online forms — is to follow in Q3 2005, including an online application for a sea fishing licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2409">Coastal zone management, CoZAS, system phase I — foreshore — has entered its development phase and will go live in Q4 2005. Phase II — aquaculture — is due to be released in early 2006 and the final phase — dumping at sea — is set for delivery in Q2 2006. The system will allow members of the public to view a list of all applications for licences within the system; create applications for services relating to foreshore leasing and aquaculture licensing and enable the submission of an application form. Phase II of the system will make all of the above services available to the Department's aquaculture customers, including a GIS element.</p>
            <p eId="para_2410">The Department is in the early stages of expanding on the existing data available on the Irish corporate fleet. When finalised, the corporate vessel register, or CVR, will allow round the clock access to the data, with due diligence given to security and data sensitivity issues, for the benefit of national and international maritime safety and security interests and to provide self-service vessel queries. The CVR project incorporates the safe sea network of the EU Commission which will enable the community and Ireland to monitor passing and visiting maritime traffic leading to more effective port and coastal State control and the enhancement of maritime safety, security and environmental protection. The implementation of the system will allow the Government to meet obligations on the reporting of vessel information, as mandated by applicable international conventions and protocols, over the Internet and provide the Irish authorities with a method for sending and requesting information about maritime activity to and from other EU member states. The system will also advance the objective of e-enabling the public service by moving towards the online management of marine safety and vessel-related issues and activities. It will also facilitate a joined-up approach to marine activities with other EU member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_2411">The Department's website, <i>www.dcmnr.ie</i>, is continually being improved and developed and will comply with the National Disability Authority’s IT accessibility guidelines, level II, by Q3 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_2416">Ireland's biofuels sector is currently at a very early stage of development and there are currently two pure plant oil producers active in the biofuels market. Under the pilot biofuels mineral oil tax relief scheme which my Department recently advertised, a total of 34 applications were received under the call for proposals by the closing date. Applications were received under all three categories of biofuel. A number of challenges to market development are being addressed as part of an ongoing policy to develop the sector. These challenges include high production costs relative to fossil fuels, sourcing and maintaining adequate feedstocks, consumer awareness, ensuring quality standards, and accessing distribution networks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2417">These issues, and appropriate measures to increase market penetration, are currently being considered in consultation with all of the relevant Departments. As part of developing policy, a liquid biofuels strategy study was published by Sustainable Energy Ireland in December 2004. This report provides comprehensive details on the potential for the development of a biofuels market in Ireland and options to stimulate the market. Further studies are now being commissioned with a view to evaluating the most effective policy mechanisms for developing Ireland's biofuels sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_2419">First, as regards domestic electricity prices, the Deputy will be aware I do not have any function in regard to the pricing of electricity as this falls within the remit of the Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, the independent regulator for electricity and gas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2420">The CER was given the responsibility for regulating tariffs under the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2000, which amended section 9 of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_2421">Liberalisation of the electricity market has proceeded on a phased basis since February 2000 under the regulatory oversight of the CER, in accordance with the Electricity Regulation Act 1999. On 19 February this year the market opened fully to competition. This is over two years in advance of the July 2007 deadline set down in Electricity Directive 2003/54/EC.</p>
            <p eId="para_2422">All customers are now eligible to source their electricity from any licensed supplier and the entire market becomes contestable. Scope now exists for all customers, household and non-household alike, to seek out keener prices in the competitive market. The evidence of switching between suppliers shows that business customers are price and quality sensitive and having a choice of supplier is allowing them to make the decision on what best meets their needs. I welcome the fact that companies are exercising their right to choose their optimum supplier as an indication that the liberalisation of the market is working.</p>
            <p eId="para_2423">Over time as suppliers target the domestic market, I expect to see those benefits extended to the domestic customer. Like any newly opening market, suppliers have initially concentrated on serving larger customers — not least because the market for larger customers was opened earlier.</p>
            <p eId="para_2424">My objective is to have in place policies and a regulatory environment, which will deliver a competitive energy and electricity market leading to the lowest sustainable prices. I expect that the major consultancy into electricity which commenced recently and the recent publication by both regulators of the SEM, single electricity market, proposals will assist us in policy evolution towards a more competitive market.</p>
            <p eId="para_2425">The SEM will allow participants to buy and sell wholesale electricity across the island regardless of either the demand or supply location. It is expected that the new market will be more efficient as in general, the lowest cost generating plant on the island will be run first, leading to potentially lower electricity costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2426">Over time the aim is to facilitate the development of an efficient competitive market thereby minimising the wholesale cost of electricity. This will create a more attractive location for new generation investment. Additionally, it is expected that the SEM will improve the security and reliability of electricity supplies throughout the island.</p>

            <p eId="para_2428">Energy costs relate primarily to the market prices of fuels and the capital and operating costs of energy providers, matters in which I have no function. Costs to industry generally are a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2429">Ireland is an importer of fuels, which are traded on the international market and have encountered unprecedented levels of volatility in the past year. There is a lack of cheap indigenous resources unlike for instance in Austria, Norway or Scotland which can utilise substantial hydro-power. France, Belgium and others rely heavily on nuclear power.</p>
            <p eId="para_2430">The distance from fuel supply sources brings higher transportation costs which place a significant premium on prices — landed prices for natural gas in Ireland are considerably higher than those paid by our mainland European counterparts. Furthermore, the current lack of widespread electricity interconnection limits access to other competitive markets in Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_2431">The following comparisons for the EU15 countries is based on the most recent data from EUROSTAT, the statistical office of the European Communities. Electricity prices, excluding VAT, to industry were 19.8% higher in Ireland than the EU average in January 2005. Fuel oil prices, excluding VAT, to industry were 8.3% lower in Ireland than the EU average in January 2005. Natural gas prices, excluding VAT, to industry were 5.9% lower in Ireland than the EU average in January 2005 for the lower consumption bands. No data for Ireland were available for higher consumptions. Automotive diesel prices, all taxes included, were 6.1% lower than the EU average in January 2005. Electricity prices, VAT included, to households were 1.4% higher in Ireland than the EU average in January 2005. Heating oil prices, VAT included, to households were 4.1% lower in Ireland than the EU average in January 2005. Natural gas prices, VAT included, to households were 16% lower in Ireland than the EU average in January 2005. Premium unleaded petrol prices, all taxes included, were 7.3% lower in Ireland than the EU average in January 2005 and were 17.4% lower than the UK during the same period.</p>

            <p eId="para_2434">SEI is involved in a number of projects aimed at promoting solar energy in Ireland. Through its information office in Cork, SEI offers advice to the public on solar energy systems and suppliers.</p>

This project will be run jointly with Energy Action in Northern Ireland building skills both north and south of the Border and is funded through the EU INTERREG III programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2436">Under SEI's house of tomorrow research, development and demonstration programme, solar panels are among a number of energy technologies eligible for support in the context of an integrated set of measures comprising a whole house energy efficiency solution.</p>

            <p eId="para_2440">The full resources of the State's industrial relations machinery continue to be made available to management and unions to assist in resolving industrial relations issues at An Post. I have urged both sides to make full use of that machinery and I am pleased to say that progress has been made in regard to resolving many of these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_2441">A recovery plan has been devised by An Post in consultation with the unions. A key element of the plan concerns the continuing implementation of a major change programme, throughout the company, to deliver significant cost savings and efficiencies. In regard to the non-payment of Sustaining Progress increases, in which An Post has invoked the "inability to pay" clause, it is open to the unions to refer this matter to the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, and ultimately the Labour Court where a binding ruling can be made. Following a hearing in the Labour Court in March 2005, the LRC appointed assessors to examine whether the company was correct to invoke the "inability to pay" clause. The assessors' report was presented to both parties in the LRC in early June. The key recommendation was for an increase of 5% backdated to 1 January 2005. An Post unions have not accepted this recommendation and the issue will now be referred to the Labour Court. An Post intends implementing the assessors' recommendation and will pay employees a 5% increase from the end of June 2005, backdated to 1 January 2005.</p>

The proposal is now before the European Parliament for its second reading. Ireland will play an active role in Council in considering any amendments which the Parliament may propose.</p>
            <p eId="para_2495">Ireland strongly supports the aims of this proposal and the Council's common position text. I see the draft directive as offering increased certainty in intellectual property right protection by clarifying what can, or cannot, be patented. This, in turn, will reinforce the incentive to innovate and support a properly functioning Internal Market.</p>

            <p eId="para_2525">Child benefit is payable up to the age of 16 years and continues to be paid in respect of children up to age 19 who are in full-time education, or who have a physical or mental disability.</p>
            <p eId="para_2526">The policy of the Government over the past number of years has been to substantially increase the amount spent on child benefit for all families. The Government's commitment to this policy is reflected in the substantial resources invested in the child benefit scheme since 1997.</p>
            <p eId="para_2527">According to figures collected under the quarterly national household survey by the Central Statistics Office for the final quarter of 2004, there were an estimated 84,400 students aged 19 to 22 years. Extending child benefit to this category would therefore cost in the region of €144 million per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_2528">In recognition of the need to target resources towards low-income families with children in full-time education, child dependant allowances are paid to social welfare recipients in respect of qualified children to age 22 where the parent has been in receipt of a short-term social welfare payment for six months or more. Short-term schemes include such payments as unemployment benefit and assistance, disability benefit and supplementary welfare allowance. This provision also applies to recipients of long-term payments.</p>

        the steps which have been taken to try to ensure the security and the safety of the travelling public as well as workers and persons living in the vicinity of Shannon Airport in the event of serious accident, sabotage or terrorist attack, in view of the quantity of munitions, explosive substances and other dangerous materials such as depleted uranium and napalm-equivalent incendiary bombs which are widely reported to be regularly transported through the airport by the US military; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2559">Requests for exemptions under the Air Navigation (Carriage of Munitions of War, Weapons and Dangerous Goods) Order 1973 are received from civilian air carriers carrying military troops with their personal weapons and ammunition.</p>
            <p eId="para_2560">Requests for exemption are also received from cargo carriers. The cargo contained on these flights includes items such as helicopter parts, grenades and cartridges. These items are normally carried in accordance with International Civil Aviation Organisation, ICAO, regulations for the safe transport of dangerous goods by air as approved by ICAO.</p>
            <p eId="para_2561">As the day-to-day oversight of aviation safety falls within the remit of the Irish Aviation Authority, IAA, all applications under the 1973 order, including details of the cargo carried, are submitted to the IAA for its observations. Applications are also sent to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which in turn informs the Garda Síochána of each and every operation. Observations are also sought from the Department of Foreign Affairs, and each application is sent to the Department of Defence for information. Should any of these bodies express an objection to the operation of these flights, I would refuse to grant an exemption under the 1973 order.</p>
            <p eId="para_2562">In addition, the authorities at Shannon Airport are required, under the Irish Aviation Authority's aerodrome licensing procedures, to establish an emergency plan which provides for the co-ordination of the actions to be taken in the event of an emergency occurring at the aerodrome or in its vicinity. The plan must be tested by conducting a full-scale emergency exercise every two years. I understand that the airport authority conducted an exercise in November 2003 and that plans are being made for a further exercise later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2563">Foreign military aircraft may only land in or overfly Irish territory with the permission of the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I understand that permission to land or overfly Irish airspace is normally only given when the applicant foreign military aircraft are unarmed and not carrying weapons or explosives.</p>

            <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_2571">I propose to answer Questions Nos. 261, 262, 263, 267 and 269 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2572">It is my policy that Irish Rail should remain in the rail freight business and the company has made significant progress in growing the rail freight business in areas where it holds a competitive advantage over road haulage, such as in the carriage of sugar beet, cement and pulpwood. Irish Rail continues to pursue a policy of growing its rail freight business where opportunities present. However, as in all businesses, it must adjust the freight business from time to time to reflect changes in the marketplace.</p>
            <p eId="para_2573">The company has developed a business plan based on a strategy with regard to freight which is to break even by 2006; increase the profitability of the existing profitable business; withdraw from those businesses that are heavily loss-making; and target trainload traffic. In formulating this plan, Irish Rail has held wide-ranging consultations with business interests around the country, including representatives of business located in the west of Ireland, to identify those freight activities which are best suited to rail transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_2574">The strategic rail review, commissioned by my Department and published in 2003, contained a comprehensive examination of the rail freight business and its realistic potential to support economic development and contribute to a sustainable environment. The Irish Rail business plan has been developed against that background.</p>
            <p eId="para_2575">Since 1999, we have invested over €1.5 billion in rebuilding the railways, with Government and EU support for the investment programme delivering improvements in new trains, upgraded infrastructure and customer facilities. While such investment has primarily focused on improving passenger services, the investment in improving rail infrastructure also has a direct beneficial impact on freight activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2576">It remains my priority that any additional Exchequer subvention should focus on expanding passenger services to meet the continuing unmet demand for such services, in seeking to address the adverse social and economic impacts caused by traffic congestion.</p>

            <p eId="para_2579">In particular, data gathered annually by the National Roads Authority, Córas Iompair Éireann and the Dublin Airport Authority address traffic flows on the national road network, passengers numbers on CIE bus and rail services, and air passenger numbers and aircraft movements in the State airports. These data are published by the relevant agencies on an annual basis.</p>

Under the terms and conditions of the 2004 special beef premium scheme, it was appropriate that these animals be rejected, that is, they would not be paid premium and a reduction penalty would apply to the premium payments due in respect of the other bovine applications lodged by the person named. However, following correspondence with the person named, it was agreed that the proposed penalty, applicable to the other applications would not apply, as medical evidence was supplied which confirmed that the person named was ill at the time of the sale of the animals. In the correspondence, the person named acknowledged that special beef premium could not be paid on the animals but argued that the proposed penalty should not be applied.

            <p eId="para_2705">Ireland implemented the single payment scheme in January 2005. The special beef premium scheme and the slaughter premium scheme were the only schemes where the deadline for the receipt of applications was 31 December 2004. This meant that as many farmers as possible submitted their applications in late December 2004 in order that they could benefit from the special beef premium. Under the 2004 scheme, applications for in excess of 2.4 million animals were lodged, of which almost 1.4 million were quota animals, that is, first age-bull animals. The application figure in each of the previous three years was 1.9 million animals. In effect, the same amount of premium was available for payment on a much increased number of animals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2706">The person named lodged a total of eight applications for special beef premium in 2004. The total number of eligible animals listed on these application was 46, three animals for first age premium, 22 animals for second age premium and 21 animals for bull premium. To date, the person named has received payment of €328.50 on first stage premium and €3,372.60 on bull premium. On the second stage premium €2,541 has already issued to the person named. The final payment on special beef premium will issue when the quota cut on 2004 special beef premium is finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_2707">The level of the overshoot of the regional ceiling is attributable to the ending of the special beef premium scheme in 2004 and application patterns, both in terms of total numbers of animals applied upon and the timing of lodging of applications, strongly suggest this to be the case. I am fully aware of the impact that the overshoot reduction will have on beef farmers who claimed on more than 25 animals. I am seeking a solution to this issue and will continue to do so with the European Commissioner.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_2718">I propose to take Questions Nos. 290, 293, 295 and 298 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2719">I ask the Deputies to refer to the answers I gave to Questions Nos. 248 and 249 dated 23 March 2005, Nos. 104, 733 and 722 dated 12 April 2005 and Nos. 397 and 403 dated 19 April 2005 and to note that the position as stated therein is largely repeated hereunder.</p>
            <p eId="para_2720">The correspondence referred to in these questions relates to a document widely circulated by a group called Athlone Families Together, which gives a particular version of how the deportations took place and sets out a series of arguments — legal and otherwise — as to why the persons who were deported should be returned. I have also received a number of other representations, including from the aforementioned Athlone Families Together group, requesting that these persons be permitted to return to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2721">The two persons referred to by the Deputies are Nigerian women who were deported from the State on a charter flight to Lagos on the night of 14-15 March 2005. One of the women was accompanied in the State by four of her children, while the other was accompanied by two children. The asylum applications of both women and their children were refused following negative determinations by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. Their cases were further considered under section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, including representations on their behalf for leave to remain in the State, before deportation orders were signed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2722">I am informed that despite the best efforts of the Garda national immigration bureau on the day of the removals to maintain the unity of both families, the women refused to co-operate with the Garda in locating the whereabouts of all their children. In the end, both women were deported accompanied by only one child each. It is understood the remaining four children, who were hidden from gardaí, were passed into the care of other local Nigerian nationals by their mothers. The Garda national immigration bureau informed the local area Health Service Executive of the position regarding these children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2723">The Garda Síochána is tasked with the execution of deportation orders. All persons subject to such orders are required to present at Garda stations for the purpose of their removal from the State. In enforcing these orders it is a priority, as far as operationally possible, that family units which are the subject of such orders are not broken up in the process. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that in the circumstances which gave rise to these questions, members were obliged to call to school properties to enforce deportation orders because of a failure by the parents concerned to comply with a lawful request to present the family unit to the Garda. A complaint has been made to the Garda Complaints Board in respect of this matter which precludes me from commenting further at this time. To date, no decision has been reached by the board.</p>
            <p eId="para_2724">Notwithstanding the outcome of the complaint made to the Garda Complaints Board concerning the manner of the removals, the unalterable fact of this case is that it was the consequence of a deliberate choice of the persons concerned that they are now separated from their children. This behaviour by parents cannot form a basis for revoking the deportation orders in this instance and I do not intend doing so. Those persons who are caring for the children left behind by their parents should make themselves known to the authorities and every facility will be afforded to enable the children to be returned to Nigeria to be reunited with their families. Such a successful family reunification was recently effected in Romania in respect of a Romanian child who, similarly, had been deliberately left behind by his parents in the course of a charter removal operation from Ireland to Romania which took place on 2 June 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_2730">The visa applications in question were to enable a wife and child of a non-EEA national employed under the employment permit scheme to reside with him in the State. A worker employed under the work permit scheme may be joined by their spouse and minor children after the worker has been in the State for one year and has been offered a contract for a further year. The worker must also be able to fully support the family members in question without the need to have recourse to public funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_2731">When assessing applications for family reunification the visa officer will consider, among other things, whether the level of salary of the worker would come within the ambit of qualifying for payments from public funds. The applications in question were refused as it was felt that the documentation did not show that the worker in question was in a position to fully support his family without recourse to public funds at the time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2732">An appeal in respect of the applications was received on 13 December 2004. However, based on the additional documentation supplied, the visa appeals officer was unable to conclude that the initial refusal decision should be overturned. Consequently, the application was refused on appeal on 21 December 2004. It is open to the persons in question to submit fresh applications with current supporting documentation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2738">The gardaí attached to the Bridewell Garda station are responsible for the policing of the area referred to by the Deputy and it is patrolled by local uniformed gardaí on a daily basis. These patrols are assisted by detective units, divisional task force, divisional drugs unit and a community garda assigned to the area. Since 1 January 2005 there has been three recorded incidents of criminal damage-theft of vehicles in the location referred to by the Deputy. These incidents are all currently under investigation. Garda management keeps the issue of resource allocation under constant review in all areas to best determine the policing methods most appropriate for local communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2739">On Garda resources generally, I am pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis in line with An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</p>
            <p eId="para_2740">The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of the area referred to by the Deputy will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda districts throughout the country. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</p>

            <p eId="para_2755">To ensure that resources are used in the most effective manner, a review has been conducted in my Department in recent months to establish if primary schools have the level of SNA support that they need for children in their care, if they have resources which they no longer need or if they need extra resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_2756">The review has found that some schools no longer have the care needs for which the SNA was originally sanctioned, that is, in some cases the child may have left the school while in other cases the care needs of the child have diminished as the child has progressed through the school. In this regard, the schools where surplus SNA support was identified have been advised that they may retain this surplus until the end of the current school year. Accordingly, no schools that were identified as having surplus SNA support have yet lost that support.</p>
            <p eId="para_2757">My Department is engaged in discussions with the trade union representing SNAs, under the auspices of the Labour Relations Commission, on a number of issues relating to the employment of SNAs and these discussions are continuing. It would not be appropriate for me to comment specifically on any of the issues under discussion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2758">It has always been the case that where the care needs of a child no longer justify SNA support, that support should no longer have been available to the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2759">This Government has put in place an unprecedented level of support for children with special needs. Since 1998, the number of SNAs has increased from under 300 to more than 6,300 nationally. In addition to this, more effective systems, such as the establishment of the National Council for Special Education, have been put in place to ensure that children get support as early as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_2771">My Department has issued a letter to all primary schools notifying them of their teaching allocation under the new general allocation model for the 2005-06 school year. The letter also includes details of any clustering arrangements that may apply.</p>
            <p eId="para_2772">One of the objectives of the general allocation model is to maximise the extent of full-time permanent posts available to support the needs of pupils with higher-incidence special educational needs, SEN, and learning support teacher requirements. Clustering facilitates the assignment of experienced teachers as well as allowing for better training of resource teachers on the basis that permanent posts will retain teachers for longer periods. This ultimately benefits the pupils.</p>
            <p eId="para_2773">Schools have been advised that where they currently have a permanent resource teacher and where they have adequate hours to warrant the continuation of a full-time post through a combination of general allocation hours and-or low incidence hours and-or transitional hours for the coming school year, they may retain the existing teacher for the school year without the status of the teacher having to change.</p>
            <p eId="para_2774">Ultimately, where a school is due to lose a resource teaching post and where the teacher filling this post has restricted recognition, this teacher is entitled to special education panel rights. They are then eligible to fill any special education teaching post that may arise in special schools or in special classes attached to mainstream primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2775">My Department is currently finalising a circular for schools which will contain detailed information on how the new system will operate.

            <p eId="para_2777">My Department is fully aware of the need to provide a solution to the long-term accommodation needs of the school referred to by the Deputy and is actively considering two options.</p>
            <p eId="para_2778">The first option is the provision of a new school on a greenfield site. The property management section of the Office for Public Works, which acts on behalf of my Department in site acquisitions generally, has identified a site which could provide for the long-term accommodation requirements of the school. Negotiations on this site are ongoing between the OPW and the vendor.</p>
            <p eId="para_2779">Officials in the school planning section of my Department are also looking at another option which could offer a better value for money solution for the school's long-term accommodation needs. This option is being investigated by way of an overall review of primary educational infrastructure in the area in question, the likely demand for primary school places in the medium to long term, and how existing provision can be maximised to cater for this demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_2780">As part of this review my officials are in ongoing discussions with the boards of management of the Larkhill schools on the possibility of an amalgamation. The Deputy will appreciate that an amalgamation is a sensitive issue for those concerned. It would not, therefore, be helpful to develop plans to accommodate an unconnected school in premises owned by those involved in the amalgamation process. This matter can only be advanced when the amalgamation discussions have been completed and a decision has been taken by the boards of management concerned to actually effect an amalgamation.</p>

Under the Education Act 1998, An Comhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta was established in March 2002. One of the main objectives of the chomhairle is the planning and co-ordination of the provision of textbooks and teaching materials in Irish. This objective is reflected in the chomhairle's strategic plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2783">In 2005 my Department allocated to the chomhairle €725,000, of which €300,000 is specifically for the provision of textbooks.

            <p eId="para_2798">My Department has provided annual funding of €63,500 to the Dyslexia Association of Ireland since 1999. This funding has helped the association to operate an information service for members and the public. Part of this funding has assisted in meeting the costs associated with the attendance of some children from disadvantaged backgrounds at workshops and programmes organised by the association.</p>
            <p eId="para_2799">My Department has received representations from certain branches of the Dyslexia Association of Ireland expressing concern at the costs of running the workshops. My Department is in communication with the association at central level for its funding requirements. My Department has developed an information resource pack on dyslexia on CD-ROM, DVD and video format, in association with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland. This product has now been made available to all primary and post-primary schools. The DVD and video will provide support for parents of pupils with dyslexia while the CD-ROM will assist teachers who are teaching children with dyslexia in the mainstream classroom. These new materials will help and support parents and teachers to understand and respond to the educational needs of children with dyslexia.</p>
            <p eId="para_2800">Provision of resources to address the learning difficulties of children with low levels of achievement in reading has been given a very high priority by my Department. Last month, I announced that 660 additional special needs teaching posts will be put in place in primary schools from next September to cater for the needs of pupils with high incidence special needs, including pupils with dyslexia. Every primary school will be allocated resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures to cater for this pupil cohort.</p>
            <p eId="para_2801">One in five of the teachers in primary schools is allocated for the support of children with special educational needs. My Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist pupils with special educational needs, including pupils with dyslexia, with their education where such equipment is recommended by relevant professionals. Schools can apply to the local special educational needs organiser directly for this support. Training is available through the 21 teacher education centres nationally for teachers using ICT and assisting technologies to support pupils with special educational needs, including those with dyslexia.</p>
            <p eId="para_2802">At second level, each school in the free education scheme or block grant scheme with an enrolment of fewer than 600 recognised pupils, excluding pupils on post-leaving certificate programmes, receives an allocation of 0.5 of a learning support post. Schools with an enrolment of 600 such pupils and more receive a full learning support post. The Department also allocates resource teacher posts and special needs assistant posts to second level schools and vocational education committees to cater for pupils with special needs, including pupils with dyslexia.</p>
            <p eId="para_2803">There are a total of 528 remedial-learning support teachers, 620 guidance posts and 1,388 whole-time equivalent resource teachers in place. Additional special support services are being made available on an ongoing basis in response to identified needs. A further 100 posts will be allocated for guidance from the commencement of the 2005-06 school year. Second level pupils with specific learning disability are normally integrated into mainstream classes. In such situations, they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teacher. Depending on the degree of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations.</p>

        the action she has taken to date on foot of her assessment of the needs of pupils with dyslexia; and the recommendations which remain to be implemented.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_2805">The report of the task force on dyslexia contains over 60 individual recommendations ranging across a wide variety of issues from identification and assessment, to models of service delivery, specialist training for service providers, to issues relating to structural reforms and the maintenance of a database of pupils with specific learning difficulties, including dyslexia, who are in receipt of special education services in primary and post-primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_2806">Since the task force reported, several initiatives have been taken in the area of dyslexia. These include: the introduction of the first ever on-line training course for teachers catering for pupils with dyslexia; the appointment of ten new learning support trainers to the primary curriculum support programme, specifically to provide in-depth support for the implementation of learning support guidelines for children with dyslexia; a reduction from 11:1 to 9:1 in the pupil-teacher ratio applicable to special classes catering for pupils with dyslexia; the development, in association with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland, of an information resource on dyslexia to be made available in CD-ROM, DVD and video format.</p>
            <p eId="para_2807">In addition to the above measures, a key focus of my Department has been on advancing the fundamental structural and legislative measures, which are necessary to underpin the development and delivery of services for persons with special needs, including children with dyslexia.</p>
            <p eId="para_2808">A key development on the structural front has been the Government's decision to approve the establishment of the National Council for Special Education. The National Council for Special Education, which became operational on 1 January 2005, now processes applications for special educational needs supports. The council has a key role in the development and delivery of services for persons with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia. It will have a research and advisory role and will establish expert groups to consider specific areas of special needs provision. It will also establish a consultative forum to facilitate inputs from the education partners and other interested parties. The council has a local area presence through a network of 71 special educational needs organisers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2809">On the legislative front, the Oireachtas has approved the Education for Persons with Special Needs Act 2004. This act sets out the rights and entitlements of persons with special educational needs, including dyslexia, to an appropriate education service and provides the necessary framework for effective service delivery.</p>
            <p eId="para_2810">My Department also provides funding to schools for the purchase of specialised equipment such as computers to assist children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia, with their education where such equipment is recommended by relevant professionals. Schools can apply to the local special educational needs organiser directly for this support. Training is available through the 21 teacher education centres nationally for teachers using ICT and assisting technologies to support pupils with special educational needs, including those with dyslexia.</p>
            <p eId="para_2811">The provision of resources to address the learning difficulties of children with low levels of achievement in reading has been given a very high priority by my Department. Last month, I announced that 660 additional special needs teaching posts will be put in place in primary schools from next September to cater for the needs of pupils with high incidence special needs, including pupils with dyslexia. Every primary school will be allocated resource teaching hours, based on their enrolment figures to cater for this pupil cohort.</p>
            <p eId="para_2812">One in five of the teachers in primary schools is allocated for the support of children with special educational needs including those with dyslexia. Where the condition of a pupil with dyslexia is of a more serious nature, provision can be made in one of the four special schools or 23 special classes attached to ordinary primary schools and dedicated to the needs of children with dyslexia. All special schools and special classes for such children operate at a reduced pupil-teacher ratio of 9:1.</p>
            <p eId="para_2813">At second level, each school in the free education scheme or block grant scheme with an enrolment of fewer than 600 recognised pupils, excluding pupils on post-leaving certificate programmes, receives an allocation of 0.5 of a learning support post. Schools with an enrolment of 600 such pupils and more receive a full learning support post. The Department also allocates resource teacher posts and special needs assistant posts to second level schools and vocational education committees to cater for pupils with special needs, including pupils with dyslexia.</p>
            <p eId="para_2814">There are a total of 528 remedial-learning support teachers, 620 guidance posts and 1,388 whole-time equivalent resource teachers in place. Additional special support services are being made available on an ongoing basis in response to identified needs. A further 100 posts will be allocated for guidance from the commencement of the 2005-06 school year. Second level pupils with specific learning disability are normally integrated into mainstream classes. In such situations, they may receive additional tutorial support through the remedial teacher, guidance counsellor and subject teacher. Depending on the degree of the condition, they may also be eligible for special arrangements in the certificate examinations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2815">In September 2003, my Department established the special education support service to manage, co-ordinate and develop a range of supports in response to identified training needs. The special education support service, which is hosted in County Laois Education Centre, provides a nationwide service to teachers and special needs assistants. As part of its response to the growing demand from teachers for support and training, the special education support service is developing teams of trainers to deliver training in four specific areas, autism, challenging behaviour, dyslexia and inclusion. This training will be delivered locally through the education centre network.</p>
            <p eId="para_2816">My Department is continuing to prioritise the development of the network of special educational provision for children with special educational needs, including children with dyslexia and I believe that the steps taken in recent years and those in hand represent significant progress in the development of those services.</p>

While the transposition deadline for this directive is 4 January 2006, the option of a longer period, up to 4 January 2009, is provided for the implementation of more complex provisions regarding mandatory energy performance rating or labelling of newly constructed buildings and of existing buildings, when existing buildings are sold or let; improvement of the energy efficiency of boilers; and mandatory inspection of air conditioning systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_2869">Where the longer transitional period is applied, compliance with the above provisions would be required only from the later date of implementation of the directive. The draft action plan for the implementation of the EU energy performance of buildings directive in Ireland was published on 27 April 2005, for public and industry comment, by Sustainable Energy Ireland on behalf of an interdepartmental working group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and Sustainable Energy Ireland. The draft action plan proposes the phased implementation of the directive during 2006 to 2009. The three month period for submission of comments to Sustainable Energy Ireland on the draft action plan ends on 29 July 2005. A copy of the draft action plan has been placed in the Oireachtas Library.</p>

            <p eId="para_2881">The area in question is located near the Carrigower river, a tributary of the River Slaney, and is within the Slaney river valley candidate special areas of conservation. My Department is in the process of implementing a revised approach to inclusion of marginal areas along river banks in candidates for special area of conservation. In general terms, the boundaries of river for candidate special areas of conservation are being reduced to a distance of 2.5 M from the river bank. Lands beyond the 2.5 M limit will continue to be included if the area constitutes a floodplain of the river or contains valuable wildlife habitat such as woods or wetlands.</p>
            <p eId="para_2882">In the case in question, in November 2004, an application for a boundary revision on scientific grounds was submitted by an ecological consultancy on behalf of the landowner. Following inspection of the site by my Department it was decided to make an adjustment to the boundary of the candidate special areas of conservation in line with the revised national approach to such designations as outlined above.</p>
            <p eId="para_2883">My Department has been consulted by the Environmental Protection Agency for a waste licence application covering <i>inter alia</i> part of the land now to be excluded from designation as a candidate special areas of conservation. In response, my Department has indicated that it opposes the granting of this licence on grounds of adverse impact on the candidate special areas of conservation.</p>
