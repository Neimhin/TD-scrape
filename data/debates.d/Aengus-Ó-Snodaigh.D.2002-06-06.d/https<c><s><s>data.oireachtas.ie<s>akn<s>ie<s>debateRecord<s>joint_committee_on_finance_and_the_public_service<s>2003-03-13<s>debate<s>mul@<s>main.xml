          <p eId="para_15">I extend the sincere condolences of the joint committee to Deputy McGuinness whose father died last week. I also extend its condolences to the Vice-Chairman, Deputy Finneran, whose mother died last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">Before we commence the meeting we should have a brief discussion on the format. We have invited the high level review group to come before the committee. Its members will make a short presentation which will be followed by questions and answers. We should move on to the Information Commissioner at 12 midday and it might be possible to conclude before lunch. If not, we will take a break from 1 p.m. to 2 p.m. After lunch we will meet members of the NUJ, National Newspapers of Ireland, the Irish Council for Civil Liberties and Dr. Maeve McDonagh, in that order. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>

          <p eId="para_17">That is sensible. It would be useful when asking questions of the high level group to group topics together in order that we would not be moving from one subject to an entirely different one. We should follow a group of topics based on the contents page and deal sequentially with the different themes.</p>

          <from>Deputy Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_18">I agree. Opposition Deputies on the committee have broadly agreed, as far as possible, to keep their questions and contributions short in the initial stages in order to allow our distinguished visitors the maximum amount of time to speak. We should concentrate on a series of broad themes such as the terms of reference of the high level group, its methodology and whom it consulted about its methodology and the consultation process. If possible, it would be useful to get a response from its members in relation to the discussion in the report on collective responsibility to Parliament.</p>

          <p eId="para_19">I ask members to keep their questions and contributions brief in order that we can obtain the maximum amount of information. At the end of today's meeting we might decide to reconvene next week with a view to producing a report, if that is possible. That would depend on whether there was a level of consensus on some issues; there might be none on others. It would be beneficial from the committee's point of view, with regard to issues on which it could achieve cross-party consensus, to produce a draft report which it could consider next week. We could have it finalised before the legislation is dealt with in the Dáil in two weeks.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">If in the course of today's discussions we identify any other party who could contribute significantly to the work of the committee, we might make time to hear them when we meet next week. That might also apply to some of the parties the committee is meeting today should they, due to pressure of time, be unable to make an adequate presentation.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcCarthy" eId="spk_12">
          <from>Mr. Dermot McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_28">I thank the joint committee for inviting my colleagues and me to this meeting to outline our recommendations arising from the Government decision of 25 June 2002 to ask us to consider the operation of the Freedom of Information Act 1997. As chairman of the group, I accept the invitation to make the opening statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">Members of the committee will be aware that there are certain constraints on what we may say here today. In particular, it would not be appropriate for us to question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy. This is of particular importance in that a Bill is before the Seanad which reflects the Government's position on the issues of concern to the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">We were asked by the Government in June 2002 to make recommendations in a particular context. Under the present legislation, records of Cabinet will become eligible for release from April next, as they reach the five year threshold. Towards the middle of last year consideration had to be given to how that process should be organised and, in that context, the question of the appropriateness of the five year exemption arose. The Government decided to ask us to examine and advise it on this and related matters. There was already in the public domain a report by the Information Commissioner on compliance by public bodies which raised particular issues in relation to the protection of Cabinet records under section 19 of the Act and deliberations of public bodies under section 20. Our terms of reference required us to have regard to the commissioner's report and the reports of departmental and interdepartmental reviews of the operation of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">The spirit in which we approached our task was the same as that implicit in the present FOI legislation, namely, to strike the appropriate balance between maintaining the integrity of the Cabinet and the underlying deliberative process and ensuring the maximum level of openness and transparency in the public interest. In this overall context, the group was asked to consider from its perspective issues in relation to how exemptions provided for in the Act had been applied, the extent to which the public interest had been served in practice by the operation and provisions of the Act and the appropriate balance between promoting transparency in the decision making process and preserving the effectiveness of the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_32">We met formally three times over the period of the review. We were supported in our task by a joint secretariat provided by the central policy unit in the Department of Finance and the Government's secretariat within my Department. There was ongoing liaison with the joint secretariat in the preparation of the report between the meetings of the group. Its third meeting on 27 November was for the purpose of agreeing and signing off on the report to Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">A question has arisen, which I wish to address, about the level of consultation we undertook in making our recommendations. I wish to put this in context. It is a well established, if not very frequent, practice for the Cabinet to ask officials to assist it with consideration of particular matters. The role of our group was to offer our advice as an input to the Cabinet decision making process. We were not asked to, nor was it expected that we should, engage in a public consultation process. Our advice was sought in a context where the views of the Information Commissioner on certain issues and those of other interested parties were in the public domain.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">In relation to the matters at issue in this instance, Secretaries General of Departments work closely with ministerial heads of Departments. They have extensive knowledge and experience of the functioning of the deliberative and Cabinet process. They are in a position to form views and make assessments based on that knowledge and experience, as well as the publicly stated views and judgments of others.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">As I mentioned, we were also supported in our work by the central policy unit in the Department of Finance. The views of those with an active interest in freedom of information such as academics, journalists and frequent users of the legislation are channelled to the unit on an ongoing basis, including, for example, through conferences hosted and attended by it.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">We prepared our report as advice for Ministers. Its publication by the Government was intended to inform the debate on its legislative proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">Before addressing individual recommendations I would like to make one point very strongly. There have been suggestions that our purpose was to protect Civil Service advice from public scrutiny. We emphatically reject this. In fact, considerations of this kind never arose in our discussions or deliberations. It is fair to say all of us, civil servants, Ministers and Members of the Oireachtas, have had the experience of seeing records published which have caused some degree of discomfort, even embarrassment. We have learned to live with this, however, and recognise that personal discomfort is not relevant in any consideration of the FOI framework. The five years of operation of the Act have moved us well beyond this and we accept this possibility as part and parcel of the climate of openness in which we operate. In this regard, I strongly agree with the views of the late Tom Barrington when he said, "It says little for one's professional confidence if being the holder of a secure job one is afraid that one's honest advice should become public knowledge."</p>
          <p eId="para_38">The right to access information serves the public interest in a unique way. Making government open and accountable is in everyone's interest. Together with the strategic management initiative, with its emphasis on the public recording of departmental objectives and results and a clear focus on customer service, with the enhanced role of Oireachtas committees, underpinned by compellability legislation, and with a much more extensive media scrutiny of public affairs, the Freedom of Information Act has helped to modernise and improve public administration. We accept and are fully committed to this regardless of what sceptics might say but we are also part of the framework of government and concerned with ensuring the decision making process works effectively and efficiently. This is also vital in the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">The Government's main purpose in establishing the review group was to consider the effect of the Freedom of Information Act on the Cabinet process. Accordingly, we devoted most of our consideration to this area. Much of our concern derived from the nature of government and the exercise of collective responsibility. Collective responsibility, a defining characteristic of the Government under the Constitution, has implications which were well described by W. T. Cosgrave who stated:</p>
          <p eId="para_40">When Government arrives at a decision to do or abstain from doing any particular act, the decision is the decision of all its members. Previous divergence of views, individual opinion, arguments pro or con, all become merged in the decision that becomes not the decision of a majority, but the decision of all, binding every member of the Government equally, whatever may have been his previous attitude.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">In the words of the all-party Oireachtas committee on the Constitution: "Cabinet confidentiality supports the unanimity principle . . . and is a feature of European cabinet government". In its 1995 report the Constitution review group highlighted the importance of Cabinet confidentiality and noted that such confidentiality is an almost universal feature of government and the essential underpinning for the doctrine of collective responsibility enshrined in Article 28.4.2. Collective responsibility is, in turn, essential to a Government's ability to plan and act cohesively. The possibility that Cabinet confidentiality might in some circumstances be lifted could in itself, obviously, inhibit discussion and therefore the effectiveness of Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">That was the context in which we considered, in particular, the period of exemption for Cabinet records. A key recommendation of the group was for the period of exemption for Cabinet related records to be extended to ten years. I stress, however, that we were not breaking new ground in our approach to this issue as section 19 of the Act already carried a legislative recognition that a period of protection for Cabinet records was necessary. We looked at practice in other jurisdictions. Internationally, Cabinet records are either excluded in their entirety from FOI legislation or have exemptions of up to 20 years. In some cases this period is as high as 30 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">I wish to outline some specific examples that we considered. In Australia freedom of information legislation operates mainly at state level where limits of between ten and 30 years apply. In New Zealand there is no time limit for the exemption of records that protect collective ministerial responsibility. In Canada there is a broad exemption for 20 years applying to records relating to Cabinet confidences, although we noted that a recent review recommended a reduction in the period of exemption to 15 years. While the UK freedom of information system has not yet come into operation, it is intended that a broad exemption, with no time limit, will apply to any records likely to prejudice the maintenance of collective ministerial responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">Against this background the group considered whether the release of information related to the Cabinet process after only five years could potentially have a detrimental effect on the operation of the process. We felt strongly that the process of collective Cabinet decision-making and with it effective government could be seriously impaired if Cabinet records were released after such a relatively short period of time. We came to this conclusion having regard to two principal factors: first, that most Ministers could still be active in politics in a five year framework; and, second, that members of the Government enjoy virtually absolute confidentiality in respect of discussions at Government. We believe such early release of those records would be likely to have either of two consequences. It would have the effect in many cases of Ministers making their views on policy issues known only at the Cabinet table. This would run counter to the public interest and the effective operation of collective responsibility by weakening prior consultation between Ministers and the careful assessment of their views through the process of circulation of draft memoranda for the Government. This would seriously undermine the process of forging the maximum consensus in advance of matters coming to Cabinet, change the focus and strategic direction of discussion at Cabinet, and produce a form of decision-making more verbal in nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">An illustration of this possible outcome is provided by looking at how Cabinet deliberations are conducted in Sweden, a country which has a constitutional principle dating back to 1766 that anyone has the right to ask any public authority to show any public document kept in its files. As noted by the all-party committee on the Constitution in its recent eighth progress report, Cabinet decisions in Sweden are kept in two series: series A is open to the public, although appendices may be classified, while series B is secret. In practice, the vast majority of Cabinet decisions are accessible. However, no minutes are kept of Cabinet discussion, there are no Government memoranda as we know them, and what is placed before Cabinet is an agreed decision. Accordingly, a Cabinet document will never contain any indication of the different views of Ministers. The report notes:</p>
          <p eId="para_46">It is the practice of Ministers who are not otherwise engaged, to meet daily for lunch in the prime minister's dining room. In practice, much of the consultation between Ministers takes place in this forum. No record is kept of those lunch-time discussions.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">In other instances, we considered that it would tend to encourage more writing for the record by Ministers on issues where they may wish to present a particular position on the public record when the common good would require a different collective decision. Both of these possibilities would be clearly detrimental to the process of good government and tend to weaken the cohesion required for collective responsibility and its effectiveness in practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">Turning to the question of discretion in section 19 of the Act, the Information Commissioner in his July 2001 Report on Compliance by Public Bodies with the provisions of the FOI Act highlighted, in particular, the operation of the exemptions provided by that section of the Act. He was concerned that what he felt was a discretionary exemption for Cabinet records was being applied as a mandatory exemption in practice. The group believes the policy underlying this section of the Act is that as a general rule Cabinet records should be exempt from release for a specified period of time. The commissioner was right in drawing attention to the uncertainty around how a discretion of this kind might be exercised. However, the group was of the view that the articulation of guidelines relating to the exercise of this discretion would not resolve the problem. We believe any widespread exercise of a discretion by key decision makers to release Cabinet records would not be compatible with the overall purpose of this class of exemption provided for in the Act. Furthermore, it would weaken the confidence of Ministers that views given freely by them in Cabinet records would be protected for a specified period of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">In regard to incidental records, due to a question of interpretaton, we also recommended that section 19 of the Act be amended to ensure there was protection for records created for use at a meeting of the Government, even if they were incidentally used for other purposes. We do not believe this recommendation fundamentally alters the existing provision. The original purpose for which a record was created remains the key determinant of its FOI status. In our view, a record for use at Cabinet should not lose its protected status just because it might be used subsequently for some incidental purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_50">We furnished our advice to Government on the basis that it was ultimately in the public interest to have a well functioning Cabinet process which allowed Ministers the freedom to carry out their constitutional function as members of the Government. It was against this background that the group considered whether communications between Ministers in support of collective responsiblity warranted protection. There are circumstances where Ministers communicate with each other to try to resolve an issue already on the Cabinet agenda or on the point of submission to Cabinet. Again, the process of forging consensus around proposals to Government is an important part of the Cabinet process which needs to be encouraged and supported.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">Internationally, the need for space in the exchange of views between Ministers is well recognised. Communications between Ministers in matters relating to the making of Government decisions or the formulation of Government policy are excluded from the scope of many freedom of information regimes. In the proposed FOI regime in the United Kingdom there is specific recognition of the role of inter-ministerial communications in the exercise of collective responsibility. In Canada communications between Ministers on matters relating to the making of Government decisions or the formulation of Government policy are exempt from release. In New Zealand an exemption with a public interest test may be invoked to protect the confidentiality of advice tendered by Ministers and officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_52">Having considered this matter we concluded that communications between Ministers in their capacity as members of Cabinet merited protection. We saw the need to circumscribe the grounds on which that exemption might apply. The group's recommendation links the protection of such records to matters on the Government agenda or on which a submission to Cabinet is imminent.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">It is for similar reasons that we recommended protection of records of working groups set up in direct support of Cabinet. I make it clear that we saw this applying in a very limited way and that it would not apply to the vast majority of working groups set up for many different purposes. The kind of group which we had in mind was one which worked as an extension of Cabinet helping it to tease out issues which were already on its agenda. It would be a once-off exercise, rather than a standing or continuing group, and would cease to exist once the issues in question had been decided by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">While a report prepared by such a group for submission to Government would be protected under existing FOI provisions, its minutes and other records would not. We felt there were special circumstances which warranted protecting records in those circumstances so closely linked to a critical stage of the Cabinet process on the grounds that they would involve articulation of the personal views of Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">With regard to factual information, our recommendations were influenced by the experience of the Cabinet secretariat which regularly receives requests for clarification about what constitutes factual information as currently defined in the Act. The group felt it helpful to clarify the definition of factual information so as to provide a clearer context in which FOI key decision makers could release what was clearly established as factual information in support of the decision making process.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">The group had become aware of concerns among colleagues and Ministers that the prospect of early release of records might inhibit the frank articulation of views to the detriment of the deliberative process. We considered but decided against making any recommendation for a period of time to be allowed after the deliberative process was completed before such records would be released.</p>
          <p eId="para_57">The Act currently provides for a presumption of release unless the prospect of harm to the deliberative process can be satisfactorily shown. Very often it is not possible to establish in terms which are sufficiently certain what future impact the release of particular records may have on the deliberative process. This frequently requires a fine judgment call which would be well below the threshold of proof that the current section 20 requires. The group felt a more balanced public interest test was appropriate in line with that used in other sections of the Act while still retaining the underlying principle that the mere fact of an ongoing process should not be a barrier to release. As has been acknowledged by the Information Commissioner on a number of occasions, the public interest is not specifically defined in the Freedom of Information Act and is far from being an easy concept to define.</p>
          <p eId="para_58">With regard to fees, I mention the recommendation for the introduction of an up-front fee. The intention was to encourage responsible use of the Act and better reflect the cost to public bodies of freedom of information. The Act already requires fees for the cost of searching and retrieving records and photocopying. In practice, however, such fees are often not charged due, it seems, to the additional burden of work imposed by the relevant provisions. Up-front fees are a feature of FOI legislation in other jurisdictions. In Australia an up-front fee of Australian &amp;dollar;30 must accompany an FOI request with further fees for various other parts of the process. There are also additional charges for internal review and external review to the equivalent of the Information Commissioner. In Canada there is a nominal application fee of Canadian &amp;dollar;5 with further charges applying at other parts of the process. The group felt fees should not apply to personal information, that they should be set at a level not to discourage the making of requests and that there should be provision for appropriate waivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_59">I highlight that our review also recommended significant expansions in coverage of the operation of the Freedom of Information Act. We were of the view that the progress that had been made in promoting a culture of openness and transparency in decision-making and in the way government works should be maintained. There are now nearly 400 public bodies covered by the Act ranging across Departments, Government agencies, regional and local authorities, educational institutions, health boards, hospitals, voluntary organisations and third level colleges. We wished to see this momentum maintained. Accordingly, we recommended that early progress be made in a significant programme of extensions of operation of the Act and that partial exclusions of public bodies' functions from freedom of information should only be permitted in the most exceptional cases. We also highlighted training in implementing freedom of information in an effective and consistent way as a key factor in rolling out the benefits of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_60">I hope our outline of how the group arrived at its recommendations will be of assistance to the committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">I wish to address the issue of consultation in respect of which the Secretary General said, "We were not asked to, nor was it expected that we should, engage in a public consultation process." Did the group receive a direction orally, verbally or in writing to the effect that there should not be consultations with any other groups? In that context, from a statutory point of view, did it consider that under section 36 the Information Commissioner was charged with responsibility for a review of the Act? It appears from infromation that has since come into the public domain that he was surprised to discover that consideration was so far advanced and that he had not been consulted. That is one issue. Why did the group not undertake such consultations?</p>
          <p eId="para_66">Who exactly initiated the review? Who brought the original memo to Government and was there a Government decision in relation to it? What was the thinking in this regard?</p>
          <p eId="para_67">In relation to the review which the group conducted, its terms of reference were to include reviewing the extent to which the public interest had been served by the Act. It seems that this issue has not been addressed in the report. Mr. McCarthy indicated that the context was imminent disclosure but it seems that the failure to address that issue represents a significant gap which leads me to my fourth question. He indicated correctly that the spirit in which he approached the task was to strike the appropriate balance between maintaining the integrity of the Cabinet and the maximum level of openness. How exactly were the benefits of the public's right to information weighed against the other arguments advanced against not letting the public know? I see no reference to the advantages deriving from early disclosure of information regarding Cabinet procedures on important decisions. Therefore, how was this balancing job done? How come the report only reflects one side of the argument?</p>
          <p eId="para_68">It appears that the report endorses a rake of amendments, apparently advanced by the Department of Finance, but there seems to be no evaluation of them. What are the amendments and how did the group come to endorse them without apparently weighing their merits? Did it believe they had already been accepted by the Information Commissioner? What was their status that they received an endorsement of this nature with no apparent assessment?</p>

          <p eId="para_69">On the scope of our brief, there was a clear expectation on the part of the Government that the report we submitted would be based on our own assessment and experience. We were required explicitly to take account of the report on compliance by the Information Commissioner and the reviews of the Act by the various networks, as well as the work of the central policy unit but it was an explicit expectation the report would be based on our reflections and deliberations.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_71">There was no explicit instruction not to consult. There was a clear requirement that the report would be based on our own experience, assessment and advice, as is routine when Ministers seek the opinion of their officials. The question of public consultation was not part of the exercise as constituted in the terms of reference. Regarding the context in which it arose, there was a Government decision establishing the group and its terms of reference.</p>
          <p eId="para_72">In terms of the consideration of the public interest in the operation of the Act as a whole, the group made it clear that we regarded the operation of the Act to date as being in the public interest. There is a strong endorsement of the legislation as having played an important role in "promoting openness, transparency and accountability in government". As I said, we recommended the vigorous progression of coverage of the Act to public bodies and the narrowing of exemptions. We also endorsed the importance of committing appropriate resources to training.</p>
          <p eId="para_73">The clear stance of the report is support for the operation of the Act. We furnished recommendations on exemptions in a very particular context regarding the exercise of collective responsibility by the Government. The question of the public interest in that was the basis on which the recommendations were framed, having regard to our experience and international practice and experience. We were influenced significantly in this by the constitutional status of collective responsibility - that it is not public interest on a level with any other public interest but explicitly required to be maintained——</p>

          <p eId="para_76">Regarding the other amendments to which we referred in the report, the Deputy is right in saying we did not evaluate them in any rigorous sense. We were aware of them and reviewed their nature. We merely recommended that the opportunity be taken to bring forward recommendations which would enhance the operation of the Act having regard to the experience of users. While we instanced the type of amendment which would be involved, we were not evaluating or specifically recommending any amendment under that heading.</p>

Would it not be reasonable that a high level group such as Mr. McCarthy's would seek to identify the benefits and problems of the Act and consultation? For instance, as I understand it, the consultative group established by the Department of Finance has not met in recent times, although the Information Commissioner has presented papers from time to time.

          <p eId="para_90">Mr. McCarthy, before I call Deputy Conor Lenihan, in your letter of 11 March to the committee you state your recommendations were prepared, as advised by the Government, as a contribution to its deliberations and your group was established to assist the Government in its consideration of the Act. To your knowledge, besides the Government, what other groups or individuals, if any, were involved in the process? Given that you acknowledge your role was to make a contribution, it is clear there may have been other contributions from other sources. What other sources would have been involved in the decision besides members of the Cabinet and your group?</p>

This was done in the normal manner. Once our group finished its work, we were not collectively involved in the process of formulating the legislative proposals. This would have been primarily a matter for the sponsoring Minister, in this case the Minister for Finance.</p>

          <p eId="para_95">There was no formal process of consultation in the sense we discussed earlier. The same considerations set out by Mr. McCarthy in relation to the considerations of the high level group also applied with regard to the legislation. At that stage decisions had been taken by the Government in relation to the legislation and its contents. There were a number of proposals and issues which the central policy unit in the Department of Finance had been considering and these were highlighted in the report and later adopted. There was no wider consultation on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">I have a specific question for Mr. Sullivan. The report prepared by Mr. McCarthy indicates that his group considered collective Cabinet responsibility in depth. On the other hand, from a reading of the report, the definition of the Government and Cabinet in the Bill appears to have been significantly broadened and the concept of working groups has been extended to include people who are not civil servants or may be temporary advisers to Government. It even covers "others".</p>
          <p eId="para_97">Mr. Sullivan is saying that when the Bill was drafted in the Department of Finance, the report of the high level group provided an input into the workings of the Minister for Finance and his Department. Given that the Bill provides for a substantial expansion in the terms of the Act, which extends beyond the input of the high level group, was other advice sought in relation to expanding the terms of the Act, particularly with regard to the broader definition apparent in sections 19 and 20? Did the group or the Department seek advice on this? This is, I understand, the thrust of the Chairman's question.</p>

Forgive me for repeating myself but the best way I can respond is to say the proposals prepared by Government are those represented in the Bill before the Oireachtas.

My understanding is that the group has not met for a number of years. Given the deep thought that was put into the review process, I am at a loss to understand the reason it would not have been commissioned to meet to get the benefit of its insights when it came back to the Department. Even at this late stage, would the Department object to it meeting and some time being given to allow its members give their advice and views? Would that be a problem?

I understand it did meet with reasonable frequency in the early years of the FOI legislation and that a number of difficulties arose with interpretation at the time. However, I understand the Act has settled down and there has not been a call for a meeting of the group since. In relation to future meetings, while I do not know the detail, I do not see any reason there could not be meetings going forward, if necessary.</p>

Mr. McCarthy is the most senior civil servant in the State. In his experience, how many times does the Government initiate high level groups and is it his understanding that there is no reason a high level group should be involved in wider consultation at a middle or lower level? Is that not the implication of the words "high level group"? Short of putting an advertisement in the newspaper, I suspect that high level groups are not meant to do this but I am not trying to put words in Mr. McCarthy's mouth.</p>

Because of the suspicion people attach to a group like Mr. McCarthy's, being so high level and involved on a daily basis with Ministers, the view is that it is in an almost semi-collusive relationship and that it has no real independence, in the true sense of the word. That perception has been articulated in the House in terms of Mr. McCarthy's role in this specific matter. At what level were these concerns among colleagues, Ministers and perhaps even the Taoiseach articulated to Mr. McCarthy? Were they made known informally in the normal course of work as a group or as individuals or were they articulated in any formal sense? Did they take him aside and say they have an issue with a particular investigation?</p>

          <p eId="para_123">It was very much in the informal context that we were aware of some views of that kind, both on the part of Ministers and colleagues. Some have been voiced in public commentary by those who have considered the impact of certain issues arising from the operation of the Act. It was a hypothesis that we considered that the quality of written advice might have suffered as a result of the disclosure of material under the FOI legislation. Our conclusion was that, on the whole, this was not sustained. We noted, for example, that the Information Commissioner, in his report on compliance, had not found evidence of a deterioration in the written record. We also noted that the pattern of written communication had changed for other reasons, not just in public service terms. For example, a recent survey which we commissioned of customers of the Civil Service showed that the incidence of written communication with Departments had declined substantially in recent years. Therefore, face to face or telephone based communication is much more the norm in all walks of life. We have also tried to streamline decision making processes within Departments in order that papers do not need to migrate through different layers of the system, which would have required more written communication perhaps than in the past. On balance, we came to the conclusion that there was no clear evidence that the quality of advice in written form had suffered and certainly not suffered to such an extent as to outweigh the clear and obvious merits of having the FOI regime operate.</p>

          <from>Deputy Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_124">I want to return to the review mechanism of the Freedom of Information Act. The Act specifically mentions the role of the Information Commissioner in initiating a review under his or her own cognisance. It makes no reference to time mechanisms nor is there reference to anyone asking him or her to undertake a review. The commissioner was not requested to carry out the process that is now taking place nor was it initiated by him. The legislation as it currently stands does not seem to allow for other review mechanisms. How has the process we are now engaged in come about? Why have people involved in the process not used the existing legislation for the basis of conducting that review? Was the membership of the high level group determined by the Government or by the Secretary General to the Government? What criteria were used in forming such a group? Was it based on personal and departmental experience of the Act?</p>
          <p eId="para_125">I am interested in the definition of the public interest as one of the criteria for the workings of the high level group. In the explanations I have heard to date there are competing public interests. The definition I have heard today is that of the public's interest in having effective Government <i>vis-à-vis </i>Cabinet confidentiality and collective decision-making. To what extent were other competing public interests examined by the high level group, in particular the public’s right to know about the process of how decisions are reached?</p>

          <from>Mr. McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_126">In relation to the first point, it is open to the Government to review any policy or any legislation at a time and in a manner of its own choosing. That is in addition to and separate from any other review mechanisms that might be provided by statute or otherwise. There was nothing to preclude Government from deciding to review any particular aspect of this legislation. As I mentioned earlier it was decided to do that within a particular context and with a particular focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">The composition of the group was determined by the Government, I assume on the basis that it represented a reasonable spread of experience and views. With regard to the public interest in ascertaining how decisions are arrived at, there is a public interest in that clearly, but the particular records that were the primary subject of our consideration were those relating to Cabinet and the deliberative process directly in support of the Cabinet process. Clearly the vast bulk of records, including records contributing to the formulation of policy by the Cabinet and records relating to the implementation, operation and effect of policies decided by Cabinet, continue to be available.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">We are also of course operating in the context where the Executive is held to account in a variety of ways. It is not solely dependent on the operation of the freedom of information regime. The primary form of account is of course to the Oireachtas. The public interest in accountability is not reliant solely on the terms of the legislation in respect of freedom of information. So we would have taken that into account in taking into account also the particular and specific constitutional protection, not just protection, but requirement of collective responsibility, and what flows from that in our judgment.</p>

          <p eId="para_143">Influence on the time frame for consultation was from the opposite direction. The nature of the exercise which we understood we were required to undertake indicated a relatively short time frame rather than the other way round.</p>
          <p eId="para_144">As regards the propriety of sounding out Ministers informally, that was in a particular context - whether there was a view that the quality of written official advice had deteriorated. We believed that in so far as people were not aware of the views of Ministers, it might be helpful to establish them informally. In the event we recommended against any change on the basis of deterioration in the quality of official advice. There were mixed views among Ministers on whether the quality and usefulness of policy advice had changed as a result of the Act.</p>

          <p eId="para_145">The Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003 currently before the Seanad and the subject of some controversy has emerged as a direct result of the report. Report Stage of the Bill was to be guillotined at 2 p.m. in the Seanad, although that will not happen now.</p>
          <p eId="para_146">Mr. McCarthy said it was not necessary or appropriate to consult colleagues in other Departments. That is fine because the group is from five key Departments. From the point of view of informing himself about the operation of the Act, was it not fundamental that at the first meeting the group would decide to meet the one person who would have a unique insight into the operation of the Act - the Information Commissioner? He is a former colleague with a long record of public service who has seen the situation from the inside and has been appointed as the arbiter between the citizen and the institutions of State on how the Act has been operating. The group still did not consult him. Why not? Not alone was this a gross omission, it was also a gross insult to someone who is a former colleague and has been statutorily vested according to sections 36 and 39 with the authority to keep the Act under review.</p>
          <p eId="para_147">The Information Commissioner felt compelled this week, as the legislation passed through Committee Stage at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, to issue the report, The Application and Operation of Certain Provisions of the Freedom of Information Act 1997. He has taken the key provisions of the Act and analysed their strengths and weaknesses in detail. I know Mr. McCarthy cannot comment on the Bill but the commissioner felt compelled to make a comment on selected suggested amendments. Why was it not decided at the first meeting of the group to call the one person who absolutely should be called to inform it properly, that person being a former colleague and the current Information Commissioner, Mr. Kevin Murphy?</p>

They are irrelevant, however, to the brief we were given, which was to formulate advice based on our own experience and views, taking account of the views in the public domain from the commissioner and others. It was not a matter of consulting. It was not for us to consult the commissioner or anyone else in formulating our report which was explicitly based on our advice as Secretaries General in relation to certain aspects of the operation of the Act in contemplation of the change which would apply to Cabinet records. It was not for us to decide against consulting him or to consult him.</p>

Listening to Mr. McCarthy it appears there was no rigorous evaluation, no root and branch approach to the review. Meetings with Ministers were informal and the Information Commissioner was excluded from the discussions. We are giving so much credibility to the report into how the Act is formulated but we get the impression the group did not expect to see itself in the eye of the storm. It was sitting around giving its opinions in an informal way for Ministers to discuss them. There was no detailed evaluation of the Act that was supposed to go forward. Am I misreading the situation?</p>

It was not for us to anticipate how it would proceed beyond the receipt of our report. It was not a comprehensive root and branch review of the Act. We were asked to focus on certain issues in the context of the approaching five year threshold in relation to Cabinet records, on which we primarily focussed. In that regard our reflection was rigorous and considered and the judgment we made in formulating our advice is one over which we are happy to stand.</p>
          <p eId="para_158">In terms of other issues and wider aspects of the operation of the Act, they were not aspects on which we were asked to comment. The question of the outcomes in terms of legislative proposals is for debate with others in a different context.</p>

It stretches the scope of subsequent application of the original Act. Did the witness expect there would be more consultation afterwards, before this would be used perhaps to bring forward amendments to the Freedom of Information Act? The report is certainly very detailed and makes many good recommendations but did those who prepared it expect there would be further consultation after they were finished with it?</p>

For example, the Department of Foreign Affairs is involved. It is my understanding that that Department is largely exempt from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, having regard to its role in international affairs and Northern Ireland matters.

I can also say the same in relation to the Information Commissioner. We need to be very careful as to our targets and what we are trying to achieve. We should recognise that there are Government decisions which are implemented by members of the high level group. It is a committee of civil servants of the Government, as opposed to the Information Commissioner, who is a civil servant of the State and who has a requirement to the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">It is important that we would see that the Government established a committee of its own high level people to report to it.

          <from>Senator O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_190">I am. I have been in the position many times of being on the other side of the table and having a different point of view from each of those people over there, and indeed the Information Commission, in another life, as an esteemed former senior civil servant. The kind of people to whom I refer are of the highest quality, and those who will walk into this room will be too. We need to be careful that we, as politicians, recognise the distinction regarding what we require of our civil servants as opposed to what we require from our politicians, and the Government is made up of politicians.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">It has also been my experience that in terms of people at this level the more they disagree with the position of Government, the closer they keep to their remit. That is a fact. They will give the Government exactly what is required of them, and no more.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The difficulties of course arise after this report. The question is what happens next. There was no consultation with us, a committee which has spent hours and weeks on this, over the past two years. There was no consultation with the users' group. There was no consultation with the Information Commissioner. Those are the things which should have been undertaken, not by this group but because of what happened after that. I want to know why none of those things happened at a later date.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">There are issues in their report with which I fundamentally disagree, but I would like to ask questions of the people who can answer them. For instance, how did we extend the definition of Government to what I consider to be well beyond the recommendations in the report before us? There are a number of other issues as well. There were decisions taken beyond this. People were given a viewpoint and that viewpoint came forward. I disagree with many aspects of it. I certainly disagree with the decision to get rid of the discretionary change from "may" to "shall". I disagree with that and I feel it is unhelpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">In terms of us moving it forward, however, there are two issues of importance. First, our agreement today in the Seanad that Report Stage will be deferred for at least another week is important because now, at least, consideration can be given to the views of the Information Commissioner in a real way, and also to the views of this committee. That is crucial.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">However, I do not believe that we will learn a whole lot more from the people in front of us. Their view will be that they have written it down, there it is, that is what they think. That report went back to Government, and therefore the real question is what happened with it after that. It then went to a sponsoring Department or Departments. At some stage after that, decisions were made not to talk to other people. Perhaps it was not such a decision, but no consultation took place beyond that. The question is about the unholy haste with moving it from that point onwards, which I feel is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">There is an issue as to what happened to the proposals of the Information Commissioner when they were sent to the Department of Finance, but this, I understand, is not the group to which I should direct that question. I want to know the answer to that question. I want to know about the debate that took place on every one of his recommendations and why they were ruled out or ignored, or the small number which it was decided would be implemented. Those are the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">I want to see the development of this legislation before it comes before the Oireachtas and I want to see the argument behind that. I can agree or disagree with the views of this group, and I disagree fundamentally with a number of them, but I do recognise, as was said by Deputy O'Malley, that this was one item of advice available to the Government in terms of what it did.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">What did the Government do next with the other advice it got from the Information Commissioner, the advice it could have had from the users' group and the advice which potentially was available from this committee, all of which did not have any bearing on it, and then with the pushing through? They are the questions which I really want to get involved in at the end of the day but I can assure the committee that we will not learn a great deal from these good people.</p>

We have gone down many culs-de-sac and looked at many small print issues this morning. How did the committee arrive at a period of ten years - moving from five to ten years - having looked at models in other democracies across the world, and looking at the most liberal one, which is New Zealand? In New Zealand, the Opposition forced the FOI Act through. The then Government was pushed out and became the Opposition, and it created the biggest nuisance it could for the crowd who put it in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">Twenty years has been the norm in some countries, and I think it is 30 years in Australia. This Bill is only dealing with one particular change, that is, protecting the right of Government to have confidentially for ten rather than five years.</p>

Therefore, at the end of that ten-year period, the previous ten-year period will encompass the coalition Government and a period where many Members served as Ministers. Why did they not look at a longer period? How did they arrive at a period of ten years, having looked at other models and having seen the difficulties they were having?</p>

We will now move on to the remaining issues, that is, the issues pertaining to the Government, the deliberative process and other measures. We will try to conclude with the delegation by lunchtime because we have other people lined up who we want to meet after lunch.

          <p eId="para_204">We did acknowledge in the report that any period of time is arbitrary. We felt that the question of the appropriate balance between access and protecting collective responsibility had to be struck at a level which was longer than five years. We felt ten years was reasonable on the basis that longer than that, even though it would be in line with international practices as the Deputy observed, would probably swing the balance a bit further away from the public interest in accessibility. We noted that our overall stance on the freedom of information regime is somewhat more liberal, in any event, than many other jurisdictions and in that spirit we thought ten years was a reasonable period. After ten years the sort of pressures which we were concerned about as inhibiting the exercise of collective responsibility, would be significantly reduced.</p>

          <p eId="para_205">There is much confusion in the public arena regarding what this revision of the Freedom of Information Act 1997 is about. For me, the heart of Government is the decisions which take place at the Cabinet meeting, where discussions enjoy absolute protection. The public and many people in the Oireachtas probably do not realise that Cabinet decisions and meetings enjoy absolute protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">To make Cabinet decisions in the interests of the Irish people, the best decisions have to be made at Cabinet. We are all here in the interests of the people. The maximum degree of agreement prior to submissions of a memorandum to Government should be agreed before the Cabinet meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">I understand government very well. The Secretary General should explain to those present - then let it go out into the public arena - how the disclosure of arguments and views in Cabinet papers are likely to lead to Ministers opting to convey those views at Cabinet where they get absolute protection, and how it will impede the efficiency of the Cabinet meeting.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">I do not think people understand that. I would like that said so the media could convey it. They are not stymieing. Nobody knows what goes on at Cabinet. That is not being released; but it is the memoranda. There needs to be ministerial discussion to get proper agreement before the Cabinet meeting. I am supportive of this legislation. I hope I have explained it to the committee properly because I am a bit nervous.</p>

          <p eId="para_211">In my opening statement I referred to issues such as the Senator has mentioned and our concern about the context of more or less absolute confidentiality of the discussion process at the Cabinet table, on the one hand, and, on the other, the impact of a relatively short period of five years in terms of disclosure. We were concerned that matters would only be resolved in Cabinet discussions and that this was not conducive to government of the best quality. The forging of consensus and the consideration of different views in advance of a proposition being put formally to Government would suffer.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">There is significant emphasis in the Cabinet handbook which seeks to operationalise the principles of collective responsibility on securing the maximum degree of consultation between Ministers and the careful consideration of conflicting points of view in the interests of shaping a considered outcome to be put to the Government which would seek to maximise consensus. We believed that process which in the interests of effectiveness is necessarily a written one could suffer if Ministers were reluctant to commit their views in writing and took advantage of the protection of oral discussion, as we understand is the practice in Sweden.</p>

          <p eId="para_213">I would like to ask the Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment what sort of material has been found that his Minister needs to suppress from Government memorandums although it should be there. Similarly, what evidence has the group adduced that Ministers have not been establishing the maximum degree of agreement prior to going to Cabinet? These provisions of five year disclosure have been in place since 1997. I am surprised that the group's conclusions state these matters are likely to lead to Ministers to convey their views during Cabinet discussions when they should have ample existing experience of this and evidence to adduce and cases to cite, although they may not be public ones. They should be able to say, "We have evidence that" rather than "It is likely that." What evidence does the Secretary General have of this breakdown in Cabinet collective responsibility?</p>
          <p eId="para_214">I am also interested in the view of the Secretary General of the Department of Transport. Is she surprised that this disclosure has so damaged Cabinet provisions? It has certainly not been my perception that Cabinet has been damaged by this in the way the group appears to have concluded. There seems to be a strange mixture of adducing evidence which we would have expected the group to do and speculating on the future which we did not expect.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">In many areas the group is now looking to the Secretaries General to certify items that will be entirely closed down because of this certification. What surprised me was that there was no mention of a right of appeal or a test of reasonableness. In the case of certification, there is no time limit after which deliberation should be over. Is it not unusual in legislation of this sort to have a recommendation that Secretaries General have a capacity to close something down and admit of no right of appeal or requirement to obtain confirmation that this is a reasonable approach? That appears to have been dropped from the equation.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">It appears from the information of the Information Commissioner that a Secretary General can effectively make a declaration about, say, a health board. An example would be the present discussions about the allocations of budgets to hospitals - these are part of the deliberative process of Government's preparing Estimates and revisions of Estimates. Effectively, the Secretary General can close down huge areas with this power but with no tests of reasonableness. Why has the group decided that the presumption must be changed in favour of these bodies? We are not talking about Cabinet but about bodies. There was an explicit provision that these bodies would generally make material available unless there was a supreme argument to the contrary. This balance has now been shifted. Why does the group believe this shift is proper?</p>

          <p eId="para_217">I have no evidence whatsoever of my Minister changing the nature of her observations in anticipation of the five year rule termination. We were concerned, as was the Government, about the impending five year transition. The framers of the Act were obviously concerned about the issue as well, otherwise they would not have inserted the five year provision. People accept that there is need for space for the Government to formulate and record its views and memorandums in an open and constructive fashion. Sometimes it moves beyond a departmental towards a wider political viewpoint as a member of a collegiate group. The Government needs space to do this in an open and frank fashion and it is in our collective interests that the Cabinet works as efficiently and effectively as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">What is our expectation about the termination? Some of it is crystal ball gazing: at the end of next month, if memorandums from Government start hitting the street and the observations of serving Ministers are revealed, will that in any way inhibit the Government's perspective and practices in the future? Everybody adjusts his or her behaviour depending on the circumstances. Committees of the Oireachtas operate in private at times for particular reasons: they wish to do things in a slightly different fashion. All of us operate differently under the glare of the external world. We had to strike a balance and anticipate, in the light of our experience with freedom of information in general and the wide interest in activities, whether Ministers may become inhibited in the future by the release of information that is quite "warm" from a public interest point of view.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">We were sufficiently concerned to advise Government that this was an issue and that our view was that we should extend from five to ten years the breathing space allowed to the operation of this collective responsibility.

This has never happened before: the only other experience we have had is the release of Cabinet records after 30 years in which there is a lot of interest but it is of a more historic nature, although occasionally it can become quite immediate, as we saw some time ago. Ministers knew about this and, when the Government was formed, decided to ask us to look into the issue and conduct a review because it was a legitimate concern. Our committee shared a concern on this issue and believed that giving an extra five years space to that type of deliberation was desirable to inculcate, encourage and support the confidentiality and collegiality of the Cabinet process.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_136">
          <from>Ms Julie O’Neill</from>
          <p eId="para_223">I will take both parts of the question. First, I will deal with the impact on the Cabinet process of the imminent release of papers under a five year rule. I have been involved with the Freedom of Information Act since it was first formulated as an idea. I have closely studied the experience in other jurisdictions, both before and after the implementation of freedom of information legislation, and have had experience in three different Departments since it was implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">I echo the points Mr. Haran made in that there is a difference between how people feel about something that has not yet happened but will soon and how they feel when it begins to happen. I have closely studied what happens in other jurisdictions once fairly recent Cabinet confidences have begun to emerge in the public domain. There is quite striking evidence from other jurisdictions, including New Zealand, that it has had a significant effect on behaviour, among Ministers in particular, once it has begun to happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">I share Mr. Haran's view that there was an element of crystal ball gazing. I am comfortable to say that in my experiences I have not seen to date any evidence of any Minister adjusting views given in a memorandum for Government in order to take account of what might happen should it be released. I have genuine fears and concern as to what might begin to happen when suddenly a flood of information begins to come out relating to such recent times as five years ago. Our view was that there was a genuine issue, not of concern to us, as civil servants, but to protect the process of Government and ensure we would continue to have the best quality and best articulated views and advice at Government and to protect the efficiency of the Cabinet process.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">On the wider issue of the deliberative process and the recommendations we made in relation to section 20, it is an interesting and difficult issue. It is only fair to say it is one on which we would have had considerable debate at our meetings. Deputy Bruton was correct when he said that, unlike other exemptions contained in the freedom of information legislation, section 20 of the Act was somewhat different in that the public interest test was designed to favour the release of information unless there was a public interest to show it should not be released. In all of the other exceptions framed with the public interest test the presumption in the first instance is that material will not be released unless it is in the public interest to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">It is important to put in context our specific recommendation which was for the rebalancing of the public interest test. Our concern was not about the views of civil servants coming into the public domain and being demonstrated to be different from those of our Ministers. Mr. McCarthy made this comment in his opening statement. For the last few years all of us have had the direct experience of having our views exposed to public spotlight. That is not an issue of concern. The democratic process and the process of government have got to a stage of being sufficiently robust to cope with the exposure of differences in the views of civil servants and Ministers. That was not part of our consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">There is, however, an issue about allowing an effective deliberative process to take place which allows some space for undisturbed consideration of policy issues. This is not of issue just in the Irish context. It has arisen in every country which has introduced freedom of information legislation, including those like New Zealand where the legislation is designed and intended to encourage not just openness and transparency after the event but also effective participation in decision making by citizens before the event. It is always an issue as to how one can protect the space which allows for undisturbed consideration of policy issues or, as they describe it in New Zealand, a cone of silence, in which Ministers can have some space to reflect on a wider range of policy options.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">There is a strong tradition that civil servants give independent and robust advice to our Ministers which will often depart from the conventional line. It may often depart from what is publicly attractive either to particular interest groups. The issue is whether premature release of that advice before a process is complete can contaminate or destabilise the process of arriving at conclusions. This is a difficult call to make. When we framed the original legislation, the call was made that it should favour the release of information on the deliberative process unless the public interest suggested that should not be the case. There is a specific reference in section 20 to take account of the public interest in that context where release of information would disclose impending important policy decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">The difficulty in practice - I have a great deal of experience in a number of Departments - is that it is a fine judgment call that the deciding officer has to make when a deliberative process and issue are live and not complete. This again raises the crystal ball gazing problem to which Mr. Haran alluded. Releasing information at that point before completion of the process could have a distortionate effect on the decisions that might be made. It was for that reason we recommended on balance and with some difficulty as a group that the section 20 public interest test should be rebalanced in order that records would not be released until after the deliberative process had been definitively completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">The Deputy asked specifically about the recommendations contained in the legislation about certification by Secretaries General. We are in territory about which we talked earlier with this because it was not one of our recommendations. We looked at the issue of putting a specific time limit in place on the release of records relating to the deliberative process which is in place in a number of jurisdictions. In some cases records which contain advice by civil servants to Ministers are treated akin to Cabinet records. We did not believe that was necessary or appropriate but that, as public servants, we should be subject to more open scrutiny of advice we have given. We did not believe a specific time limit was necessary. We were also aware of the fact that in some jurisdictions there was provision for certification of the deliberative process but, as that was not a recommendation of the group, it would not be appropriate to comment on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_232">There does not seem to be a specific example in the last five years of information made available under freedom of information that has been unhelpful to any deliberative process, affected the running of government or hindered the work of the Cabinet. In assessing this has the high level group looked at hypothetical situations where it believes it might, in the absence of some type of smoking gun, to justify any change in the legislation?</p>

          <from>Mr. McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_233">We were operating on the basis of the most likely plausible reaction to the actual experience of the release of Cabinet papers of a relatively recent vintage. There were and are examples of the inadvertent release of Cabinet papers of a very current vintage from which one can extrapolate the sort of impact it would have on behaviour with regard to the process of prior consultation between Ministers in matters coming before the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">On a more general issue of the deliberative process, the practice in relation to section 20 as observed by the Information Commissioner and others has been to take a rather conservative view and perhaps not apply the presumption in the Act in the way that might have been expected because of the difficulty of judging the impact of early release on the deliberative process. Indeed, the question of providing greater clarity and greater support for key decision makers in forming that judgment was something which the users' group had identified in its report.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">This is an area, in terms of deliberation and the balance to be struck in preserving an appropriate space for the deliberative process, which is intrinsically difficult. However, the fact that difficulties of any gross kind have not been identified reflect, first, the fact that the provision is not yet operable with regard to the special Cabinet records and, second, in relation to section 20, that practice has been more conservative in relation to the release of material than might have been expected, having regard to the terms of the Act.</p>

          <from>Ms O’Neill</from>
          <p eId="para_236">That is an important point. One of the comments of the Information Commissioner which we took into account when deliberating on this issue is the fact that often when the refusal by a public body of information under section 20 is appealed, by the time the appeal is examined by the Information Commissioner the deliberative process is concluded and the material has been released. In practice, Departments have acted to use the deliberative process more like the public interest test in other sections of the Act.</p>

          <p eId="para_242">Should the Cabinet wish to consult the high level group about the wide terms which have been included in the amendments to sections 19 and 20, can Ms O'Neill say if the high level group would remain available? My understanding is that the group has had no opportunity to advise the Cabinet on the much wider terms which have been used. All members of the committee are practising politicians. We understand the requirement in relation to Cabinet confidentiality and that it is a difficult call to make. However, the expansion of the terms in sections 12 and 13 of the Bill have an impact on sections 19 and 20 of the Act. Would the group avail of the opportunity should the Cabinet consult it in relation to what the Bill now provides? This is a critical point.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">The duties and responsibilities of Secretaries General in relation to certification are truly awesome, given that they appear not to be time bound. I can give an example in the context of both the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the Department of Transport. Section 12 includes the wide definition that is now given to Government and to people within the deliberative process. It is far wider than any of us, having served either in Parliament or in Government, had ever understood. It is now the practice of Departments to buy substantial amounts of advice in the context of the State investing many billions of euro in infrastructure. The use of outside advisers and consultants is now routine for various reasons. The way the new sections have been drafted is so wide that these advisers and consultants may well in the future be part of the Government process. This probably constitutes the greatest change in the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">Secretary General O'Neill was involved in the work on the original Act. Would the group welcome an opportunity from the Cabinet to give its expert advice? This is a key element of the new legislation. My party has made a call for a period of reflection to try to get this right. I can give another example. If the new legislation is passed as drafted, I do not believe the high level group report would be available to the Dáil even though collective responsibility means collective responsibility to Parliament. It is not just the collective responsibility of the members of the Cabinet to each other, it was originally collective responsibility to the Parliament. If the Government were to recall the group and allow it to offer advice, would the members make themselves available and would they welcome that?</p>

Why does he agree that it is necessary to shield the background papers to parliamentary questions where the Cabinet is, in fact, accountable to the Dáil and Seanad? Why is it necessary to shield the background papers of parliamentary questions from the operations of the Act, given that is one of the exercises of accountability to the Parliament of the people?

In the interests of clarity, Mr. Gallagher might clarify whether or not I am reading this point correctly. Perhaps we are becoming overly caught up in this matter because while information is exempted under the Freedom of Information Act, it can still be released voluntarily. I do not want it to be assumed that because we are exempting information from the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, it can never come out. It cannot come out under the Freedom of Information Act, as I gather, but there is a whole range of other mechanisms for obtaining the information. For example, Deputies can correspond with Ministers who, in turn, can release information. Ministers' speaking notes on legislation are not placed on the Dáil record but are made available to parliamentarians and through other mechanisms without reference to the Freedom of Information Act. Perhaps the witnesses could clarify that issue. It has been lost in the debate, as if to say that the only mechanism for the Government to provide information is through the Freedom of Information Act. I do not mean to cast any doubt on what has been said but I am worried that impression may have been created.</p>

          <p eId="para_264">There is a linkage between the kind of background information given to Deputies in parliamentary questions and the kind of information that forms background papers concerning Cabinet decisions. That seems to be the fundamental issue in conceptualising this point. The high-level group took the view that the background papers - for example, works of advocacy where an anonymous civil servant is clearly advocating an unconventional or radical solution to a particular policy option - should be shielded from the public purview. If such material was to be disclosed, clearly there would be a mediocre discussion in papers containing policy options confronting the Government. That seems to be the same reason the parliamentary question issue has arisen here also, although I have to say it is a fundamental one.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">A constituent of mine requested information on a topic about which I had earlier tabled a parliamentary question. However, the information received by the constituent included the background note and e-mails of civil servants, which had not been disclosed to me as a parliamentarian. The information disclosed to the constituent utterly contradicted the thrust of the Minister's reply. People are afraid that the elimination of background papers will effectively result in the kind of advice we saw years ago, which stated: "Don't tell him that because that would reveal that, in fact, we're pursuing exactly the opposite policy to that stated in the reply." Perhaps the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach could clarify why it is that background papers are excluded in this regard. He might also explain how the group arrived at its view concerning the issue of trawling requests. What experience have they had as civil servants of such requests, including, "Tell us what you had for lunch yesterday?" I would be interested to hear what the cost of dealing with such requests has been and how they have impacted on civilservants' time.</p>

          <p eId="para_271">Where did the decision concerning a ten-year period come from? It was said that the group came to the conclusion that ten years would be appropriate, but why not six, 16 or 30? In that context, did the group refer to the original documents for the 1997 Freedom of Information Act, which felt that five years was an appropriate period? Was there an evaluation whereby, all of a sudden, it went from five to 10 years? Certain countries were selected in order to make comparisons but were no comparisons made with the experience of our European counterparts? I find it strange that all the countries selected are in the British Commonwealth.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">It was stated earlier that Ireland has a more liberal freedom of information regime but I do not necessarily think that is a bad thing. When the group was discussing the matter, it should have said "Yes, we have best practice in this country and we should continue that." Changing the period from five to ten years seems to be a case of reverting to type, whereby we slavishly follow international norms.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">Was any consideration given to the effects of these regressive steps? It was stated that there is a culture of openness and transparency, and obviously the public perception would go along with that.

Mr. McCarthy also said that officials are not accountable in the same manner and, therefore, they should not be under the same restrictions as politicians. It is very magnanimous from Mr. McCarthy's point of view to say that officials should be more accountable than politicians. I could promote the idea of Cabinet records being restricted for ten years in relation to good Government. I would like further clarification on what the Secretary General, Mr. McCarthy, means by inter-ministerial discussions to ascertain how restrictive that could be.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">In relation to throwing a blanket over the records of every group that deals with a Minister, regardless of how tenuous such a relationship is to Cabinet discussions, that is a major step backwards.

I will home in on the section dealing with working groups directly supporting Cabinet. This also connects to what Deputy Burton said and it is the point at which we left our consideration of the Bill in the Seanad. Would the Secretary General to the Government, or any of his colleagues, be able to cite any instances in the past five years or even further back of specialist working groups of officials established to develop further or resolve complex issues on the Cabinet agenda, including people who are not civil servants or special advisers who fall into the category, the explanation of which we did not reach, of a person who is a member of such other, if any, classes of person as may be prescribed? That provision seems to leave extraordinarily wide discretion. My experience in Government Buildings is that this type of working group to Government always and only included officials and sometimes advisers. Can the Secretary General give concrete examples where it includes other people and that would be covered by this section?</p>

          <p eId="para_279">In relation to the question of access to background papers in respect of parliamentary questions, that is a provision of the Bill and it would not be appropriate for us to comment on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">In relation to a point that Deputy Conor Lenihan made, I will clarify and repeat that we did not recommend any particular protection of advice prepared for Ministers other than in the context of the deliberative process. As a class we did not recommend any such protection. I do not think it is particularly relevant to PQ position as such.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">In relation to the release of material other than under the terms of the FOI legislation, there is a clear provision in the Act that the release by means other than through the mechanisms of the Act is not prohibited or restricted by the terms of the Act. An example of material released other than through the Act would be our own report, which would not be discoverable under FOI legislation. I will ask Paul Haran to deal with the trawling question.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">In respect of the ten year provision requirement and why it is not a shorter period, as I said earlier, we acknowledged that any period is somewhat arbitrary. It seemed to us that a period of ten years, which might be in and around the duration of two full term Dáil periods, would be a reasonable protection of the spirit of collective responsibility. With regard to international comparisons, perhaps Ms O'Neill might refer to that.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">On the question of the impact on the culture of openness and its potential suffering as a result of the changes we recommended, we were reasonably confident that culture is well established and well embedded. We were supported in that view by the relatively positive tone of the commissioner's report on compliance by public bodies and the very positive assessment of the impact and acceptance of the FOI regime in Departments in the independent review of strategic management in the Civil Service conducted by PA management consultants last year. Therefore, we think it is reasonably robust and the changes we recommended would have had very little impact on the records created by civil servants for the most part. We did not envisage that would suffer.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">In terms of accountability in regard to ministerial correspondence, we envisaged that would be specifically construed as relating to correspondence in furtherance of collective responsibility. In other words, where the matter was in respect of an item on the Cabinet agenda or imminently to come to Government and the correspondence was clearly in the context of seeking to establish a collective position and in that sense being another form of the process which would otherwise occur at the table.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">In respect of Senator Mansergh's question, I confirm that I am not aware of any committee which was established in the circumstances. We envisaged that comprised persons other than Ministers, officials or advisers.</p>

          <p eId="para_286">On the trawling issue, we are concerned that together with the public interest, openness and transparency issue, there is the issue of the efficiency and effectiveness of organisations and the sheer cost in terms of activity and staff time in dealing with the requests.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">I will refer to a particular challenge we faced in 1998 and 1999. One individual was responsible for making 141 requests in 1998 and 53 requests in 1999. Those 141 requests represented about half of all the requests we received. The average cost of answering requests from that individual was approximately £650 per request. More than half of the requests went through one area of the Department and public servants who could have been involved in other areas such as the development or implementation of policy were consumed with responding to this individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">The Act is carefully framed in a fashion to protect the giving out of information and the balances are very strongly biased towards giving out information. We are not allowed to look into the mind of an individual who requests information. The individual in question was having a judgment secured against him for moneys from an entity within the Department. I will not say anything that would disclose the name of the individual.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">I will give members an idea of the practicality involved for an organisation in dealing with such requests. In one week this individual requested: information on the euro - we had all the information on the euro in the Department and we had searched through files; information on the abolition of duty free facility, particularly the employment implications; information on the insurance ombudsman shaped scheme, information on details of European Social Fund funding given to an entity, the name of which I will not mention; information on the Department taking over responsibility for the NRB; information on the background notes on replies to Dáil questions during the previous week; information on the financial controls of the Department subject in this particular area; and information on a particular entity gaining funding. Those were the requests for information we received in one week from one individual. If we were to get too many of those types of request, in other words, if there were too many of that type of individual, the system would stop producing policy or anything else as staff would have to try to deal with requests for such information.</p>

The commissioner ruled in our favour on our request in the referral but declined to give a determination on the frivolous and vexatious request element. It is a 14-page judgment by the commissioner, if that is how to describe it. He concludes: "As Assistant Commissioner Richardson pointed out, receipt of frivolous or vexatious requests from a particular individual in the past is not in itself sufficient to conclude that a new request is automatically frivolous or vexatious. Each request must be considered on its own merits, as measured against the relevant criteria." My civil servants would abide by that, and we ruled a number of requests to be frivolous or vexatious. That is how we dealt with them. We estimate the cost to us to be a few hundred euros per request. It has been suggested - and this is in line with the user group report - that we consider introducing a handling charge for requests and perhaps reviews. One individual subjected us to 45 reviews in year 1. At the meeting of the user's committee, that is one of the reasons I strongly supported the introduction of a handling charge - to help deter somebody from repeatedly sending in requests.</p>

          <from>Ms O’Neill</from>
          <p eId="para_302">Mr. Haran has given a very specific example of one type of trawling request. When we introduced freedom of information legislation, we looked at the experience of a wide range of common law jurisdictions and at the issue of whether there should be an up front fee. There is, in practice, an up front fee in a number of jurisdictions, as Mr. McCarthy mentioned earlier. At the time we were introducing freedom of information legislation, the expectation based on the pattern of requests elsewhere was that something of the order of 90% of requests would be for personal information. It was not, and is not our intention in our proposals, or in the legislation, to impose charges for personal information requests.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">One of the interesting things to emerge from the experience of FOI in Ireland is that the balance is something in the order of 50:50 between personal and non-personal information requests. In Departments, the balance is closer to about 60:40. The fee regime we structured under the Act is, as we and the Information Commissioner have noted, a complex means of levying a fee. There is no charge for the decision making time involved. The charge is purely for photocopying and pulling out the records. Various studies on this have been done in various Departments, and I have been in a number of different Departments.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">The Department of the Environment and Local Government, for example, looked recently at the average time taken to process any FOI request, and it works out at about 22.5 hours on average. That is not to take way from the value and importance of freedom of information legislation, but it is a significant administrative burden. Besides the trawling issue, which lends itself to various approaches, we felt there should be an up front fee that would reflect in some way the administrative cost to the taxpayer of processing requests, while pitching it at such a level as not to be a disincentive. It also means that when somebody wants information, he or she can get it. There will obviously be waivers in place for particular circumstances, but it might act as a disincentive to those simply trying to occupy the time of a Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">One Deputy asked whether we looked at European countries. Given the system of Government we operate here, the common law model is much more relevant. We studied common law jurisdictions at the outset and have continued to update our knowledge of what is happening in them. In terms of Cabinet confidentiality, we would be quite out in front in terms of the openness of that process to scrutiny in the time frame compared to other jurisdictions. Even in the more liberal regimes, there is either no time limit on withholding of Cabinet records or the time limit is anything up to 30 years.</p>

        <speech by="#GerardMurphy" eId="spk_198">
          <from>Mr. Kevin Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_313">Before I start, let me for one very brief moment put on my Ombudsman's hat to thank you, Chairman, and the committee for your support in bringing my dispute with the Revenue Commissioners over redress for taxpayers to a successful conclusion. One of the most gratifying aspects of the whole exercise was that it showed that the provisions in the Ombudsman's Act for a special report to the two Houses worked in practice. If I could be so bold as to make a suggestion for your future consideration, it would be useful if the committee was to maintain the connection with the Office of the Ombudsman and the Office of the Information Commissioner by inviting them to make a very short presentation to you on an annual basis when their annual reports were published.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">Let me turn to the matter at issue. I will be brief. I want to make three general points. First, I reiterate that the Office of the Information Commissioner is politically neutral and that it is very important that it remain so. This means that I must refrain from getting into a debate about the merits and demerits of the provisions of the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Bill 2003. Second, I report to the two Houses of the Oireachtas and I am appointed by the President on the resolution of the two Houses. I see my two offices as providing support for the two Houses in the exercise of their constitutional duties, both in relation to legislation and also in relation to accountability. The other side of the coin is that my office can call on the Houses of the Oireachtas for support when required, as I did in relation to the tax case. Third, members will, I hope, recognise that the publication of the Bill without any opportunity for me to comment presented me with a very real dilemma. As Information Commissioner, I will have to operate whatever legislation is enacted by the Oireachtas. I, therefore, have a very real interest in drawing attention to any operational deficiencies which may create future problems. Having operated the Freedom of Information Act for five years, my office and I have a very good knowledge of its workings which would have been of considerable benefit to the drafters of the Bill. Equally, given that I report to the two Houses, this technical expertise should also be available to benefit Senators and Deputies from all political parties as they deal with legislation which, even as it stands, has been acknowledged as being very complex and technical.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">It was for these reasons that I decided to produce a commentary on the workings of the Freedom of Information Act, as I am entitled to do, under section 39. I regard the commentary as a useful aid to all Deputies and Senators as they grapple with a Bill, particularly, on Committee Stage. It will give them information on the kinds of cases with which I have dealt over the past five years and the factors which have determined whether particular records are released. Given that Deputies and Senators have the sole and exclusive power of making laws in the State, it is not only right and proper but also desirable to give them the maximum factual information on the workings of the Freedom of Information Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">It has been claimed that I have strayed across my own self-imposed politically neutral line. I totally reject this. Civil servants and politicians, especially those with experience of committees such as this, are keenly aware of and sensitive to the distinction between policy and implementation. Although I have been an independent office holder and not a civil servant for the past eight years, I chose to use this distinction when drafting my commentary. I am fully satisfied that nowhere in my commentary have I strayed from the area of implementation into the area of policy. In my comments on section 19, Meetings of Government, and section 20, Deliberations of Public Bodies, I concentrated on problems of implementation, not the objectives behind the amendments. I made this clear in my commentary.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">While I would like to have been able to make my comments directly to the sponsoring Department, I was not offered that opportunity. When the Bill was published, I felt it proper and prudent to draw attention to what seemed to be flaws in the structure or the drafting of the Bill. I did this, both in response to my duty to the Oireachtas and also to ensure that, based on my experience to date, any potential difficulties with the operation of the legislation would be identified and addressed if the Houses so desired.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Let me end by assuring all concerned that whatever legislation emerges from the Oireachtas, it will be implemented conscientiously and impartially by my office. If I may refer to a recent comment about me by the Leader of the Seanad, I will implement it punctiliously but not pusillanimously. I have deliberately kept my presentation very short and refrained from going into the commentary because the time will be best spent on questions.</p>

          <p eId="para_320">I want to make a suggestion. There are a number of areas in respect of which I would like to have the benefit of Mr. Murphy's experience and expertise. One is the question of costs in relation to the new regime of charging. Another is the very important sections of his report which deal with the changes to sections 19 and 20 of the current Act, contained in sections 12 and 13. Another area about which I would personally like an opportunity to ask him is the change in the provision whereby, up to now, a person looking for information in relation to personal records could access all relevant information. I understand the proposed change will confine it to information on the person himself or herself. Those are areas I would like the opportunity to discuss.</p>

          <p eId="para_322">I want to deal with the question of costs. It appears from the reviews Mr. Murphy carried out previously and the experience of other countries, that the presence of significant charges may constitute a discrimination against the more active use of the Act by members of the public. I note from his various reports on the Act that he appears to be quite satisfied that the broad thrust of the Act is working well and is used extensively. Is Mr. Murphy concerned about charging regimes and what impact they might have for the Act? I note that the members of the high level group indicated on several occasions this morning that there would be a waiver. We also heard the Secretary General of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment speak about a troublesome request, which I suggested might have been vexatious. If there is a vexatious or repeat request which the Department finds difficult does the Act make provision for such types of request to be dealt with either by reference to his office or in another way?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GerardMurphy" eId="spk_203">
          <from>Mr. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_323">The question of whether there should be a charge is a policy decision and I do not want to get into the merits of that. I am pleased that if there is to be a charge it will not apply to people looking for personal information. It is hard to measure what the effects will be and whether it will lead to less usage of the Act. One would imagine once a price is put on something that might happen. The issue I raised in my commentary was that I was not clear on how they were going to apply and whether they would apply on a cumulative basis. That might be important because then the cost could be quite considerable.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">On the question of whether cost is the solution to frivolous or vexatious requests, such requests have their own solution. As Information Commissioner I have been surprised that no Department has used it. They have the power to reject and they have the power to reject on grounds of an administrative burden that would disrupt the working of the Department. They have not been used at all by Departments. One was used by the Eastern Health Board but that was a once off. What many Departments said to me was, "Why do you not use this?" My decisions are appealable on a point of law to the High Court. It would be a strange position for the Information Commissioner to go to the High Court and say, "I thought it was frivolous and vexatious but the Department, a public body, did not think it was frivolous or vexation." In a speech I gave to civil servants at one stage I said I thought they should be a little braver, in terms of using the Act. We had a concern that the Act could come into disrepute if it was abused in that way. In our own case we have appeals - I think I mentioned it in the commentary of particular individuals - I might have 20, 30 or 40 cases from a particular individual on hand at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Due to the fact that it was of such concern to Departments and because I thought it might bring the Act into disrepute, I decided to lay down guidelines in one of my decisions. I did this with some reluctance because the rule when dealing with a case is that one should deal only with what is before one. I departed from that rule in this case. Mr. Paul Haran took a small extract from that this morning. It is dealt with in much more detail in my commentary. I laid down what possibly might be considered as frivolous and vexatious. Cases are more likely to be vexatious than frivolous. As Ombudsman I have the same provision for frivolous and vexatious but I have never used it. What may seem frivolous to somebody may not be frivolous to a complainant. In the case of vexatious, if there is a pattern of behaviour it becomes clear after a while that there is a clear abuse of the Act. It is not in anybody's interest that this should be allowed. The existing provision, given the examples I have laid down as to how I might react to that sort of situation, could probably cope with that system.</p>

          <p eId="para_330">The second issue follows on from what Mr. Murphy has said. It is in relation to the proposed changes to the Act. If the Bill is amended, as proposed, the papers and workings in relation to tribunals would fall within the remit of the Act. I would have a particular concern in relation to people who were in institutions seeking information on their personal records, that may also fall under the remit of the Laffoy commission and the redress board. The proposal is to change related personal information relating to the person to files which contain information about the person. In his work as Information Commissioner has Mr. Murphy found that giving information to an individual who makes an application for personal information, which may also relate to the operation of a institution or Government Department, has posed a significant difficulty for the decision makers in terms of the Act? It was not an area that had come to my attention as being problematic. Has Mr. Murphy had experience of that posing a problem?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GerardMurphy" eId="spk_209">
          <from>Mr. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_331">On personal information there are significant implications in the Bill. The one mentioned by the Deputy where the words "related to" are replaced by "containing" will result in a change. I had taken the view that "related to" meant that if a record, which itself might not be personal information, related to a record which contained personal information, it was releasable. It still might be subject to other exemptions. That view was upheld by the High Court. Mr. Justice O'Neill laid out in detail what he considered to be the meaning of "related to." Basically, what he said was that if there was a substantive link between one record and another which was a personal information record, then it was releasable. Clearly that change would have implications.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">On the issue referred to about the institutions, where many people have sought records relating to themselves and their time in institutions, including the industrial schools, I have taken the line that in addition to purely personal information there may be a case, in certain circumstances, for releasing what I would call "non-personal" records. They might relate to an investigation that was carried out by the Department at the time as to what was going on. Some of them would be quite anodyne in that they would point out that there was good nutrition and good facilities. I was keen to do that. I do not know whether these people will ever have closure but in so far as they can get the maximum amount of information, they should get it. If they do not, they become suspicious that something is not being disclosed to them. I have not seen a problem with that so far as public bodies are concerned because most of these records are quite old. I do not think public bodies generally have much of a problem in releasing old records. They are more concerned with those of current interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">There is also an implication in the changes in section 24 for personal information. Under section 24, which deals with security, defence and international relations, people request certain personal information. It might relate to, say, a passport or it might be somebody who wants to know the reason he or she was not appointed having passed a Civil Service examination, which comes into the area of security clearance. In those cases I have not released more cases than I have released, but I have directed the release of some information where I was fully satisfied that there was no threat to the security of the State. Under the amending Bill, I would no longer have that discretion because all those areas have now become what we call a class exemption, in other words, there is no longer a harm test. Therefore, provided it falls into that category, it is no longer releasable.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I pointed out in my commentary that in section 24, first, there is no public interest test but, second, there is provision for a ministerial certificate which could be used in cases where the material would be particularly sensitive so, in a sense, there are safeguards under the present system. I am not aware of anything that I have released, or been asked to release under that section, causing any problems. It is a section that I take particularly seriously because we are talking about defence, security, Northern Ireland and international relations, and while the change is not primarily concerned with personal information, it could affect personal information in some cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">There is a final incidence where there is a possibility of an impingement on personal records. I have not mentioned it in my commentary because it surfaced while I was doing my commentary. It is a sensitive issue and I was not too clear on it because it is the type of issue I would like a legal opinion on but I did not have time to do that. Mention was made of tribunals and in all honesty I have to reply to it. For instance, we get requests for personal information from parents who are affected by the organ retention case. There is a new provision going into section 22 of the Act which deals with tribunals generally. I have a concern, which may not be firmly founded because it is a rather legalistic area, that if the Dunne inquiry, for example, gets these personal records from the hospital, and I understand there is some controversy about that, I can no longer release them to the parents because the provision refers to the business or proceedings of a tribunal. A tribunal could take the view that these records are its business and no longer that of the Information Commissioner, so there are those implications, if I can put it that way. However, I stress that on the tribunals aspect it may possibly be an inadvertent bit of drafting. Clearly, it is something that the committee might like to address because if I were to have to tell parents subsequently that they cannot have access to their children's records because they are before a tribunal, it might give rise to many difficulties.</p>

          <from>Deputy Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_336">My final point, and I will be brief, concerns the changes in sections 12 and 13, which are dealt with in the first few pages of Mr. Murphy's report. I put a point to one of the Secretaries General this morning on the definition of "Government", which is very wide. Until now the definition of "Government" included the members of the Government, senior civil servants involved with Government and advisers to Government. The new definition is much wider and, as Mr. Murphy said, it is exceptionally wide.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">Much of the information obtained by journalists in particular and media organisations has related to the substantial investments this country is currently making in public infrastructure in a wide variety of areas from health to transport. It has been possible up to now to obtain, usually by journalists and media, details of consultants' reports, for example, which are commissioned by a Department to report on some element of a Government sponsored project. Would it be Mr. Murphy's view that in this wider definition of "Government" it might be possible to include people like the consultants to the project, where the project is before Government over a protracted period of time because it is a substantial project involving large expenditures of public funds over a period?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GerardMurphy" eId="spk_211">
          <from>Mr. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_338">The direct answer to the Deputy's question is yes, but there is an element of speculation involved. The amendment seeks to include persons who can be prescribed by regulations. I have no idea who might be prescribed by regulations and I do not want to speculate on that, but the provision appears to allow for people who are clearly not Ministers, Ministers of State, the Attorney General, civil servants or special advisers. It appears to envisage some other category or class but I have no idea what it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">My concern with that provision was more or less about future implementation. Any legal adviser will say that for the purposes of a section or an Act we can define black as white and white as black. In terms of constitutional bodies, we can still define them in a different way as long as we do not take away from their core functions. To give an example, if a Bill going through the House stated that for the purposes of that Bill, Dáil Éireann shall be something else or the Supreme Court shall be something else, we would all jump up and down. Government to me is on an equal par with the Dáil and the courts. Where a term is being used that has a constitutional definition, we should be extra careful. It is not a legal point because if I got a legal opinion I am sure it would be to the effect that it can be done, but it is still an important point.</p>

          <p eId="para_340">Before I call Deputy Bruton I want to clarify one point on the issue of the change from "contain" to "relate to", which has been referred to by people in the past day or two. To some extent that is a narrower definition of the personal information they will be able to obtain. Aside from a request for personal information, would such a requester have a facility to obtain the information that is not now being given by a general inquiry on the issue? Could he or she obtain that information under the Act by way of a separate request other than for personal information? Is this closing off all avenues to the requester?</p>

          <from>Mr. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_341">One of the main tenets of the Long Title and also of section 28 is the protection of privacy. When we talk about access to personal information we are talking about access by the requester to personal information about the requester, not about any other third person. There is still a public interest test involved. I have gone on record as saying that in regard to a finely balanced request in terms of non-personal information, it should be released if it is so finely balanced, but in regard to personal information, I would come down on the side of privacy. It is important for people to realise that when we talk about access to personal information, we are not talking about access by third parties to other people's information.</p>

As a laymen - I am not a legal person - it is my view that it seems there is a possibility of conflict arising in regard to a parent's right to information on his or her child while such records have been obtained by a tribunal in carrying out its work. With regard to this section, the Act, as is stands, deals only with tribunals set up under the Act of 1921. This amendment provides in regard to any other tribunal or other body or individual appointed by either or both of the Houses of the Oireachtas to inquire into specified matters. Therefore, it may not be a tribunal in the sense of the Flood or Moriarty tribunals. That is another consideration that would have to be examined.</p>

As I said in my presentation, there were ways in which I could have been consulted without my getting into policy areas. I could have been asked to look at it purely on the basis of my technical expertise in operating the Act and to confine my comments to my commentary. If they came to me and said this is Government policy, it is not my role to query that. It could have happened that way, but it did not.

          <p eId="para_356">I have given many speeches over the past five years. I have spoken even at international conferences, I spoke before a select committee of the House of Lords and to an all-party committee of backbenchers in the House of Commons on another occasion. I had quite a number of dealings with the Scottish Executive on its Freedom of Information Bill or Act, as it is now. Today or the other day, it appointed an information commissioner. The Scottish Act is very similar to ours. In all those discussions, I have said we have excellent legislation. I am proud of it and I think it is operating well. They were my views then, they are still my views. I am not retracting anything I have said.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_227">
          <from>Deputy R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_357">To return to the substance of the report, one of the most interesting parts of it is the section on page 41 in which Mr. Murphy outlines his view that the Act is different from the intentions of the Act in the view taken by the high level group. The group said essentially that this was all about protecting Cabinet pretty much at all costs whereas Mr. Murphy's view was that, to the greatest extent possible, consistent with public interest and the right of privacy, information would be made available. The contrast is between a more minimalist approach and the approach Mr. Murphy took. Without asking Mr. Murphy to comment on the choice, can he give the committee his grounds as to why it was his view that the intention of the Act was to maximise openness?</p>
          <p eId="para_358">A key issue is that of suddenly defining as Government all sorts of committees composed of anyone, to become protected. Can Mr. Murphy give us examples of the sorts of committees he believes might now become protected by this process? It seems that if one wanted to protect committees that were reporting directly to Cabinet, one would not redefine the word "Government", rather one would say that committees who are dealing with matter "X", which is before or proposed to come before Cabinet, would have certain protection. Am I right in taking it that Mr. Murphy would support that view? Can he give us examples of what sorts of committees will now be afforded protection of which the Houses of the Oireachtas may not be fully aware?</p>
          <p eId="para_359">I would like to get Mr. Murphy's view of the certification process which will be given to the Secretaries General in relation to public bodies where, effectively, the Secretaries General will be able to certify public bodies as protected under the deliberative process, without any test of reasonableness, opportunity for appeal or timeframe. Are there freedom of information Acts elsewhere which give similar arbitrary and, in some ways, awesome powers to Secretaries General to make such decisions without the test of reasonableness or appeal and strict time limits?</p>
          <p eId="para_360">One of the features of the new Bill is that where previously there was a presumption that information would be released, now Secretaries General or heads of Departments will have to make a judgment that the public interest would be better served by release than concealment. Does Mr. Murphy believe heads of Departments have the experience of recognising the public interest in openness to make those balancing judgments? What implications will flow from the balancing judgments made in this newly tilted way?</p>
          <p eId="para_361">Mr. Murphy might not wish to comment on my final question. At the heart of this debate is the idea that Cabinet will cease to work effectively if information is released next month. We heard this morning from one of the Secretaries General that the experience in New Zealand suggested that this had dramatically changed the way Ministers and Cabinets operated. Given his experience and what he has seen in different jurisdictions, does Mr. Murphy believe the release after five years can have such an impact on the workings of Cabinet and that we should be concerned about it?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GerardMurphy" eId="spk_228">
          <from>Mr. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_362">I will start with the question about maximising openness on which the Act is clear. The long title says information should be released to the maximum extent possible consistent with the public interest and the protection of privacy. That is the guide by which I operate. This is supported in section 34 which says that unless a public body justifies the non-release of a document, I should deem the release to be justified. Again, this supports the general approach of openness to the extent that one just protects vital interests and the privacy of individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">With regard to Cabinet records and meetings of Government, I said in my commentary that Secretaries General approached this provision from the first day as if it was a mandatory exemption. If one looks at the Freedom of Information Act across all the exemptions, one will see that in some exemptions it says "a head shall" while in others it says "a head may". In some Acts such as pension Acts the statement that the Minister "may" award a pension is interpreted as meaning "shall". However, when legislation deliberately uses "shall" in some cases and "may" in others, there is only one interpretation one can make. It was not that I wanted a huge amount of further information to be released under that provision because I am sensitive about Cabinet confidentiality but I was saying that I could not accept, in the light of what the Act stated, this meant "shall" rather than "may". That was our point of disagreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">Listening this morning I got the impression that more things had been released than should have been. It is a strong provision. All Government memoranda, for example, are exempt. One can say it is subject to "may" but if a request for Government memoranda came before me, I would say access was not possible. All records on discussions of the Government are not only exempt but also constitutionally protected. There is no flexibility. That is also the case with all briefing notes. When a Minister is going to Government, he or she gets briefing notes. The secretary to the Government and the assistant secretary may get briefing notes. They are all exempt. That will not change and it was not subject to the Information Commissioner's discretion. He could not overrule it. Changing it to "shall" strengthens and makes it more mandatory. It does not affect my office but the heads of Departments who might have decided: "Well, I will release this briefing note for the Minister." It is a possibility; they would have had that discretion. It is a change within the system rather than in relation to my office.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">This can be linked with the question about the period of five years. If that had been the only change in the Act, I would not have prepared a commentary. By reference to international practice, a period of five years was exceptional. I do not make an issue of this in my commentary, although I point out that the impression that is sometimes created that all these records will suddenly become available after five years is not correct. First, they are subject to other exemptions. Second, in relation to the two sensitive areas of law enforcement and security, they are also subject to ministerial certificates. There is protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">I cannot envisage anything sensitive about Northern Ireland coming out at the end of five years because there would be exemptions to cover it. However, I cannot prejudge what decisions I or another Information Commissioner might make in the future and can understand the apprehension. I have found in my experience that when I take decisions, I take them on a case by case basis. I sometimes take a decision but go on to say it does not mean information of this kind will be readily available. In the culture of the Civil Service, with which I am familiar, there is a tendency to say: "He made this decision in this case; what might he do with something else?" There is an apprehension of what might happen in the future. That came clearly from the Secretaries General. They were more concerned about what might happen in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">That brings me to the issue of certificates. I found the Secretary General's certificate somewhat surprising. In the Act, with regard to matters as crucial as security, defence, international relations, law enforcement and safety, there is provision for the issuing of a ministerial certificate, to which there are two conditions attached. One is that the Minister must be satisfied that the record is particularly sensitive. The second is that the certificate the Minister issues is subject to review by the Taoiseach and another Minister every six months. This is being extended in the amendment to one year.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">There were criticisms from some when the Act was introduced that there should not be any certificates. However, in those sensitive areas the need for a ministerial certificate, certainly at the early stages of a Freedom of Information Act, is probably justifiable. It is clear that the certificate has not been abused in any respect. Only two have been issued. There is a further protection in that where a certificate is issued, it has to be notified to the Information Commissioner. I must report on it in my annual report, so certificates cannot be issued in private, so to speak. There are very good protections. The Act goes on to state that the issue of a certificate is subject to appeal on a point of law to the High Court. My concern about the Secretary General's certificate was, first, that it did not have to be sensitive material - that constraint was not there. Second, there was no supervision of it, as there is for a ministerial certificate. Third, there was no appeal whatsoever regarding it. My concern was not a policy concern, it was about implementation; I could see appeals being made to the High Court. I get a lot of appeals to the High Court from individuals which cost my office a lot of money, even though they may not succeed in the High Court. I was concerned that the absence of an appeal would raise a lot of legal and perhaps even constitutional questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">There was also the other drafting question that a Minister is "a head". There seemed to be an assumption, when it said "a head", that the head was the Secretary General but the head of a Department is, of course, the Minister. It also has implications for my office. For instance, to give a practical example, if I was negotiating with the Department of Finance for resources - and let us assume we were back in the bad old days of my predecessor, when they were cutting the tripe out of my office, and I was into that sort of battle - and I got a freedom of information request from a Deputy, and the Secretary General of the Department of Finance issued a certificate, I could not release that information to the Deputy under the Freedom of Information Act. I would of course release it to the Deputy outside the freedom of information legislation, but the point is that I could do so because I am an independent office holder. What about all the other bodies that are fighting and must take a long-term view of their interests? There were many concerns about that section which I thought I should raise.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">It is about implementation, however. It seems to me, for instance, on both these sections that if that is Government policy there are other ways of doing it. I was just concerned with the way it was being done. In fairness to the Secretaries General, nowhere in the report of the high level group did they suggest that particular mechanism.</p>

          <p eId="para_371">Before I call Deputy Finneran, I want to seek a point of clarification in connection with the certificates. Under the existing Freedom of Information Act is there a mechanism currently in place for a register of ministerial certificates? Are you notified about this matter and is it included in your annual report? Is there a report on those at the moment?</p>

          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_379">The question I am teasing out is that this issue sounded like a broad exemption but, in fact, it has been used remarkably sparingly. Moving on to the certificates by the Secretary General to the Government for certain committees and certificates proposed by the Secretaries General, if they were to be used equally sparingly it might present no operational problem. However, if they were to be used widely it could present a substantial operational problem.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GerardMurphy" eId="spk_238">
          <from>Mr. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_380">Yes and on that point, Chairman, you must bear in mind the constraints on ministerial certificates. Ministers do not want to issue their certificates because first of all they have to prove that the matter is sensitive. They have to get it past the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Finance. So three Ministers are looking at this to see if it is really justified. They have to inform me of it and I list it in my annual report. For instance, if at the beginning of FOI, a Minister had issued 20 certificates, it would be public knowledge.</p>

          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_381">Currently, there seems to be a good control mechanism on the issuing of certificates; it is a tight procedure. We are broadening the number of people who can now issue them but the problem is that there appears to be no control. If a similar control regime continued to operate for the new certificates, it may not present a problem, but at this point we do not know how it will operate in practice.</p>

          <from>Mr. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_382">Yes. There is one other point I should have mentioned, which is that the certificate is used where exemptions do not apply. In other words, where they might be afraid that a particular exemption would not apply. That is perhaps a bit too complicated.</p>

          <p eId="para_390">I did not make any submissions. However, when I learned that a Bill was about to be published, my director general wrote to the Department to say, "Are you going to consult us about it because we have technical amendments to suggest?" We got a letter back asking us to send on our technical amendments and that is the explanation for my letter of February. This Bill was going to go ahead and as I considered there were some things I wanted to see in it, I decided to send those details. They are at the back of my commentary.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">I want to come back to the central policy unit because of this ongoing matter. For instance, it was sending guidance notes to Departments on how to operate particular exemptions and it would run them past us because of our expertise. So that I cannot be accused of not giving the Deputy the full story, we would have been consulted about technical points like that. For instance, if we had a problem with a particular section or Department, we might have a word with the central policy unit and say, "Look, this isn't right, can you do anything about it?" It was a good working relationship but based strictly on the fact that I was independent and that the relationship existed with a view to improving how the Act worked, rather than changing it in any way.</p>

In performing that role, surely it is not objectionable for somebody to give information to help the Houses do that even better.</p>

          <p eId="para_410">Did Mr. Murphy feel aggrieved that he had not been consulted, that he was not on the expert group, that he made his submission as a result of finding out on the grapevine that it had been put in place and that subsequent to the publication of the legislation, on which he still had not been consulted, he issued recommendations or observations on 5 March? As a result of not being consulted again, he felt aggrieved and issued a further document on 12 March. Is that a fair summary of what happened?</p>

          <p eId="para_411">No. If my office had been asked to appoint somebody to the high level group, I would have refused because there cannot be mixing between an independent office and a Department of State. There is a very strict dividing line between an independent body, whether the Ombudsman's office or the Information Commissioner's office. If the high level group had written to me to say it was thinking about something and to ask me if I had any views on it from a technical point of view, I would have been very happy to oblige, but I certainly would not have allowed myself or any of my staff to be a member of the high level group.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">As regards being aggrieved, there is no statutory obligation on the Government to consult me but I see my role as one of supporting the Houses. Therefore, when the Bill, which is a very technical and complex one, was published, I asked myself if I could help the Houses in any way by giving it factual information. That is what I did.</p>

          <p eId="para_414">Does Mr. Murphy feel the timing of the issue of his document was most unfortunate? On Tuesday, 11 March, as we were discussing Committee Stage of the Bill and the Minister of State and the officials were present in the Seanad Chamber, questions were put by the Opposition in relation to his document. Neither the officials nor the Minister of State had possession of the document at 4 p.m. on Tuesday, 11 March. Mr. Murphy's actions, in a way, undermined the workings of the Seanad and the workings of the Department of Finance and its officials, and caused them great embarrassment as a result of a question put by Senator Higgins to the Minister of State who replied by saying he had not received this document. I understand the document was supposed to be published today.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">Section 39 is quite specific. It states that the commissioner may prepare and publish commentaries on the practical application and operation of the provisions of this Act, including commentaries based on the experience of the holder of the office of commissioner in relation to reviews and decisions. I put it to Mr. Murphy that he went beyond his remit as commissioner and that he has now engaged in the political process in commenting on the Bill published by the Government. He has certainly given Opposition parties considerable food for thought in the drafting of amendments. They will now use his document as the gospel according to Mr. Kevin Murphy. As the expert in the field, I contend he has gone beyond his position as commissioner and undermined his independence in relation to the Government.</p>

          <from>Mr. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_416">Let me first deal with the question of timing. The question of timing was out of my hands. I heard on the Friday that the Bill was being published that day. I thought about it at the weekend and decided that on the Monday, I should do my commentary. Members will appreciate there was a significant amount of work in that. I announced at that point that it would be available in a week or so. When it was available the first people to receive copies were, as always, Deputies and Senators. I have no obligation to give my reports, whether as Ombudsman or not, to those within my jurisdiction, which includes Minister and Departments. We got these copies in small batches because of the time restriction, so I told my staff that all Deputies and Senators were to be the first to get them and at the same time. Once it was laid before the Houses and given to Deputies and Senators I posted it on our website, which is in the public domain. I see nothing wrong with that.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">I am now 47 years in the public service. In that time I worked closely with ten different Ministers from three of the main political parties. I also worked closely with three different Taoisigh. None of them would ever accuse me of having any particular political leanings of one kind or another. One Minister was always fascinated as to where my leanings lay, but he never discovered what they were. It is ingrained in me.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">I was faced with a dilemma here although I take the point about the two sections. In my commentary I would have preferred that I would not have to comment on the drafting aspect. However, I had to ask myself if I let it go without drawing attention to clear problems that will surface, would I be doing my duty as far as the Houses of the Oireachtas are concerned? I concluded that I would not. My position may be argued over, but that was the decision I made and I stand over it.</p>

          <p eId="para_443">We welcome the commissioner's commentary on the Act and the proposed legislation. Section 19, dealing with the definition of the Government, was alluded to by Deputy Burton. Article 28 of the Constitution is clear on this while the Interpretation Act 1937, broadens the scope of what constitutes the Government. Section 12 of the Bill provides that the term "the Government" includes, <i>inter alia</i>, a committee of the Government and a committee of officials. The word “officials” is defined on page ten to mean two or more of the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_444">(<i>a</i>) a person holding a position in the Civil Service of the Government or the Civil Service of the State;</p>
          <p eId="para_445">(<i>b</i>) a special adviser within the meaning of section 19 of the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995;</p>
          <p eId="para_446">(<i>c</i>) a person who is a member of such other (if any) classes of person as may be prescribed.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">Paragraph (<i>a</i>) does not refer to rank while paragraph (<i>c</i>) is all inclusive. It effectively means that anybody off the street may be included. There are three definitions. One is the article in the Constitution, the second is the definition in the 1997 Act based on the 1937 Interpretation Act and the third is the broadened version in this legislation. Two comments jump out of Mr. Murphy’s report. He states, “This is effected by substituting for the definition of Government currently contained in section 19(6) a much more far reaching and constitutionally unrecognisable definition. Apart altogether from the constitutional unrecognisability of the definition. . . ”. Is he saying there is a constitutional problem?</p>

          <from>Mr. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_448">No, I am saying there is huge scope for confusion. I said that in drafting a Bill one could basically say for a particular purpose black was white in one's definition. I would be slow to say it is not legally possible to do this and I am not saying it. I am saying that when one comes to the main constitutional organs of the State, one should be very careful about defining something we all know and love, the Government. For instance, when we are operating the Act, when somebody says "memorandum for the Government", is that a memorandum for the real Government or the working group, which for the purposes of the section is the Government? I am talking about confusion and probably litigation but I am not saying it is not constitutionally possible to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">When the committee deliberates on Senator Leyden's point, I draw its attention to section 38 of the Act which states, "The Commissioner shall foster and encourage the publication by public bodies of information of relevance or interest to the general public". I am a public body. This refers to the activities and functions generally of public bodies. People see me as having a wider role in terms of promoting openness.</p>

          <from>Senator Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_450">Mr. Murphy states in his report that under section 2 of the Act, "A Minister could not release a record under the FOI Act if the Secretary General of his or her Department or, indeed, the Secretary General of another Department issued a certificate in writing stating that record contained matters relating to the deliberative processes of the Department". Will he comment on this?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GerardMurphy" eId="spk_299">
          <from>Mr. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_451">That is an opinion. I have been interpreting the Act for the past five years. I took that section and, on the basis of my reading of it, that is what it says. I am open to contradiction but the Act defines the head of a public body quite properly as the Minister and then, outside the Civil Service, the Comptroller and Auditor General is the head of his office. I am the head of the Ombudsman's office and so on. The Bill states, "A head shall if the Secretary General issues a certificate. . . ". Under the normal rules of interpretation, it means a Minister shall if a Secretary General issues a certificate. It does not say it must be the Secretary General of the Department or that it must be about the business of his or her Department. It could be about the business of another Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">One can speculate as to what the objective is - I should not get into it - but it spreads out. I have a particular interest in that my office could be affected by this, as could the Comptroller and Auditor General, if there were ongoing discussions, negotiations or communications between my office and, say, the Department of Finance. The Secretary General of the Department of Finance could say, "You can't release this." I could not live with this. I would have to release it outside freedom of information.</p>

          <p eId="para_453">I refer to the Information Commissioner's commentary on section 20 which refers to certification by the Secretary General of a Department of the existence and continuation of a deliberative process. If the Secretary General issues such a certificate, is he or she stopping his or her Minister from issuing information? There are a number of categories. If the deliberative process involves more than one Department, it would be possible for the Secretary General of a Department to stop information issuing from the other Departments. With regard to the other offices of the State, particularly those with a watchdog role such as Mr. Murphy's and the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, such a restriction could be placed on them by the signing of such a certification.</p>

Given my long experience, I would be very surprised if any Minister put up with that or allowed it to happen but it can happen in relation to other public bodies. It extends out. Having listed all the people concerned, the Bill further refers to "anybody who acts as a chief executive of a public body". That would cover a county manager also. I am concerned about its ramifications. I am drawing attention to and not taking a position on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_460">The important point about section 24 is not that it is changing anything in relation to what information is covered by it, it is changing from a harm based to a class exemption. In other words, up to this - I have had a few requests - if the Department for Foreign Affairs refused a record on the grounds that it would "adversely affect international relations", it would have had to prove to my satisfaction that it would harm international relations. I had one case about which it was quite upset. It concerned a request from somebody looking for what records were available in the Department about the Church of Scientology. The Department first denied the existence of records and an appeal was made to me. I looked at the records and said, "Look, this does not stand up, have a second bite at it and convince me that this would harm international relations." What was at issue was a transmission from the ambassador in Germany to the Department in which he quoted from most of the German newspapers about a controversy in Germany at the time about the Church of Scientology. It was all in the public domain. I said I could not see and the Department did not convince me that this would harm international relations. The officials got upset about it because they said, as a class, dispatches from ambassadors to the Department should always be exempt. We now have this in effect. No matter how innocuous the document is, once it falls into the new category under the new legislation, it will be exempt. That is a change on which I want to be clear.</p>

I have received few appeals about fees.</p>

          <p eId="para_466">On the 44 submissions under the Freedom of Information Act in the past five years, if all these amendments were made to the Act now, would Mr. Murphy see them as affecting him slightly or severely? As an example, if I wanted to obtain information from the chief executive officer of a health board on his or her spending plans which were under discussion at Cabinet for whatever reason, or on waste management plans from county managers - it is almost impossible to find out any information about the location of waste incinerators - would Mr. Murphy find that, if the amendments were to be made, severe or mild restrictions would be placed on the Act?</p>

          <p eId="para_467">Let me repeat the point I made in my opening presentation that, whatever legislation comes out of the two Houses, will be conscientiously implemented by me, impartially and properly. It is not for me but for the two Houses to decide where the balance lies between access to information and protection of public interest. The current Act has drawn a line at a certain point. It is certainly up to the legislators to decide if that line is the right one or if it should be pushed in one or other direction. All I am doing is trying to give members enough information to help them in some small way to make that decision, but that decision is theirs. That is what they are paid to do as legislators, I am afraid.</p>

It is probably not as major an issue for most committee members but many of the points Mr. Murphy raised are very significant. I am delighted he has attended this meeting, regardless of what Senator Leyden believes about information being made available too soon. Mr. Murphy's attendance is excellent because we need this type of information. I hope the amending legislation will be repealed and that we will continue to receive information.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">One feature has been that people say they cannot discuss this as openly as possible because policy is restricting them or they are restricted in saying what really happened by their positions of either working for the Oireachtas or the Government. Perhaps we should request the attendance of the individual who can answer these questions without saying there is a higher being.</p>

The reason I drew a line in the sand beyond which I would not go was because of my obligation to my office. I can ride off into the sunset with a halo on my head saying I really said what I felt. That does not do any favours for my office. Therefore, it is and has been referred to as a self-imposed line but is so with a view to the long-term interests of my office.

However, the commissioner is independent and this analogy does not stand up. As he rightly says, he is entitled to comment and say what he likes on matters. That is why I am still confused following Deputy Finneran's line of questioning.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">Mr. Murphy says it is not his role to comment on the merits or demerits of the Bill yet he is before the committee making significant comments which I believe should be taken seriously by the committee and everyone watching it. I hope I do not misquote Mr. Murphy but effectively he says that the flaws in the structure and drafting of this legislation, which will soon be before the House, are such as to render it inoperable. I think this is the sense of what Mr. Murphy said and I took careful note of it. In effect, the design, structural and drafting flaws are of such an order that the Bill is almost inoperable.

If there were a working group which was established by Cabinet to do a job and reported to it, all that need be done, and I am sure this has happened already, is to put a front page on it headed "memorandum for Government" and get a Minister to send it, because memoranda for Government are sent by Ministers or the Attorney General, not officials, and that becomes a memorandum for Government. I accept, in a number of my decisions, that things like memoranda for the information of the Government and <i>aides-memoire </i>for the Government, which is a technique often used by Departments, are all exempt under the Act. I was really asking if we need this definition or is there a better way of drafting this. I was not making a decision on whether it should or should not be done.</p>

First, there is the kind of request deemed to be frivolous or vexatious by a Department or an official and second, there is the kind which the commissioner would decide was vexatious, on appeal. This seems to have been a big issue for the high level group and for Members of the House. It has been raised in the debate and instances and examples have been cited. Does the commissioner take the issue of frivolous or vexatious requests seriously, in terms of their cost and burden on the Administration? If so, can he tell us how many decisions he has made in favour of the Administration when it has made the case that a particular request is vexatious or frivolous in its intent?</p>

I feel they have damaged the Act in many respects. They have abused the Act. It is up to a Department, first of all. A public body has a right to reject a request for records on grounds that it is frivolous or vexatious. It also can reject it on grounds that it would cause an undue disruption of the work of the Department. No Department has ever done that so I have not had to rule on it. On the other hand, many Departments have sent coded messages to me when they are making their submissions that I should rule that a request is frivolous or vexatious.</p>

However, in order to help - and I broke a rule here because one should never anticipate cases until one deals with them - because they were getting so exercised about serial requesters, I gave them guidelines. I made a very long decision, and some of it is quoted in my commentary, in which I went into all the case law about the terms frivolous and vexatious in the Irish courts and in other jurisdictions. I finally put down the sort of situations where, if public bodies rule a request out as frivolous or vexatious and it comes to me on appeal, I would probably support them. Obviously, I cannot say that. I have to take each case on its merits.</p>

          <from>Mr. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_509">One did. That was the old Eastern Health Board. There was an individual who had got discovery of documents in a court case. The documents were of a sensitive nature and the High Court judge had ruled that a decision had been made that these were sensitive records and were not to be released to anyone. The requester wanted to get the same records he already had under freedom of information legislation so that he would be free of this restriction. The Eastern Health Board's first reaction was that this was frivolous and vexatious. The case came to me and, while I upheld the decision on other grounds, I said I could not see it as frivolous or vexatious because there is a difference between discovery, where one is subject to great restraints, and freedom of information, where the whole tenor of the Act is that once one gets the information one can use it. That case ended up in the High Court and the judge agreed that it was not a frivolous or vexatious request. However, because the High Court had restricted discovery I had found that to release it would be contempt of court and the judge upheld my decision in that case.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">That was the only case where a body objected and I think it picked a bad one. There are many cases involving serial requesters where Departments could have had the courage to say "no". Maybe they were reluctant and thought I might find against them. I do not know.

          <from>Senator Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_514">The point I want to make leads directly to the question I wish to ask. The commissioner is, or shall be, according to legislation independent in the performance of his or her functions. Not merely sections 38 and 39, but also section 40.2 give him a very wide remit. It is difficult to argue that the report he issued was <i>ultra vires</i>. We should be very slow, whether in Government or not, to censure the operation of an independent officer of State on a matter vital to our democracy. By the way, as Fianna Fáil spokesperson on finance in the Seanad I entirely forgive Mr. Murphy any embarrassment he may have caused when the Bill was debated on Committee Stage. In fact, he did not cause me any particular embarrassment. I was glad to have his report to be able to refer to in the course of the deliberations.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">That leads into the question. The way in which the various provisions of the Bill are interpreted, with one exception which I will come to, depends on how Mr. Murphy and his office interpret the Bill and the case law - if law is not the wrong word, but he knows what I mean - that he lays down in the course of hearing appeals. Therefore, in arguments that a provision could be systematically abused by civil servants, he is there as a safeguard of the public interest. In any case, it is not really just a question of abuse. People can quite conscientiously and with absolute integrity come to a wrong judgment and some of these judgments are very finely balanced. How is this to be interpreted, except in the case of things that will be certificated by Secretaries General?</p>
          <p eId="para_516">In respect of the latter point, which has already been discussed, I am not sure that the sort of Secretaries General we saw this morning would necessarily be entirely comfortable with having that degree of responsibility placed on them. For something to operate free of abuse, it is important to have a system of appeal. In respect of the freedom of deliberation of Government, I understand why the Government might not necessarily want decisions referred to an independent office like that of Mr. Murphy. In the case of Ministers they are ultimately referable to the Taoiseach. However, the principle of a second judgment at some level is desirable. Does Mr. Murphy agree with that?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GerardMurphy" eId="spk_357">
          <from>Mr. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_517">The deliberative process is always a difficult area in terms of freedom of information. I have adopted the perspective that the Government and civil servants must engage in it without undue interference. The worst thing that could happen, as we know in practice, would be for something that is not decided upon and which is still being considered to be released because this would lead to all sorts of interests joining in the process and, perhaps, pre-empting what would be a good decision in the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">I have said that I accept the principle that premature release is not desirable. Dermot McCarthy reiterated that this morning. He said, "In most cases, by the time I had dealt with it and it had come through the system, decisions had been taken." It is often stated that there must be free and frank expression of opinions by civil servants. That is important because they must be able to offer free and frank advice to their Ministers. One has to draw a line somewhere. If I were to rule that I would not direct the release of any records until the deliberative process was finished, I fear I would find that it would never be finished in practice. Finding the balance is a difficult task.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">One of the decisions I made caused some concern in the Department of the Taoiseach. The decision involved my concluding that the release of records would do no harm in a case where a deliberative process was still going on but where a certain phase of it had finished. However, I always satisfied myself that I would not impinge on the deliberative process in the sense of preventing it from operating properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">As the Senator said, fine judgments have to be made. Civil servants generally operate in terms of the public interest. However, there is a difference between the public interest as perceived by civil servants and as perceived by an outside body, such as the one I represent. The public interest of the Revenue Commissioners is always associated with getting in revenue and the public interest of the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment may concern the creation of employment rather than the environment. Therefore, a balancing of public interests must be engaged in.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">When a Department says it is not releasing information in the public interest, it is generally doing so in the interest of what it perceives to be the public interest. There is a wider balancing act in my office. We say, "Yes, that is a legitimate interest. We must encourage employment, but people interested in the environment may also have a right to see records to see what is happening." I do not claim infallibility. However, I insist on getting submissions from everybody to try to reach the most balanced conclusion I can.</p>

          <p eId="para_523">Yes. One of the more important aspects of my office - I can contrast this with my role as Ombudsman - is that I make legally binding decisions. Therefore, a body of precedents is building up. This is useful for Departments and I encourage them to ask why they are dealing with an appeal regarding a case similar to one I have already ruled on. The Civil Service mind works by saying, "Suppose we had a different case and he applied the same principle, would we have to release the relevant information?" Civil servants become a little fearful.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">I have been at pains to say that I treat every case on its individual merits. In one particular case I said a security clearance should be released. I made it clear, as I always have to do, that that did not mean I would release security clearances. I released it in that case because of its contents. Due to the fact the case is before the High Court, I cannot tell the committee what the contents are, but I was of the opinion that it would not harm security to release this particular one.</p>

          <p eId="para_526">No. My main concern is with delays and this is what my compliance report was about. I had problems with the Revenue Commissioners initially but in my report they came out on top as having got to grips with their problems. They set the example. I still have problems with some Departments because there are sometimes long delays in dealing with requests. However, I have no evidence of anybody deliberately trying to circumvent the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_527">I sometimes think people abuse the Act to a small extent. When they know I am about to make a release, they still insist on sending a request to me, the benefit for them being delay. In other words, they know I will not deal with their cases for three or four months.</p>

          <p eId="para_528">What fees will people have to pay arising from the proposal? If one is on a social welfare income and disadvantaged economically, €20 is a significant portion of one's income, although it might not seem like a lot to some. The poorer one is the more likely one is to be put at a disadvantage by one's local authority or to feel aggrieved by one's health board.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">We are trying to include community and voluntary organisations and get them to participate more in local democracy. I am not referring to the high politics of Government decisions but to questions as to why the road outside one's door is not being repaired or why one's estate is not receiving the attention it deserves. Does Mr. Murphy think we should look again at the fee because it can have a very disproportionate impact on those concerned and can put them at a significant disadvantage? There is a feeling, particularly among poorer people, that society is not there to help them and that if they are to get to the bottom of this issue they will have to pay the €20. That will have a negative impact on them. From the point of view of the local authority or health board, it is only a one-stop report people are looking for. The local authority will not have to spend years going through files. There is very little administration involved. Why should people have to pay to get immediate accountability from their local authority?</p>

          <p eId="para_530">This morning the Secretary General indicated that there would be provision for a waiver. In the sort of cases the Deputy listed, particularly cases of individuals who are on social welfare, most would be looking for personal information and there is no fee for that. In so far as they might look for other types of information there is provision for a waiver of fees in the present Act. It is only on the basis that it can only be waived if some or all of the information is in the public interest. At the moment, irrespective of the nature of the information requested the charges may be disregarded if the head of the public body is satisfied that it would not be reasonable to levy the charge having regard to the means of the requester and the nature of the record concerned. I would expect Departments to use that provision generously.</p>

          <p eId="para_531">I have a few questions on the area Senator Mansergh probed. Prior to this job Mr. Murphy was an eminent civil servant and did not have to contend with the Freedom of Information Act. Does he think the task of his successors is made more difficult by the Act?</p>

          <from>Mr. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_532">Yes. It is very comfortable to operate within official secrets. One does not have to be as careful. A person can say things and write things in the knowledge that nobody will ever know. One of the benefits of freedom of information is that it ensures that people in future write objectively. There was a Secretary General, whom the Deputy would probably remember who is long since retired, who used the term that on files one might get what he called "latrine gossip". The Deputy probably recollects who it is. This was in the sense that things may be said about other people and since it would not be released it did not really matter. Now we have to be more careful. I would argue that as a result the submissions are more focused on what a good civil servant would do and the arguments for and against and there is less free-ranging comment. That imposes its own disciplines and obligations.</p>

          <from>Mr. Murphy</from>
          <p eId="para_534">In my compliance report we decided - this was three years ago now - to look at records before and after the Act and see was there a change in terms of recording and so on. We found there was not. That was a small sample and I would not like to draw too many conclusions from it. Equally there is anecdotal evidence. I keep hearing people saying "we do not commit things to paper" or "we keep very sparse minutes of meetings". What I always say in response to that is that at the end of the day one must always be very careful about record keeping because it can come home to haunt a person.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">The Deputy will be familiar with this from the DIRT inquiry where the absence of records of discussions between Ministers and civil servants raised great difficulty for some of the Secretaries General who appeared before the inquiry. In this era of greater accountability there is a huge self protection element now in maintaining records. If I was still in the Civil Service I would be very careful about maintaining records. I would certainly feel that it would be rash on my part to say "I better not keep any records of anything because of freedom of information." The reverse is true.</p>

          <p eId="para_537">No, I have an unequivocal view that it has been good for written submissions and their quality. On several occasions I have expressed my concerns about record keeping generally in the public service. I went so far in one of my annual reports as to say I would like to see a provision, and I think this is probably in one of the amendments I sent to the Minister, where there would be an obligation on public bodies to keep adequate records.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">One of the things that has surfaced in recent years in terms of access to the institutions, to the industrial schools and so on, is the abysmal record keeping. With my ombudsman's hat on I have several times criticised record keeping in the medical and hospital areas. Freedom of information, if anything, should help rather than hinder that.</p>

          <p eId="para_540">New Zealanders have a great phrase which always attracted me. It is the phrase "contestability of policy advice". What they mean by that is that if one really wants to ensure that people give good quality advice to Ministers it should be contestable against. Similar experts should have access to it and be able to say whether it was a load of rubbish. I would expect that freedom of information, by enabling people to look, probably with hindsight, and say that some advice was really not good quality advice, should ensure that civil servants when giving advice will try as best they can to ensure it is quality advice.</p>

What about the controversial case that arrives on a civil servant's desk where perhaps some insurance broker had done a runner with his or her clients' funds? It would be an awkward case for the Minister with angry members of the public to deal with and where invigilation may or may not have been as it should.

          <p eId="para_547">The Deputy is asking me to speculate. One of the things I said in the early days of freedom of information was that I still had a question mark in my mind over the case that would arise at some stage which would be seriously embarrassing for a civil servant or seriously embarrassing for a Minister and that the real test of commitment to freedom of information is when that sort of document is released. Human nature being what it is, I could see a civil servant being concerned if there was a record about to be released which might put him or her in an embarrassing situation. I have no reason to believe that the process would not go through including referral to my office if necessary. In my experience, the number of instances would be quite small. We are all a little apprehensive of things we may have written. I would now be a little apprehensive of some of the things I wrote when I was a junior civil servant in the Department of Finance if I were to look at it now in the cold light of day. I believe that people will learn to live with that. They will be more careful in what they write. The message has gone out to the Civil Service that it is advisable to always work on the basis that a document has a potential for release under FOI.</p>

There is sometimes confusion - and Dermot McCarthy referred to this - where things may have been released without coming to my office and which have been potentially embarrassing. That is an internal matter for the Civil Service. I am not aware of any serious damage that freedom of information has done to the deliberative process. I would see the deliberative process as an area that needs careful handling. It is a sensitive area and nobody wants to freeze Government into a situation where it cannot carry on and do what it is elected to do.</p>

          <p eId="para_551">The example of the Ombudsman is the easiest one to give. For the purposes of the Act I am the head of a public body. I think the amendment says that a head of a public body shall not release records if a Secretary General of a Department issues a certificate. I could envisage a situation where rumours might escape about problematic consultations with the Department of Finance about resources for my office and someone might request the records from my office. While my investigations as Ombudsman are protected, the general administration of my office is not and my policy is to release all those records. It could be argued that these records relate to the general administration of the Oireachtas but before I could release them, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance might use a certificate which affects me as Ombudsman. As I said earlier, I would still feel myself capable of releasing it because the Act says I can release information outside of FOI——</p>

          <p eId="para_553">——but the trouble would be that instead of having a structured system, it would go back into a discretionary system. The difference between having FOI and not having it is that without FOI information clearly comes out into the public domain on a regular basis but it is structured, controlled information. The good news comes out and the bad news does not. We would be reverting to that type of discretionary system. The Ombudsman is independent and would release it, but some other body which might be fearful of the effect could argue that it would not release it. This leads to anomalies in the system and that is one of my concerns.</p>

I was amazed by some of the criticisms of the publication of the Information Commissioner's report which is of tremendous benefit to those of us in either House who wish to improve the Bill. It is extraordinary that there should be any suggestion that it should not be published. Those who have observed what has happened over the last five years in relation to freedom of information can see all the benefits, including those who may have had doubts initially.

I also wish to refer to the following comment on the Bill by him in relation to the phrase "frivolous or vexatious": "The use of the word "or" in the proposed amendment may be problematic as it suggests the addition of something not quite captured by the term "frivolous or vexatious".

It is not unusual in jurisdictions for this to happen in the early stages. It is like a new toy to some - they like to use it. Some have spent a lot of time on it. I would share in any action designed to help in that area. Let me refer the Senator to page 30 onwards in the report which involved a very long decision of mine. The sort of things I dealt with were: submission of a series of requests on the same topic; situations where the number of requests submitted by the requester was very large; requests made in bad faith. I was trying to lay down guidelines for those responding to such requests that if somebody was abusing the process, they should use the "frivolous or vexatious" provision and take their chances when the matter came before me. Having laid down that guideline I have a little concern that what the drafters have done is, more or less, put my suggestions into the Act. I already see it encompassed in the term "frivolous or vexatious". I wonder whether by adding "or" we are limiting it, rather than extending it. It is really just a small point. Sometimes, if one makes something specific in an Act, it means that it is less general. That is the point I was making in that context.</p>

I also thank the members of the committee for their questions. I now call Dr. Maeve McDonagh to make her presentation, following which we will take a short break before continuing with other witnesses. Dr. McDonagh is involved in the Freedom of Information Citizens Advisory Group.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_411">
          <from>Dr. Maeve McDonagh</from>
          <p eId="para_581">Thank you, Chairman, for allowing me to skip the queue. I beg the forbearance of other witnesses and will be as brief as possible. The context of my presentation comes from a background of teaching and research in the area of freedom of information dating back as far as the mid-1980s when I worked in Australia for a number of years. I also provided advice for the Tánaiste's office when the original Act was being formulated and, as the Chairman mentioned, I am a member of the Freedom of Information Citizens Advisory Group set up by the Department of Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">I did not come to freedom of information as a user as such. In fact, I have been involved in responding to FOI requests as a decision maker in my own institution, University College Cork. My standpoint is as an academic commentator. As such, I have participated in recent reviews of FOI legislation in Queensland and Canada. Those undertaking the Canadian review came to Ireland to discuss their review in the last year or two, not only with me but also with many of those present today, especially the Information Commissioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">I will not take up a great deal of the committee's time because much of what I would have said has been covered. I wish to make a few points from the perspective of international experience in relation to freedom of information. The report of the high level group was somewhat selective in quoting from international experience. With regard to meetings of the Government, the changes to the Cabinet records exemption recommended in the report and implemented in the proposed Bill are very broad by international standards. Like the Information Commissioner, I do not have a huge difficulty with the extension of the time limit from five to ten years which is generally in line with international practice. However, I do have a difficulty with the extension of the scope of the exemption for Cabinet records, particularly through the very broad definition of "Government" included in the amending Bill. It was not clear from this morning's discussion the reason this change was needed and no real evidence was put before us. It is worth noting that the Cabinet records exemption in the Act is virtually identical to that in place in Australia. Australian legislation has been in place for over 20 years and the Australians have not deemed it necessary to change their legislation in this far-reaching way.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">The report refers with approval to Canadian law on access to Cabinet records but in the recent review of its legislation the scope of its Cabinet records exemption was acknowledged by the review group as being too broad by international standards. The records of working groups and communications between Ministers are very likely to be exempt under section 20. There is no need to extend section 19 in the manner suggested.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">With regard to the deliberative process exemption, the review group suggested changes to the nature of the public interest test, thereby removing the presumption in favour of disclosure. This is not a good precedent in that it is important that policy documents are available. To refer to international practice, the Queensland review completed in 2001 considered this issue. Queensland has exactly the same system of public interest tests as Ireland, although it is more onerous with regard to its version of section 20. It concluded that it was best to leave the system as it was.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">With regard to the major changes in the amending Bill not recommended by the review group, the Information Commissioner has spoken to the second point I make and I will not cover that area again. The change allowing for certification by a Secretary General that a deliberative process is ongoing suggests the introduction of a two tier system of freedom of information. It provides for special additional protection with regard to the deliberative processes of Departments not available in respect of the deliberative processes of other public bodies such as health boards, local authorities and so on. This should not happen but if it is, why is it necessary to do so in regard to departmental deliberations and not those of other bodies? I am concerned at the failure to allow for appeals against the issuing of such a certificate, though I accept that the other points regarding appeals against ministerial certificates have already been covered by the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">The international relations issue is an important one. The amending Bill seeks to change the nature of this exemption from a harm based to a class based exemption. For example, one of the categories which will now amount to a class exemption is that of communications between a Minister and a diplomatic mission of the State. The changes to be introduced would mean that such communications would automatically be exempt from freedom of information regardless of what harm, if any, might result from their disclosure. Very innocuous matters could be withheld on the basis of this change, including communications from Ministers to diplomatic missions involving matters such as the purchase of Charvet shirts. This is different from what is provided for in Australia and Canada where there is a harm based test. These countries provide examples, as in the original Irish Act, of what might come within the scope of the exemption but in every case the harm based test must be satisfied.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">With regard to fees, the analysis of the review group was flawed. The introduction of an up-front fee is justified by it on two grounds: first, that present arrangements have not worked in practice and, second, that international practice favours the use of such fees. With regard to the present arrangements, the difficulty - acknowledged by the review group - is that the current powers available for charging fees are not being used. Fees can be charged for search and retrieval. A deposit can also be charged up-front before search and retrieval begin. There is ample provision in the existing legislation to charge fees to deter trawling expeditions. The commissioner mentioned that many of the perceived problems in regard to freedom of information have resulted from a reluctance on the part of public bodies to use the powers available to them under the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">With regard to the point concerning international practice, there is no application fee in the United Kingdom, New Zealand or the United States. The review group report referred to Canada and Australia, both of which provide for the charging of up-front fees. However, in both cases, the amounts charged in respect of the other elements of the charging regime - search and retrieval - are a fraction of what can be charged under the Irish Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">Another important element of the Bill not recommended by the review group is the introduction of a fee for the bringing of an appeal against refusals to grant access to records. This issue was considered in the recent Canadian review and the conclusion was that such fees for bringing appeals should not be introduced because it would deter legitimate complainants.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">I endorse the recommendation of the review group that coverage be extended. One body not covered by the Act which stands out in terms of international practice is the Garda to which I urge that the Act be extended as soon as possible.</p>

          <from>Deputy Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_592">I thank Dr. McDonagh for a concise presentation. There has not been much chance to discuss the protection of collective Cabinet and ministerial responsibility. The protection of Cabinet records covers this but the Bill goes further and seeks to protect and exempt communications between Ministers, even though those communications may never go to Cabinet or be the subject of Cabinet proceedings. With regard to Dr. McDonagh's international experience, does the protection of communications between Ministers apply in other countries? I am not aware - perhaps Dr. McDonagh is - of any significant complaints from any bodies within or outside government about faulty operation of the Act. Will Dr. McDonagh comment on whether communications between Ministers which may never reach Cabinet are covered in the jurisdictions to which she refers?</p>

          <p eId="para_594">The only jurisdiction of which I am aware where there is such a provision in place is the United Kingdom where the relevant Act is considered to be restrictive. The exemptions in the other jurisdictions mentioned are almost identical to those in our 1997 Act. Another aspect of the new provision which relates to communications between Ministers is that there will be no requirement that the communication will have to have been formulated for the purpose of dealing with Cabinet matters. In the existing exemption submissions are covered only where they have been created for the purpose of coming before the Cabinet. The rider was included to prevent abuse of the process by passing records through the Cabinet to give them the status of Cabinet records. This issue has been highlighted in other countries as an important one. It was taken on board in the original Act but is missing from the new version.</p>

          <p eId="para_596">It certainly leaves it open. The new definition of "Government" which is extremely broad appears to apply to this provision also. The need to protect Ministers' communications has been discussed but the amending Act has been formulated in a way that appears to cover communications between working groups which may not contain a Minister. I am not sure if this was meant to happen but the new definition of "Government" will have that effect. It applies throughout the section.</p>

          <from>Deputy Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_597">My second question relates to a point I raised with the Information Commissioner. I am concerned about the changes in this legislation. When the Taoiseach was speaking in the Dáil, he argued that the new provisions would have no impact on the rights of individuals to access personal information. I have been persuaded by what I have read in a number of newspapers and other documents, however, that there are significant changes to the rights of individuals to access personal information which will now be limited to records which contain information about them, as opposed to any relevant information.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">I wish to ask about the impact of these changes on tribunals and inquiries, particularly those which relate to sensitive matters such as haemophilia, hepatitis C, former residents of certain institutions and organ donations. Will Dr. McDonagh give the committee her thoughts on the possible implications of the reference and exemption for tribunal papers, allied to the change in what people can access about their personal records? Does it constitute a significant change?</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_417">
          <from>Dr. McDonagh</from>
          <p eId="para_599">I tend to agree with the Information Commissioner's view that it is possible, given the definition of "tribunal records" in the amending Bill, that references to records concerning the business of a tribunal might be interpreted as preventing the disclosure of personal information relating to persons dealing with tribunals.</p>

          <from>Dr. McDonagh</from>
          <p eId="para_601">A broader point needs to be made in relation to the impact the amending Bill will have on the rights of ordinary people, whoever they may be, whose interest goes beyond gaining access to records which relate to them personally. One of the great improvements which resulted from the 1997 Act, as well as a decision of the commissioner, was the publication of inspection reports relating to nursing homes. While it is a matter of great interest to all those with ageing relatives, it does not relate to personal information as such. The interests of the wider community go beyond one's desire to gain access to one's personal records. Much has been made of the fact that the amending Bill appears to have little impact on the right of access to personal records but there is a larger issue.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_419">
          <from>Deputy Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_602">This morning I asked the high level review group a question because I was puzzled about the reason the Department of Foreign Affairs should have a representative on it. My experience is that most of that Department's affairs are, in practice, exempt from freedom of information provisions. Does Dr. McDonagh agree that the Department enjoys a large-scale exemption as a result of the sensitivity of matters relating to Northern Ireland and global affairs? There has been a move to exempt ambassadors' correspondence and papers which may contain all sorts of information from the provisions of the Act. Is such a move mirrored in any of the international practices she has studied?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_420">
          <from>Dr. McDonagh</from>
          <p eId="para_603">No, it is not. The introduction of this class type exemption is unusual. As things stand, matters relating to international relations can be withheld if their disclosure would have an adverse effect on such relations. The fact that all that is required is "adverse effect" is not a particularly strong harm based test by comparison with those in other countries' legislation. I believe, therefore, that the protection available under the original Act is quite sufficient. There has been no outcry with regard to the disclosure of records relating to international relations. Our original provision was very much in line with that in other jurisdictions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#RichardBruton" eId="spk_421">
          <from>Deputy R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_604">One of the key elements of the amending Bill is its changes in relation to the notion of deliberative processes. The Government has decided to preclude any consideration of the public interest by the head of a Department in deciding whether to release information. In Dr. McDonagh's experience, has there been a satisfactory delineation of deliberative processes? It could be tightly defined. I am worried that the deliberative process would almost stretch like an elastic band and run from one year's Estimates into the following year's. We would always be deliberating about how much we could spend on different services. Is there a satisfactory way of foreclosing such issues?</p>
          <p eId="para_605">Dr. McDonagh's submission also referred to groups. Can she give the committee an idea of the practice in countries which have gone beyond Cabinet papers to include groups? How have groups been defined in such countries? Have they solely sought to define them in relation to a Cabinet decision in order that a group has to be appointed around a Cabinet decision and, therefore, is protected until the Cabinet has made its decision? Is that the alternative? Have Governments sought to include wider groups?</p>
          <p eId="para_606">The notion of a two tier system was also commented on by Dr. McDonagh. Is my reading of the Bill - that a Secretary General can, in effect, shut down certain aspects of Departments other than his or her own - correct? For example, could the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children shut down health boards? Perhaps the Department is closer to the Secretary General and might have his ear to convince him to shut it down but the law allows him to shut down almost anything that he could stretch to include as part of the deliberative process.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_422">
          <from>Dr. McDonagh</from>
          <p eId="para_607">The Deputy has asked three questions, two of which relate to the deliberative process exemption. There are two issues with regard to deliberative processes, the first of which is the changing of the nature of the public interest test to make it easier to withhold information. The formulation of the public interest test was deliberately chosen; it is very clear and different from all the other public interest tests in the legislation. As I mentioned, the Oireachtas debates revealed that the exemption was not intended to permit withholding of documents on the grounds that they might mislead but only where damage to the public interest was certain to arise from their disclosure. It is, therefore, a very strong provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">With regard to the point concerning the power of the Secretary General to issue a certificate which would require a head of another Department to withhold information, the Deputy is absolutely right. This matter was canvassed in some detail by the Information Commissioner when answering questions, which is the only reason I did not refer to it. I find it very disturbing.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">With regard to placing working groups under the Cabinet records exemption, this measure is unprecedented in terms of its breadth. It extends the notion of Cabinet records far beyond what is normally considered to be the scope of the Cabinet or Cabinet records exemption in other jurisdictions.</p>

          <from>Dr. McDonagh</from>
          <p eId="para_611">No, "deliberative process" is the term used in other jurisdictions on which there is a considerable amount of case law. In addition, various decisions of the Information Commissioner have drawn on international decisions in this area. While it is a difficult notion to come to terms with, it is better to have the scope of the process defined by an independent person, rather than someone involved in the process who would want to extend it for as long as possible in order to withhold records.</p>

          <from>Deputy Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_612">I wish to ask a brief question on fees that I put to the Information Commissioner. Does Dr. McDonagh consider that the decision of the European Commission on planning fees would have application in terms of the principle of charging up-front fees for accessing public information under the Freedom of Information Act? Would the same principle apply to subsequent appeals arising from requests made under the Bill's proposals?</p>

          <p eId="para_613">The up-front fee is a significant development in the context of the Bill. As mentioned, there are provisions regarding the waiving of fees which apply in respect of applications for personal information. The Bill also refers to the means of an applicant being taken into account and so forth. The provision only applies with regard to applications for information relating to oneself. As I stated, there are many other reasons one would want access to information.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">There is also a provision allowing a waiver where it is deemed by the head of a Department to be in the national interest that the information in question be disclosed. While I am not aware of the circumstances in which this waiver would be used, I presume they would be fairly limited in scope.</p>

          <p eId="para_617">As I am not clear on the reason Dr. McDonagh objects to the enhanced protection being afforded to diplomatic cables and diplomatic traffic generally, perhaps she will flesh it out a little. Perhaps I am naive but I always understood this area was afforded protection in terms of confidentiality and secrecy and that international convention provided for an element of respect for their confidentiality. Even other states, at least notionally, undertake not to interfere with diplomatic traffic. Is Dr. McDonagh arguing the case for having diplomatic traffic treated in the same way as one would treat a telephone call or telefax between two Departments of state? Given that we live in a competitive world and the international community makes a distinction with regard to diplomatic traffic, I fail to understand Dr. McDonagh's objection to enhancing its protection in the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_618">Under the Freedom of Information Act, there is a requirement that adverse effect be shown with regard to disclosure of information concerning international relations. Although there are a number of categories set out in the legislation, falling within the scope of one of them is not sufficient, which means the commissioner will examine the nature of the information in each case. If there is a prohibition on disclosure through other means, this will be taken into account. Ultimately, there is a requirement that adverse effect be established which will frequently be the case. However, the principle at stake is that there should not be a class type exemption in relation to this category of information. It should remain harm based, otherwise everything can be excluded.</p>

The question of definitions throws up difficulties. Is it not easier from the point of view of the operation of the Act to create classes of activity which are exempted? For example, what offends the Japanese in terms of injudicious comments, phrases or straightforward and frank analyses of their position, motives and so forth might not offend the Germans.</p>

          <from>Ms Mary Maher</from>
          <p eId="para_641">The National Union of Journalists welcomes the opportunity of addressing this committee and we thank the committee for the invitation. As cathaoirleach of the Irish Executive Council, I have one point I want to make very strongly, which is that we are not here to make special pleading for journalists in relation to the Freedom of Information Act. The Act is important to our members because it enables them to do the job they were already doing, and will go on doing, to a higher standard and more thoroughly. Our concern, however, is not just about how we do our job but, much more fundamentally, why we do our job. We strongly believe that freedom of information is about empowering the citizen. I cannot over-emphasise how deeply committed the union is to that view.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The president of the union, Mr. John Barsby, and the deputy general secretary, Mr. John Fray, are with us today as well as a number of other colleagues. Our delegation is representative of journalists in the print, broadcasting and academic spheres. Ronan Brady is a lecturer in Griffith College Dublin and a freelance journalist, and he has worked extensively as a consultant with the International Federation of Journalists. Fergal Bowers is a journalist and author who specialises in health issues. He is editor of irishhealth.com. Richard Dowling is a journalist with RTE and has worked as an editor on "Morning Ireland." Mr. Dowling and Mr. Bowers are both among the most effective users of FOI and have a great deal of practical experience in using the legislation. Seamus Dooley is the Irish secretary of the NUJ. In a previous life he worked at the coalface as a sub-editor in the <i>IrishIndependent </i>and as editor of the <i>Roscommon Champion</i>. I will now ask him to present an outline of the NUJ’s position.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_453">
          <from>Mr. Seamus Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_643">The NUJ is a strong proponent of open and transparent government. In using the Freedom of Information Act, journalists exercise professionally the rights conferred on every citizen. It is important in the context of the members' consideration that the Act neither discriminates against nor confers any special privilege on any category of user. When we talk about the Act or about any form of waiver, we must remember that in making a request every citizen, whether a journalist, a politician or a business person, has exactly the same rights. The use to which the information is being put is explicitly not an issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">The Freedom of Information Act was introduced following a detailed consultative process. In responding to the report of the high level group, we would first like to put on record our disappointment at the <i>modus operandi </i>of the group: the failure to consult the advisory groups established by the Government was a missed opportunity on the part of the higher civil service and of the Government itself. The NUJ takes part in the Citizens Advisory Group, which is one of a number of groups that could usefully have been consulted. We also note that there was no process of public consultation and no process of consultation with the representative trade unions within the public service. As a trade union, we have been committed to the social partnership process and we fail to see why the high level group, comprised of Secretaries General with knowledge and appreciation of the partnership model, should abandon the concept of prior consultation. It is a source of mystery to us that a Government which itself demonstrated such clear commitment to saving the partnership process should, in an area of openness and transparency, decide that the issue of public administration itself was outside the process of public consultation.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">We have long believed that the strength of the current Act lies in the effective appeals system, applied with absolute impartiality by the Information Commissioner. We wish to record our concern at the process adopted, in which he was excluded. His contribution today was useful and demonstrated what could have been happening in terms of building a consensus as part of the review. We believe that the review provided in the Act was a good idea in itself; we recognise its value. However, in our consultation with Deputy Jim McDaid, the then Fianna Fáil spokesperson, and with the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, then an enthusiastic supporter of freedom of information legislation, we were given to understand that the review would effectively be a consultative housekeeping process. We in our naiveté thought it would be about extending the boundaries: extending, for example, to members of the Garda Síochána the same right as is conferred upon members of the Defence Forces: that of access to their own records. Who could argue that members of the Garda do not have the same rights as members of the Defence Forces? Who could argue that there are issues involving the Garda Síochána which could not usefully in any review have been included in the ambit of the FOI Act?</p>
          <p eId="para_646">The report of the high level group and its use to justify amendments gives us cause for concern. Journalists have a natural curiosity, as does the public, about politicians and their expenses. Over time, that curiosity has worn off. I know enough about politics and politicians to know that one of the frustrations felt by users of the Acts is in the obsession on the part of journalists with politicians' expenses. Greater clarity and explanation in the presentation of information would have been useful in some cases, notably in the earlier stages of FOI. In reacting to stories presented under FOI, elected representatives should challenge my members and not be so defensive about the legitimate expenses they claim in the conduct of their public duties. Fewer stories about expenses and more imaginative use of the Act would be a welcome development. Ironically, if the report of the higher level group on implementing the proposed amendments is to be accepted, all journalists will be left is information about expenses. Many of the real policy issues will be excluded. We will have more stories about Deputy Parlon's credit card and fewer about policy matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">Generally, where confusion has arisen it was not because of the information released but because of inadequate explanatory material. The NUJ has been to the fore, together with the regional newspapers, in organising training in the use of FOI. I am critical of some national media organisations for not providing in-service training in this area. I am also critical of the failure of the top-level review to deal with the issue of training for citizens in the use of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">The NUJ is strongly opposed to the introduction of a flat-rate fee for FOI requests. I share the view of Dr. McDonagh in relation to charges. We are also concerned at the implications of a flat fee for smaller media organisations, including groups such as the provincial news and independent radio sectors. In a market dominated by a handful of media organisations any threat to diversity of information is of concern. Journalists work in the public interest and FOI requests benefit the public. Any possibility that managing editors or news managers employed by Independent News and Media or any other media organisation will have to take into account the cost of lodging inquiries is a real threat to the operation of journalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">We note that there is no charge for personal information. While this is welcome, to assume private individuals are only interested in personal information is, at best, to misunderstand and, at worst, devalue the role of citizens in a democracy and civic society. Citizens of this State are not just interested in personal records. Whether a person is a member of Castletown tidy towns committee or a member of a GAA club in County Roscommon, he or she has an interest in community affairs and access to information above and beyond his or her own personal records. This appears not to have been understood by the Tánaiste in her comments in the Dáil on personal records, that because there was no apparent implication for personal records in the Act, something we dispute, ordinary citizens were not affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">If a flat rate fee of €20 is set, it could spiral to €60 if all or part of a request is refused. That sum is just to get the Information Commissioner to examine a case. In addition, €20.95 per hour will have to be paid for research, retrieval and copying at 4 cent per sheet. At present a typical journalist's request can cost more than €150. Failure to pay any fee on any request will, under the recommendation of the group, debar the person from making others until it is paid. There is a technical issue that it might also debar journalistic colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">We are submitting for consideration to the committee a cost benefit analysis by Mr. Colm Murphy, a visiting lecturer in journalism, media and law, and a member of the NUJ. It outlines in real terms the estimated total net revenue from the flat rate fee. On current usage, it is estimated at €87,257, a figure that is difficult to estimate given that the high level review group has presented - Senator O'Rourke saw this as an advantage - the fact that there is now an appeal beyond the High Court to the Supreme Court. For most of our members and ordinary citizens that is not attractive. The huge cost implications of the liability to the State for contesting ongoing Supreme Court appeals are also worrying.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">Ms O'Neill acknowledged that the high level review group, in its decision on Cabinet papers, had not evidence of examples whereby Cabinet had been inhibited in the last five years from making decisions as a result of freedom of information. Deputies and Senators acknowledged that the review group had, to use Ms O'Neill's words, engaged in crystal ball gazing. With the greatest of respect to Ms O'Neill, an accomplished public servant, I invite her to give me an example of one other area of public policy where decisions have been conveyed on the basis of a group of Secretaries General sitting around and engaging in star gazing. Section 19 allows the Cabinet to release material after five years, it does not make it mandatory. The section must not be viewed in isolation of other sections of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">The issue of frivolous and vexatious use has been referred to by other speakers. We share the view of the Information Commissioner that existing powers are adequate but they must be used - they have not yet been tested. To criticise the commissioner because others have not used their powers under the Act is akin to criticising the Supreme Court for not taking appeal cases without appeal to a lower court. That is what this power is - it is one of appeal.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">We are particularly worried about the increased restrictions on individuals accessing their personal records. This is directly related to a subject mentioned already - the use of freedom of information in the health area. Mr. Fergal Bowers will comment briefly on this aspect of our concerns.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_454">
          <from>Mr. Fergal Bowers</from>
          <p eId="para_655">We are concerned, as a trade union, that individuals, including staff of public bodies, may only be allowed access to personal records containing personal information on them. This is defined in the Act as meaning information known only to them, their family or close friends. It is now envisaged that they should no longer be able to access records relating to them. This would mean that if a record relating to them was misleading, there would be no chance to amend it. There is a danger that this clause could be used to create mirror records on individuals that they know they could not access.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">In many cases individuals would no longer be told if confidential information about them had been given to a public body. This is particularly dangerous if malicious or false information is being given and used against an individual. As a user of freedom of information in the health sector, in the health area, with which we are all familiar and where life and death issues are at stake, the proposed restrictions on individuals and their access to personal information, on patient organisations, on getting answers to treatment or complaints, will have a serious effect. These individuals and organisations often come to the media with important documents secured under the existing FOI system, highlighting flaws in services or sometimes showing no failures in the process and an end to the complaint.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">At a time when everyone agrees that the health service needs major reform freedom of information is crucial for greater accountability, especially given the tragic health scandals of the recent past, the human cost to citizens and the financial cost to the State. It is clear from what we heard this morning that access to personal records and related records for inquiries or tribunals, including non-statutory inquiries, is under threat. That is a negative move.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_455">
          <from>Mr. Ronan Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_658">I am speaking to the four key recommendations of the high level review group and referring to the Freedom of Information Act 1997, not the Bill before the Seanad. The first is the question raised repeatedly in these discussions of the change from the words "may refuse" to the words "shall refuse" in section 19 covering Cabinet secrecy. The section guarantees Cabinet secrecy in line with the constitutional amendment on the subject and states Cabinet documents may be released subject to certain conditions. It is important to stress that this option has been very rarely used and that the review group noted calls from the Information Commission for greater flexibility in this regard but took the exact opposite direction, advocating the removal of this option. In this the group takes a number of matters for granted without weighing the alternatives. It is taken as axiomatic that the protection of records of Cabinet, in order that Ministers can express views freely, is fundamental to the exercise of collective responsibility and the effective functioning of government.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">We would be as one with Ms O'Neill when she referred to the need for a cone of silence around Cabinet discussions. We admit it is necessary but what is unnecessary is a blanket of secrecy covering everything related to Cabinet discussions. That is highly contentious. It reflects a view of government that confuses means with end that has been displayed throughout the discussion so far by the high level review group. Collective responsibility is not a value in and of itself, it is a means to two higher ends: consistency on the part of Government decision-making and accountability. Modern approaches to government hold that these two objectives can be arrived at by other means.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">The review group believes Ministers and senior civil servants are avoiding written briefings in favour of orals ones. Frightened of writing things down, they say what they once wrote. There is a concern that news about disagreements among Ministers will overshadow the important issues about which they disagree. If this is true from time to time in the press for which we are responsible, it is only because the excessive secrecy surrounding our form of government prevents a more balanced approach. Reporters only get a tiny keyhole look at Cabinet decisions, so it should be no surprise that insignificant details are sometimes accorded too much importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">Of course Cabinet members will have disagreements, but if their discussions were more open, reporters could concentrate on the significant and avoid the insignificant. The monolithic unity of Cabinet Ministers is a fairy tale. It is not essential for good Government. Modern ideas of Government seek to place decision making as close as possible to the individual citizen. Greater freedom of information, by definition, means more power for individual TDs and citizens. There is also the self-protection element brought in by the Information Commissioner. Recording facts is a form of self protection for people in public life, whether in the civil service or politics. This is the direction Europe has taken with the principle of subsidiarity, and until recently, this country was in the vanguard of that movement.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">In section 19(1)(<i>c</i>), the change to “primarily” instead of “solely” is based on the same outmoded logic as was its predecessor. It is even more serious because it dangerously loosens terminology, allowing all sorts of material to be covered up. The clause refers to documents “primarily” for the Cabinet, as opposed to documents “solely” for Cabinet. The broader the definition, the broader the blanket of secrecy. Once the principle of sole use is dispensed with, a very wide variety of documents can fall under the exemption, even if they never were to reach the Cabinet table.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">Then there is the exemption for communications between Ministers in section 19(1)(<i>c</i>). From the point of view of Government accountability, this is the most dangerous recommendation of the high level review group. It would end the opportunity to observe political decision making. This is an essential aspect of the democratic process. Journalists and TDs are particularly concerned with this question because the public’s right to know how and why is almost a important as the public’s right to vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">There is also the question of the deliberative process, the so-called "re-balancing" question. Under section 20 of the Freedom of Information Act 1997, a head of a Department may refuse an information request if the material concerned contains details related to the deliberative process. This is a reasonable measure designed to allow bodies to come to decisions without undue outside influence. We accept that principle. However, even after listening to the explanations this morning, we still cannot clearly see why this measure should be altered. The high level review group says this protection is not sufficient and takes a highly debatable view that the measure should be reversed. Instead of re-balancing it in favour of openness, it advocates re-balancing it in favour of closure. It is important to note that the number of disclosures under this section is quite small. That suggests the Act has not been interpreted liberally, as the high level review group would have us believe.</p>

          <from>Mr. Richard Dowling</from>
          <p eId="para_665">There are two key issues I will address. The first is the issue of the costings of political party proposals. Under section 25 of the amending Bill, these will now become exempt. Why? When does a Government become a political party in terms of an election? Would this mean that Government proposals coming up to an election would also become exempt?</p>
          <p eId="para_666">The second key issue relates to parliamentary questions. These are the responses that Ministers must give to questions from the Opposition. If the Opposition ask the right questions, they get the right information. The Minister can then speak on all this information that is being released. If the Opposition does not ask the right question, then information is not released and would become exempt under the new legislation. Why is that necessary?</p>

          <from>Deputy R. Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_668">I thank the delegation for its presentation. I shall not waste a great deal of time with comments that are largely in agreement with what the delegation says and shall instead put a few specific questions. I would like to hear the delegation describe or list specific freedom of information requests that it has been able to obtain under the existing Act but will no longer be able to in the future. I am not referring to the five-year rule, which is in a separate category. I would like to hear examples of where the witnesses foresee the Government's proposed amending Bill closing off options.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">Julie O'Neill made a very interesting contribution. She said she believed that higher protection was needed for Ministers than for public servants. I presume this is because Ministers have to seek election and the views they express can become very personalised in the media. She notes that media organisations sometimes fail to give adequate time and staffing resources to proper scrutiny of information. I ask Ms O'Neill how she thinks this balance can be struck, given much earlier access to information. To take a concrete example, if a Minister expressed views that compensation should not be paid to a certain group and that the State ought to defend its position, one could foresee circumstances in which the Minister would be excoriated as being heartless and so on. On the other hand, it could equally be argued that it would be important that this factor be viewed by Cabinet before taking a decision. How would she square those two interests? People should be accountable but, equally, their efforts should be seen in their whole context. They get it wrong sometimes but may still be contributing to the debate. That seems to be one of the concerns that lies behind this initiative.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">I also ask the NUJ delegation about its experience of New Zealand, if any, where, according to Ms O'Neill, Cabinet started behaving differently when its decisions started to be publicly released. She cited this example as a strong argument for protecting Cabinet deliberations from public view. I would like to know whether the networks of the NUJ representatives offer supporting or contrary information.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">The essence of the political party costings issue is that politics is a competitive business and parties must get proposals costed before deciding to include them in a manifesto. Thus, parties would not be keen for their competitors to see the options they are considering. That is what lies behind this aspect of the Government's proposals. Political parties should have the opportunity not only to launch policies on an unsuspecting public but to cost such policies before committing to them. There is an element of deliberative process with political parties also, particularly in the very competitive run-up to an election. It is a different matter when parties have released their manifestos or the election is over. I can see, however, a case for some protection in this regard.</p>

        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_459">
          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_672">I suggest that Richard Dowling and Fergal Bowers deal with Deputy Richard Bruton's questions in relation to stories they have worked on, as they are the two currently active journalists here. Before they do that, I wish to make two brief points. I will also ask Ronan Brady to come back on the international experience question and his role on the users' group which is relevant. There are issues about how that group functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">On the issue of political party costings, it is valid that a party which is thinking about putting forward proposals in a manifesto should be able to do so in confidence. I have no difficulty with a party approaching the Department and saying, "We are thinking of putting forward this idea." If the idea is costed and it is then discovered that it is not a runner, I would have no difficulty about a veil of secrecy surrounding it because it was actually something that was not put forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">I have a different view of a situation where a party could potentially get advice on the viability of a plan and be told that it should not run with it, but which decides on the basis of advice from a director of elections or a group of spin doctors to run with it because it was a vote getter. I would have a difficulty because the fact that the advice was given and ignored is not in the public domain. It should be possible to develop a situation whereby it is part of the deliberative process where it is only a tentative proposal. I have no difficulty with that. What I do have difficulty with, which is allowed here, is where there would be a ban, effectively, on the release. That is the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">On the area of five years versus ten years and how we square the circle I have to say I do not know. I do not know how one decides. It is a judgment call whether one decides on five or ten years. The arguments put forward after five years are as valid after ten years. In a representative democracy, as a citizen, I happen to believe that politicians should be honest and straightforward with the electorate at all times and should assume that it is a mature electorate which should be treated with total respect. I do not believe that parties have a right to hold from the electorate proposals which they are then going to implement, as happened in the case of this review.</p>

          <p eId="para_676">My experience of FOI has been positive. The existing system works well but many FOI units are understaffed and overworked because the resources are not there to meet the demands. Among the stories that I would have done, having secured FOI documents, is a story using documents revealing whether the blood bank was meeting its obligations after two tribunals of inquiry set up by the Oireachtas. Through that documentation we saw details of the plans to axe blood testing in the Cork blood service and details of the disturbing continuing in-fighting at the highest level within the blood service despite all we know of what has gone wrong in the system.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_462">
          <from>Mr. Bowers</from>
          <p eId="para_678">Yes, because that in-fighting related to a proposal by Government to have a further inquiry into issues as to why 28 blood donors in the Cork region were not told at the time they were infected. The Secretary General could determine that those were matters of a deliberative process in terms of a new probe or inquiry.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">Also interesting is that last year I sent in an FOI inquiry to the Department of Health and Children to seek documents in relation to plans for several projects this year. The Department of Health and Children, after extensive correspondence and internal review, told me that this was part of the deliberative process and could not be released in the public interest. I sent the same FOI inquiry to the Department of Finance who decided to release all documentation to me in the belief it was in the public interest. Given all the difficulties that we have in the health service, these are matters the public should know about. Among the issues that arose from that documentation, which was understandably embarrassing and controversial but in the public interest, was that despite a Government commitment to establish a heart-lung transplant programme at the Mater Hospital, the Department of Finance believed it should not proceed on cost grounds. So, the public had been told one thing, but the Department of Finance believed it should not proceed and that the Government commitment should not be met as it could not be afforded.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">Another issue discovered was how a previous health Minister who was moving to another Department, within hours, issued a directive that the national disease surveillance centre be relocated from Dublin to Offaly, his own constituency, without prior consultation. That information would not be released because it would be part of the deliberative process in terms of the transfer of an organisation to another sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">Another thing which was raised by the Information Commissioner today relates to the organ retention controversy. Under an FOI application to the Department of Health and Children we secured documentation showing how doctors at one of the biggest children's hospitals in the country were demanding a State indemnity from the health Minister, and a bar on any evidence they gave before the Dunne inquiry ever being used elsewhere for any other probe, before they would agree to co-operate with the inquiry. That information would come under a bar on documents relating to the establishment of future inquiries - non-statutory inquiries.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">FOI also showed how €15 million was being clawed back by the Department of Finance from the Department of Health and Children from the national treatment purchase fund because it could not be spent, despite the long waiting lists. That is potentially Government business. I will hand over now to Mr. Dowling on the other points raised.</p>

          <p eId="para_683">There are two stories that stand out in my records. One was on electronic voting. There was a report done by an outside consultancy regarding the safety and security of the electronic voting system. It is not clear whether that document would be completely covered by these amendments. I suspect it would be because of the definition of "Government" and going to Government the report was sent onwards and upwards in the chain of command. That report raised serious concerns about the safety of the electronic voting system.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">The Department of the Environment and Local Government did not agree with a lot of the recommendations. The point is that there was a report which expressed concern over the voting system. I think we should be able to see these reports, discuss them and hear from the Department's point of view whether they are rubbish or accurate. We need to get this information to discuss it. If, in a year's time, it turns out that there is an error with the electronic system, or it is discovered that it can be breached, and then it is found out subsequently that there was a report saying that there was this potential danger, it would be damaging. The fact that the report is now out in the open would not damage a Government or Civil Service in the years to come if there was a potential problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">The second story that is ongoing concerns the agreement with the State and the Conference of Religious of Ireland over the indemnity for the redress board. I have had ongoing communications with the Department of Education and Science on that issue. I was granted some documents. I was initially refused others, but I appealed and was granted some more but was refused others. The Information Commissioner will eventually decide on what documents I can and cannot have.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">There are key elements in the documents I already have that show the process that went on between civil servants. Initially when the deal came out it was a slow burner but as it went on more people became concerned about the indemnity and the level to which the State is exposed in terms of paying compensation. What the documents we have so far show are the reasons the civil servants and the Government did what they did. We do not have the full documentation but what we have shows the process. A lot of that will disappear if these amendments are taken and we will be left with a <i>fait accompli </i>and minimal documentation to show why that decision was reached. I believe that is not good for civil servants, the Government or the citizens at large.</p>

          <p eId="para_687">I want to talk about the appendix relating to usage and the up-to-date figures. An argument might be made by Government, I would not make it, that the freedom of information legislation is meant to be for the benefit of the individual citizen in enhancing democratic rights rather than being a journalistic investigative tool.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">At first glance, the figures might indicate that journalists are the largest single identifiable group of users. We heard this morning from the high level group that the balance between inquiries under FOI for individuals and other inquiries are something like 40 for individuals and 60 for others. My reading of these figures is that individual citizens have asked more public interest questions than journalists which seems to indicate that the potential of FOI is only being scratched as of now and there is greater potential for both journalists and the public to ask more using the existing legislation in terms of freedom of information.</p>

          <p eId="para_689">One of the things that is also overlooked when people look at the figures is that the level of use by businesses is significant. That is frequently overlooked. FOI is used by journalists, but, and I think my colleagues who are working with this on a day-to-day basis would point out that FOI was never intended as a journalistic tool, the process is simply too slow for ordinary routine journalism.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">I mentioned the issue of training. One of the problems with FOI is that ordinary citizens, and sometimes journalists as well, come to a story looking for information under FOI. However, a relationship is developed over time whereby a civil servant will say that such information is not covered by FOI and a FOI request is not required, but the information will be given anyway. I do not believe that FOI is just an issue of legislation guaranteeing access to information; it is about an ethos of government and an ethos of how we do business. Very often public servants adopt the attitude that the information is available under FOI in any case so they will make the information available now with less tears and less conflict.</p>

          <from>Deputy Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_692">I have a couple of questions to ask. The citizens' advisory group was set up by the Department of Finance some years ago. Mr. Eddie Sullivan from the Department of Finance who was with the high level group this morning made reference to difficulties with the advisory group and he also admitted that the advisory group had not been consulted. From the presentation I see that the delegation requested an urgent meeting. Who was that request made to and who turned it down? I would have thought that having regular meetings of the advisory group would be beneficial.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">As someone who served as a Minister of State in a previous Government and who has also worked in the public sector in the Dublin Institute of Technology, I have seen FOI from both sides. It has been my experience in relation to an institution like Dublin Institute of Technology that the training of decision-makers, FOI officers, has resulted in information being released into the public domain if it is considered to be within the remit of FOI. A good example is the release of student examination information in colleges. When it was discussed originally it was thought that the sky would fall in if this information was disclosed and students would be quibbling over half marks when in fact I believe the numbers of students asking for information on their examination papers stayed the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">Modern government has the services of a range of advisors and other people who deal with the media and brief journalists about Cabinet meetings on an ongoing basis to advise them on what a Minister or the Government is considering. Has the availability of FOI as it currently exists been helpful in ensuring that briefings by Ministers and their advisors and civil servants provide more detailed and accurate information than previously? I think that is one area where the spin is perhaps more elaborate, but where they are a bit more careful with the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">I wish to ask Fergal Bowers about the impact that the changes in the Act may have in relation to people who are going to tribunals. In the initial stages of the debate in the Dáil, the Taoiseach was at pains to assure the House that there were no changes in relation to the rights of individuals to access records. I am interested in what Mr. Bowers is saying about the health services and this creation of mirror records as he described it.</p>

          <p eId="para_701">I will explain the degree of influence I think I have. I telephoned and then wrote to the Department subsequent to my telephone call and asked for an urgent meeting to discuss the new Bill, whereupon I was told by a principal officer in the CPU that there was not very much that they could enlighten us about. I informed her that there was quite a lot that we would like to enlighten her about. I asked her when a meeting could be arranged and she replied that they encountered great difficulty in arranging the meetings. I believe this is the difficulty mentioned earlier by Deputy Bruton. There are four non-CPU members on our committee and one of them comes from Cork. I asked if there would be a meeting of the committee before this legislation is due to come before the Dáil on 1 April to be voted upon. I have just thought how appropriate that date is. The officer said that she could not promise a meeting before that date.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">The business advisory group has not met since 12 May 1999. The interdepartmental group last met on 26 January 2001 and the public service users' network last met on 17 May 2000. When I heard Mr. McCarthy say this morning that people with an active interest in FOI such as academics, journalists and frequent users of the legislation are channelled to that unit I did not think that was spoken in the correct tense. It should be in the past tense.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_474">
          <from>Mr. Bowers</from>
          <p eId="para_703">Some reports such as the report into the death of baby Bronagh Livingstone in the North-Eastern Health Board area have been disturbing and reports such as those could be barred from release. They were the subject of non-statutory inquiries but they may be deemed as part of the deliberative process between, for instance, the Department of Health and Children and the health board on service failings and they may never see the light of day. That is a clear example of where an investigation highlighted a lot of concerns that are still waiting to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">In relation to tribunals and other inquiries, two groups of people may be affected. Individual patients may be affected such as individual parents in the retention of organs issue. They may not be allowed access to anything more than a name and address, age and sex of their child. They will not be given access to the documents relating to, for example, the post-mortem - who ordered it, what happened to the organs and whether or not they were sent to a pharmaceutical company. Those are matters relating to an individual but the parents would not have access to them. That is a significant issue. The representative organisations such as Parents for Justice who represent 2,500 parents will have to pay higher fees as they go through the system in order to gain access to general information which will not be released under the new restrictions that are being proposed. It would have a severe effect on ordinary citizens and patient organisations preparing to go into inquiries, whether statutory or non-statutory.</p>

          <p eId="para_726">There are two issues. One question relates to the deliberative process and the other is the question addressed to Mr. Bowers. The interpretation of the deliberative process is a matter of grave concern. The former Minister of State, Ms Eithne Fitzgerald, had the experience, under the current Act, of having a question of policy in relation to unemployment turned down on the basis that since this was an ongoing issue, policy in that regard formed part of the deliberative process. The deliberative process is capable of an interpretation which is far too broad.</p>

The former Minister of State, Ms Fitzgerald, appealed successfully to the Information Commissioner. On the basis of what is now proposed, there will be no appeal mechanism. The only previous example of such power I can recall was under the Offences against the State Act whereby if a Garda superintendent said that a person was a member of a proscribed illegal organisation, that was beyond question. In the present instance, power is to be given to a Secretary General to make a decision which, in industrial relations terminology, will "red circle" one as being part of a deliberative process. One can imagine the concerns to which that could give rise. For example, in relation to transport policy, one Department might view the provision of a link to Dublin Airport as an ongoing project which, as part of the deliberative process, could continue for as long as that project may take to complete. I hesitate to imagine what would happen if Deputy Finneran were to put down a question about the drainage of the Shannon, for instance.</p>

This point was made by the Information Commissioner earlier today. There is absolutely no such evidence, except anecdotally. One extreme case has been wheeled out in a series of debates. What we would like to see happening is that the existing powers in relation to charges and to frivolous and vexatious requests would be tested. We firmly believe that frivolous and vexatious requests bring the Act into disrepute. However, civil and public servants who make the claim that the system is being clogged up should use their existing power.</p>

I submit that this committee, consisting of public representatives who deal with civil servants on a daily basis, needs to consider that the Bill would confer a special status on a small elite group of civil servants. I contend that the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science should have to operate within exactly the same framework as a chief executive officer in a health board or a librarian in a county library. What is the difference, in terms of public policy, between the operation of one group of civil servants and another? This Bill sets a different standard. The process of central administration and that of regional and local government is exactly the same. They have different functions but under existing legislation and constitutional provisions, the problem is not that the legislation is inadequate but that it is not being used properly.</p>

          <p eId="para_744">The point which is made on page four is very disturbing. The various advisory groups have not met, in some cases since as far back as 12 May 1999. It is totally unsatisfactory that the groups concerned were not involved on an ongoing basis. I acknowledge that it is a matter for the CPU to call meetings. However, Mr. Dooley said he had written two weeks ago requesting a meeting. How many such requests were made since 1999? As I see it, if members of a committee were determined to be effective, they would have initiated a process sooner than two weeks ago in relation to consultation. Perhaps I am missing out on some point but as a member of any group in those circumstances, I would have kicked the door much earlier than two weeks ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_766">There was no need for this to be a gladiatorial contest. When the Freedom of Information Act 1997 was drafted, I sat in corridors around Leinster House assisting Deputy McDaid in drafting committee stage amendments on behalf of the Fianna Fáil Party. We assisted the Progressive Democrats in drafting amendments. We sat down at joint meetings with the Labour and Fine Gael parties. There was all-party consensus on this issue, as is apparent when one reads the debates in the Dáil and Seanad during the passage of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">The reason this has become gladiatorial is the lack of consultation at an earlier stage and we do not understand why this is the case. We have known for five years that there would be a review. We do not understand the manner in which the amending Bill was published or the fact that it was delivered on a Friday which meant that Senators were debating a Bill they had not actually read because it did not arrive in time in Longford or wherever. All of that led to a situation where there was a debate, which I agree contained a great degree of heat but not much light in some respects. Again, that is not our fault. There was an opportunity to put in process at an earlier stage what this committee, to its credit, has attempted to do now. The secret of freedom of information legislation is that it is based on consensus and consultation. To put it bluntly, it does not interest any of us to be engaged in an argument with politicians in regard to freedom of information. There is an important issue to which I will return, in response to Senator White.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">Freedom of information is not about freedom of information for journalists; it is about freedom of information for citizens. Our interest in it is accessing information using our profession on behalf of citizens - no more and no less.</p>

          <p eId="para_772">In putting forward our submission, I acknowledge the valuable advice and assistance we received from Marie McGonagle who is a specialist in media law at NUI Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">In the light of what was said before we came up here, any gladiatorial comments are aimed at the Government and not at this committee. We very much respect and appreciate the work the committee is putting into this subject. The decision to review the Freedom of Information Act after five years in operation is inherently good and, in normal circumstances, would be warmly welcomed by the National Newspapers of Ireland. The closed and secretive manner in which it has been done, however, is an affront to democracy. The 1997 Act deserves an open and consultative review, which takes on board the experiences and concerns during the past five years of providers and users of information. The NNI would have been happy to contribute in a positive and practical way to such a review, but such a process did not take place. Only one viewpoint and one side of the argument was canvassed. The NNI is dismayed by the manner of the process and the nature and substance of the proposed amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">The new Bill proposes to amend 25 sections of the principal Act. While some of the amendments are technical or are necessary for clarification, others are fundamental. The Bill cannot be said to be "minimal", as has been contended by some senior members of the Government. Its effect is to row back substantially on some of the most progressive provisions of the principal Act. It is not correct to say that the Bill does not affect the rights or interests of ordinary citizens, as a senior Government figure recently stated in the Dáil. The Bill may leave intact the rights of ordinary citizens to access personal information, but it curbs their rights to access information of a non-personal nature. Most people depend on the media to access such information on their behalf. Non-personal information can be just as crucial to individuals as personal information. The Act has been used to access information on the safety of the railways and aspects of health or housing policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">The Bill has serious implications for the public, of which the media are the representatives, as people rely largely on the media to access non-personal information on their behalf. The 2001 report of the Information Commissioner, for example, shows that the media made over 3,000 of the 15,000 requests in that year. The media contributes significantly to the fostering of public debate, which is crucial in a functioning democracy, as the European Court of Human Rights has consistently acknowledged and underpinned.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">The fact that the media represent and act on behalf of the public was recognised by the Supreme Court in <i>The Irish Times v. </i>Judge Murphy, a case which related to court reporting. The judges in that case recognised the public’s right to know, as well as the importance of the media’s role in assuring that right in practice. Reference was made to “the great security of publicity” and Mrs. Justice Denham acknowledged that we live in a modern democracy, in the age of information technology. In such a democracy, information is brought into the public domain by many routes, but most people receive their information from the press. The judge said that “any curtailment of the press must be viewed as a curtailment of the access of the people.” She referred to the community’s freedom of expression as central to democratic government to enable democracy to function. Mr. Justice Keane said that “in modern conditions, the media are the eyes and ears of the public and the ordinary citizen is almost entirely dependent on them for his knowledge.” Mrs. Justice Denham further stated, in de Rossa v. Independent Newspapers, that information does not fetter discretion and that specific information would aid decision making.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">The crucial role of the media as the public's main source of information was recognised by the UK House of Lords in Reynolds <i>v. </i>Times Newspapers in relation to political reporting. In a Northern Ireland case, Turkington <i>v. </i>Times Newspapers, the same court recognised the role of the media on behalf of the public and decided that press conferences and press releases should be privileged from defamation actions. It is in light of the media’s role, on behalf of the public, that the NNI has accepted the invitation to make its views known to this committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">The way in which the amending Bill has emerged and the manner in which it is being rushed through the Oireachtas is unfortunate. Sufficient time has not been given to analyse fully the detail and impact of the proposed provisions or to produce a comprehensive study of their import and practical effect on the media's role in bringing information to the public. I welcome today's debate, which has been very informative. The NNI is asking the committee to take whatever steps are at its disposal to have the Bill deferred to allow for a reasoned debate and meaningful consultation. I should add that the time we have had to prepare this submission has been very restrictive and it is not as complete as we would like as a consequence.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">The NNI wishes to point out that the Bill will have serious consequences in Ireland and in terms of Ireland's image abroad. The Freedom of Information Act 1997 has been seen as a model for many other countries. It was actively espoused in Scotland during the drafting of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 and in many central and eastern European countries. It is regarded in Poland, for example, as encompassing the best possible legislative ideas which should be used to form the basis of the drafting of Polish legislation. It also informed the model freedom of information law, drafted under the auspices of the international organisation, Article 19, for use around the world and in south Asia in particular. Some of the proposed amendments in the Bill that is before the Oireachtas are questionable in light of the provisions of that model law.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">At a time when Irish defamation laws are drawing criticism at EU level, the Freedom of Information Act has been regarded as a bright beacon, heralding a more open and progressive society. The social development process involves the incorporation of the European Convention on Human Rights into domestic law and the updating of the defamation laws so they can be brought into line with the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights. Incidentally, a leading media law textbook, written by Robertson and Nicol, states that "defamation law is antediluvian" in this country. An order of court was issued by a monarch about 200 years ago, when this country was under British rule, prohibiting the media from making lodgements in court without admission of liability. The UK abolished this rule in 1933, but it is still part of this country's law. The urgency to make amendments in that regard contrasts with the urgency which has been shown to amend an Act that is only five years old. I must say that I am a little disillusioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">The manner in which the amending Bill has been drawn up does little to enhance confidence in the Government and the institutions of State. This committee should address that matter. It may erode confidence as it sends out a signal to the public that the Government does not value freedom and does not trust the public enough to consult it. It appears that the Government does not trust the people with certain categories of information. The Information Commissioner's 2001 report pointed out that the increase in the use of the Act was "helping to realise one of the key objectives of the FOI Act, i.e. to increase confidence in the institutions of State by ensuring a free flow of information between Government and the citizen". Such an ethos is at the heart of freedom of information and reflects the position in Sweden and other countries that have had such legislation for a long period of time. Release rates of information by public bodies under the Act are lower in Ireland than in other countries with similar legislation. The Government's commitment to the concept of freedom of information, as well as its credibility, are at stake.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">Rather than proceed immediately with the amending Bill, a process of deliberation would greatly add to the value of the Freedom of Information Act as a model for other countries and would maintain confidence in our system of government. The Government is attempting to claw back on significant aspects of openness and transparency, while demanding greater openness and accountability from other organisations in society, including the media. A <i>quid pro quo </i>is being demanded of the media in return for the amendment of the defamation laws, for example, despite the fact that they have been recognised for many years by State bodies, such as the Law Reform Commission and the Commission on the Newspaper Industry, as being in urgent need of updating, in the interests of the public as a whole, quite apart from any media and-or specific sectoral interest. Even if there have been difficulties with some aspects of the media use of the Act, some of which, including allegations of trivial, selective and sensational use of information, were referred to earlier, that in itself is not sufficient to justify curtailing the Act. It is tantamount to shooting the messenger when one does not like the message and confuses the principle of openness with the consequences of openness. There is a price to be paid for openness, but it is one worth paying in the light of its overall benefits. The prevention of embarrassment or inconvenience to Government or officials is not sufficient justification for curtailing the scope of the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">International principles in freedom of information indicate that a refusal to disclose information is not justified unless the public authority can show the information meets a strict three part test. This test requires that the information must relate to a legitimate aim listed in the law, disclosure must threaten to cause substantial harm to that aim and the harm to the aim must be greater than the public interest in having the information.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">Restrictions, the aim of which is to protect Governments from embarrassment or exposure of wrongdoing, can never be justified. The protection of the effectiveness and integrity of the Government decision making process can amount to a legitimate aim, but such exceptions as are made for this reason should be narrowly drawn to avoid including material which does not harm the public interest. They should be based on the content, rather than type of document. Substantial harm must be shown and the information should be disclosed if the benefits of disclosure outweigh the harm. The proposed amendments should be tested against these principles, rather than being railroaded through the Oireachtas with little opportunity for informed debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">Freedom of information principles also recognise that in some cases the disclosure of information may benefit as well as harm the aim. There have been examples of media use of the Act which have enhanced the reputation or improved the lot of Ministers and other officials. For example, a request from the media for the records of the names of all Deputies who had petitioned the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to drop or reduce court penalties against constituents in 2001 led to the position in 2002 by which the Information Commissioner was able to report that there had been no further requests of this nature. There is no doubt the Minister and a number of Deputies benefited from this development.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">Besides, the same accusation as that levelled against the media could be levelled at Ministers and officials who use and misuse the Act for their own purposes. The problem with the media, to the extent that it exists, can be attributed in part at least to a learning phase in the early days of the Act and can be countered, as Seamus Dooley stated, by further training. The NNI would be happy to support such training.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">Undertaking a deliberative process now rather than immediately proceeding with the Bill would allow the proposed amendments to be considered in the light of international standards and principles. As well as the manner of the review, the NNI is also concerned with the substance of the proposed changes. We have kept our concerns to a minimum. Much of the focus of the debate has been on the extension from five to ten years of the period after which Cabinet records can be released. We would have no major difficulty with this measure, provided some of the other issues would be considered in a constructive manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">Freedom of information legislation is inevitably judged by the breadth and scope of the exemptions for which it provides. The broader the exemptions, the weaker the Act. Under the Bill the exemptions currently provided for in the principal Act will be extended and strengthened and the Act weakened. Some exemptions, such as those relating to Northern Ireland and international relations which are currently in the category of discretionary exemptions, that is, information which may be refused, will become mandatory. Since there was already a discretion to refuse them in the public interest, the justification for making them mandatory is not clear and ought to be tested against the international principles referred to earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">The proposals envisage extending the concept of Cabinet and the deliberative process to include non-elected groups. Wider discretionary powers are given to Secretaries General of Departments. The proposals lack safeguards for the public and certificates can be issued from which an appeal is precluded. The proposals require detailed consideration and evaluation which can only be entered into if the Bill is deferred.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">The effects of the provision on the role of the Information Commissioner also require consideration. The interaction and impact of these and other proposals require the utmost scrutiny, which the current time schedule in the Oireachtas does not permit or envisage.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">On the subject of costs, the NNI does not wish to engage in argument on the introduction of fees, except at the level of principle. The NNI favours some consistency between Departments and public bodies in respect of the level of fees for similar types of information. I have here an example given to me in the past week concerning a request to health boards. While most health boards responded to the request and imposed an average charge of between €40 and €60, one health board demanded €600. Fees should not be used as an instrument to deter requests or exclude less well-off individuals or organisations from using the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">Some states, including the United States under the Freedom of Information Reform Act 1986, operate categories of fees according to the status of the user. They give recognition to the news function of the media, for example, in publishing or broadcasting news and information to the public. Federal courts have pronounced in a number of cases on the definition and hallmarks of the news media category. This model freedom of information law states that fees shall not be required for requests for personal information or requests in the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">I reiterate our strongly held view that a deliberative process now rather than proceeding immediately with the Bill would allow the proposed amendments to be considered in the light of international standards and principles. The NNI would be pleased to contribute to such a process in a constructive manner, given the considerable experience its members have acquired in the operation of the Act to date. I ask the Chairman to take whatever steps possible to at least delay the Bill to allow further reasoned and meaningful debate to take place and organisations such as ourselves to reflect more extensively on the proposals, consult with one another and make more informed submissions than has been possible in the time permitted us.</p>

          <p eId="para_795">I appreciate and welcome the comprehensive response of the NNI. I was particularly taken by the organisation's commitment to get involved in the deliberative process. How much additional time does the NNI require to complete its internal consideration and deliberation of the issues? Mr. Cullen has addressed many of the relevant issues and his views on many of them, including his open view on fees, will have to be taken into consideration by the Government. Does the NNI wish for time to deliberate on the proposals before returning to us with further information?</p>

          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_796">Yes. An organisation requires time to conduct deliberations. We have to consult upwards, downwards and across 12 newspapers. Furthermore, we would also like to consult at a European and international level, particularly as the Act has generated significant interest internationally. Many people have complimented this country on the progressive freedom of information legislation we have had in place for the past five years. It would be a pity if we were to lose our good standing built as a result of this legislation, which is regarded as a model for others.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">We do not oppose amendments <i>per se </i>and are happy to have legislation reviewed frequently, but we would like them to be put to some international test to ensure we do not jump off the deep end and return to a more closed society. It is difficult to say how much time we require, but six months would be sufficient. The legislation should be deferred until autumn.</p>

          <p eId="para_798">The Labour Party's Bill proposes waiting for one year. However, I am sure we could negotiate on the proposal to wait for six months. Clearly, from time to time, senior civil servants, Ministers and other politicians have been irked and annoyed by the publication of trivial stories. The NNI has extensive experience in the newspaper industry. Is it Mr. Cullen's view that more minor, embarrassing stories are now published about politicians as a consequence of the Freedom of Information Act than was the case previously?</p>

          <from>Mr. Gerard Colleran</from>
          <p eId="para_800">I wish to express my appreciation for the invitation to attend here today. I met a Member of the Oireachtas earlier who said he heard I was attending the FOIFU hearings. In that case "U" means the ordinary citizen. I am not sure there is a point in these hearings, either as an editor or a citizen. The people who decide on this matter to contain the flow of information to the sovereign people are not even here. The attack on freedom of information is apparently a done deal. It is going through like an express train. The Taoiseach is not in the country. Where is the Minister for Finance? He is apparently backing horses in Cheltenham. I do not know what luck he is having. We will hear what he has to say at some later stage but I am not sure he really cares.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">Where is the Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon? The report is that he is carrying the Minister, Deputy McCreevy's bag in Cheltenham. I presume we do not have to put in a freedom of information inquiry to find out why two people working in the same Department, the boss and his deputy, take a hike at the same time. It is not the sort of thing that would happen in the tiniest corner shop. We are invited here to dignify what to me amounts to a charade. Quite frankly, I am rather reluctant to provide a fig leaf for this nonsense, with every respect to this committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">The creation of a <i>cordon sanitaire </i>which cuts off the flow of information from the very heart of Government will have the effect of making what goes on in the Oireachtas even less relevant to the ordinary people of the State than is already the case. Members of the Oireachtas should realise how sad and disappointing recent voter turnout figures are. In the first referendum on the Treaty of Nice two out of three people did not bother to vote. In the second referendum one out of two failed to show. In last year’s general election four out of ten people did not bother to vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">However, since I am here and the committee has asked my opinion I suppose it is important to focus on one particular issue. A key element of the current legislation is that after five years we may be able to inquire into what mistakes, if any, are at the heart of Government administration, what these mistakes have cost and who caused them. The point is that a five-year term allows accountability from people who may actually then be serving. What is the point in having accountability where people have already retired?</p>
          <p eId="para_804">Information is not a privilege to be mediated by servants of the people who are self-interested, conflicted and compromised. What have the administrators and servants of the people to hide? What are they doing that is so wrong? It is my firm belief that there is an extraordinary poverty of democratic principles and ideology at the heart of the proposed legislation. The people do not count. They are seen as an impediment to good government. Essentially this attack on the freedom of information is an act of extreme contempt against every single citizen of this State. That is my opinion on the manner in which the Government has behaved.</p>

It is a sign of the importance and significance of this committee that we are sitting at this time after a long day to give people the opportunity to present their views. We welcome the views although we may not fully agree with everything that is said. I reject two points in particular, the first being that we are wasting our time. This is an all-party committee of TDs and Senators. We are here of our own volition, not on behalf of any Minister to offer a charade.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">There has been a lack of reportage in certain papers of our activities. In recent weeks the Ombudsman appeared before the committee. He is here today wearing his other hat of Information Commissioner. He presented to us his first report in regard to his dissatisfaction with the treatment by the Revenue Commissioners of some widows of retired former public servants. This committee succeeded in getting the full implementation of the Ombudsman's report in the Finance Act that went through the Oireachtas in the past fortnight. While we may not be as effective as we would like, we have been quite effective. We are not the Government.</p>

This process will continue into the month of April. While I do not know the outcome yet I hope that as a result of our deliberations today, we will be successful in achieving some amendments. Irrespective of whether we like it, the principle of the ten year rule has received general support across the Oireachtas. I agree that there are other aspects which do not have such support and we are all now far better informed as a result of being here since 10 o'clock this morning. We appreciate the contributions that were made and hope that those who contributed accept that we are entitled to disagree with their point of view.

We are the representatives of the people, not just representatives of the Government. We are engaging in a public consultation process so that we are in a position to go back to Government next week to suggest changes to certain aspects of the Bill. I hope there will be some productive outcome to our work before it is concluded within the next month. That is a personal observation.</p>

        <speech by="#JoanBurtonLAB" eId="spk_551">
          <from>Deputy Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_812">It is appalling that we have had to resort to the device of having this committee hearing today to get the views of people who are interested in the Act. In the hearings we have not included some groups because of the pressure of time, community groups or representatives of environmental groups or bodies such as An Taisce, people who are interested in information about where incinerators are to be located.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">We learned of this Bill on Friday two weeks ago. At that stage most of us had left the Dáil and we did not get the Bill until later that weekend on the Internet or on Monday in the post. It was interesting to hear today that the high level group clearly saw itself as simply having an input into a process and not the designers and writers of the Act. One might argue that it should perhaps have seen that role for itself, given its elevated position in the public service. Nonetheless, it made clear, to me at any rate, that it did not have any objection to other people having an input into the consultation process.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">Another important point which emerged from today's deliberations and recent media coverage is that in spite of the Taoiseach's statement in the House, which was reiterated by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the other evening, that there was no impact in the legislation on individuals in regard to them accessing records, what we have heard alerts us to the fact that there is a great deal of danger in regard to people accessing personal information. Much anguish has been caused to hundreds of thousands of individuals involved in tribunals or inquiry processes of different kinds, particularly those who have gone through the various health-related tribunals or those who were in industrial schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">They are two solid achievements from today. This committee is made up of representatives of both Government and Opposition, although it is obviously dominated by the Government side. I am not sure if an agreed report can emerge from this committee. As a member of the Labour Party, I brought forward a Bill two weeks ago to make what is in political terms a very generous offer to postpone the Government Bill for a year to allow the consultation process to take place. However, bearing in mind the consultation process and the view Opposition parties will be obliged to take if and when they are in government, it is important to identify the key areas in which there is a roll-back from the culture of freedom of information.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">All Governments now have a very significant army of PR personnel. Obviously, a Government will issue information about episodes such as the death of Bronagh Livingstone in Monaghan, but the Freedom of Information Act empowers a journalist to glean information on such a story not just from Government and its officials, on or off the record, but from an independent source. The family involved also has this independent means of searching for further information subsequently. Today we have seen a threat to that process.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">Although this Bill was at first perceived to be a little esoteric, many people now feel it may well affect them in their dealings with State in the future, if not at the moment. I know the delegation has been waiting all day and I thank it for attending.</p>

          <from>Deputy Boyle</from>
          <p eId="para_818">I agree with much of what Deputy Burton has said. I am certainly not part of a <i>cordon sanitaire </i>for any Minister or his bagmen. There are political realities to be faced and contempt has been shown in the production and delivery of this Bill. The challenge for the Oireachtas is to confront this contemptuous behaviour and to try to present alternatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">Having heard today's presentations, I am confident that there are enough holes in the Bill such that both Houses of the Oireachtas will be able to improve it substantially. The Government has to respond to much of the information we received today, particularly in light of the high level group's report that was meant to have an input into the Bill and the contributions of other bodies on the extent to which our legislation fits in with similar legislation around the world. The NNI presentation is beneficial in this respect as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">This morning, the high level group stated that it wanted Irish legislation to fit in with more aggressive legislation elsewhere, whereas the NNI is making it clear that the Irish legislation is regarded as a model in other parts of the world. Maybe we are selling ourselves short in that there are other models to which we can aspire which would enable us to improve the Bill. I would value any comments the delegates have to make on that subject.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">A central point concerns the indecent haste of the Government to change the Act although there are other aspects of public information legislation that need to be changed, particularly libel law. This indicates the priorities of the Government, which must be challenged by Members of the Oireachtas in whatever way they can.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">I value the patience the NNI delegates have demonstrated today. I assure them that there is hope and a possibility of bringing about a different climate and improvements to what has worked in this significant legislation. We need to be supportive of groups outside the House to make sure the changes being proposed by Government do not come about and that changes that will improve the legislation are made.</p>

I want to refer to the distinction between those who are in government and those who are not. I do not mean party members in government but people in government because my party discovered information in this respect at the same time as members of the Opposition. It surprised us just as much as it did them. It is from the media that one obtains this kind of information. I would hate to think that because one is on the Government side, one is necessarily behind a particular measure.</p>

          <from>Mr. Farrelly</from>
          <p eId="para_834">I empathise with my colleague's passion because he works at the coalface of journalism where one is frustrated every day while trying to obtain information. I and the NNI hold this committee in high regard. It is fair to say that it is contributing largely to what we want, which is to be involved in discussions on the Freedom of Information Act. As our submission made clear, we are concerned about the speed at which reform is taking place. This is unusual in that the people who are made accountable by the Act are the persons who are proposing the adjustments. Rules of natural justice should apply, not just for the sake of the media but for the sake of the citizens and for good governance and social development. I know this is what the Chairman and his colleagues want. The great attendance by Members at this committee makes it quite clear that there is great interest in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">There is an essential liberty called freedom of expression. There is a corollary to that which is that people have a right to know. When there is openness, frankness and transparency, we have good economics and good governance. I know the committee wants that and we want that too. The Deputy asked whether the Freedom of Information Act was being utilised for smart cheap-shots at political leaders. That was addressed in my submission, in which I said that the most important thing is that democracy is seen to work and that essential freedoms are upheld. Major decisions are being taken about our infrastructure and taxation which affect our everyday lives. For the rationale behind those decisions to be held up to public scrutiny is good for democracy. Sometimes, when inquiries are made, the Government is seen to be running well.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">The Freedom of Information Act is important for our future because it tells people abroad how we like to conduct our business and expresses a view about our culture and whether that is modern or antediluvian. There are many things which are done in government of which we should be proud and sometimes when inquiries are made, they show good decisions. However, there are some problems and sometimes it is better for the Government if information comes out correctly rather than being leaked out through a side show.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">I thank the committee for meeting us and listening to our submissions. Our views are made clear in our written submission. This process will be beneficial and will act as a catalyst for ensuring we have consultation and that the correct adjustments and decisions are made. I hope they will be made for the benefit of the country, both for our politicians and the media.</p>

          <from>Senator O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_838">I empathise with the useful points made by Mr. Farrelly. They change what I was about to say. I was about to say to Mr. Colleran that he is a messenger that needs to be shot at this stage but he has turned my view around.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">Having spent 25 hours in the past week arguing, fighting and struggling on this Bill, the last thing I wanted to hear was someone telling me I was wasting my time because I could have been somewhere else a long time ago. I am here to learn and bring forward improvements to the Bill, which I have been working on for some time with my colleagues. We decided to have this meeting today to create a certain atmosphere and it has worked well. Partly because of this and other reasons, we have managed to have Report Stage of the Bill in the Seanad deferred from today. That is a huge change in terms of where we were two days ago. These are the small things one works on.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">I am also somewhat resentful towards the media. This committee meets regularly and the last time we met the Information Commissioner about dealing with problems where a large number of widows were badly treated by the State. The committee, including Government members, took a strong view but there was little public interest in it. However, the reason we have managed to make progress today is, no doubt, partly because of the involvement of the media. The media would do well to recognise that there are issues dealt with here which could do with some media support now and again. However, Mr. Colleran is correct in many of his points.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">In fairness to my Government colleagues, they have privately expressed their concerns about issues, which they could not do publicly and will not thank me for pointing out. The value of this engagement is that the media are giving Government members the ammunition to raise at meetings of their parliamentary parties. This is one of the reasons those of us on the non-Government side want these sessions to take place so that they are given that information. They will be stuck with their party's decisions because that is how politics works, but this is an important meeting nonetheless. Government members have been open in their questioning and their comments over the course of the day. The progress we have made is to be measured in inches rather than miles and I am tired with the lack of progress over the past week. However, I hope that over the coming month we will make further progress. I will also recommend to the committee, and hope it takes the view, that the Government should listen to what we have learned.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">The first indication of whether that is successful is whether Report Stage of the Bill is put back further from next Thursday. That is why I asked the initial question. This is a serious engagement which will lead on to matters. Speaking as a disinterested Independent, I believe we can move matters forward.</p>

          <p eId="para_845">Mr. Cullen has a valid point when he talks about changing the laws of defamation and libel. It has been a consistent theme among his industry group, myself as a former journalist, the Law Reform Commission and other worthy people.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">The using of cheap shots such as that used by Mr. Colleran in <i>The Star </i>about the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, being in Cheltenham, with the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, carrying his bags, is not the best way to win friends and influence people to address defamation issues and make changes to FOI legislation. The same applies to Deputy Rabbitte who used similar terms. Does Mr. Colleran not understand that there is a political class of people - Government, Opposition and Independent Members - who might be suspicious of the media carrying gifts, saying they will transform their lives if only they would change the laws of libel and defamation?</p>
          <p eId="para_847">Is this the kind of commentary we will be subjected to on a highly personalised basis? Will Senator O'Toole not be allowed to go on holidays or take a break at Listowel Races without it being the subject of an editorial in <i>The Star </i>newspaper? It will be interesting to look back on what has been said today. I would like to hear from the NNI. Mr. Farrelly said that the common position does not represent the NNI. We can do without that kind of debate on any issue, most importantly in relation to libel. It is cheap shot journalism.</p>

          <p eId="para_848">The committee accepts the delegation's forthright comments. We are mature people who meet people on the street every day and we take the comments, robust as they are. I mean this to be provocative rather than smart, but I suspect no other organisation has profited more from FOI legislation that the National Newspapers of Ireland. Releases under the Freedom of Information Act 1997 have given more front page headlines and sold more newspapers than any other event, possibly excepting the tribunals, in recent times. It is important to recognise that we have different roles. The NNI's job is to sell newspapers, on which it has expressed its views with an eye to its customers. We have the same type of customers. However, the NNI should address its comments to us. This organisation benefits enormously financially from the release of information under the FOI Act. It is not an insignificant element of its reportage on a continuous basis. I would like the observations of the representatives on that. This is not meant as a dig——</p>

          <p eId="para_849">I am entitled to respond briefly to Deputy Lenihan. I accept his characterisation of my comments as "cheap shots". I have no problem with that. However, cheap shots play a part in democratic debate. The issue of taste and tastelessness is the death of a democracy which allows people to express views that many if not most others would not regard as tasteful. However, even if it was a cheap shot, it is personal and scurrilous to refer to somebody attending this committee as suffering from intellectual dyslexia. In fairness, the Chairman should ask for such pejorative commentary to be withdrawn. I am here by invitation and I do not expect that type of personal abuse.</p>

          <p eId="para_863">We did not come here to enter into this sort of personal debate. Our submission stands as we have put it to the members. We came here in a constructive spirit with three editors who took the afternoon off to be here. We stand over everything we said. We fully respect the work of this committee. I have personally worked with a number of Deputies and Senators at this table on the very complex Copyright and Related Rights Bill in the not too distant past and the committee work proved extremely beneficial to the final Act that was passed. I have every confidence that the committee will be able to deliver amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">It is important that more time is given to this Bill. There is much frustration out there - much of what was thought and written in the past few days was done without the knowledge of what is going on here. There was a fear that this Bill would be passed by the weekend, with guillotines and so on. It appears, from the comments I heard today, that things are slowing down. I would advise, as would many other people, slowing down further and consulting further. There are many people who will make constructive contributions. At the end of the day we have legislation of which we can be as proud as the existing Act and that will continue to stand as a beacon in the international world, giving Ireland a positive reputation. I urge Deputy Lenihan to take on his shoulders the task of defamation law reform and I will be with him all the way.</p>

I thank the members, the press and those people who were in the public gallery during the course of the day. We will meet again on Wednesday morning. The meeting may run into the afternoon, but we will decide on Wednesday how we will conclude our business. One or two groups will come in first thing on Wednesday, after which we will conclude our own business.</p>
