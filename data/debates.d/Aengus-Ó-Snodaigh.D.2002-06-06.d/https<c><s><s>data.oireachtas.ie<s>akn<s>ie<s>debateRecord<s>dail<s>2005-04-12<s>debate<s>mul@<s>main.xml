          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_1">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_7">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 6, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8">There are no specific plans at present to hold any referenda during 2005. The treaty to establish a constitution for Europe was signed at a ceremony in Rome on 29 October 2004. Member states of the EU must have completed their ratification processes by 1 November 2006. As the Deputies will be aware, I have indicated my intention to hold a referendum on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_9">The Government has acted on most of the key recommendations which have emanated from the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. In all, this and the previous Government have brought forward ten referenda. The Government will avail of appropriate opportunities to take forward further recommendations of the all-party committee. The complexities involved in holding a referendum require that careful consideration be given to the frequency with which referenda can realistically be held and the significance of the issues in question.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_10">Fáiltím roimh an Taoiseach tar éis an sos. I welcome the Taoiseach back by giving him an assurance. If the electorate votes in favour of the proposed EU constitution in a referendum and, as the Taoiseach as indicated perhaps it may not be this year, I assure him that although my arguments will not have won I will not call for a second referendum. Will the Taoiseach reciprocate that assurance? Will he assure the House that in the event of the electorate rejecting the EU constitution in referendum that he will not again present the arguments in a second referendum? That would be a fair exchange at the outset of this term and I hope the Taoiseach will reciprocate the assurance I have given him.</p>
            <p eId="para_11">If the referendum on the EU Constitution is not to be held in 2005 when is it proposed to hold it? Is it possible that the Taoiseach will hold off so it can be held in tandem with an early general election in 2006? We are all interested to hear what he has to say on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_12">Will the Taoiseach ensure there is full access to information on the text of the EU constitution? I understand we are talking about 564 pages of text but I do not want that to sound prohibitive. Will the Taoiseach outline the steps he proposes to take to ensure full and fair access to all the relevant information in the document? Has he noted the steps the Spanish Government has taken in the lead up to its referendum? What measures does he and the Government propose to take? Will he give an assurance to the House and the electorate that a fair and balanced executive summary will be available, that it will not be the peddling of one line of argument but that all the pros and cons will be outlined in a fair and equitable way?</p>
            <p eId="para_13">The website of the Department of Foreign Affairs says there is a publicly accessible fund for promoting information about the EU constitution. Will the Taoiseach assure the House the fund will be available to all sides in the argument and not to promote only one view on this important debate that has yet to get under way?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_14">As I stated there is no Government decision on the matter yet but the referendum has to take place before 1 November 2006. Preparations are already under way. Work on the legislation is under way. A Bill will come before the House sooner rather than later. The Referendum Commission will then put forward the balanced arguments as per the procedures. An explanatory document on the EU constitution has already been circulated. Work on a White Paper is well advanced. The EU constitution is available either from the Department of Foreign Affairs or the European Commission on demand. It is already on a number of websites. The Government is actively engaged in ensuring people understand the contents and significance of the constitution. I note what the Deputy said in the context of the referendum being defeated. Naturally I want to see it passed. There is no other plan. Ultimately, it has to be passed in all countries. Last year the European Council laid down procedures in regard to the issues that have to be dealt with close to 1 November 2006. The Government will do all it can, as will the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs, to ensure all the information is available.

            <p eId="para_16">Arising from the question will the Taoiseach confirm that it is desirable to have the Referendum Commission established as soon as possible to address the issues raised by Deputy Ó Caoláin and others that there should be full, objective information available to as many citizens as wish to participate in obtaining that information? Will he agree that following that desirable objective it is necessary for the legislation to be initiated sooner rather than later in this House? Given that it is a constitutional referendum Bill it is required to be moved in this House rather than the other House. If that Bill was moved between now and June it would enable the commission to be established for the preparation of information and for factual objective documentation to be prepared in a format that maximises the transfer of information and minimises the delivery of confusion which happened in the past with some referenda.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">I am aware that a referenda will be held on 29 May in France and in the Netherlands in June. Notwithstanding the prospects for those referenda, will the Taoiseach agree we should bring forward the legislation sooner rather than later for deliberation by this House and that the Referendum Commission should be established without delay? It is a matter for the Government to decide the appropriate time for a referendum to be held to ratify the European Union Constitution which is a good thing and which brings together the existing five referenda and five treaties which we have ratified.</p>

            <p eId="para_18">I agree with all the points made by the Deputy. The sooner the House deals with the legislation the better and, if possible, I would like to complete it. The establishment of the commission is crucial and that depends on the legislation. The information can then be dealt with in the manner outlined by the Deputy, with which I agree. A decision on the date for the referendum can then be decided.</p>
            <p eId="para_19">An explanatory leaflet on the European constitution is available in public offices and places. Commissioner Wallström made it clear during a recent visit a few weeks ago that the European Union would make the text of the European constitution available on demand through its offices. I accept that not many people will wish to read the entire text of the constitution but they may wish to read the White Paper and explanatory memoranda and consider the objective case made. In particular they should study the importance of the charter on fundamental rights because that will ultimately confer rights on the citizens which they have not been given under similar treaties. Other than that, everything else is similar to the position in the treaties already ratified.</p>

            <p eId="para_20">Is the Taoiseach aware that a recent Eurobarometer research indicated — I do not know whether we can believe this — that 45% of Irish people had never heard of the existence of the EU constitution, never mind be aware of its content? If there is any relevance or truth in that report, it is obviously very serious. I ask the Taoiseach to outline the steps the Government intends to take on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_21">Is the Taoiseach concerned that, in his Government's consideration of the timing of the referendum, there will obviously be a very strong Eurosceptic lobby from elements of the UK media which would be contrary to the general perception here of the importance of the European Union and the constitution? What is the Taoiseach's view on that matter? Will the Taoiseach take this into account in the Government's consideration of the timing of the referendum?</p>
            <p eId="para_22">The All-Party Committee on the Constitution discussed the matter of Northern Ireland representation in the Oireachtas. What agreement was reached on this by the Government last year? Before the talks broke down, was an agreed proposition put to the Northern Ireland parties in respect of such representation? If so, did it involve representation and speaking rights in this Chamber or at committee meetings outside the Chamber? If such a development is part of a package of Dáil reform, there seems to have been little discussion about it. Will the Taoiseach outline what elements of a proposal were put to the Northern Ireland parties in respect of representation in the Dáil and Seanad and at committees?</p>

          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_8">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_23">The periodical Eurobarometer polls indicate a high level of support in Ireland for the European constitution. However, it is clear that a job must be done to ensure all citizens are informed. We have already published an explanatory guide to the constitution and will publish a White Paper. The Referendum Commission, which will be established shortly, will be given the resources to ensure that accurate and factual information is made available.</p>
            <p eId="para_24">I do not wish to comment on figures, some of which are contradictory and depend on the manner in which questions are put. However, there is strong support for the constitution among those who express an interest. The 480-page constitution is a bulky document and the costs involved in producing a copy for every voter may not be necessary. It is available for those who wish to acquire it and is posted on the website. As on previous occasions, the Government will bring forward a White Paper and resources will be provided to the Referendum Commission. After that it is for people to make the objective case for the constitution. There is a strong benefit for this country in supporting it and I will make that case in every way I can.</p>
            <p eId="para_25">Referenda on the constitution are taking place in many EU states and each will have its own debate in this regard. Those who espouse a Eurosceptic view have targeted this country on previous occasions in recent years through media vehicles and otherwise. At least on this occasion such persons will be able to vote on the matter in their own country. We will not interfere in the debate in other states and we hope Eurosceptics will allow the Irish people to make their own decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_26">The discussion on Northern Ireland representation in the Oireachtas has been ongoing for some years. The proposals we brought forward last December emanated from the discussions that took place as part of the search for a comprehensive agreement. This was in a spirit consistent with the constitutional principles underlying the agreement and the conclusions of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. I said at that time I would consult with party leaders with a view to establishing a mechanism whereby MPs elected in Northern Ireland constituencies could make an input into the deliberations of the Dáil with regard to Northern Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement. I made it clear that any proposals that might be agreed by the Oireachtas would not involve the granting of any rights or privileges.</p>
            <p eId="para_27">Regarding Seanad reform, I said I would support the holding of a referendum before a general election to increase membership to allow Northern representation. Such representation has been taking place for many years on an <i>ad hoc</i> basis. The appointment of such Senators would be done in consultation with party leaders in Northern Ireland and in such a way as to represent, where possible, a cross-section of public opinion. They were the two proposals. One was made about the Dáil and the other about the Seanad.</p>
            <p eId="para_28">I also said that, in the context of a comprehensive agreement, I would ask the Leader of the Seanad to discuss with the parties taking the necessary procedural steps to facilitate allowing MEPs elected here and in Northern Ireland to speak in the Seanad on periodic debates on EU matters. I cannot say at this stage when we might get around to advancing any of these proposals because they were all based on the comprehensive agreement.</p>

            <p eId="para_29">I have a number of questions, most of which could be answered with a "Yes" or "No". Given the Progressive Democrats' declaration that electronic voting was expensive, undemocratic and unworkable, is it now the view of the Government that electronic voting will not be used in any constitutional referenda? Can we look forward to a referendum without the complication or controversy of electronic voting?</p>
            <p eId="para_30">Is the Taoiseach prepared to accept that the EU constitution cannot be accepted if the French reject it? As he stated, all countries need to ratify it. Is that the <i>de facto</i> position? It is certainly indicated in polls but we await the real poll.</p>
            <p eId="para_31">Although the Taoiseach said the White Paper is well advanced, will he state the month, if not the day, when it will be produced? As Deputy Kenny said, there is a need for information. Will the Taoiseach listen to the Referendum Commission on this occasion? In the past it has been very dissatisfied over its being established so late in the day. Will the commission be established at such a time as to afford us the best opportunity to impress the reality of the constitution on the public mind?</p>
            <p eId="para_32">Is it envisaged that another referendum or election will take place on the day set for the referendum on the EU constitution? Has the Taoiseach considered the legal arguments that the Irish Constitution may need to be amended to allow the EU battle groups, for example, to operate? Article 15.6 of Bunreacht na hÉireann states clearly that it is for the Oireachtas alone to raise or maintain a military or armed force. If other countries are involved in raising an armed force that is to train in Ireland, for example, a constitutional issue will have to be addressed. Has this been reflected upon and, if so, has there been any outcome? Will there be a referendum on the compliance of the battle groups with the Constitution?</p>

            <p eId="para_33">The question on the Referendum Commission being able to commence its work will be addressed when the referendum Bill is brought before the House. It is intended to introduce it as soon as possible. This is in everyone's interest and will allow us to proceed with the debate and associated issues. It is the obligation of each member state to pass and ratify the EU constitution. Regardless of what other countries do, we have an obligation to deal with the matter ourselves. It is not for us to be watching what other countries are doing. Obviously we should take an interest but we have an obligation to try to ratify the constitution before 1 November 2006. This obligation was imposed on us when we agreed to the constitution. Our task is to ratify it and not to comment on what other countries are involved in.</p>
            <p eId="para_34">It is obvious that the sooner we deal with matters in this House, the longer the Referendum Commission will have to deal with the issue. I agree with the Deputy's remark on the timeframe. We have already said we will provide the resources then people can see the facts. The Minister for Defence said that the issue of the battle groups is being considered to see whether it requires legislation or raises any constitutional issues. He will clarify that when the examination is finished.</p>
            <p eId="para_35">When the Government decides on the date it will consider whether there are other issues to deal with. It is no use speculating but while at the time other issues may arise I do not know of any.</p>

            <p eId="para_39">Has the Government discussed the question of discrimination against women in the home? The Irish Human Rights Commission called for a referendum on the deletion of Article 41.2 of the Constitution. The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution recommended the deletion of the article and its replacement with a different form of wording to the effect that the State would recognise that family life gives society a support without which the common good cannot be achieved, and that the State endeavour to support persons caring for others within the home.</p>
            <p eId="para_40">Has the Government considered the implications of that and has it contacted the Irish Human Rights Commission? Does the Government intend to hold a referendum on this other proposal, if accepted, on the same date as the referendum on the EU constitution?</p>

            <p eId="para_47">In regard to France, the Netherlands and several other countries holding referenda we have an obligation to pass the European constitution here. In November 2006 the European Council will examine the position. If 90% of countries ratify the constitution by then it will decide on how to proceed. The outcome is not influenced by what happens in any one country. We have an obligation to fulfil and the European Council will make its judgment in November 2006. I would like all countries to pass it, particularly France, which is an important member of the European Union but that does not influence our work.</p>
            <p eId="para_48">The All-Party Oireachtas Committee on the Constitution has produced nine reports dealing with various issues, many of which have been implemented. We have a good record on the recommendations. Most of the significant proposals have been acted upon, for example, issues regarding the death penalty, judicial oversight — although the Dáil did not pass that — abortion and local government recognition. Many of the other recommendations did not require constitutional amendments but we dealt with the important matter of the scrutiny of EU business. Many other matters are under consideration in Departments. When we get an opportunity, we try to include them in the reports. The All-Party Committee on the Constitution is currently working on issues relating to children and the family.</p>

            <p eId="para_49">I would like to pursue with the Taoiseach the question of the price of building land. Today Davy Stockbrokers predicted another boom year, which at least is different from the usual economists' reports which, whenever there is a threat to the price of building land, state the prices of houses will tail off next year and that increases will be in line with inflation. We have been hearing this for approximately seven years but it has not happened. Given the Taoiseach has discovered what we on this side of the House told him, namely, that a constitutional amendment was never necessary, and that he has been assured of that by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution, what action, if any, does he intend to take on the question of building land?</p>

            <p eId="para_50">Whatever about outside economists' reports on building land, over the last number of years we have proved the capacity in the country to build a record number of houses. The rate of price increase significantly reduced as we dealt with the issues of supply and demand, which is significant.</p>
            <p eId="para_51">The All-Party Committee on the Constitution report did not find that a constitutional amendment is necessary to allow for a reform of the existing system of compulsory land purchase. However, it suggested that the wording of the Constitution in this area could be improved. That also sounds like an economist's report. There has been the NESC report, PricewaterhouseCoopers report and the All-Party Committee on the Constitution report. The Minister is bringing forward proposals on what further steps are necessary in this area, which I hope will happen in the next few weeks.</p>

We brought forward many initiatives over recent years, which is why the supply of housing in this country has increased from a stagnant 20,000 to 25,000 homes to the current figure of 75,000. From the examination of these reports over the past year or so, there are a number of other useful initiatives, including affordable housing, and these will shortly be brought forward.</p>

He mentioned that if 90% approval could be garnered the next stage could be planned. I would like some clarity on that because it seems that if the Irish, the French or the people of any other member state were on their own in rejecting the treaty that would not make a whit of difference; ratification of the treaty would proceed based on the 90% approval rate the Taoiseach mentioned. Will he clarify what he means by saying that a meeting would take place to plan the next stage if there was 90% approval of the treaty? Is 100% no longer the requirement for it to be fully acceptable?</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_112">I propose to take Questions Nos. 62 and 63 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_113">I am informed by the Garda authorities that the robberies referred to by the Deputies are the subject of ongoing investigations. I understand the Garda authorities have set up an incident room at Santry Garda station to investigate the two robberies of security vans in Dublin during the month of March and an extensive investigation is under way.</p>
            <p eId="para_114">The available information regarding the total amount taken in raids on security vans and the number of such cases in which charges have been laid relates to 2004 and 2005 to date. With regard to 2004, approximately €3.4 million was taken in raids on security vans. Six people are before the courts in relation to these raids. I am further informed that since the beginning of 2005 approximately €5 million has been taken in raids on security vans and that three people are before the courts charged in relation to these raids.</p>
            <p eId="para_115">In regard to action taken before the recent robberies, as the Deputies are probably aware, Operation Delivery was initiated in June 2004 in direct response to the increase in robberies of cash in transit in the Dublin area. The operation is under the control of a detective superintendent in the national bureau of criminal investigation. Among the activities undertaken are profiling and targeting of suspects; searching of premises associated with suspects; disruption of activities of suspects; surveillance of suspects; liaising with cash in transit companies; and intelligence gathering and analysis.</p>
            <p eId="para_116">Operations have resulted in the arrest and charging of a number of suspects and the recovery of a number of firearms. The numbers of robberies of cash in transit have continued to decrease since the operation was established in June 2004. In the first three months of 2004 there were 12 robberies involving security vans compared with seven in the first three months of this year. While this represents a decrease of 40% in incidents, as Deputies will be quick to point out, there was an increase in the amount of cash taken quarter on quarter.</p>
            <p eId="para_117">I am assured by the commissioner that the necessary resources are being directed towards the containment and detection of such serious criminal activity. On Thursday, 31 March, following the armed robbery of a Brinks Allied security van early on 30 March at Artane when approximately €1.9 million was stolen, I met representatives of the main banks, An Post, the Central Bank and the major cash in transit service providers. I was accompanied by the Garda Commissioner, Mr. Noel Conroy, and the chief executive of the Private Security Authority, Ms Geraldine Larkin.</p>
            <p eId="para_118">Many of the participants at the meeting, who are central to the movement of currency in the State, have been meeting as a forum since November 2004. The terms of reference of the forum are to co-ordinate the sharing and gathering of information on the security of delivery and collection of cash to bank branches and ATMs; identify strategic issues and promote best practice for the transmission and storage of cash; and develop an agreed code of practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_119">At the meeting, I emphasised the massive social implications of these robberies when millions of euro find their way into the hands of organised crime gangs. Such robberies threaten the integrity and security of civil society. I informed the participants that the Government must ensure that proper procedures and standards are in place to combat the threat to security employees, their families and the public and that measures would have to be taken to ensure that the highest standards would be established and adhered to in cash escorts and cash holding centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_120">I indicated my preference for voluntary agreement on a code of practice that would see the industry operating to the highest international standards. The forum has been considering such a draft code of practice since November 2004. If such agreement on a code of practice cannot be adopted voluntarily within the next 120 days, I indicated that I would have no choice but to regulate to ensure that standards are raised. However, my preference remains that key players acting in partnership voluntarily agree to act in the interests of their industry, their employees and the public. Agreement, if and when achieved, will represent the first time that the main stakeholders have committed themselves to operating to agreed standards of procedure and equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_121">In tandem with this, the Private Security Authority has a statutory responsibility to license companies operating in this area. The authority has decided to commence work on the development of a national standard in parallel with the work of the forum. The standard will form the basis of statutory licensing of cash in transit companies. As the authority is independent, I do not want to prejudge its deliberations on this matter. However, I would hope that if the voluntary code of practice is of a sufficiently high standard and concluded within the timeframe of the authority's work, it could form the basis of the national standard that would be required for the issuance of a licence. My officials are closely monitoring the 120-day period and activity in the area.</p>

            <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_122">I compliment the off-duty garda who foiled an armed robbery within the past 24 hours. While I do not have his name, we should acknowledge the exemplary courage shown on this occasion and I hope he is recovering from his injuries.</p>
            <p eId="para_123">It is easy for us to criticise the Minister and we have many grounds for doing so. I point to the substantial number of robberies when compared with 1998, the first year in office of the previous Government, when for the entire year only 61 armed robberies took place. Is the Minister not alarmed at the large number of robberies? Even in the figures he published yesterday, robberies from the establishment or the institutions or robberies of cash and goods in transit number 370 in the first quarter alone as opposed to 61 armed robberies in 1998, the first year of the previous Government. Figures reported indicate that 17 gangs are involved. How many gangs are involved in these robberies, including the IRA and related gangs?</p>
            <p eId="para_124">What steps are being taken to address the problem? The Minister referred to Operation Delivery and the first quarter reflected a reduction from 21 to 12 in robberies of goods in transit. On the other hand, the number of robberies of institutions increased significantly, from 282 to 358. Would it be helpful to adopt a process initiated in Canada and change the law to criminalise gangs and make it an offence to be a gang member? If so, what are the Minister's proposals in this regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_125">On a technical level, are security vans equipped with global positioning systems, GPS, and if so, why is it difficult to track them? I understand there has never been a robbery of goods in transport accompanied by a military escort? Who makes decisions on escorts? Why do the military and Garda Síochána not provide greater cover? If there is to be a concerted effort to end this type of armed robbery, surely action is necessary on all the areas I have raised, notwithstanding the general requirement to allocate more manpower and technological resources to the Garda Síochána, which I do not propose to address in detail at this stage.</p>

            <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
            <p eId="para_127">I will deal first with the Deputy's final point regarding escorts. The Garda provides a considerable number of non-military escorts in any given week. More than 600 movements of cash are escorted by gardaí so it is not the case that one must see a jeep and Garda cars travelling beside a vehicle to conclude that an escort is in operation. Many cash transits are escorted with little public profile. For obvious reasons, I do not wish to address in detail the criteria for escorting cash but they are worked out in consultation with the security industry and its chief customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_128">The Deputy asked if I am alarmed by recent events. Most certainly I am alarmed and I have made it clear to the industry that if it does not get its act together, I will do so for it and impose from the outside standards with which it must comply.</p>
            <p eId="para_129">The Deputy asked about global positioning systems. Some of the participants have GPS in their vehicles while others do not, which is a clear case of underinvestment. Some of the participants use much more sophisticated vans for some transactions than for others and, again, there is major room for investment in this regard. As the Deputy can well imagine, there is also room for using proper strong boxes, perhaps carrying independent GPS, with a capacity to destroy the contents if they are interfered with and of such a design that the transit staff cannot, under any circumstances, either under duress or otherwise, open them and with codes provided only to the recipients upon delivery. There are many other technical standards which could be introduced.</p>
            <p eId="para_130">I explained to the security industry and I am happy to state now that I am unwilling to have the banks drive a race to the bottom in terms of standards. Security company employees are entitled to a decent wage rather than the bare minimum, decent conditions of work and equipment of the kind I described, which would safeguard them. The banks in question must face up to the fact that they must pay for additional standards. I will not tolerate a race to the bottom on standards when the result would be that society will be impoverished and anti-social elements enriched. I made this so clear I was perhaps unusually blunt.</p>

We have heard a great deal of it in the House and on the media and perhaps we can now get some facts. The Minister had no difficulty identifying the culprits in a recent major bank robbery in Northern Ireland. In addition, in reply to a question from the media on what he intended to do about this issue he stated he would revoke the licences of the security industry. Suddenly, however, he realised the security companies did not have licences because he had not licensed them as he did not enact legislation in sufficient time to do so. What is the current position?</p>
            <p eId="para_140">The Minister cannot allow any sector of the security industry to be self-regulatory now that legislation is in place and the Private Security Authority has been established.

        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
        the reason he is awaiting a further report into the Grangegorman murders from the Garda authorities; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
        [10507/05]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_101" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
            <p eId="para_151">I thank Deputy Gregory for tabling this question. Deputies will be aware of the main facts of this distressing case. Sylvia Shiels and Mary Callinan were brutally murdered on the night of 6-7 March 1997. In July of that year the late Mr. Dean Lyons made an apparently full confession to investigating Garda officers of his alleged guilt in the double murder. Following consultation between the Garda and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, he was charged with one of the murders at Grangegorman. In August 1997 another person, whom I cannot name in the House, was arrested and detained during the investigation of another double murder and made a confession regarding the Grangegorman murders. As a result of the admissions made by the second person, the Garda Commissioner appointed an assistant commissioner to review all available evidence regarding these murders.</p>
            <p eId="para_152">The Garda authorities state that this investigation indicated that Mr. Lyons did not commit the murders in question. Following completion of this review, a report was submitted by the assistant commissioner to the Director of Public Prosecutions. In April 1998, after consideration of the report, the DPP decided that criminal proceedings against Mr. Lyons be discontinued. In July 1999, Mr. Lyons presented a signed and witnessed statement denying any involvement in the Grangegorman murders.</p>
            <p eId="para_153">As the House is aware, when the DPP decides not to prosecute in a particular case, the reasons for the decision are given to the Chief State Solicitor and the investigating gardaí. However, the director has stated that it is his policy not to disclose this information otherwise. The prosecution of alleged offences is the responsibility of the DPP alone. He is independent in the exercise of his functions and it would therefore not be appropriate to intervene or comment on his decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_154">On 24 February, the Garda Síochána press office published a notice on behalf of the Garda Commissioner in a number of newspapers which stated that the Garda was satisfied that Dean Lyons had no participation in the murders and that it appreciated the embarrassment suffered by his family as a result of criminal charges preferred against him and subsequently withdrawn. It regretted and apologised to the family of Mr. Lyons for any embarrassment caused.</p>
            <p eId="para_155">In recent days, I have received a comprehensive up-to-date report which I requested from the Garda authorities on all matters arising in this case. The report is a detailed one and is accompanied by a large volume of associated papers. I have also previously indicated to the House my reservations regarding a public inquiry into this case. The death of Dean Lyons has obvious implications for the effectiveness of such an inquiry. I must also be mindful that the criminal investigation into the two murders is not closed. In particular, a forensic "cold case" review is being conducted by the Garda on exhibits and samples to see if there is forensic material to support a prosecution against the other person. This has led to the re-examination of a large number of such exhibits and samples. The outcome of this review could lead to charges being made in future, and I am sure the House will appreciate that I cannot prejudice that decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_156">Nevertheless, taking all these factors into consideration, I accept that there are understandable grounds for concern that Dean Lyons made an apparently inculpatory statement in this case. This is why, having taken the representations made by a number of Deputies, including Deputy Gregory, into account, I have decided in principle to refer the Garda papers in the case to outside counsel with a view to examining how Mr. Lyons came to make the confession and what lessons can be learned from that occurrence in an effort to ensure that something similar does not happen again in future. I expect to have the terms of reference for the examination finalised and a person to carry it out chosen shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_157">Will the Minister state if it is clear from the reports made available to him by the Garda that in the written statement taken by gardaí from Dean Lyons, there were specific details, including the murder weapon, that could only have been known to gardaí themselves and to the murderer? These details of the case have been in the public arena for the last five years. I have raised the case with the Minister since he became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and he has prevaricated until now. Is it not a critical issue that a statement which was neither videotaped nor audiotaped but gave precise details of the murder weapon and scene was taken from Dean Lyons who was later shown to be innocent? Is it not the case that serious implications arise from this? Surely the Minister agrees that this fact alone necessitates a full public inquiry. He has stated that he will refer this case to counsel. What is the nature of the inquiry he will ask the counsel carry out? Will it be public, open and transparent or yet another private inquiry into the details of the case?</p>

            <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
            <p eId="para_158">To clarify matters for the Deputy, I will ask the counsel to go through the considerable volume of documentation which was furnished to my office, together with a report, by the Commissioner last Thursday. I have no doubt that this is a grave issue. I agree with the Deputy that the serious issue in question is whether the alleged inculpatory statement made without any form of recording contains detail which could only have been supplied to Mr. Lyons by his interrogators. This is the crucial issue. Rather than relying on what has appeared in the newspapers, I wish to have a person in whose judgment I have confidence to go through all the material, establish what substance there may be to that grave issue and report to me. I will then report to the House whether an inquiry is necessary.</p>
            <p eId="para_159">If an inquiry is necessary, there are a number of possibilities. One, which I have already mentioned, is the appointment under the Dublin Police Act 1924 of a person to carry out a sworn inquiry and provide me with a report. This is one of several possibilities, but I do not wish to rule any out. However, I agree that the grave implications to which Deputy Gregory referred are the point of interest and public concern. I am taking steps to evaluate what steps I should take on foot of the issues raised by this inquiry.</p>

            <from>Mr. Gregory</from>
            <p eId="para_160">Several points arise from the Minister's reply. If it is shown to be the case that these details, which could not have been known to Dean Lyons, were in his statement, will the Minister arrange a full public inquiry or some other form of inquiry so that this is brought out into the open? The Minister is aware that the sister of one of the victims and Dean Lyons's father have continually called for a full public inquiry. Given the length of time that has elapsed and the prevarications that have surrounded the case from the very beginning, they are entitled to it.</p>

            <p eId="para_161">I do not wish to speculate about what I will be advised by the independent counsel regarding this matter. However, I accept it is a serious issue.

        if he is satisfied that the acquisition of 150 acres of land at Thornton Hall at a cost of €200,000 per acre represents good value for the taxpayer; his views on whether the sale of the 238-acre Grange farm four miles away at a cost of €26,000 per acre, the established market value for agricultural land in this area, shows that he paid €26 million too much for Thornton Hall; if he will reconsider the purchase; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_109" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
            <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
            <p eId="para_166">I am satisfied that the purchase of the 150-acre site at Thornton Hall in County Dublin will prove to be excellent value for money for the taxpayer and I have no intention of reconsidering the purchase. To put it in perspective, a survey carried out on behalf of the Office of Public Works in 2001 estimated the cost of refurbishing the 20-acre Mountjoy site at €336 million. At today's prices, it would cost in the region of €418 million. With regard to the purchase price of the Thornton Hall site, I have received no advice from the OPW or the agents retained to advise on the matter that the price paid was in any way exorbitant. The Deputy can point to a particular site several miles away which is cheaper than Thornton Hall. Equally I would be able to point to many sites a few miles away which would be much dearer but that does not prove anything. Not all sites are suitable for a development of the type envisaged.</p>
            <p eId="para_167">We were looking for a site that was suitable for the development of a major prison facility with sufficient open space for the proper recreation of prisoners, especially young offenders if they were to be sited there, to serve the Dublin area. Advertisements were placed in the national media inviting owners to put forward sites for consideration. All sites were examined on the basis of carefully prepared objective criteria. The site that met the necessary requirements and proved to be best value was selected.</p>
            <p eId="para_168">The other site referred to by the Deputy was not offered to the Irish Prison Service as part of the formal selection process. In any event, I have been advised by the prison service that although a formal assessment was not carried out on the site, it would not have been considered acceptable from a number of important perspectives such as location, access and egress.</p>

          <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_110">
            <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
            <p eId="para_169">Does the Minister accept that, at €200,000 an acre, he has purchased the dearest farm in Europe? Does he accept that this figure is eight times the market value per acre for a farm of that size? Does he agree the market value of the Grange farm was settled by a public auction? As he must be aware from his legal days, this is the true criterion of market value. I am not talking about suitability for a particular purpose, but about market value for agricultural land. The Minister was buying unzoned farm land. References in his committee report regarding land that was offered at a much higher price are not surprising as development land is bound to be offered at higher price.</p>
            <p eId="para_170">Does the Minister agree this deal represented extremely bad value for the taxpayer and that the decision to buy the farm was hasty, panicky and completed without half of the committee having examined the farm? The deal was first brought before the committee on 18 January, immediately agreed and approved by the Minister and announced the following week. This is a crazy way to conduct business by a member of a party that prides itself on being a watchdog regarding public finances.</p>
            <p eId="para_171">Is the Minister aware that it is now extremely likely that Thornton Hall, which he purchased so quickly, may be designated an architectural conservation area? Is he aware that the local heritage association has produced a major report, which has been in gestation for the past two years, which confirms that this is a major heritage area, as evidenced by hill forts, ring forts, ecclesiastical enclosures, churches, a castle, a castle moat, a stone cross site, medieval settlements, ancient roadways, a Cromwellian battle site and an execution site? This last site is possibly the only part that is appropriate. Is the Minister not aware that it is very likely, arising from this report, that Thornton Hall and the adjoining area will be classified as an architectural conservation area by Fingal County Council and thus become off-limits to building development? How will the Minister retrieve the €26 million out of €30 million that he wasted on the purchase of a farm if he cannot build on the site?</p>

            <p eId="para_174">The Deputy is well aware that a great number of locations in Dublin and adjoining counties were considered so the decision was not rushed. The Office of Public Works and the expert auctioneers and valuers who were advising it did not make a mistake of the kind the Deputy is suggesting and did not buy a pig in a poke. When the institution is built the Deputy will be the first to recognise that this site was the right place to build and has the right scale. He will also realise that the other farm to which he referred would be completely unsuitable. I ask the Deputy to ask the neighbours of that other farm for their views if he still has doubts about the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_175">This site was inspected for any features of archaeological or cultural significance and none was found. It was interesting to hear the Deputy speak about the many interesting features of the site as I do not believe it has any. We will find out in the fullness of time who is right on this issue. The Deputy used very careful language when he said the area contained these features. He did not say the site I bought had any of these features. I am not aware of the existence of ring forts, monastic remains or similar features on the land in question.</p>

The proposal put to me to deport this person was made in the belief of the proposing immigration service official that the order, when made, would not be implemented before June 2005, when the young man in question would be able to sit the leaving certificate examination for which he had been studying at Palmerstown Community School since September 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_180">As is usual regarding persons in respect of whom deportation orders have been made, this person was instructed to present himself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau on 3 March 2005. He did not do so and, consequently, was classified as an evader. He subsequently presented himself at the Garda National Immigration Bureau on the day of a deportation flight rather than on the earlier date specified in the letter sent to him. Consequently, he was arrested as an evader and deported. The officials involved in the deportation were acting in good faith. The assumption that he would not be deported before June 2005 was not acted on. While the deportation was authorised, its actual timing was unfortunate and I believed that to leave matters as they were was inappropriate.</p>
            <p eId="para_181">It is important to understand the general procedures that apply to the execution of deportation orders. The execution of every deportation order made by me is an operational order by An Garda Síochána. It is the Garda's duty to enforce such orders in accordance with the law and it has never been my or my predecessors' practice to assume a direct role in operational matters for a good reason. Under the laws enshrined in the Immigration Act 1999, a person who is the subject of a deportation order is under a legal obligation to leave the State. However, compliance with the law in this regard is minimal and enforcement is necessary if the integrity of the asylum and immigration system is to be maintained. As the Supreme Court has acknowledged, failed asylum seekers do not have a right to remain in the State but these people are not snatched arbitrarily or suddenly off the streets. Before I make a deportation order, the person in question is given three options. He or she can leave the State voluntarily, consent to the making of a deportation order or make representations within 15 days as to why he or she should be allowed to remain in the State. Assistance regarding voluntary departure is underpinned by special programmes established in co-operation with IOM. For three years, up to 31 December 2004, 1,879 voluntary returns have been accommodated by IOM in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Regarding all files submitted to me containing recommendations for deportation, it is plainly necessary for officials to collate and summarise all relevant information in order to present it in a coherent and consistent format for me to consider. Almost without exception, this involves a summary of all available information on the facts, as set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act and in consideration of the <i>refoulement</i> issues and-or other significant issues relating to the case. A recommendation is then made to me by an officer at a grade not lower than assistant principal.</p>
            <p eId="para_182">
              <i>Additional information not given on the floor of the House</i>
            </p>
            <p eId="para_183">The entire file is then submitted to my office for a decision. It is brought from Burgh Quay to my office at St. Stephen's Green for that purpose. The volume of such files can be understood from the fact since January 2001, in the region of 10,200 deportation orders have been signed by me or my predecessor. During 2004, the number of individual cases varied from ten to 20 on each working day. This is a direct result of the Government's overall asylum processing strategies and the commitment of resources to this area and is likely to continue to increase in scale.</p>
            <p eId="para_184">Deputies should be aware that litigation by way of judicial review proceedings is a regular consequence of deportation cases, with 361 such cases live at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">In view of the volume of the deportation files it is clearly unrealistic to think it possible for me or any other Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to remember the precise details of every individual case. While, I have no recollection of reading the particular file to which the Deputy refers, my general practice is, in some cases, to read and consider the summary and, in other exceptional cases, to read and consider the entire file.</p>
            <p eId="para_186">The approach outlined above is the only realistic way of dealing with the volume of cases fairly and efficiently and is in accordance with the Carltona principle which recognises that the whole system of departmental organisation and administration is based on the view that Ministers, being responsible to Parliament, will ensure that important duties are committed to experienced officials. In every case, I sign the deportation order and the order is made by the Minister as a matter of law. This approach is typical of that taken in Common Law countries where ministerial decisions are made in accordance with the Carltona principle.</p>
            <p eId="para_187">Finally, I refer briefly to our asylum determination process. Some commentators have referred to the fact that asylum determinations take a considerable period of time to complete and that large numbers of people are in the asylum process for a long duration. This is no longer true. Huge progress has been made in the area of asylum processing over recent years following the huge investment by the Government in this area. The progress made to date is illustrated by both the general reduction in processing timescales in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the substantial reduction in the number of asylum applications on hands.</p>
            <p eId="para_188">In terms of timescales, a new accelerated process has been introduced for prioritised asylum applications with a first instance decision provided by ORAC within an average of 13 working days and an appeal on the papers, where applicable, provided in some six working days by the RAT. At present prioritised cases comprise some 54% of all applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_189">In relation to cases on hand, only 900 cases are in the asylum system for more than six months. This can be contrasted with the fact that there were some 6,500 cases over six months in the system in September 2001 and that some 25,000 asylum applications have been received in total in the State since January 2002. We can be justifiably proud of this result.</p>
            <p eId="para_190">As I mentioned earlier, the Government has made a huge investment in this area and this expenditure ranges across several Departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_191">Overall, in the region of €375 million was spent on asylum related services in 2004, a small proportion of which also relates to services provided for other non-nationals. This figure was compiled following consultations with range of Departments and offices which provide services to asylum seekers, namely, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, including the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, the Reception and Integration Agency and the Refugee Legal Service, the Departments of Social and Family Affairs, Health and Children, Education and Science, the Office of Public Works and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</p>
            <p eId="para_192">This scale of investment leaves us with an asylum determination system which compares with the best in the world in terms of fairness, decision making, determination, structure and support services. It is also worth pointing out that it still remains a fact that over 90% of the applicants for asylum, after been through a system which is highly regarded internationally, including by the UNHCR, are found not to be in need of international protection.</p>

            <from>Mr. Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_193">I thank the Minister for supplying me with all of this information but I would like him to answer my question. I asked him whether he is going to review the procedures used in issuing an execution of a deportation order, which he did not answer, and whether he had read the file himself prior to signing the deportation order regarding Mr. Olukunle Elukanlo. I also asked him whether in general files are read by him prior to signing deportation orders. I did not receive answers to any of those questions.</p>
            <p eId="para_194">Would the Minister agree the process has become a debacle where he has been forced to do a U-turn regarding his oft-stated position that he would create precedents if he was to make any exceptions to his ruling? He has now very publicly and blatantly done a U-turn on this issue. What is the position regarding deportation orders now that the Minister has done this U-turn? We have people in Athlone, Monaghan and various other parts of the country who are looking for similar treatment to this young man.</p>
            <p eId="para_195">Does the Minister agree it is not sufficient to say he issued a deportation order in the belief that the immigration service would not deport the young man before his examinations? Are members of the immigration service supposed to be mind readers? How were they to know that the Minister did not expect this young man to be deported before his examinations? Did the file contain anything that made it clear that he was not to be deported before his examinations? The Minister should let us know if it did. If the file did make it clear, the deportation would have breached the order that was issued.</p>

            <p eId="para_196">If I had sufficient time, I would have said that the files are brought to my office for consideration, with a summary attached to each file. The volume of such files can be understood from the fact that since January 2001, 10,200 deportation orders have been signed by me or my predecessor. In 2004, the number of individual cases varied from ten to 20 on each working day, which is the result of the Government's overall asylum processing strategies and the commitment of resources to the area. This is likely to increase in scale.</p>
            <p eId="para_197">In light of the volume of deportations filed, it is unrealistic to think it possible that I or any other Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform could remember the precise details of every case. While I have no recollection of reading the file to which the Deputy refers, my general practice is to read and consider the summary of some cases or to read and consider the entire file in exceptional cases. The approach I have outlined is the only realistic way of dealing with the volume of cases fairly and efficiently. This is in accordance with the Carltona principle which recognises that the system of departmental organisation and administration is based on the view that Ministers responsible to Parliament will ensure that important duties are committed to experienced officials. The deportation order in every case is signed and made by the Minister as a matter of law. This approach is typical of those taken in common law countries where ministerial decisions are made in accordance with the Carltona principle.</p>
            <p eId="para_198">The Deputy asked whether this will set a precedent for other cases. It will not. In this case, the proposing immigration officer noted in the file his expectation that the young man would be able to finish his leaving certificate and then leave. The subsequent sequence of events that happened was unlikely in that he did not attend an interview to inform him of this expectation when he was requested to and was marked as an evader. Once he was classified as such, he subsequently appeared on the day a flight was leaving and other officials who acted in good faith but were unaware of the expectations of the first official decided to arrest and deport him.</p>
            <p eId="para_199">It was harsh to stand over his deportation under these circumstances. On consideration, I publicly said that I must take personal responsibility for these decisions. I make no apology for saying this but the other cases to which the Deputy refers have nothing to do with this particular sequence of highly unlikely and unpredictable events or their results.</p>
            <p eId="para_200">Entire families come to Ireland seeking protection as refugees and apply for asylum. When they fail, they must be deported. The Deputy has advanced in this House that, where children are in education, the question of their deportations should be deferred until their education is finished.</p>

            <p eId="para_207">The Deputy has raised this issue again, so I will reiterate that I am speaking about primary and secondary education.

The modern uniform available to members of the Garda Síochána is designed by a process which involves consultation with the affected ranks.</p>

            <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
            <p eId="para_232">Following from a Council of Europe programme in 1997 entitled, Policing &amp; Human Rights, 1997-2000, the Garda Síochána established a human rights office and a human rights working group in 1999. The human rights working group, on behalf of the Garda Commissioner, commissioned Ionann Management Consultants to carry out a human rights audit of the Garda Síochána. This extensive work was conducted during 2003-04 and the audit has been finalised.</p>
            <p eId="para_233">I take this opportunity to congratulate the Commissioner for commissioning the human rights audit and for publishing the audit which identifies certain significant shortcomings in respect of the force in an open and transparent manner. In response to the findings and recommendations of the consultants, the Commissioner is drafting a comprehensive Garda action plan to respond, in particular, to the shortcomings the report identified.</p>
            <p eId="para_234">The action plan can be summed up by saying that it will put human rights to the fore in all aspects of the management and operation of the Garda Síochána. Assistant Commissioner, Nacie Rice, head of human resource management, has been given specific responsibility to monitor, oversee and ensure the implementation of all aspects of the report. I understand that at a recent management seminar at the Garda College in Templemore, senior officers at chief superintendent and commissioner rank received an extensive briefing on the audit and the action plan which will arise out of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_235">The Garda Síochána Bill, which is before the House, places emphasis on the importance of upholding human rights in the performance by the Garda Síochána of its functions. The Bill also provides for a revised form of declaration for persons joining the force, which specifically refers to the need to have regard for human rights in carrying out policing duties. I have also made provision in this Bill for the establishment of a code of ethics for the Garda Síochána. The purpose of the code of ethics will be to lay down standards of conduct and practice for members.</p>

            <p eId="para_236">I, too, welcome the fact the Commissioner has accepted all 15 recommendations and has agreed to take action to implement them. Let us be clear on what the independent human rights audit found. It found that procedures and operating practices within the Garda force can lead to institutional racism, particularly in relation to Nigerians, Travellers and Muslims. What will the Minister do? He is responsible for legislation covering the Garda Síochána, and the Garda Síochána Bill is before the House. Has the Minister studied these recommendations? Has he considered the need for some change in the structures in the Garda Síochána? For example, recommendations were made in respect of a police authority which would allow a greater level of monitoring of the operation of the police. It is not good enough to leave it to the Commissioner to implement recommendations. What about training and education? The Garda Síochána Bill is notably devoid of reference to those areas. I would like to know about the Minister's responsibility rather than what the Commissioner will do.</p>

            <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
            <p eId="para_237">I appreciate that the Deputy welcomes the transparency with which the Commissioner acted in this matter. I can make the action plan available to the Deputy. He will see that each of the issues raised in the report is addressed and responsibility for and a method for dealing with them are identified in the Garda action plan. I back the Commissioner 100% in implementing that action plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_238">As Minister, I can set the legislative context within which the Commissioner can act. The Garda Síochána Bill is very strong and clear on this issue. There will be an ethics package for gardaí which they will have to live up to. There will have to be an emphasis on human rights in their training which does not simply end when they leave Templemore. Each member of the Garda Síochána will be required to effectively take an oath to uphold human rights. The action plan combined with that new legislative framework and the fact that there will be annual reports and directives from the Government will adequately cover this matter. I have full confidence that the Commissioner will deal with this issue in a perfectly adequate way, especially in view of the way he has dealt with it to date. He will have my full backing in everything he does.</p>

            <p eId="para_240">A contract has been signed for the purchase of the site and plans are being formulated regarding the development of the site. These will be made available in conjunction with the statutory planning process. In accordance with the Department of Finance regulations, the Prison Service is preparing a business case regarding the development for submission to the Government. It is intended that construction of the prison development will commence in late 2006. The cost of the project will be determined following a procurement process in line with EU directives and public procurement guidelines. It would be inappropriate for me to give an indication in regard to costs at this stage as this would be commercially sensitive information which might affect the tendering process. One meeting has been held between officials of the Prison Service and a group of representatives from the local primary school. There will be a process of consultation with the local community as soon as outline plans for the new development are drawn up.</p>

            <p eId="para_241">That is not quite what the Minister told us the last time I tabled a question on this matter. He told me he was agreeable to meet the residents but that they had not taken him up on his offer. He now tells me that officials met representatives of a local primary school and that some time in the future there might be a meeting with the local community. Is it not a fact that the Minister has refused to meet the local residents' association and the local community which is questioning the approach he is taking in regard to many aspects of this development? Will the Minister meet the local community?</p>
            <p eId="para_242">What is his response to Dublin City Council when one considers that some months ago, when he brought forward the proposal to close Mountjoy Prison, he had a notice posted on the gate of the prison stating that no official of the city council should be allowed past the portals to conduct any survey of the features of the prison? Will that notice be shredded given that the Office of Public Works made a submission on behalf of the Minister and that Dublin City Council rejected it out of hand, and that it has every intention of examining the architectural, historical, cultural and heritage aspects of the prison with a view to seeing what needs to be preserved? Can I take it the Minister will co-operate with the legal planning authority and the local authority?</p>

            <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
            <p eId="para_245">Will the Deputy please stop interrupting me? I am answering his question. It should be clearly understood that we are hearing that Mountjoy Prison is a heritage site and that the Deputy wants to keep it as it is. I am not prepared to have modern penology and the rehabilitation of prisoners carried out in a museum. If the Deputy has some ulterior motive to keep Mountjoy Prison in its present location and to make bogus arguments about retaining it as a campus, I do not accept them. Mountjoy is not suitable as a major prison and must be replaced. That view is supported by the governor, Mr. Lonergan, and by every independent person who has toured the prison. There is no reason to rebuild on the site because, as I indicated in an earlier reply to the Deputy, it would cost over €400 million to rebuild a prison on the Mountjoy site. Even in that context, the biggest prison in Ireland would be unusable for a major portion of the construction period. I am not going down that road.</p>
            <p eId="para_246">I want to make it clear to everyone who will listen that I am going ahead with the relocation of Mountjoy Prison from a city centre site to a site on the outskirts of Dublin and I have purchased a site for that purpose. The intention is that there will be recreational spaces, open spaces, decent buildings and decent facilities for the prison officers to work and the prisoners to exist.</p>

            <p eId="para_248">I intend to develop a campus in north county Dublin for the purpose and I intend not to be deflected by people who produce notions of fairy ring forts in north county Dublin or architectural details of interest in city centre Dublin. I will not be deflected by all this guff. The people of Ireland deserve that prisoners in Mountjoy should be imprisoned in humane circumstances. We must have drug free prisons. We cannot have a situation where drugs are catapulted over the walls. We must have circumstances where prisoners, especially the younger prisoners, can play a little football. Humane facilities will have to be available. The constant campaign to derail the relocation of Mountjoy will not succeed.</p>

            <p eId="para_249">I wish to ask a brief supplementary question. I asked two questions and the Minister had a side-swipe at one in regard to Dublin City Council. Will he allow the officials into Mountjoy Prison given that he refused to allow them in previously? My second question was whether he would meet the residents of Thornton Hall area. On the last occasion the Minister told me that an offer was made but that they refused to accept it. Will the Minister meet them?</p>

            <p eId="para_255">My main interest is in safeguarding the taxpayer. I have raised the issue of the €26 million wasted on the purchase of a site when it should have been acquired for approximately €4 million. Has the Minister taken lightly the local heritage report? Has he considered the possibility that an architectural conservation area order may be made by Fingal County Council? My understanding is that most members of the council are in favour of making such an order. Will the Minister accept it could have a serious impact on his plans if such an order is made? It is obvious he has not read the report. I am aware of the report but I have not read it in detail. If the site has, say, architectural significance of the order of the Céide Fields would that change the position? Would it mean the Minister would be left with a bad bargain on behalf of the taxpayer?</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_265">Today Irish nurses commenced their latest campaign to highlight the disgraceful scenes at accident and emergency departments around the country. At the Mater Hospital, Cork University Hospital and Roscommon General Hospital nurses were forced on to the streets to protest during their lunch break about the continuously bad situation in accident and emergency units. Their demands are not unreasonable. Like the rest of the people, they want an accident and emergency service that meets the needs of society. They want an end to hundreds of patients on trolleys in hospital corridors throughout the length and breadth of the country. Last week there were 404 patients on trolleys in hospitals throughout the country, today there are 350 patients on trolleys. Every few months the Government gives us a whole new raft of solutions to deal with the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">The Tánaiste, who has been in the Department of Health and Children for six months, building on the seven and a half years of prior service by the Government, has announced another ten-point plan, which is supposed to sort out this business. Will the Taoiseach give the House any reason to believe this plan will work where no others have worked? Will he give a definite timeframe as to when this ten-point plan will be implemented? Will he tell us what has happened to the accident and emergency agreement drawn up on the last occasion when the 2002 work stoppages took place to highlight the overcrowding in hospitals which has worsened since then? When will the additional acute and non-acute beds and primary care units promised by the Government in 2001 and 2002, which will only offer the long-term solution to this crisis, be provided? There are repeated incidences of people who leave their beds or trolleys in hospital corridors to use the toilet or to go outside for a smoke only to find when they return that their bed has been taken. This is truly disgraceful. In a country rolling in money it is sad to have the nurses of Ireland out on the streets again in an effort to deal with a problem to which the Government committed itself to solving over the past eight years.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_171">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_267">As I have stated before, for one reason or another, accident and emergency facilities are not up to scratch but it is not the situation in all hospitals. New accident and emergency departments have been opened in hospitals such as St. James's Hospital and Blanchardstown but problems still exist in a number of hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">Deputy Kenny asked me to state the present position. Approximately 3,300 people a day are treated in accident and emergency departments which is 1.2 million a year. The Tánaiste's ten point plan is a dedicated funding of an additional €80 million this year. The Government is confident that this plan has already achieved results in some hospitals but not in all. For example, the special home care packages to allow people to leave hospital are to help those who require better facilities at home and cannot leave hospital until these are provided. The first of the 500 step-down places are now being provided by the private sector. This is important as it releases acute beds in general hospitals. Nursing home places for long-term stay will soon be contracted. Several hundred beds need to be outsourced and this is under negotiation. Site visits to determine the suitability of facilities will be completed at the end of this week.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">The GP out of hours service is operational in most parts of the country but not on the north side of Dublin. However, 150 north side GPs have now indicated they are prepared to work an out of hours co-operative and this will have an impact. It is the case that there is no GP service after 5 p.m. and people have no alternative but to go to accident and emergency units. Progress has been made in discussions with private hospitals to provide additional access to MRI and CT scans in order to reduce waiting times. This is important and it is happening now. The Health Service Executive is putting in place a permanent system of audit inspection for cleanliness in acute hospitals and which was previously identified by Tallaght, Beaumont and St. Vincent's hospitals. The new St. Vincent's Hospital will open shortly. Tallaght, Beaumont and St. Vincent's hospitals are working to install new acute medical units and a number of other medical initiatives are being taken. These units are being funded by the €80 million funding announced by the Tánaiste. Others are already in place as I announced previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">I acknowledge the frustration of the nursing staff in hospitals in particular. The accident and emergency consultants are now in place but some further work remains to be done because the difficulty is that accident and emergency consultants leave at 6 p.m. and the busiest time is after 6 p.m. This is an industrial relations issue that will need to be negotiated. The Tánaiste is involved in this matter. It would be very helpful to the service if the accident and emergency consultants were in place. These are some of the issues.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_271">The Taoiseach has not changed. He referred to the figure of 3,300 people. This is very much less than it was seven years ago. The position is that the Government is unable to deal now with a lesser number than there was seven years ago. The Department closed contracted beds 18 months ago and is now opening up contracted beds as if this was a brand new initiative. In those years the health budget has doubled but the Government is still unable to deal with this element of the crisis. Why is it that today I hear reports of businessmen ringing up radio stations offering money to buy prefab units for hospitals? People are phoning radio shows to give their views about how the problem should be sorted out. The Government is almost eight years in office and the situation is much worse than it was when it took office. The Taoiseach in his reply may refer to the ten point plan and the millions of euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">What is the Taoiseach's personal view of how to deal with the hundreds of drunks who turn up every weekend in accident and emergency units, with nothing more wrong with them than that they are completely out of their minds with drink? They upset nurses, doctors and other patients who have rights that are being infringed. Has the Taoiseach a view as to how the drunken community in accident and emergency units at weekends should be treated and dealt with?</p>

          <p eId="para_275">There are reasons for this. Like me, Deputy Bruton is also a representative of the north side of Dublin. In the past there was a very good GP out of hours service. However if several hundred doctors decide to stop work at 5.30 p.m., which they are entitled to do, there is no alternative for people but to go to the accident and emergency department. It was not so in the past because a few years ago every community on the north side had a clinic. It is to be welcomed that the GPs have decided to work an out of hours service.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">It is accepted that several hundred people occupying acute beds cannot go home for one reason or another and alternative beds must be found for them, which is what we are doing. It is not a question that they were always there. Step-down beds are not available. People are living longer——</p>

          <p eId="para_279">I will give my personal view in answer to Deputy Kenny's question about the drunks. The ambulance crews and those who bring such people to accident and emergency departments both at weekends and other times, have no alternative but to bring them. The difficulty is trying to provide separate facilities for them in accident and emergency units in order to protect old people and others who may never have been in an accident and emergency unit before. Some units are able to do this but most units cannot. This is particularly the case in the Mater Hospital in Dublin because the facilities are old and separation cannot be made. This creates much hardship for the staff and also for elderly patients who have never experienced such behaviour. However, these people cannot be denied treatment for many medical and legal reasons and this creates great pressure.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_280">I refer to the scandal originally revealed to the House by Deputy Joe Higgins, namely the disgraceful exploitation of a large number of workers employed by Gama Construction Ireland Limited. In the last intervention by the Taoiseach he accused Deputy Joe Higgins of not having complied with or produced the information to the investigation. We all now know that this is not true even though the report has been injuncted by the company. The facts are in the public domain. The Tánaiste, in keeping with the PD mantra, went to Turkey to recruit Gama Construction for public sector contracts in this country. Gama Construction were given public sector contracts which provided for the going rate in the building industry to be paid to their workers. The quality of work is not an issue. Far from introducing competition into the domestic market, Gama Construction was disgracefully undercutting Irish and EU employers and workers and siphoning off the greater part of the workers' wages to Finansbank in Holland.</p>
          <p eId="para_281">What action is the Government prepared to take as a matter of urgency to secure for these workers in this jurisdiction their rights and entitlements under the registered agreement for the building industry? The difference between €2.20 per hour, which is what the workers are paid as the general operative rate, and the construction industry rate of €12.96 is deposited in Finansbank Holland which in turn transferred it to a finance company called Ryder Investments. The bank has control over that money. What the workers need by this weekend is a clear statement from that bank of their entitlements. Is the Taoiseach prepared to instruct the Irish ambassador to take whatever measures are necessary, in co-operation with his opposite number in Holland, to secure the minimal entitlement of these workers, that is, a statement of their rights and entitlements which they can examine over the weekend?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_179">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_282">There are many issues to consider in respect of this matter but lest I forget I will answer the Deputy's specific question at the end of his contribution. We are looking for not only a statement but access to the records so we can ensure the workers' rights and moneys are secured. The Government will use the offices of the ambassador and others to secure the money.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">Prior to the allegations made by Deputy Joe Higgins in February — two sets of allegations were made — with which I have no difficulty and we dealt with them the last day in the House, reassurances were given by Gama's auditors and legal advisers that workers were in receipt of the proper rates, and they were accepted by the CIF, SIPTU and BATU at the time. Following Deputy Higgins's complaints, I assured him in the House that I would ask the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, to seek the involvement of the inspectors in this matter and to draw up a report. That was the approach agreed in the House and it has been undertaken. The Minister received the inspector's report on 6 April. He informed me that he fully accepts the recommendations in the report, which need to be addressed by his Department and the Revenue Commissioners, the Garda Síochána and the other regulatory bodies, from which the Minister has sought and demanded support. The Government wishes to publish the report as soon as possible but is prevented from doing so by the High Court proceedings initiated by Gama. Our objective is to ensure all Gama workers, both Turkish and Irish, are given their full entitlements and that their terms and conditions of employment are according to the law and are fully implemented.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">There are other issues to consider such as repatriation. The Minister met representatives of ICTU, SIPTU and the CIF today and intends to meet Gama delegates this week or early next week to discuss implementation of the recommendations of the inspector's report.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_285">I agree there are many issues outside the question I put to the Taoiseach, such as that these workers in the main worked 84 hours per week but the moneys deposited in Finansbank Holland cover 48-hour weeks at the standard rate. Almost as much more is owed to the workers because hours worked in excess of the 48-hour week should be payable at overtime and weekend rates. There are questions about enforcement, the deduction of taxes in this jurisdiction and so on. These issues are for another day, as is the disgraceful state of enforcement. The Tánaiste sat atop this mess for three years while preaching competition. Other building employers made representations to her about being undercut and so on but nothing happened. I am not filled with joy that she has been replaced by Deputy Martin as Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment because he has a record of turning not one but two blind eyes to such difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">It is helpful that the Taoiseach will have access to records and so on. However, the workers' immediate demand is simple. Will the document which Deputy Joe Higgins was able to obtain for the four workers who accompanied him to Finansbank Holland, clearly setting out their entitlements, be secured for each worker, through the good offices of the Irish ambassador if necessary?</p>

          <p eId="para_287">All the issues that arise in this matter are being worked on.

We believe we can get those records.</p>

          <p eId="para_288">Were it not for the hard work of the Socialist Party in the Tallaght area and the opportunity afforded me by Independent Deputies to raise the position of the Gama workers, the company would not have been outed. How could such a vile machine of shocking exploitation be transferred intact from the Middle East by Gama to Irish sites and how could the company get away with this exploitation for four and a half years? It is inconceivable that prestigious projects, including two ESB power stations, could be constructed without senior personnel noticing that workers never got a single wage slip. If there is some excuse in regard to wages, the slave regime of 80 hours per week with no stop for rain and cold could not have been invisible. This is not even to raise the depraved morality of Irish professionals who continuously and at a significant price whited the sepulchre of Gama and the rottenness within that company.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">This State is deeply shamed that fathers who came here to support their families, leaving spouses and young children behind, and brothers and sons who came to work for their families' welfare should be most criminally abused, exploited and duped in the course of construction of the Celtic tiger infrastructure. I invite the Taoiseach to look members of the Turkish delegation in the public gallery in the eye when he gives his response and tell them that Irish people do not condone and are ashamed of the abuse they have suffered.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">Last year alone, €9 million of workers' wages was deposited secretly and duplicitously in Finansbank Holland — it may hold €30 million in workers' funds in total. When I arrived unannounced at the bank with four ex-workers, we were supplied within 20 minutes with full statements detailing the moneys deposited in each worker's account. These were the documents which had not been furnished to a single worker in the course of three years.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, has taken action in this matter and hopes to meet the workers tomorrow. Likewise, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has been helpful in accessing these documents. However, will the Taoiseach guarantee through the intervention of the State that by this weekend there will be a full statement for each worker in Gama so that next week they can sign the documents to allow them access their accounts and have the money sent to their families or otherwise dispose of it as they desire?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_293">I appreciate Deputy Higgins's remarks about the work of both Ministers. It is the intention to get the statement as quickly as possible. However, I do not know if we will have it by this weekend. The Minister may have more information in this regard when he meets the workers tomorrow — he will meet Gama representatives later in the week.</p>
          <p eId="para_294">Deputy Higgins asked me to address the Gama workers in the gallery. It is our intention to ensure that they receive their full rights and that Gama fully satisfies the obligations it owes to them. We are in direct contact in regard to securing the papers and believe we will receive full co-operation in this regard. The estimates of the departmental inspectors indicate the moneys involved may be even greater than the figures mentioned by the Deputy, although I cannot be certain about that. We will do everything we can to ensure the rights and money are secured and that we see this issue through.</p>
          <p eId="para_295">I cannot answer the Deputy's first question. When these issues were raised — as they were — assurances were made by Gama Construction, its auditors and legal advisers that workers were in receipt of proper pay rates. They were made not only to the secretariat or Government inspectorate but also to the CIF, SIPTU and BATU. Those assurances at that time were accepted but, as we found out, what was stated is not the case. The inspector's report has shown this and the facts will be put forward as soon as possible, as soon as we can deal with the legal position.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_296">"As soon as possible" is not good enough. The men in question are destitute. They got paid a maximum of €250 in cash four weeks ago and they have to be given the bus fare to come into town. That is how desperate they are. This is an incredible scandal by any stretch of the imagination. It is simple to address this and I have made a proposal to the Minister in that regard. Executives of Finansbank Holland should come to Dublin with all the information so workers can have access to it. Alternatively, each worker could sign a statement — this could be done tonight — which I or another representative of the workers could take to Holland on Friday. The bank could then give us statements for the accounts, as authorised by the workers, and we could bring these back. The workers would then have a further document to sign and would get their money within ten days of it being submitted to the bank. That is what we need. I need that assurance for these workers by this weekend.</p>

          <p eId="para_300">Gama Construction has still not supplied a legal payslip to any worker. The company must be banged around the place by the Government to ensure that it complies immediately with trade union rates of pay and conditions and respects human and workers' rights.

          <p eId="para_306">Our legal view is that the accounts belong to the workers and therefore there is no way the banking authorities can withhold them.

However, they are the accounts of the workers and the same criteria apply to them as to anyone else's account. If an account is one's own, how can it be withheld? That is our legal view.

The Minister has announced a 50% increase in staff, which will be very helpful in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_385">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_386">That, as a tribute of respect to the memory of His Holiness Pope John Paul II, Dáil Éireann sends an expression of its profound sadness and sympathy on the death of The Holy Father to His Eminence Cardinal Ratzinger, Dean of the College of Cardinals.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">It was an honour and privilege for me to attend the funeral of the late Holy Father as part of the national delegation led by President McAleese, in the company of the Tánaiste and Deputy Kenny as Leader of the Opposition. The sadness we have all felt at his passing has been lightened somewhat by the widespread celebration of his life and his achievements which we have witnessed around the world since his death.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">The widespread sorrow at his passing and the unprecedented attendance at his funeral reflected the scale of his impact on the world of our time. In part, this reflected his long reign in the See of Peter, his personal charisma, tireless travel around the world, the depth of his wisdom and the clarity of his teaching, his forgiveness for his would-be assassin, his dignity in old age and infirmity and, above all, his capacity to connect with people of all ages, but especially with young people. Arguably, he was seen in person by more people than anyone else in history. In these encounters, he affirmed the good in people and challenged us all to live out that goodness. One obituary read as follows:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_389">His is a heroic record. Here was one of the greatest men of the age. His principled stance, ethical leadership and evident holiness won respect and admiration, even from his enemies and critics.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">On his election, he told the church and the world, "Do not be afraid". He demonstrated his own fearlessness in addressing the challenges of the age. He did so with a profound sense of history, not least the history of his own nation. He was convinced, and lived the conviction, that history had a purpose, which was revealed in the act of redemption. That conviction inspired him to preach the centrality of the dignity of the human person. In turn, he saw that dignity as the basis for moral power in the face of unjust and oppressive systems. Nowhere was that demonstrated more than in his decisive contribution to the collapse of communism and the liberation of his beloved Poland and the neighbouring societies.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">The reintegration of Europe was a cherished objective. He was particularly gratified by the accession of Poland and the other member states on 1 May 2004. With its Christian tradition, he saw Europe as offering great hope to the world well beyond the boundaries of the Continent. He was equally clear-sighted about the challenges to be met, not least in responding to materialism and aggressive secularism.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">His, however, was a global vision. This was reflected, in part, in his firm if sometimes critical commitment to the multilateral approach to dealing with world problems, especially through the United Nations. His determination to establish good relations with the Jewish people reflected his historic sense of the injustice they suffered, not only at the hands of Christians and not least in his own country, and under Nazi occupation in his own home region. Equally, his engagement with other faith traditions, especially Islam, showed that his respect for human dignity and for the right relations between people extended across all boundaries. In his life and action, he demonstrated that, far from being inevitable, a clash of civilisations would be a great evil and could be averted. In this he was surely offering a profound service to the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">He, of course, will forever hold a special place in Irish hearts for his historic visit to Ireland so early in his term as Pope. We all have our own personal memories of the visit. Above all, I recall his moving words of passionate pleading uttered in Drogheda to persuade those engaged in violence in Ireland to find a new and more human way of pursuing their objectives. I have no doubt this moving appeal played no small part in the development of the framework for peace on this island, the completion of which was of such continuing concern to him, as he expressed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Ahern, when he met him last November. His historical perspective led him to pay homage at Clonmacnoise to the Irish saints and missionaries who evangelised Europe, and their thousands of successors in the modern era who have served the church and their communities around the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Many have called for Pope John Paul II to be known as the Great. Many also look forward to his early canonisation. Others have pointed to areas of contradiction in his life and work, not least within the life of his own church. All that he did, however, he did in total service to his God, his church and the whole of humanity. He demonstrated conclusively that those who believe religious faith has no part to play in modern society, unlike earlier societies, are wrong. They fail to read the signs of the times. On the contrary, he demonstrated the liberating power of religious belief and practice. He demonstrated the hunger for spirituality and the response to authentic spiritual leadership to be found around the world, among young and old, even when the ideals which are preached cannot always be met.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">Above all, he touched the lives and hearts of millions by his willingness to give, and to keep giving, in his work, his preaching, his life and, finally, in his suffering until there was nothing left to give. Many of us will at this time be thinking of and praying for Cardinal Desmond Connell and his brother Cardinals as they face into the difficult task of choosing a successor to this remarkable man. Pope John Paul II has gone to his rest, and the rewards of those who have run the race and who have kept the faith. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_396">On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I wish to join with the Taoiseach in his tribute to Pope John Paul II. I want to reflect for one moment on the breadth of his vision and his personal experience. As a young man, his mother died and he was left in the guardianship of his father and was dedicated to Our Lady in a particular personal way. He became a loyal son of the church in Poland at a time when that country was going through a mortal crisis. He saw his country invaded by the two great forces of totalitarianism at the time. He saw it being dismembered and must have seen all about him the naked evil of what can go wrong when people lose their moral compass and lose all contact with the higher things in life and the values by which we all hope to live. He saw terrible cruelty all around him. He must have felt despair for his country, of which he was so proud, as it was dismembered in front of his eyes.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">Notwithstanding that, he became a priest in the Catholic Church. He stayed with his church in circumstances where it was the subject of huge oppression for many years. The wonderful thing about his life is that he showed eventually that by sticking to what he believed in, and by mobilising other people to follow his example, the power of ordinary people's convictions and sense of what is right and wrong could endure one tyranny and overthrow a second tyranny.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">As the Taoiseach said, he was an enthusiast for the creation of a Europe which is free from war. Not only that, his great project was that Europe should be a Continent in pursuit of the ideals by which he himself lived. Not everyone agreed with everything he said, but that is not the point. Everyone was struck by the fact that he constantly stood by his own personal beliefs.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">As the Taoiseach noted, in a world in which some people have come to view greed and the absence of values as the hallmarks of our time, the Pope showed a completely different side to humanity in the past few years. The reaction of the world to his passing and the way in which he faced his final illness underlines the strength of human spirit against all forms of adversity.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">He came to this country in 1979, one year into his pontificate. He performed an act of humility on his arrival to a country by kneeling down and kissing the soil to demonstrate to the people his sense of their dignity and pride in their land. He went on his knees for a second time in Drogheda to plead with the Irish people and anybody tempted to resort to violence to abandon violence and take the path of peace. He pointed out that while they might claim to be in pursuit of justice, he too sought justice but that violence was always subversive and destructive. We have all recently had the opportunity to reflect on these words. They have never been so true and everybody in this House would hold the view that this message, ignored for more than a quarter of a century, still speaks to us today.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">On behalf of the Progressive Democrats, I join the Taoiseach in paying tribute to this wonderful human being and the strength of his spirit. Everybody in this House will endorse the thought: Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_402">I support the motion proposed by the Taoiseach. World leaders gathered in Rome last Friday for the burial of the Pope and to pay tribute to a remarkable man who was a poet, actor, mystic, jet-setter, philosopher, anti-war campaigner, human rights activist and evangelist. He meant more to humanity than any other individual in the history of mankind. His university friends once pinned a note on his desk which read "Apprentice Saint". Last Friday's call of <i>Santo Subito</i> may yet be granted for one described as approaching the papacy with the constitution of a horse and the energy of a freight train.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">I was deeply privileged and moved to be part of the Irish delegation at the funeral of Pope John Paul II, history's most public and spiritual leader. He brought the gospel not only to the furthest edges of Catholicism and Christendom but also to the birthplaces of Buddhism, Islam, Hinduism and Judaism. He brought it to the heartland of secularism and materialism and even to the bastion of communism for 40 years. He went head to head with Stalinists for what he referred to as the soul of Poland.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">Pope John Paul II was a charismatic and controversial figure. However, even those who rejected his conservatism might praise his authenticity. Much has been said and will be said about the exterior of his 26-year pontificate which may yet be one of the most consequential through his advocacy of the poor, commitment to peace, challenge to communism and secularism, public promotion of spirituality in countries where religion was punishable and rehabilitation of Galileo into the church.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The interior dimension of his papacy was also important. The immense, profoundly spiritual aspect of the life of Pope John Paul II and his soul's journey touched and inspired millions throughout the world. In the days before and after his death, millions began to think about the transcendent aspect of who we are, of finding a sense of life and meaning, about our own soul's journey, the nature of human suffering and our higher selves. We seldom get an opportunity to consider such matters privately, never mind collectively, on such a global scale and in such a material world. It has been extremely good and helpful for a large swathe of humankind to get a sense of who we are as part of a global family. We have been able to step off the treadmill of day-to-day living and think and express ourselves in a remarkable and extraordinary way, both publicly and privately.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">For Pope John Paul II the challenge of life existed in the gap between who we are and who we ought to be. Even if we were not totally preoccupied by this, it made us think beyond the habitual and banal at least once over the past two weeks. We should be grateful for that alone.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">He urged politicians to have courage, hold our heads up and deal with the great challenges of humanity as identified by him on 10 January: life, food, freedom and peace. World politicians could pay the most fitting tribute, perhaps, by nominating him for a posthumous Nobel peace prize.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">Pope John Paul II liked to watch the sunrise, even when ill. Some years ago, having broken his thigh, he shuffled noisily into a room full of bishops. It was business as usual. Manoeuvring himself into place, he muttered, "<i>Epper si muove</i>— And yet it moves.” These were the words spoken by Galileo to the Inquisition after he was sentenced to life in prison for the heretical assertion that the Earth moves around the sun. The Pope’s spokesman, Joaquin Novarro-Valls, said that in the end his soul dragged his body. That was clear at his funeral last Friday. His soul still moves.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Ireland was one of the first countries Pope John Paul II chose to visit, and Knock was the goal of that journey. He set goals in his life and, more than anybody else of whom I have ever known, he exited this mortal world having delivered fully on his life's commitments. He left behind goals for politicians to follow and attempt to achieve, and we should do our utmost to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">I share the sentiments expressed by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on the death of Pope John Paul II. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</p>

        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_268">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_411">On behalf of the Labour Party I extend our sympathy and regret on the death of Pope John Paul II. His death marks the end for a truly remarkable leader. He was not only the leader of the Catholic Church but also a most influential figure in world affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">He was the most dominant figure in the religious life of the world's Catholics for more than a quarter of a century and also played a highly influential role in general world affairs. I am also glad to have had the privilege of meeting him some years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">The spontaneous and unprecedented outpouring of grief in Rome, Poland and throughout the world was testimony to the way in which he touched the lives of many. There are few great historical figures whose passing has had such a deeply personal and emotional impact. In our modern world, only Nelson Mandela will be as widely mourned when his time comes. Perhaps only Mikhail Gorbachev has had such a deep and lasting impact in tackling oppression and on the world around him.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">Pope John Paul II transformed the image of the papacy. In a clear recognition of the demands of the modern era, he brought the papacy to the people and possibly travelled more than any other world leader in history, taking a message to the people in the most direct way. In doing so, he left an indelible imprint, not just on matters of faith and morals but also on world affairs. His influence and that of his office on issues of peace and justice throughout the world grew in each year of his reign.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The Pope held strong and sometimes controversial views on religious matters. In calm reflection, many will acknowledge that his unbending stance on issue such as contraception contributed little to the struggle against AIDS and HIV in Africa. The role of women was never enhanced in his church. The institution stumbled many times before finally coming to terms, if it has, with the issue of sexual abuse.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">Pope John Paul II was undoubtedly an authoritarian figure whose convictions left him unable to tolerate dissent, which meant that he was unable to respond to the movement for justice in South America, and this led to the stifling of liberation theology. However, nobody was ever in any doubt as to the strength and vigour of these convictions. For example, he will also be remembered as a strong opponent of war, a proponent of peace and a powerful advocate for the world's poor. His unremitting opposition to the death penalty, for instance, will not always have sat comfortably with some of those who came to mourn his passing.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">For many in this country, as the Taoiseach said, the most enduring image of the Pope's reign will be his visit to Ireland in 1979, which left such a lasting impression on an entire generation of Irish people. Remembering the strong and charismatic figure who came to Ireland all those years ago, it is all the more poignant that the final years of the Pope's life were marked by his courageous and dignified battle against painful and debilitating illness. Many in the church will look forward with hope to an era of change but that will not diminish the lasting reference, respect and affection with which Pope John Paul II will be remembered.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_418">On behalf of the Green Party, Comhaontas Glas, I pay tribute and respect to the late Pope John Paul II who, as mentioned by previous speakers, was well known as a man of peace, opposing not only the violence of paramilitarism in Northern Ireland but also the bombing of Iraq and many other so-called legitimate wars. He was a man of reconciliation, and for that he has left a valuable legacy, reaching out to cultures and other religious traditions worldwide. As a man of forgiveness, he made many people sit up and take note when he embraced his would-be assassin. It is somewhat poignant that the day he died was the day after the 37th anniversary of the assassination of Martin Luther King, another world figure and renowned man of peace.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">As also a man of justice in opposing greed and selfishness, many have commented on the need for his legacy to be emulated and to live on, but all too few have mentioned the strong, forthright words he said at the beginning of 2001 and at other times when he called and pleaded for an ecological conversion. It is clear that he meant his words to be taken seriously. He said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_420">.  .  . if we scan the regions of our planet, we immediately see that humanity has disappointed God's expectations. Man, especially in our time, has without hesitation devastated wooded plains and valleys, polluted waters, disfigured the earth's habitat, made the air unbreathable, disturbed the hydrogeological and atmospheric spheres and turned luxuriant areas into deserts and undertaken forms of unrestrained industrialisation, humiliatingthe . . . garden of the universe to use the image of Dante Alighieri.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">He also said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_422">We must therefore encourage and support the ‘ecological conversion' that in recent decades has made humanity more sensitive to the catastrophe to which it has been heading. Man is no longer the Creator's ‘steward', but an autonomous despot, who is finally beginning to understand that he must stop at the edge of the abyss.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">In 2001 in his pamphlet, God made Man the Steward of Creation, he made a plea which needs to be repeated and taken on board with the other legacies he left us. I thank God for people like Fr. Seán McDonagh who have championed those words and sentiments, as well as for Pope John Paul II. The Pope was not deaf to the cry of the earth but it appears that all too often the people to whom he was speaking overlooked it because it was too uncomfortable to take on board what he was saying.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">Nuair a bhí me ag an aifreann i bPáirc an Fhionnuisce i 1979, ba léir go raibh meas ag an bPápa ar gach sórt cultúir agus ar theangacha éagsúla, mar labhair sé as Gaeilge chomh maith le Béarla ar an ócáid sin — agus ar ócáidí eile nuair a bhí sé ar cuairt in Éirinn. Tá sé an-tábhachtach go léirimidne an meas céanna ar na rudaí a dúirt sé agus ní amháin ar na rudaí ar mian linn a thuiscint agus a chloisint. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam uasal.</p>

          <p eId="para_425">Ba mhór an chailliúint do dhaoine ar fud na hÉireann agus ar fud na cruinne bás an Phápa Eoin Pól II. The death of Pope John Paul II was a cause of sorrow to people throughout Ireland and the world. He was the leader of the Catholic Church from 1978 and he spent his long life in the service of that church and the promotion of inter-faith relations. He was a man of deep faith. He had a strong personality and he made a deep impression on people individually and collectively. His intelligence, integrity and spirituality were clear to all, as were his courage and determination in the face of the long and very debilitating illness he suffered in the last years of his life.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">The early life experience of Karol Wojtyla in Nazi-occupied Poland was hugely important in shaping his outlook and deepening his faith. It also meant that many people throughout the world felt a special affinity with him. It was no coincidence that he was recognised by people of the Jewish faith as the pontiff who did most to advance reconciliation and to make amends on behalf of the Catholic Church for the persecution of Jews over many centuries. His act of forgiveness of the man who tried to assassinate him was also of great significance and, more recently, his call for the cancellation of Third World debt and his opposition to the imperialist war in Iraq were widely welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">For many in the Catholic Church, the undoubted personal integrity, spirituality and leadership qualities of the late Pope cannot obscure the deep division among Catholics over doctrine, over the governance of the church. This is neither the time nor the place to go into those issues which are primarily the concern of members of the Catholic Church, but some of these matters have major social consequences which are of wider concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">The ban on contraception and divorce, imposed by the State and based on Catholic doctrine, undoubtedly contributed very significantly to the second-class status of women. The church strongly opposed the lifting of those bans. The opposition of the Catholic Church to contraception is undoubtedly an obstacle to the fight against HIV-AIDS throughout the world today. On these issues the late pontiff was conservative and they will continue to be hugely challenging issues for his successor, as will the failure of Rome to deal justly with the scandal of widespread child abuse by clergy and the blind eye that was turned to it for decades.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">The Pope's visit to Drogheda has been recalled many times since his death. We have heard again of his appeal to those whom he called men and women engaged in violence. It is presumed that the main author of that section of the pontiff's speech was the then Bishop of Down and Connor, Cathal Daly, who proved incapable of condemning the violence of the British state with the vehemence he reserved for others. I will conclude with another passage from the speech delivered by Pope John Paul II, which is also worthy of remembering. I nDroichead Átha, dúirt sé:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_430">Every human being has inalienable rights that must be respected. Each human community — ethnic, historical, cultural or religious — has rights which must be respected. Peace is threatened every time one of . . . [those] rights is violated. The moral law, guardian of human rights, protector of the dignity of man, cannot be set aside by any person or group, or by the State itself, for any cause, not even for security or in the interests of law and order. The Law of God stands in judgment over all reasons of State.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_431">As long as injustice exists in any of the areas that touch upon the dignity of the human person, be it in the political, social or economic field, be it in the cultural or religious sphere, true peace will not exist. The causes of inequalities must be identified through a courageous and objective evaluation, and they must be eliminated so that every person can develop and grow in the full measure of his or her humanity.</p>

          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_435">I support the motion proposed by the Taoiseach. Pope John Paul II was one of the foremost figures of the 20th, or of any, century yet he was a humble giant, particularly in his final years of infirmity. He reached the highest stature when he could not raise his head, lift his arm or address his people, particularly in his final appearances at his Vatican apartment window. He faced down dictators throughout the world and drew immense cheering crowds around the world in places as far apart as Manila, Manchester, Boston and Bombay.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">From the day of his election in October 1978, Pope John Paul II led the Catholic Church with strength and clarity, firm in his faith and boundless in his compassion. With a reign of more than 26 years, making him the third longest serving pope in the history of the world after St. Peter and Pius IX, it is likely that more than half the world's population can barely recall any other pope. This pope was open, accessible and spontaneous in his gestures, frequently brushing away his security guards as he reached out to the people, particularly the disabled.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">He was courageous and not afraid to tackle power head on by standing in solidarity with the people of his native Poland in their quest for political freedom. He changed the course of history and helped bring an end to the Cold War through his support for the Polish Solidarity movement, which started the landslide that wiped out communism in eastern Europe and eventually in the former Soviet Union. He brought it about in a non-violent revolution without bloodshed, confounding the conservatives who counselled violent confrontation and first strikes that would have cost the lives of millions.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">His voice, weakened by illness, was nevertheless at its strongest and most forceful against the Iraq war. He repeatedly called on the world's rich to share their wealth with the poor. He urged the young to take care of the old and the healthy to take care of the sick. He decried what he saw as the culture of death, particularly the tragedy of abortion and the death penalty. He was a prophet of peace and justice, especially in the Middle East and the Third World, balancing his concern for Palestinian rights with his condemnation of terror.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_439">I support the motion. Pope John Paul II will be sadly missed by millions of people throughout the world. During his life he offered people a sense of dignity and humanity that represents the human face of the Catholic Church. He appealed to both young and old and his method was one of simple honesty. In his many visits to different countries he was always seen as a likeable man with a sense of dignity and respect. People were touched that he chose to visit them and his willingness to leave the Vatican and travel throughout the world made him a universal figure and allowed the Catholic Church to be seen as a global church.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">Embracing millions of people from different cultures and backgrounds, he also possessed a great sense of humour as evidenced on many occasions which showed us that he was one of us, a man of the people with feelings just like ours. It was this honest expression of feelings that appealed to people and I respect him for that. When the Pope came to Ireland, I was in Galway with young people from Kilnamona youth club. It was an honour to be there to see the wonderful outpouring of emotion and real love for this man. His message to the young people of Ireland was simple. He told them he loved them, which was an honest and genuine message. This was really appreciated by young people who are so seldom treated with such respect in the public domain. Young people are not fools and they appreciate honesty as a quality in people.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">The Pope was also not afraid to be honest on issues of faith, which were sometimes unpopular. He was not trying to win any popularity contest. He spoke with the same honesty on such issues and was thereby respected. His honesty allowed the Pope to communicate well with young people and to gain their trust and admiration. He earned their respect in a way that many adults find very difficult. To have earned the respect of so many young people was an amazing feat.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">Pope John Paul II showed by his actions and words that young people were a vital part of society and the Church. Their continued involvement is both necessary and desirable. During his life the Pope gave a great example to us by his honesty and humility. He showed us how to respect others, not only by his words but also by his deeds. He reached out to many people of different faiths with the same warmth he showed in Galway. He was certainly a man of the people and he will be fondly remembered by millions for many years to come. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</p>

          <p eId="para_443">I join the other Members of the House in supporting the motion. The Pope was a man who was respected worldwide not only because he professed the beliefs of the Catholic Church, which was his duty, but also because he was willing to listen to people of other religions, including other Christians, Muslims and Jews as well as those of no religion. This was based on his living out the two great commandments of Christianity: love of God and love of one's neighbour. Those two commandments that he professed in action as well as in word formed the basis of his greatness. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.</p>

          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_444">With the death of Pope John Paul II, we have lost one of the greatest world leaders of our time. From his first day as Pope when he referred to having come from a far country to the day of his burial last Friday, he made a huge impact not only on religious matters but also on world affairs. Earlier this year, readers of the <i>Financial Times</i> voted him the most influential figure on the European stage. In the past 12 months a UK poll rated him as among the three most admired living people in the world, ranking him alongside Nelson Mandela and Bill Clinton. Few events in the world and particularly a funeral could lead the world to such a standstill as the people of all faiths and none paid their tributes to this great man last week. Countless world events were either postponed or changed to facilitate and mark his passing.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">As the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform said, his background is interesting. He worked in the Polish coalmines to earn the fees for a university education. He witnessed the invasion of his native Poland by Hitler which sparked off a war that was to affect the entire world. He witnessed one in six of his fellow countrymen facing a violent death in the following six years. He witnessed the takeover of his country by a communist regime. He experienced the effect nazism and communism had on the dignity of the human person. All of this along with his undoubted Christian faith moulded him into the type of leader the world came to admire greatly. His impact on world affairs was extraordinary. He is rightly credited with assisting in the fall in communism and the collapse of the Berlin Wall.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">While his influence on every country he visited cannot be measured in any quantitative sense, his impact was enormous. During his visit to this country in 1979, Pope John Paul II made a huge impact. Other speakers have indicated the remarkable esteem and outpouring of emotion that greeted the first visit of a pope to this country. However, the full impact of his visit has yet to be realised. His plea on bended knee in Drogheda to the men of violence to adopt peaceful means has yet to be fully answered. His words continue to have resonance today. In seeking an end to violence and criminality, the Government recently invoked his 1979 plea. Perhaps now is the time for strong leadership as epitomised in Pope John Paul II and to take control of the peace process, end ambiguity and appeasement and let the men of violence know the game is up. There can be no greater way for Members of this House to honour the late pope than by showing this type of leadership and ridding the country of the men of violence once and for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">He appealed to both conservatives and liberals, to one with his heart and to one with his head. Regardless of whether one agreed with him, he was resolute and strong. People knew where they stood with him. I am sure his tenure as pope will continue to have an impact on religious and world affairs for many years to come. He deserves our gratitude and respect.</p>

          <from>Ms O’Donnell</from>
          <p eId="para_448">I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to these expressions of sorrow and appreciation on the death of Pope John Paul II. As a champion and advocate of human rights and human dignity for the duration of his papacy, Pope John Paul II sought and achieved radical change throughout the world, including in some of the most difficult places and especially in his beloved Poland, throughout eastern Europe and in South America and Africa. The world has lost a true hero who personified all that is wonderful in the human condition. While I disagreed with the Pope on certain issues such as contraception and the role of women in the church — their absence from ministering the church diminishes the institution — he held his views sincerely and one must respect them.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">As late as last year, when it was obvious his health was failing badly, the Pope continued to urge the world to help those most in need. In so doing, he proclaimed the essential message of Christianity and the church's true mission of eradicating the scourge of hunger and chronic under-development in the world. He prayed that God would "sustain the efforts of the international community aimed at justice and solid development." This, he stated, was the path which could guarantee to the world a future of peace, a view frequently cited by United Nations Secretary General, Kofi Annan, who points out that eradicating global poverty is not only a matter of charity but also of enlightened self-interest. This is an area in which we can best honour the Pope's legacy. While words of tribute are well justified, those with the privilege of political office should act in areas under our responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Tonight, around the world, more than 800 million people will go to bed hungry. Approximately 3 billion people have no clean water or sanitation, while half the population of Africa lives in extreme poverty on less than one dollar per day. Deputies will agree that in a world of unprecedented plenty this is an unconscionable and reversible position. Every day, 15,000 people in Africa die from preventable and treatable diseases.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">I and many other Deputies have seen at first hand the tremendous work being done by Irish and other international aid workers in Africa and elsewhere. Funding from the Irish Government and other rich countries makes a considerable difference to the lives of millions in the developing world, particularly in Africa where needs are greatest. Once one has seen suffering abated, hunger sated and fear give way to hope as a result of aid funding and education programmes, it is impossible to turn away. Once one has seen the scale of unmet needs and become aware that lives are saved by intervention, action becomes not a political choice but a moral imperative.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">This House and the Government, in our full senses, made a solemn commitment to the international community to double the Irish aid budget to 0.7% of GNP within a timeframe which has, sadly, been allowed to slip. There could be no stronger testament to the deceased Pope than for Ireland to hold to our firm commitment to the developing world and urge others in the rich world to reach the millennium development goals to which all rich countries signed up to mark the millennium.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">John Paul II demanded of the church leadership in helping the oppressed of the world. Last February, in one of his last addresses, he told the world diplomatic community that providing food and ending hunger is one of the greatest challenges facing humanity today. Irish people, with our memory of the great famine, have a particular identification with the catastrophe of mass hunger and famine and an onerous responsibility to give world leadership in this area. That would be a fitting memory to our beloved Pope. May he rest in peace.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_454">I am grateful for the opportunity to pay tribute to Pope John Paul II, known as John Paul the Great. I offer my sympathies to his brother priests and other brothers and sisters in religious life. As a young person, I recognise the respect in which our late pontiff was held. He is the only Pope of whom many young people aged under 35 years have memories and, as the first Pope to visit this country, he will always have a special place in the hearts of Irish people. It is a special thought that Ireland was among the first countries he visited and a large number of Irish people travelled to Rome last week to attend his funeral mass when Cardinal Ratzinger's homily caught the heart of people across the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">It is with sadness that we lost Pope John Paul II given his great leadership skills described by Deputy O'Donnell. I will always remember the simple words he spoke in Galway during a special mass for young people when he said: "Young people of Ireland, I love you."</p>
          <p eId="para_456">Last Wednesday night I attended a mass in my Wexford constituency lead by the Bishop of Ferns, Dr. Eamon Walsh. He spoke of the Pope's visits to various countries across the world. The special and simple message he offered at every venue in each country will always live in the memories of those present.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">On the evening the Pope passed away, I listened as Bishop John Magee, who spent many years with John Paul II, said that among the first words the Pope will hear when he approaches the gates of heaven for his eternal reward will be "Well done, good and faithful servant", a fitting description of the late Pontiff. I hope the Catholic Church will canonise Pope John Paul II in the coming years. I extend my condolences to his brother priests, bishops and cardinals and send prayers and good wishes to the College of Cardinals in electing a new Pope in the coming weeks.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_458">I strongly support the motion and, like my colleagues, have personal memories of Pope John Paul II. I often think of the fateful autumn night in 1978, the year of three Popes, when the Polish Primate entered the Vatican. We could hear the bureaucrats in the Vatican say "enough" but the Pope proved that night and over the subsequent 26 years that he would not be dictated to and went about his business following the Lord's path as he saw fit.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">Visiting Rome in April 1979 I had an opportunity to see the Pope at an audience. Later, I was an archbishop's corps volunteer at the Apostolic Nunciature on the Navan Road when he visited Ireland. Having seen him on the Saturday and Sunday of the visit, we were woken early on the Monday morning to meet him, with some firemen, before his departure for Maynooth. I have often talked about the experience. I was struck by his presence and how he responded to people. People have reacted to his death in an amazing way. I was particularly impressed by many of the tributes paid to him this evening and compliment the Taoiseach and other speakers on their remarks. Archbishop Diarmuid Martin's words on television on the night of the Pope's death also struck a chord.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Deputies have made both negative and positive comments about the Pope. It must be remembered, however, that he was an 84 year old man who was regarded in church circles as an arch conservative, yet his death caused a huge outpouring of sympathy, particularly among young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">I happened to be in Poland last week and was present for a mass attended by 150,000 in Warsaw on Friday. I spent Saturday, my birthday, in Krakow where I attended a concert in the evening to commemorate the Pope. I also had the opportunity of going a couple of times to the Curia house where he lived as the cardinal archbishop. One had to be impressed and touched to see the emotion evident, particularly of young people. I was glad to come home with recollections of the outpouring of grief from young people and the emotion felt on the streets of Krakow. I saw the Pope as a very positive influence on the world. In common with other Members and the Taoiseach, I wish Cardinal Desmond Connell well as he goes about the business of choosing a successor. That will not be easy.</p>

        <speech by="#CeciliaKeaveney" eId="spk_280">
          <from>Cecilia Keaveney</from>
          <p eId="para_462">I appreciate the fact that Deputy O'Connor has shared his time. I wish to lend my voice to those of the other Members. When this man was elected Pope, I was relatively young and many of us latched on to the fact that he had been a goalkeeper. It struck a chord with young people that this most important man was human. As time has passed, his incredible connection to youth has come to the fore. It was best seen last week, when even in his dying moments, his strongest connection was to young people. It has already been noted that for my generation and succeeding generations, he is the only Pope that can be remembered or that was ever known.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">I was in the Philippines last week, and every moment of all the news channels was dedicated to his declining condition and to the events following his death. I have never seen such interest shown in an issue as there was to his health. There was a certain miraculousness about the fact that throughout the world, everyone tuning in had the same interest in this very important man. As other Members have stated, many people met the Pope. I had the honour and privilege of shaking his hand in 1990 in the Vatican. It made an impression that has stayed with me. He wished for Ireland to be at peace and I hope that his wish will be granted and we will continue to move towards the peace he envisaged for us when he visited us so many years ago. I congratulate the missionaries from Ireland throughout the world who have done us proud.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">All over the world, including the Philippines, people have the same impression of this strong resolute man. As everyone has stated, whether one shared his views, one knew where one stood with him. In many ways, it is an important characteristic to know where one stands with someone. I do not know how he will be replaced or how his successor will fill his shoes. The cardinals have a difficult job ahead of them. This man has made his mark with the young and old alike which was a vital characteristic that will be difficult to replace. We wish those who will follow the procedure to install John Paul's replacement well. He visited Ireland and many other parts of the world. He made his mark everywhere and it will be difficult to replace him.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanRyan" eId="spk_281">
          <from>Mr. S. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_465">I am not afraid to say, as a practising Catholic, that I am pleased and honoured to have this opportunity to express my personal sadness and sympathy on the death of Pope John Paul II. During the last days of his life and up to his burial, the eyes of the world were focused on Rome via the media. It brought the death of a truly remarkable man into houses throughout the world. His critics will say that he was a conservative person. His opposition to abortion has been raised time and again as if to say that by virtue of that opposition, he was conservative. I am delighted to share his view on that issue. He was opposed to war, the death penalty and poverty, and in favour of human rights. He was opposed to communism and capitalism in its raw form. In this context, he was a person who stood up for his rights and for what he felt was his role in this world.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">I appreciated that he said things as they were and people understood him. The Catholic Church has gone through a very difficult period in recent times, not only in Ireland but in America and other countries, because of sex scandals and abuses. His recent death and the outpouring of grief from many people in this and every other country in the world underlines the fact that people are looking for leadership. It would speak volumes if some of the leaders who were present at his funeral Mass took on board Pope John Paul II's teachings and writings. There is much in them for world leaders to express and implement. If they did so in a humane way, the world would be a better place in which to live for many people who now live in poverty, despite the fact that there is so much wealth available. He has set an example for us all. May he rest in peace.</p>

        <speech by="#PadraicMcCormack" eId="spk_283">
          <from>Mr. McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_468">The stop-start manner in which Second Stage of this Bill is being debated leaves much to be desired. It is being taken piecemeal, which is akin to treating the matter with contempt. I hope this is not a deliberate attempt by the Government to dilute the issue and further frustrate the campaign for a proper rights-based Bill. Why did the Government get it so wrong? It was obliged to withdraw the 2001 Bill and it then introduced this Bill. Why did it not listen to the valid case put forward by the support groups for people with disabilities? That puzzles me greatly. Moreover, the manner in which the debate on this Bill is being conducted is most unsatisfactory. In reality, the Government is treating the Bill and people with disabilities with contempt.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">We had a Bill in 2001 before the general election. That Bill was withdrawn because it was so inadequate. The Government then promised in the run up to the general election that a rights-based Bill would be introduced. It took three years to come up with this Bill which falls very short of what is required. The legislation was brought before the House on 4 November 2004. I spoke on it on 22 February 2005 and the debate was interrupted in the middle of my speech. Now the debate has resumed.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">It is difficult to make sense of this type of debate. The way this Bill has been handled is farcical. We were promised a rights-based Disability Bill and more money for the disability sector. However, we now receive an excuse of a Disability Bill which has dashed the hopes of people with disabilities. Their hopes were raised only to be dashed by this Bill. The parents of children with disabilities are at their wits' end as a result of the lack of necessary services for their children. This Bill is every bit as inadequate as the previous Bill, which was withdrawn. Does the Government believe it can slip this new Bill through without much fuss because there will be no general election this year?</p>
          <p eId="para_471">I and other Deputies have been lobbied extensively about this Bill. I received a letter from a group of parents in Galway whose children have autism and severe learning difficulties. The children are aged between ten and 11 and receive a respite service at Crannóg in the John Paul Centre in Ballybane. Unfortunately, this service will cease when the children reach the age of 12. In anticipation of this, their parents submitted a plan for respite and residential services to the Brothers of Charity in Tuam in 2002 and have been following up the matter since then. They are being further frustrated in their efforts.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">I wish to quote a section from a letter sent by the Brothers of Charity to this group of parents on 25 February 2005:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_473">The level of funding being provided by the Government and the Health Service Executive locally has not allowed in the last few years, and indeed will not in the years ahead allow for the provision of the additional services required. As a service, we are very concerned at the lack of funding available and continue to press locally and the Government about the needs of this group and other groups within our service.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">This passage plainly spells out to the Government that services like those provided by the Brothers of Charity can be provided so long as the necessary funding is available. This responsibility lies with the Minister and the Government. It is perfectly acceptable for Opposition Deputies to be lobbied but the responsibility ultimately lies with the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">The same lack of funding and services applies in the case of older people with disabilities. When a person with a disability reaches the age of 18, he or she is excluded from the education system. Parents are concerned about what will happen to their children when they die or are unable to care for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">This Bill falls far short of the rights-based legislation that was promised to people with disabilities. It fails to incorporate many of the core principles and recommendations of Equal Citizens, a report published by the disability liaison consultation group in February 2003. This report represents the collective and agreed vision of the disability sector on disability legislation. Given this level of activity, I am very disappointed by the current Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">The legislation requires major reconsideration and amendment if it is to vindicate the rights of people with disabilities. The Bill's definition of disability is too narrow and inconsistent with other legislation like the Equal Status Act 2000. The definition of disability in that legislation is much more inclusive. The definition in the Disability Bill would exclude many people with disabilities, for example, people with epilepsy, who require services. Under the legislation, people with epilepsy would no longer be considered disabled and would lose their entitlement to services they currently qualify for such as disability allowance, occupational therapy and supported employment. The Bill does not confer a right to the independent assessment of need and does not adequately address an individual's right to have his or her unmet needs addressed over time, as identified in the independent assessment report.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">The appeals system set out in the Bill is excessively complex and cumbersome. Not only would the appeals procedure be difficult and frustrating to navigate, it would also create a great deal of expensive and unnecessary bureaucracy, resulting in resources being diverted from the provision of services. The appeals system should be independent of the Department of Health and Children and the Bill does not stipulate that Departments and public bodies must include people with disabilities in their plans and services with appropriate monitoring and accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">There are ten key issues in this Bill from the perspective of the members of the DLCG. The first is the definition of disability, which is too narrow. The use of such terms as "substantial restriction" and "enduring" and the exclusion of certain conditions and early intervention needs is a matter of concern. The Bill should provide a clear right to an independent assessment of need and for an individual's right to progressivity in their unmet needs identified in their independent assessment report. This should be done annually or whenever there is a change in a person's circumstances. The conveyance system is too complex and needs to be simplified. The appeals system should be independent of the Department of Health and Children and should be sited in another Department. The Bill should provide for a clear ring-fencing of disability specific resources. The Bill must provide for a clear statutory duty on the part of all Departments and public bodies to include people with disabilities in their plans and services with appropriate monitoring and accountability. The definition of public services in the Bill should encompass all public services provided in the public system by statutory or non-statutory bodies. The sectoral plan section of the Bill needs to take the wider needs of people with disabilities into account. For example, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has not addressed the housing needs of people with disabilities. The impact of the Disability Bill on section 14 of the Equal Status Act needs to be clarified. There should be a review of disability legislation at least within a set period of years. I think the DLCG mentioned a period of seven to ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">The Government will not get away with this Disability Bill because the electorate will not let it forget the cruel and shameful neglect it has shown in its dealings with the disadvantaged. A grave responsibility rests on the Independent Deputies in this House who normally support the Government and Government backbenchers. I heard a number of Government backbenchers during the debate five weeks ago. I heard Deputy Cassidy outline all the faults of the Bill and state at the end of his speech that he would support the Bill on Second Stage. A grave responsibility rests on those members of the House who genuinely believe that this Bill does not address the needs of people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">There are many anomalies in the Bill and so much could have been done to improve the lives of people with disabilities and their families. A particular hobby horse of mine which I have raised on several occasions in the House is a mother caring for a disabled family member who receives the carer's allowance, which is welcome recognition of the year-round work that she does. An anomaly arises if the woman's husband and chief breadwinner dies. She will qualify for the widow's pension and lose her carer's allowance the next week despite continuing to be a full-time carer 365 days of the year. That is cruel. I have asked the previous four Ministers to deal with this issue but I am still being ignored. I will continue to raise it for as long as the people send me back here to do so on their behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">The medical assessment of people on domiciliary care allowance must happen every year. Why is that necessary? It is a source of great frustration for the parents and the persons involved. The person's situation will not improve if he or she is assessed. It is a cause of resentment for all concerned and is a waste of time and resources of the Health Service Executive which carries out the assessments. When will this legislation be examined or updated? We have been slow in abandoning the 2001 Bill and introducing this Bill, which will be inevitably passed by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">I wish to raise the issue of the disabled person's grant, which concerns public representatives at all levels. This is a farce because of the limited resources that have been made available to it. For example, I have encountered many cases in County Galway and Galway city in which people with disabilities who are unable to climb stairs due to advancing years or other reasons apply for a downstairs bedroom and bathroom. However, as there is so much red tape, delay and lack of funding for this essential service, the people involved have sometimes passed away before the work is completed. Several people have witnessed these instances and I submitted a parliamentary question on the subject recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">The Bill addresses the health and education needs of people with disabilities, but they have many other needs, such as housing, transport, employment etc. For example, many people with epilepsy cannot drive due to uncontrolled seizures but are not entitled to a free travel pass unless they are in receipt of disability allowance. If they are capable of working but not driving, they must use public transport, which can be extremely expensive. Why should they not have a free bus pass? In the area of education, people often underperform by as much as two years in comparison to their peers despite having average ability. Most children are not psychologically or educationally assessed even if they experience significant difficulties. Access must be made available to assessment to evaluate the impact on learning, memory etc. Where seizures disrupt school attendance, supplementary hours such as are provided for some disabled children in home tuition should be considered at another school and not as an alternative.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">There are many other aspects of this Bill. I ask the Minister of State why he did not consult the representatives of people with disabilities. Why was the Government so careless, why did it think so little of this? It was aware of the campaign undertaken to have the 2001 Bill withdrawn. Why did it not listen on this occasion to the articulate case put forth by the representatives? It seems that the Government is completely ignoring this case and is only going through the motions of putting this Bill through after raising the hopes of those people with what was promised before the election by the former Minister of State, Deputy Mary Wallace, who was banished to the back benches for her troubles. She promised the people a rights-based Bill but the Government had neither the guts nor the intention to deliver on it.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeSherlock" eId="spk_284">
          <from>Mr. Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_486">I ask the Minister of State to note that I am not speaking for myself, as I have had much consultation with various bodies. So many people are doing such great work that he must take it into consideration.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">I refer to Gorey Centre for Independent Living Limited. Its members stated that, though the Taoiseach said that the Disability Bill 2004 would be the best disability legislation in Europe a number of weeks before it was published on 21 September, it is a load of rubbish. Think of this statement coming from those who work with people with disabilities. They said that, for some time, people with disabilities have been calling for a rights-based Bill but instead were given one that was resource-based. One of the only rights in this Bill is what they claim is the "right to know what you already know". It brings disabled persons no closer to the services they need and want. Currently, if resources are not available, one can be refused a service even if it is needed. The same situation will occur with this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">This is not right. If their appraisal is correct, it is a waste of time to pass this legislation as it will change nothing for them. Accordingly, the centre's members state that under this Bill the requirement that public buildings be accessible to people with disabilities will not come into effect until 2015. Think about that. The Bill seems to be based on the medical mode of disability rather than the social needs of disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_489">The assessment of the needs of people with disabilities will be conducted by individuals in the Health Service Executive, as was stated previously. Any appeal will be conducted by individuals from the HSE. In essence, it will appeal its own decision. This is not an independent assessment of needs. The assessment should be conducted by a neutral body outside the Department of Health and Children and the HSE, such as FÁS, and given to the HSE as a statement of needs. If it is appealed, the appeal should be undertaken by an independent organisation. That must be done to give a proper assessment of the needs. The Office of the Director of Equality Investigations is the HSE's main source for these services. The matter should be referred to the Health Service Executive but as it is centered in Dublin, it is out of touch with local needs. I shudder to think of the service that will be provided in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">The Cork Centre for Independent Living Limited wrote to me about the national disability strategy and to express its deep concern about the disability legislation as currently proposed. It stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_491">We welcome the recent Government announcement of an €894 million multiannual funding package, which will go some way in addressing the historic underfunding of services and supports for people with disabilities. This is an unprecedented and welcome development by Government. While this funding is an important and significant development it is only part of the solution. We believe that, if people with disabilities are to become truly equal citizens in Ireland, this can only be achieved through legislation that ensures, promotes and enforces their status as equal citizens.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_492">In Ireland, people with disabilities have the same rights as everybody else. What we need is to be able to exercise those rights. If the Bill is adapted to provide for specialist services and secure the inclusion of people with disabilities in public policies and services it will vindicate in legislation these rights. People with disabilities will have become equal citizens in Irish society.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">That is what this is and what the Bill should be all about. These questions should not have to be raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_494">The organisation went on to state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_495">In our opinion, the Disability Bill, as it stands, falls well short of the commitments given by this Government. In 1997 our current Taoiseach and Tánaiste made a commitment, in the Programme for Government, ‘to ensuring that disability is placed where it belongs, on the agenda of every Government Department and public body'. They further stated that: ‘our policy is based on the core principles of promoting empowerment through appropriate, accessible and responsive services'.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">That does not appear to be happening in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The organisation further stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_498">We welcome these statements and commitments, however they have not been incorporated into the legislation as currently proposed. [We have the evidence of that before us.] The Bill, as produced, fails to meet the expectations of stated Government policy in two key areas, firstly, the way in which it addresses the specialist service needs of people with disabilities, and secondly, the manner in which it addresses the responsibility on public service policy, planning and delivery to include people with disabilities as equal members of the public. Ensuring that people with disabilities have the specialist support services they need is half the job done. Society must be able to fully include them.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">Surely, that is what this Bill is all about, but it falls very much short of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">The organisation also stated: "Therefore the Bill requires major reconsideration and amendment if it is to vindicate the rights of people with disabilities and to bring the needs of those members of the public who have disabilities into the centre of public policy and service delivery." I quote this letter so the Minister of State will note the points made and make the necessary amendments to this legislation. The Cork Centre for Independent Living looks forward to hearing from the Minister of State and I will also reply to those people. I have had consultations with groups previously.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">I come to my own area of north Cork. The Minister of State might have heard of Annes Grove in the Castletownroche area which is a great centre of excellence. I wish to quote from a letter from Patrick Annesley, the person in charge of that section of disability. It has done much with Clúid to provide accommodation in certain areas of north Cork. An accommodation unit will be provided at St. Patrick's in Fermoy shortly and there is one in Mallow. The letter states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_502">Things are less good elsewhere, however, and so I am also writing to ask for your help in addressing the national deficit, by way of an amendment to the Disability Bill currently before the Oireachtas. The Disability Legislation Consultation Group has identified ten fundamental flaws in the Bill as it stands, and I am listing and enclosing these on a separate sheet. While we would welcome your support on any or all of these issues, I am asking you personally to address two specific points. [The previous speaker referred to the points stated by Mr. Annesley in this regard.]</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_503">1. Access to housing and the provision of appropriate levels of supported accommodation are of paramount importance in combating and mitigating mental ill-health, as in other areas of disability. At present there is no coherent policy for meeting accommodation needs, and the Bill fails to address this deficiency.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_504">The Bill should impose a duty on the Department of Health and Children, in conjunction with the Health Service Executive, to assess and quantify present and future accommodation needs. The Bill should also impose on the Department of the Environment a duty to work with the Department of Health and Children, Local Government and other appropriate statutory and non-statutory agencies to provide the accommodation to meet those needs.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_505">Unless this is done now, it is likely that accommodation needs will in many areas continue to be met, at best, haphazardly and often not at all.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_506">I am therefore asking you to seek to amend the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">I am using this opportunity to ask the Minister of State to note what has been said and to amend the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">The letter goes on to state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_509">2. For many people, mental health difficulties are long-term or recurrent but acute illness is intermittent or episodic. The level of disability experienced in such episodes may be extreme and even life-threatening.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_510">It is unjust that episodic disability is at risk of being excluded from the provisions of the Bill. It would be intolerable if a person could access services under the Bill only if he/she had already received a diagnosis of chronic disability. In any individual case, even if a clinician comes to believe that such a diagnosis could be justified, he may equally believe that, in the patient's best interest, such a diagnosis should <i>not </i>be given at that time, if ever.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_511">Therefore, I am asking you to seek to have the Bill amended.</p>
          <p eId="para_512">Great work is being done by people in every parish. These people have made the effort to put in writing their observations, contentions and objections to much of the Bill. The Disability Bill has been awaited for many years. I hope the Minister of State will take these points into consideration. The great, voluntary effort by people must be recognised by this Government. I look forward to Committee and Report Stages of the Bill and hope amendments will be made by the Government to make it easy to implement. That is what people with disabilities need. I will back any case made in support of people with disabilities.</p>

        <speech by="#PatBreen" eId="spk_285">
          <from>Mr. P. Breen</from>
          <p eId="para_513">I wish to share my time with Deputy Hayes. I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important Bill which I am sure is being watched closely by all concerned citizens as an indictor of how well the State intends to treat the most vulnerable and those most in need in society. There are 360,000 people with disabilities in this country with many thousands more caring and supporting them every day. Despite this statistic, this group often finds it difficult to have its voice heard by policymakers. I want to help put that right. These thousands of people have struggled to have their voices heard for many years. The House will recall the campaign for disability legislation by the Forum for People with Disabilities began as far back as 1990. Some 12 years later, the Government made a failed attempt to address the need with the 2002 Disability Bill. It was a Bill written in haste and without due consideration for those most affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">The Government's latest attempt to remedy a situation it should have remedied years ago is before the House. Given that the Government has had 14 years to address concerns and has gone through the failed experience of the 2002 Bill, one would have thought that this Bill would have done the job. Unfortunately, it does not. Comprehensive and adequate legislation to address the needs of the disabled community and incorporating the excellently articulated requirements of their representative groups should include some essential elements such as a right to an independent assessment and services, an independent appeals and complaints procedure, meaningful targets in regard to employment and access to buildings and a wide definition of disability which would include those with mental health problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">Since 1992, the Government has commissioned and paid for three consultative groups to make recommendations. Their output was the basis for a good disability Bill. However, the Government has ignored the results. While it employs the language in the reports of these groups, it does not employ the substance. The substance of the recommendations of three excellent consultative groups has been ignored.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">The Bill does not contain the essential elements I have outlined. It is inadequate and forces disabled people into a bureaucratic nightmare. It forces people to search and scrape for essential services. When individuals like Séamus Green of the National Parents and Siblings Alliance say things such as "We are reasonable people" and "We don't expect miracles", it makes me wonder what world the Government lives in or wants us to live in. Carers, parents and siblings deserve reasonable treatment. Given the work they do day in, day out, they deserve miracles. Disabled people deserve better from the Government and deserve better legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">These people should certainly have a right to an independent assessment and, crucially, to services. They should have an independent appeals and complaints procedure. They deserve meaningful targets in regard to employment and access to buildings. There should be a wider definition of disability that would include those with mental health problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">As legal experts on the subject have argued, there is a fundamental difference between the attitude to equality within European law and that adopted by the Government. The approach taken by the European Union is to enforce equality by means of a legal right not to be discriminated against, harassed or victimised and a right to reasonable accommodation. Should an employer or service provider not comply with the right to equality, the employee or service receiver may seek redress in the courts. The Bill does not deliver these rights to our disabled people. It is not as if the Government did not have the time to get this right. It had plenty of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">The disability legislation consultative group met the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Fahey, last year to express its concerns. It also met the Taoiseach and had hoped for a positive response to the reasonable amendments. That group, which represents 597 organisations, said there were fundamental flaws in the Bill, yet the same legislation is before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">As with much of Government policy in recent years, the Bill appears to ignore the realities, for example, in my constituency of Clare, with which the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, is aware. The personal assistant service is vital for people with disabilities. This issue highlights a flaw in the Bill. There are 30 people in Clare who have been assessed for the personal assistant service and are on a waiting list two years later. The Bill will not help those 30 people or their families or any other family in a similar situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">The Bill may guarantee the right to an assessment, but without rights to services, it is fundamentally flawed. Disabled persons cannot take up work with large employers such as the Army, the Garda or the Naval Service. The 3% employment targets points also to another flaw in the Bill. The definition of disability used to assess how this target is being met is less strict than the general definition in the Bill. Therefore, when the Government is being tested, a condition such as asthma can be considered a disability, but in the general context of the Bill, the disability must be persistent and ongoing. This excludes those in the early stages of conditions, for example, those with multiple sclerosis. It also excludes those with conditions that can seriously disable them. The Government wants it both ways; strict definition in terms of rights and looser definition in terms of assessing whether the 3% employment target has been met.</p>
          <p eId="para_522">We had the shocking 50% cutback in the annual budget in the Mid-Western Health Board area for the special respite home purchased for the Brothers of Charity in Ennis. Some of the children need 2:1 staffing levels. The home was unable to provide respite care for the children who need it most. The inadequacies of the system and what it provides for people with disabilities and their carers are obvious and disgraceful. People are at the end of their tether. The position has deteriorated to such a degree that one of my constituents, who is in a wheelchair, resorted to telling the Minister that if it were physically possible, he would chain himself to the railings of Dáil Éireann and stay there until disabled people got the recognition they deserve.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">In 1999, a ten-point plan drawn up by groups representing people with disabilities was published in Ennis. The plan, drawn up by the Centre for Independent Living in conjunction with the information age town project, the Central Remedial Clinic and the Disabled People of Clare, called on the Government to bring forward changes for people with disabilities to achieve full social, civil and political rights. Those are needs and realities for the 360,000 disabled people in Ireland, those in Clare, and their carers, families and siblings. This is what was expected from the legislation. The assessment of the legislation is best carried out by those who will be most affected by it and they have handed down their assessment.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">Some time ago, 700 disabled people, their families and carers packed the RDS and Leinster House at a public meeting. They highlighted ten serious flaws and described it as forcing disabled people into a bureaucratic nightmare. Let us take, for example, a disabled person who wishes to make a complaint about service provision. The Bill places four layers of bureaucracy between them and resolution of their complaint and the process can take up to 18 months. This is after years on a waiting list. When it comes to access to buildings, they face more bureaucracy. The Bill places the burden of proving inaccessibility on the disabled person. Any reasonable person can see that placing sole responsibility on the person in this case is wholly unsatisfactory and shameful.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">Even if the Minister did not like what he was hearing from the representative groups of persons with disabilities when they made their assessment, the Government should have heeded the views of the Human Rights Commission. The State should set itself to be judged by the highest standards of international law given our economic status and the citizens' desire to see fair treatment for the vulnerable in society. Instead, the President of the Human Rights Commission, Dr. Maurice Manning, said the legislation was defective based on analysis of international law.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">Those most affected by the Bill call it flawed while those charged with monitoring rights call it defective. In its current state, the Bill is an insult to disabled persons, their families and carers and is more evidence, if we needed it, of the Government's detachment from the realities of people's lives.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_286">
          <from>Mr. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_527">I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to the debate. The last Disability Bill was withdrawn because every organisation representing disabled persons opposed it. There was a public outcry that the Government, one of the richest in the world, was failing to give disabled people their entitlements. In examining the record of what has happened in recent years, it is clear that many voluntary organisations became involved in helping the disabled. Were it not for those voluntary organisations, the religious and others, where would the disabled be in society?</p>
          <p eId="para_528">I refer to the work of the Tipperary association for the mentally handicapped. It has undertaken fund-raising efforts and set up throughout the county schools and help centres such as the Moore Haven Centre. This is mirrored in every other constituency. When discussing this Bill we should not be afraid to applaud those people while also taking on board the many issues for which they have lobbied. The disability legislative consultative group has issued a list of ten requests which in its view are not addressed in this Bill. This is a matter for concern and the House should take cognisance of the views of these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Those who work in the disability sector must be commended. There is nothing as frustrating as working a system that could and should be improved. I refer to the situation in Australia which provides home support to people with disabilities. I have spoken to a person who worked in Australia and now works in the disability sector in this country. We have much to learn from their system.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">The needs of young people with disabilities in schools and the lack of funding by the Department of Education and Science should be of concern to each of us. There is no Member of the Oireachtas who has not been lobbied by individuals and families on behalf of those with disabilities. They come from every part of the country and they are trying to help young people with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">On the subject of the disabled person's grant, money was expended and wasted on electronic voting. The waiting list for assessment for the grant is at 180 in my constituency. This is deplorable when so much money is available and is being wasted.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">Having consulted widely, the Government was true to its word. A long and detailed process of assessing various voluntary organisations and groups took place. Discussions and negotiations were held with Government officials in the hope that their members would receive the recognition and resources required to live a life where equality, independence and choice was as natural for people with disabilities as it is for each of us. Then came the long wait for the publication of the new Bill. This Bill had to be better; the Government had finally recognised that the people, by their nature, wanted to do the right thing for people with disabilities. Having taken such a long time, it was hoped the consultative process had produced a Bill that was better. On publication of the new Bill, it soon became apparent that the consultative process had not led anywhere. Those who had concerns about the delaying tactic were certainly proved right. Had the local and European elections anything to do with that?</p>
          <p eId="para_533">The Government chose to ignore the majority of the recommendations made by the various organisations. It is arguable that this Bill is more restrictive than the previous one, although couched in better language. In the final analysis its main objective is to indemnify the State against any obligation to treat people with disabilities equally. Everything is contingent on a certain amount of resources being made available. The public supports the efforts to make more resources available to those with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">Assessment will establish the need of every disabled person, but without a direct or binding line to the service statement, all it may do is raise expectations only to find that the resources are not to be made available. This would be very disappointing. A long drawn-out process has been undertaken to assess needs. This Bill should be made more amenable. The views of those who have worked in a voluntary capacity should be heeded because if not, this Bill will go nowhere. It is not the responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to provide for the building of houses for those with disabilities. This should be addressed in the Bill. I appeal to the Government to take on board the views of the bodies and organisations who have made representations. Action is needed now to provide a better quality of life for people with disabilities.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_287">
          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_535">I am privileged to have the opportunity to make a few observations on this important legislation. God knows it is a long time coming but it will have an impact in a substantial and measurable way on the lives of tens of thousands of citizens. It will impact on their carers, families and loved ones and on their quality of life. This cannot be said of much of the legislation that goes through this House. It behoves us to deal with this as the important legislation it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_536">I come with the perspective of a former Minister for Health who saw, even in my time, the area of disability coming out of the shadows. I listened to the radio today to the celebrations of the origins of St. Michael's House which happened because somebody put an advertisement in the newspaper for people connected to anyone with a mental disability to come together to see what could be done to support and help them. The prevailing view in this society and probably in every other society for a very long time is that people with disabilities or people who were less abled or differently abled were a cause for charity. In recent times we have moved beyond that and what is now at stake is the demand for full vindication of the rights of citizens, not tokenisms, sops or charity but a real understanding that differently abled people have a right to full citizenship and all that involves.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">Campaigning groups have changed the public perspective on disability in recent years. There is more inclusiveness in the approach to education. Now schools do not think of excluding people because they are physically challenged or have an intellectual disability but rather see how that can be overcome to enrich the school environment in total by inclusion, not exclusion and compartmentalisation. Disabled people and differently abled people are involved in the full gamut of public life as is right and proper. This change in perspective has impacted on planners although there are still too many side-door solutions to access. In general, people expect those who are unsighted or have sight or mobility difficulties to be able to access public buildings and conduct their business. We have not reached those goals but there is an expectation that this should be the case. Nobody argues it should be otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">The most impactive event in recent years to engage and capture the public imagination was the Special Olympics. Each of us is disabled in some way. Those games copperfastened the notion that everyone, regardless of ability, has a right to full participation and, moreover, has great gifts that can bring significant enrichment to society. When I became Minister in the Department of Health and Children there was no accurate measure of the degree of intellectual disability. Groups campaigning for services and supports at that time found there was not even an accurate measure of the volume of need. We proceeded to set up the first register to measure the volume and degree of need accurately. Only when such information is available can one begin to put in place a structured response.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">We have come a long way since then. We do not have broad strokes of need where whatever was available, whether day care or full-time residential care, had to be applied for by all because it might be the only care option. There is an understanding in modern times that what is required is the measurement of the specific needs of individuals and the responsibility and obligation of the State to respond to that analysis on a case-by-case basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">What has been the political response to this development of public opinion in its recognition of the exclusion of some of our citizens from full participation in citizenship? The programme for Government promised legislation based on a commitment to rights:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_541">We will complete consultations on the Disability Bill and will bring the amended Bill through the Oireachtas and include provisions for rights of assessment, appeals, provision and enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">This is the promise the Government freely entered into and made publicly. There is an expectation that what is written into the programme for Government should be delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">Instead, there has been a shoddy welshing on this publicly and freely made commitment by the parties in Government. The broad-ranging consultations that were promised were delivered through a process which conveniently dragged on without exposing the Government's real intent until last summer's local and European elections were over. This meant there could be no public judgment on the delivery of the Government's promises. The Government has made a mess of this situation once. After being forced to withdraw the legislation, one would imagine it would get it right on the second attempt.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Consultations did not involve a two-way system whereby views were taken on board. The National Disability Authority chaired the group set up by the disability advocacy movement to set out the views of that movement on this critical legislation. The disability advocacy groups made extensive representations to the Government, published detailed documents and set out their expectations of rights-based legislation that would provide assessment, provision and enforcement as of right. It is ironic that during this extended period of consultation which ran to two years, the Government was full of praise for the inputs of these groups. On several occasions in this House, the Taoiseach lauded the work of the advocacy groups and did not quibble to any degree with their expectations and proposals. The publication of the Bill represented a sham and a shameful disregard for the broad-ranging consultations and the contributions all those advocacy groups brought to the discussion table.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">As part of the consultation process, the disability movement itself changed because it came to accept that rights could not just be laid out with the expectation that they would be delivered the next day. There was an understanding in this dialogue that there would have to be timeframes because all the necessary therapists, support staff and residential and day care facilities could not be provided immediately. All these developments required careful planning over an agreed timeframe and a resource allocation. The advocacy groups brought that understanding to the discussions. There was no short-changing of the Government with an expectation that was unreal. There was an understanding that, in a partnership way, historic change could be brought about and that supports to vindicate people's rights could be introduced over time in a structured, feasible and affordable manner.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">The disability movement had the courage to state this in its documents and to put it to its members, including families in urgent need of support, so it could dampen expectations that change could be achieved overnight or that there was any magic-wand solution to providing adequate resources and supports. Advocacy groups would have supported this Bill if it had outlined a set of rights in principle and set out a structure and process to achieve those rights on a planned, focused and individual basis. That would have been reasonable, affordable and morally right. It would also have been the correct approach in terms of keeping faith with the words of the Taoiseach and the promises contained in the programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">Unfortunately, the Government's response was a Bill that meets nobody's needs except that of the Government itself to pretend to be doing something on this issue. Even the Bill's definition of disability is unclear and too narrow. What is lacking is a principle that should be at the core of the Bill. The required principle is that services should be provided to allow the vindication of full citizenship as a right.</p>

            <from>Dr. Twomey</from>
            <p eId="para_560">This motion concerns two cancers that affect women of all age groups. Breast cancer is more common in women over 50 and women with a strong family history of the disease. Cervical cancer, or cancer of the cervix, which is part of the uterus or womb, has a number of risk factors. These factors include smoking, the incidence of which is increasing among young women, and the human papilloma virus, the incidence of which is also increasing in the female population. The more sexual partners a woman has, the more likely she is to contract cervical cancer. In the treatment of all cancers, time is of the essence and early detection through screening is critically important.</p>
            <p eId="para_561">In two years, Fianna Fáil will have been in power for ten years and we will still not have a nationwide breast cancer screening programme. It is now five years since phase one of the service commenced in the eastern region. It is four years since the publication of the national cancer strategy, which promised that breast and cervical cancer screening would be extended nationwide. In the intervening period, we have had nothing but a litany of announcements that amounted to nothing. The former Minister for Health and Children was well known for the number of press releases he issued. He issued them almost on a daily basis. It is therefore no wonder that patients in the south and west were expecting breast cancer screening in 2005 but, sadly, as we now know, that will not be the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_562">Serious questions must be asked about why the roll-out has been delayed so severely. For example, capital funding for the roll-out of BreastCheck was not allocated until 18 months after the Department of Health and Children announced its national extension. Why? Why have BreastCheck's press releases indicated that its understanding of the roll-out timeframe was at odds with that of the Department? This kind of disarray has become increasingly common under the Government. Tragically, the implications of the delay in the roll-out of these services have been under estimated.</p>
            <p eId="para_563">One of the former Minister's press statements from February 2003 states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_564">In relation to the extension to the remaining counties, the Minister said that the Board of BreastCheck has submitted a Business Plan to his Department. A number of key issues have been raised by health boards and health professionals in relation to the national roll out of BreastCheck which need to be addressed in advance of further expansion. I am fully committed to the extension of the programme to the remaining counties in the West and South and I will be meeting with BreastCheck shortly to discuss these issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_565">We on this side of the House would dearly like to know what those issues were and the concerns of the professionals and the health boards. In the two years since that announcement, there has been zero movement in regard to BreastCheck and breast screening in the south and west.</p>
            <p eId="para_566">Women are being told they will have to wait until 2008 to be screened and treated for breast cancer on an equal basis. In 2008, women in Northern Ireland will celebrate 15 years of breast cancer screening and a reduction of one fifth in deaths from the disease. By that time, because of delays in the roll-out of the programme, hundreds of women in the Republic of Ireland will have lost their lives in their battle against breast cancer. This is not an exaggeration. Hundreds more will have endured devastating and radical surgery to control advanced breast carcinoma. This is terrible.</p>
            <p eId="para_567">The late diagnosis of cancer will require more severe chemotherapy for the patients involved and women will suffer the terrible side effects of the radiotherapy required to bring advanced cancer under control. At the same time, many women will have had their uteruses removed because cancers will have spread before treatment can be given, denying some women the chance to have children. This is because it is often a disease of young women. It will deny some children the chance of having a mother. These are the implications of a delay in the roll-out of a screening programme. Such a programme is taken for granted by our near neighbours in Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_568">The Government has no idea of the cost to the quality of life of all the women who endure cancer treatment, nor does it know what is entailed. This is the case for all cancer patients but I refer in particular to those who could benefit from two very vital screening programmes that would have been implemented long before now if the Government was really serious about the health service. It is not a question of what we have been reading in the papers for the past six months.</p>
            <p eId="para_569">There are changes in our society and behaviour that make the roll-out of cervical cancer screening more urgent than is generally acknowledged. I have already pointed out some of these changes in regard to cervical cancer and the risk factors involved, such as smoking, the human papilloma virus and the number of sexual partners a woman may have. Given the risk factors, screening should begin six months after a woman becomes sexually active. Screening is relatively straightforward and involves a smear test. Thousands of these tests are carried out each year in many general practitioners' surgeries. It is known as opportunistic screening because it is done by general practitioners when they offer the service to patients or when the patients request it from them.</p>
            <p eId="para_570">Is it not strange that the smear test, which can be carried out in the general practitioner's surgery by either the general practitioner or practice nurse, has been available for more than two decades in Northern Ireland? It is a good question to ask where we stand in the South. Five years ago, a pilot programme started in the Limerick region but five years later it has made precisely zero progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_571">The national cancer strategy itself contains some inequalities which should be addressed and which I have raised before in the House with the Minister. For example, the cancer screening test, the smear test for cervical cancer, is not available to medical card patients or young women on low incomes. Young women are particularly at risk of cervical cancer.</p>
            <p eId="para_572">The cavalier attitude of the former Minister for Health and Children and his Minister of State with responsibility for the elderly is reflected in the ageism associated with restricting the planned breast screening services to those aged between 50 and 64 and cervical cancer screening to those aged up to 60.</p>
            <p eId="para_573">It is acceptable that there be a starting point for every screening programme but the end point should be based on the same medical criteria. I would accept the Minister's attaching an age limit to the programme if it was just to get it off the ground in two or three years. However, the age limit is unacceptable given that half the female population has had to wait five years for the programme to reach them. Cervical cancer can be diagnosed after the age of 60 and breast cancer can be diagnosed after 65. The average female lifespan in Ireland is approximately 82 years which should be reflected in any screening programme. Stopping a screening programme 22 years before the average woman may die is ageism.</p>
            <p eId="para_574">Unfortunately, the Government has no commitment to any form of primary screening. The piecemeal and incoherent roll-out of a national programme for BreastCheck and cervical screening is a sad reflection on the Government and is leading to a devastating outcome for the women of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_575">Fianna Fáil has not only failed to provide cancer screening but it has also failed to provide proper facilities for the treatment of all cancers. It has failed to publish reports, including the radiotherapy report that sat in the Department of Health and Children for almost the full tenure of the former Minister, Deputy Martin. He received the report in 2000 and did not publish it until shortly before he left the Department. He almost made it his trademark to issue reports but cancer screening and treatment services are at Third World standard. This Government can have no excuse for this.</p>
            <p eId="para_576">Just over half the population can avail of BreastCheck. It might be important for politicians in whose constituencies there is no BreastCheck facility to see what happens. An appointment for a routine mammogram can take between six and 12 months in an area which does not have access to BreastCheck. I have seen women who missed early diagnosis because the wait for the appointment was too long or because to make an earlier appointment they had to pay for it, and were later diagnosed with breast cancer. These women may not have had palpable lumps but had risk factors.</p>
            <p eId="para_577">BreastCheck has made a dramatic improvement in patient care and reducing the morbidity associated with breast cancer. Morbidity refers to the side effects of cancer, for example, swollen arms, losing a breast and all the related psychological problems. Affected women may also die. The Government should take this on board and do something about it immediately. I hope the Government parties will accept the points we make tonight and demand that the Government roll out BreastCheck and the national cervical screening programme and stop the dallying of the past four years.</p>

          <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_291">
            <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
            <p eId="para_578">I thank Deputy Twomey for putting this motion before the House and facilitating a debate on such an important health issue. A great deal of money has been wasted on electronic voting, Abbottstown and Punchestown, and has been scattered like confetti at election time. Promises have been made yet one of the major issues, the health service and, in particular in the context of this motion, women's health have been taken for granted. In my constituency of Carlow-Kilkenny a roll-out of the BreastCheck programme and the national cervical screening programme was promised but it has not happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_579">People took this political promise in good faith before the last general election and it has been thrown back in their faces almost three years later. The Taoiseach, the Minister for Health and Children and local government representatives promised a radiotherapy service for the south east, based at Waterford Regional Hospital, in advance of the 2002 general election, but that has been abandoned and there is no sign of its implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_580">People have taken to the streets in Waterford and the south east to ask for basic facilities for preventative medicine in the form of these two programmes. The failure to implement the programmes shows the low priority the Government assigns to women's health. It is unacceptable when it has significant resources at its disposal that such low priority is given to a modest scheme that would help provide early and accurate diagnosis of cancer in women.</p>
            <p eId="para_581">Families worry about health. No family has escaped tragedy of some kind, one of the greatest of which, apart from a sudden death, is the prolonged worry about and fear of cancer, its treatment and the services available. This trauma which women in particular have suffered, for want of the early diagnosis these schemes could provide, indicates the callousness of the Department, the Minister for Health and Children and the Government in general.</p>
            <p eId="para_582">The former Minister for Health and Children commissioned many consultancy groups and reports but regrettably took no action. The present Minister seeks to hide behind a commitment to develop cancer services further without indicating the timescale for the implementation of the two programmes. The Government should stop making promises about these schemes. They should implement the programmes promised years ago, particularly before the last general election. I call on them to roll out the BreastCheck programme for my constituents in Carlow-Kilkenny and implement a proper public radiotherapy service for the people of the south east on the campus of Waterford Regional Hospital without delay.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_292">
            <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
            <p eId="para_583">I congratulate Deputy Twomey on tabling this motion. I am pleased to see the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, here. As I drove here today I heard an advertisement on the radio extolling the virtues of BreastCheck and inviting women to apply, but it was of no use to the 57,598 women in Connacht, Tipperary North Riding and County Clare. There are no BreastCheck facilities in those areas and there will not be. A total of 150 women aged between 50 and 64 years of age in that cohort of women have the potential to contract the disease. For every subsequent year between 70 and 80 women will be so diagnosed. That is a potential death sentence for those women. Why five years ago were women in an area around Dublin and the midlands given the opportunity to come forward for BreastCheck while those in the rest of the country were sent to the back of the queue? How can that be justified? Women are infuriated by this. If the women about whom I am speaking can pay for a check, they will get it, but what about the thousands of women who cannot pay for it? These women are condemned as second-class citizens.</p>
            <p eId="para_584">The Government and the Minister for Health and Children are involved in a PR stunt. They are giving the impression throughout the country that the service is available to everyone. Every now and again, a Minister promotes this idea which everyone knows is very important when women reach that stage in their life. However, the money is not being put into the system. Those involved in the national screening programme and I believe that if funding was made available, every area would be covered within the next year. There is no need to further test the waters in this area. This has been going on since 1998. All the facilities and procedures have been put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_585">The Minister of State is being most unfair to the 57,000 women who live in the area I know best, namely, Connacht, Tipperary North Riding and County Clare. Funding is available to the Minister and the Government to provide this service because Exchequer returns the week before last indicate the Government never had more money at its disposal. It is not good enough to say to that cohort of women, who have reared their families and helped this economy, that they must wait for this service until 2007, 2008, 2009 and God knows how long more. There will be a backlash as a result of this and I am pleased to have had an opportunity to make my views on this important matter known to the Government parties. People are not prepared to gamble with their lives. It would be different if everyone was in a financial position to pay for a breast check, but that is not the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_586">It will be interesting tomorrow night to see what Members will do when the Government parties vote on this matter. They will take a different stance from the message they portray when they are in the constituencies throughout the country. We will see the colour of their money when they vote. Many of them are giving the impression that this matter will be solved within the next year, but my understanding is that people in the west, who should be able to have such a check tomorrow morning, cannot expect a free breast check until 2008 or 2009, which is a disgrace.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_293">
            <from>Mr. Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_587">It is recognised that the early detection of cancer by screening is one of the strategic areas of cancer prevention. Clinical trials of specific screening methods have been shown to be effective in detecting breast and cervical cancer.</p>
            <p eId="para_588">Breast cancer has now overtaken both lung and bowel cancer to become the second most common cancer in Ireland. Women in the Republic are suffering because of the failure to extend BreastCheck nationally. The national breast screening programme commenced in February 2000 and to date it has only been rolled out in very small pockets of the country. We know from our neighbours in Northern Ireland, where the cancer screening programme was rolled out some time ago, that the rate of cancer there is considerably lower than in the South.</p>
            <p eId="para_589">I would like to refer specifically to County Kerry. Deputy McManus recently organised a seminar in Tralee which was attended by approximately 250 people. Women in County Kerry are very concerned about their health, and rightly so. The rate of breast cancer in Kerry is among the highest in the country. Treatment in the county is symptomatic because women are only treated when they find a lump or when their GP refers them for a mammogram to Tralee. There are no screening services in the county. As the Minister of State will be aware, if cancer is undetected, it will get larger and spread. However, if it is detected early, it can be treated successfully, and there is less need for mutilating surgery, which is very important for women. Lack of screening services in Kerry is leading to more deaths and more mutilating surgery, which is very distressing for women.</p>
            <p eId="para_590">The number of full mastectomies in Kerry is much higher than in the rest of the country. This is another factor which should be considered seriously. Each year, approximately 60 new cases of breast cancer are presented in the county. Given the population of the county the fact that there are no screening services means at least another 30 people do not present themselves for a check. Unfortunately, it is too late for many of these people when their GP becomes suspicious that a lump in the breast could be cancerous.</p>
            <p eId="para_591">I appeal to the Minister of State, who comes from the southern area, to use his influence to ensure the current timescale of the end of 2008, when it is expected to have a screening programme in Kerry, is brought forward considerably. There is no doubt that this will be a big issue in the next election. Commitments in this regard were given by the Government. Prior to the last election, the people of Kerry were told that a screening programme would be put in place within two years, but now they must wait for more than six years for such a programme. At the time, a clear commitment was given to the women of Kerry, but it has not been honoured and people are furious. While people may not be affected themselves, they know of women who have died unnecessarily from cancer.</p>
            <p eId="para_592">I thank Deputy Twomey for raising this issue. As a medical doctor, he is well aware of the distress and the number of deaths breast cancer causes throughout the country. Deputies from many parts of the country will be aware of people who have died from breast cancer or who have had their breast removed. From discussing the issue with women, we know at first-hand and can relate in the House this evening the stories of women who have breast cancer. I hope the Government will take note of what has been said.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TomHayes" eId="spk_294">
            <from>Mr. Hayes</from>
            <p eId="para_593">I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak on this important motion. I commend Deputy Twomey for tabling it and bringing his knowledge in the medical field to the House. We as politicians need to be reminded of the urgency of treating cancer and the frightening experience many families have had to endure because of a close relative, neighbour or friend who has suffered from this deadly disease. We have had many reports and consultations. However, if we are worth our salt we should give people the opportunity to have proper breast checks. It is unfair to allow such a situation to arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_594">I recently received a note from a 25 year old lady who has found a lump on her breast. She said she will be visiting the doctor in the next few days but she thinks screening should be made available. A close relative had both breasts removed last June. She is 50 years old and her doctor ordered a priority mammogram. She got an appointment for November 2005. Recently, a woman in her fifties, who has worked in nursing since she left school, came to my clinic to get her appointment at a Dublin hospital brought forward. It is deplorable to put people in this situation. We could talk about the issue for hours but this is a deadly disease and the Government should be upfront with people and do something that will help them. They are at a vulnerable stage in their lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_595">I represent a constituency formerly represented by the late Ms Theresa Ahearne who died from cancer. Prior to her death she spoke about the poor state of services. She was complimentary about the hospital she attended but very vocal with regard to what she saw as the problems experienced by people with cancer.</p>
            <p eId="para_596">A campaign for improved cancer services is ongoing in the south east. There is no commitment with regard to that. The Government does not take the issue seriously. Money is wasted on an endless list of initiatives such as e-voting. We have a duty and a responsibility. As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I see money wasted on a weekly basis. It is deplorable that money is not made available for people with cancer. It affects many people and families, which is why I fully support this motion.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_295">
            <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_597">Ba mhaith liom tacú leis an rún ar son Theachtaí Shinn Féin. This is a timely and important motion which I fully support on behalf of Sinn Féin. I thank my Fine Gael colleagues for the opportunity to speak.</p>
            <p eId="para_598">The Irish Cancer Society is to be commended for its current campaign which calls for the roll-out of a national cervical cancer screening programme. On the day the Dáil rose for its Easter recess, 23 March, I questioned the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, on this issue. In response, she stated she favoured the roll-out of such a national programme. She also stated that she would support cross-Border co-operation in this area. I welcome that and hope she keeps her word. However, the Government amendment to this motion is disappointing in that regard and I cannot support its request for us to have blind faith in the Tánaiste or any other Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_599">I call on the Government to act in accordance with this motion, as tabled by Deputy Twomey. It should also heed the call of the Irish Cancer Society and 24 organisations, including trade unions, professional bodies and women's networks which joined together on 24 February in a unanimous call for a national pre-cancer screening programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_600">In 2000, there were 1,090 cases of <i>in situ</i> cervical cancer, a pre-cancerous state, 193 cases of invasive cancer and 65 deaths. Comprehensive screening leading to early detection and treatment can dramatically reduce both the development of cancer and the death toll arising from the disease. The Minister should therefore roll-out a screening programme as soon as possible. Screening should be available free of charge to all women over the age of 25. There should not be a ceiling age of 65. We must recognise that women beyond that age are equally entitled to full access and all necessary treatments. There should be a register of women to facilitate such a programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_601">The Government will cite the costs of such a programme but the Minister should explore ways in which these can be reduced, including economies of scale. This is where all-Ireland co-operation has a role. The Minister has described such co-operation as a good idea and she should act accordingly.</p>
            <p eId="para_602">As stated in the motion, the roll-out of the BreastCheck service has not happened as promised and, as a result, cancer will go undetected and lives will undoubtedly be lost. According to the National Cancer Registry one in 13 women in Ireland will develop breast cancer and a woman living in Ireland is four times more likely to die from the disease than her European counterparts. These are very worrying statistics and affect every family. Every Member knows the harrowing reality of cancer within their own family, as I do.</p>
            <p eId="para_603">By failing to put these programmes in place, the Government is operating a false economy. Comprehensive cancer screening programmes will save massive resources for the health services through early detection and prevention. Above all, it will save women's lives. This must be the key motivation and central focus for each of us. There is no excuse for failing to deliver on this issue. In the regrettable absence of the Minister's support for the motion, I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Tim O'Malley, to ensure the Minister proceeds with the indications she gave on 23 March. I welcomed them at the time and continue to urge and encourage her in that regard.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#TimOMalleyPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_296">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O’Malley)</from>
            <p eId="para_604">I apologise on behalf of the Tánaiste who cannot be here as she has a prior engagement.</p>
            <p title="amendmentProposal" eId="para_605">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_606">To delete all words after "Dáil Éireann" and to substitute the following:</p>
            <p class="indent_2" eId="para_607">"commends the Government for the significant increases in investment in cancer services, in particular the development of services for women with breast cancer and cervical cancer, and supports the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children in her commitment to further develop cancer services nationally."</p>
            <p eId="para_608">There have been significant increases in investment in cancer services since 1997. In parallel, we have also seen major improvements in cancer across all modalities of care, specifically medical oncology, oncology surgery, radiation oncology and supportive care.</p>
            <p eId="para_609">Overall relative survival from cancers increased for men and women between 1995 and 2002. With regard to women, there were increases in survival of the four most common cancers: breast, lung, colorectal and lymphoma. With regard to men, survival improved for almost all cancers, notably for cancer of prostate and stomach, as well as lymphoma and leukaemia. By far the best survival rate for the commonest cancers was for female breast cancer. The overall true risk of developing cancer, allowing for the effects of population changes and ageing, is not increasing for women and is increasing by only 0.6% for men. The true risk of dying from cancer is decreasing by about 1% per annum. We have seen a substantial increase in oncology related activity in hospitals. The number of patients with a diagnosis of cancer rose from 58,000 in 1998 to over 80,000 in 2002. The number of day cases increased by 68% between 1998 and 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_610">International evidence demonstrates the proven efficacy of population-based screening programmes that are effectively managed and meet quality assurance standards. The Tánaiste is fully committed to implementing screening programmes which have proven efficacy in line with best international standards. The European Commission's recommendations on cancer screening were adopted by the European Council in December 2003. These recommendations proposed that screening tests which have demonstrated their efficacy should be seriously considered, and that the decision to implement such programmes should be based on available professional expertise and priority setting for health care resources in each member state. Population-based screening programmes for breast and cervical cancer have been proven to reduce mortality, with subsequent improvements in population health in terms of survival, morbidity and quality of life. Screening aims to improve survival from cancer, limit morbidity from cancer and improve the quality of life of those who have developed cancer.</p>
            <p eId="para_611">I am pleased to have this opportunity to outline the considerable investment that has been made in recent years in the national breast screening programme and the Irish cervical screening programme. I take this opportunity to set out the current position on the development of these services nationally. The extension of the current breast screening programme to the remaining counties in the country is a major priority in the development of cancer services nationally, as is the extension of the pilot cervical screening programme. The Tánaiste has committed to making sure that BreastCheck will be available to women in all parts of the country. I am confident that during 2007 screening will commence in the western and southern counties.</p>
            <p eId="para_612">BreastCheck, the national breast screening programme, commenced in the eastern, north-eastern and midland regions in February 2000. Screening is offered free of charge to women in the 50 to 64 age group in these regions. From the commencement of the screening programme to September 2004, 167,000 women were invited for screening and 120,000 women availed of the service. Under the national expansion, all women in the relevant age group will have access to breast screening and follow-up treatment, where appropriate. It is estimated that the cancer detection rate is approximately 7.8 per 1,000 screened and to date over 1,000 cancers have been detected. Screening uptake among eligible women is almost 77%, which is in excess of the 70% required to reach the target of reducing mortality by 20%.</p>
            <p eId="para_613">The expansion of the BreastCheck programme to counties Carlow, Kilkenny and Wexford is under way. Screening commenced in Wexford in March 2004. BreastCheck expects to commence screening in Carlow in April this year and screening will follow in County Kilkenny when the first round screening in Carlow is completed. There are approximately 18,000 women in the target age group in the south-eastern area.</p>
            <p eId="para_614">The national roll-out of the programme required detailed planning for the development of essential infrastructure to provide for two clinical units, one in Cork and one in Galway. This detailed planning involved considerable work by BreastCheck, University College Hospital, Galway, the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, Cork, and the Department of Health and Children. There are approximately 130,000 women in the target population for screening in the southern and western regions.</p>
            <p eId="para_615">The planning of two static clinical units necessitated the establishment of two capital project teams to develop briefs for the construction of the two units. The former Western Health Board prepared detailed option appraisals for the BreastCheck development at University College Hospital, Galway. The brief proposals, with cost and phasing options, were then submitted to the Department for consideration. After careful evaluation the most appropriate option was selected. The South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital considered it necessary to commission a site strategy study to ensure the integration of the breast screening service into the present and future developments at the hospital. The Department made a capital grant of €230,000 available for the study to be undertaken by professional architectural, engineering and quantity surveying experts. This study was completed in mid-2004 and brief proposals were submitted to the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_616">After the evaluation of both briefs the Department was in a position to determine the capital funding requirements for the progression of both developments. These requirements were considered in the context of the overall capital investment framework and in September 2004 approval for a capital investment of approximately €21 million was given for the construction of the units. This investment will also provide for the mobile units which will be available to screen women throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_617">Subsequently, discussions took place between BreastCheck, the South Infirmary-Victoria Hospital, the former Western Health Board and the Department in regard to design issues surrounding the development of the static units. In addition, it was decided to relocate and develop the symptomatic breast service back to back with the BreastCheck development at University College Hospital, Galway. In December 2004 the Tánaiste approved additional capital funding of €3 million to support this development.</p>
            <p eId="para_618">Capital funding for the facilities at Cork and Galway has been identified under the capital investment framework 2005-09. Funding has also been approved for the relocation and development of the symptomatic breast disease unit at University College Hospital, Galway. This unit will be developed in tandem with the BreastCheck development. The Health Service Executive, in conjunction with the Department, is examining the health capital investment framework with a view to initiating, as quickly as possible, new capital commitments for this and subsequent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_619">It is intended to progress the developments at Cork and Galway simultaneously and it is anticipated that the advertisement of the appointment of a design team will be placed in the <i>EU Journal </i>shortly. Given the scale of the investment involved, EU tendering procedures will apply. The design construction and commissioning of projects of this nature generally take approximately two and a half years.</p>
            <p eId="para_620">Since February 2000, cumulative revenue funding of approximately €60 million and €12 million capital funding has been allocated to support the programme. Additional revenue funding of €750,000 was provided by the Department in 2005 to further support the national roll-out to counties Wexford, Carlow and Kilkenny.</p>
            <p eId="para_621">BreastCheck requires highly skilled specialists working together to ensure best outcomes for patients. A key requirement and dependency for the national roll-out of BreastCheck is the recruitment of a wide range of specialist staff. The largest single requirement in terms of staff numbers is specially trained radiographers who will provide screening services both at the static centres and at mobile clinics.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">Until now specialist mammography training for both screening and symptomatic breast services has been undertaken overseas. The Department is supporting the development of a national training centre in mammography to be operated under the auspices of BreastCheck adjacent to its Eccles unit on the campus of the Mater Misericordiae Hospital in Dublin. This facility will greatly enhance our training capacity and enable Ireland's needs to be met here at home. The physical infrastructure for this centre requires an investment of more than €750,000 and BreastCheck is now seeking tenders for this work. The centre will be led by a specialist tutor and will provide training for BreastCheck and symptomatic services. The centre will open at the end of this year and will be in position to support the roll-out of BreastCheck.</p>
            <p eId="para_623">Interim proposals regarding a limited screening service through the deployment of some mobile units and the deployment of temporary facilities have been considered by BreastCheck, pending the roll-out of the national breast-screening programme. BreastCheck is primarily a radiological, as opposed to surgical programme, with fewer than eight women per 1,000 requiring surgical interventions. The competence of the radiologist is crucial in the detection of screened cancers.</p>
            <p eId="para_624">Radiological quality assurance for breast cancer screening dictates a minimum viable screening throughput of 22,500 mammograms per annum. Based on a 75% uptake this requires an eligible population of 30,000 per annum or 60,000 over two years. The 2002 census shows that the total eligible population in the western region is 57,288 and is 71,888 in the southern region. It would not be possible to quality assure a population-based screening programme for a smaller population than this within quality assurance parameters. BreastCheck has advised the Department that to ensure that a quality assured breast-screening programme is available to all women here, the optimum approach is to work towards the development of the two static clinical units referred to earlier.</p>
            <p eId="para_625">The current priority is to progress the roll-out of breast screening to women in the target age group throughout the rest of the country. When the national roll-out of the programme is sufficiently developed and it is assured that quality service is being delivered at national level, consideration will be given to including older women and continuing screening of women in the programme who have reached 65 years of age. More than 60% of women diagnosed with cancer here are under 65 years of age. However, we have no plans to target women below the age of 50 years. This position is consistent with the report, Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease, which states that clear proof of the value of population screening has up to now been confined to women over the age of 50 years. This is also consistent with the recent recommendations adopted by the European Union, advocating the introduction of cancer-screening programmes, which have demonstrated their efficacy having regard to professional expertise and priority setting for health care resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_626">The majority of women diagnosed with breast cancer will be diagnosed and treated outside of the BreastCheck programme. It is necessary therefore that we support both the symptomatic breast disease services and the screening services to ensure that comprehensive breast cancer services are available for all women. The report, Development of Services for Symptomatic Breast Disease, which was published in 2000, recommended the development of new organisational structures for the provision of symptomatic breast disease services to improve the quality of care. It made a number of recommendations based on the requirement of good care, which included the establishment of specialist breast units throughout the country. The report recommended that each unit should be based on a population of 250,000 to 300,000 from which it is expected to identify a minimum of 100 new primary breast cancers per annum. The report concluded that this level of workload is necessary to sustain the collective workload of the multi-disciplinary team involving surgeon, radiologist, pathologist, medical oncologist, radiation oncologist and clinical nurse.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">Breast cancer is the individual site-specific cancer which has received the most investment in recent years and more than €60 million has been made available for development of these services since 2000. The benefit of this investment is reflected in the significant increase in activity, which has occurred with inpatient breast cancer procedures increasing from 1,386 cases in 1997 to 1,812 in 2003, an increase of more than 30%.</p>
            <p eId="para_628">The Government is also committed to the national roll-out of a cervical screening programme in line with international best practice. International evidence demonstrates the proven efficacy of programmes that are effectively managed and meet quality assurance standards. Careful planning and consultation with relevant professional and advocacy stakeholders is required before definite policy decisions are made on a national roll-out. The pilot cervical screening programme commenced in October 2000 and is available to eligible women resident in counties Limerick, Clare and Tipperary North. Under the programme cervical screening is being offered, free of charge, to approximately 74,000 women in the age group 25 to 60, at five-year intervals. Almost 83,000 smears have been processed through the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_629">To December 2003 histology findings relating to pre-cancerous indicators were reported in 747 women screened. Carcinoma was diagnosed in a further five women. The national roll-out of the cervical screening programme is a major undertaking with significant logistical and resource implications. The former Health Board Executive commissioned an international expert in cervical screening to examine the feasibility and implications of a national roll-out of a cervical screening programme. The examination included an evaluation of the pilot programme, quality assurance, laboratory capacity and organisation and the establishment of national governance arrangements. The evaluation of the pilot programme is a key element in informing the development of a high quality cervical screening model for Ireland. The expert's report was published in December 2004. The report reviewed the operation of the pilot programme in the mid-western region and identified improvements that may be needed in the context of a national expansion.</p>
            <p eId="para_630">The Department is now consulting the Irish College of General Practitioners, An Bord Altranais, the Academy of Medical Laboratory Science, the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, the faculty of pathology of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland, the Women's Health Council and the Irish Cancer Society. Consultation with these key stakeholders is well advanced and will be completed in a matter of weeks. The Department has also met representatives of the Well Woman Centres. All the groups consulted so far are fully committed to a national cervical screening programme. Following completion of the consultation process the Department will examine options for the roll-out of a national cervical screening programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_631">A key concern for the pilot programme and any future national roll-out was the need to provide a quality service in line with best international standards. In this regard, a national expert advisory group on cervical screening was set up to oversee the implementation and operation of the pilot programme. This group produced quality assurance guidelines for the national cervical screening programme. These guidelines established standards and targets for the main stakeholders involved in the delivery of the screening programme, including GPs or smear-takers, laboratories, colposcopy service and the register office.</p>
            <p eId="para_632">Outside of the programme many women present for opportunistic smear tests, the number of which has increased substantially in recent years. Overall, more than 230,000 smear tests were carried out in laboratories throughout the country last year. To meet this increased demand additional cumulative funding of approximately €14.5 million has been provided by the Department since 2002 to enhance laboratory and colposcopy services. This funding has enabled the laboratories to employ additional personnel and purchase new equipment, thereby increasing the volume of activity. These initiatives have resulted in a reduction in waiting times for smear test results.</p>
            <p eId="para_633">The programme also supports opportunistic services, particularly in the area of quality assurance and new technology. Additional revenue funding of €1.1 million was allocated to the programme this year to support the introduction of liquid based technology in laboratories where it is not available and support the development of quality assurance and training programmes. The introduction of this technology will result in fewer unsatisfactory slides which require women to come back for repeat smears and will, therefore, substantially improve throughput in the laboratories. It will also enhance the capacity of the laboratories to deal with any expansion of the current cervical screening programme. The transition of the remaining laboratories to new, more effective testing methods are essential preparatory elements in a national roll-out.</p>
            <p eId="para_634">With regard to cancer services generally, there has been a cumulative investment of approximately €720 million in the development of appropriate treatment and care services for people with cancer since the implementation of the national cancer strategy commenced in 1997. The key goal of the national cancer strategy 1996 was to achieve a 15% decrease in mortality from cancer in the under 65 year age group in the ten year period from 1994. The Deloitte evaluation of the 1996 national cancer strategy demonstrated that this figure was achieved in 2001, three years ahead of target.</p>
            <p eId="para_635">This substantial investment has enabled the funding of 109 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology and haematology. An additional 245 clinical nurse specialists have also been appointed in the cancer services area. This investment includes the sum of €23.5 million, including €11.5 million for radiation oncology services, provided in 2005 to ensure we continue to address increasing demands in cancer services throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_636">The Government's policy on radiation oncology is based on the report, The Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland. Considerable investment will be provided for radiation oncology services in the coming years. The central aim is to ensure access by cancer patients throughout the country to high quality radiation oncology in line with best international standards. Significant progress is being made in implementing the report's recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_637">Immediate developments in Cork and Galway will result in a significant increase in the numbers of patients receiving radiation oncology in the short term. Two additional linear accelerators are being provided at the supra-regional centre at Cork University Hospital at a capital cost of more than €4 million. The first of these linear accelerators has been installed and the second is expected to be commissioned by the autumn. Last year, approval issued for the appointment of 29 staff for this unit and additional ongoing revenue funding of €3 million to cater for this expansion.</p>
            <p eId="para_638">Two additional consultant radiation oncologists will be appointed at Cork University Hospital with sessional commitments to the south-eastern and the mid-western health areas. Cork University Hospital is also in the process of recruiting to fill other key posts required for the commissioning of the new linear accelerators.</p>
            <p eId="para_639">The supra-regional centre at University College Hospital Galway commenced treatments for radiotherapy recently. Last year, approval issued for the appointment of 102 staff for this unit, together with ongoing revenue funding of €12 million to cater for this expansion. Approval issued for the appointment of an additional consultant medical oncologist and three consultant radiation oncologists, two of whom have significant sessional commitments to the north-western and mid-western areas. Key staffing is in place and the first two consultant radiation oncologists have taken up their posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_640">In addition to revenue funding, approximately €95 million in capital funding has been allocated specifically for the development of cancer related initiatives since 1997. This investment includes €60 million for radiation oncology and €11.9 million for the BreastCheck programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_641">Data from the National Cancer Registry show that the overall survival rate from cancer increased between 1995 and 1997 and between 1998 and 2000, with the five year survival rate from breast cancer increasing from 73% to 79% over the period. This reflects the level of investment made by the Government in cancer services. The developments I outlined in cancer services generally and in both screening programmes are a clear indication of the considerable progress made in addressing the burden of cancer in our community. I am glad of the opportunity to put on record the substantial developments which have taken place and to outline the extensive preparatory work necessary before a national screening programme can be implemented. The Government is fully committed to the extension of both programmes to all women throughout the country.</p>

          <speech by="#LizMcManus" eId="spk_297">
            <from>Ms McManus</from>
            <p eId="para_642">I wish to share time with Deputies Moynihan-Cronin, Lynch and O'Sullivan.</p>
            <p eId="para_643">I would also like to share my chance of life with them but cannot because I am the only female Labour Party Deputy present who can avail of free breast cancer screening. The reason is that I happen to live in Leinster while my colleagues live in Munster. BreastCheck has been available in County Wicklow where I live for a number of years. I and other women in the county have been called and screened twice under the programme, while the women of 13 counties are still waiting for their first visit.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">For reasons of geography the chance of early detection of breast cancer among women is diminished. Given that early detection means better outcomes, women in the 13 counties in question are being denied the best chance of surviving breast cancer. We have seen significant political and resource investment in cross-Border efforts between North and South arising from the Troubles. There is, however, an east-west divide which can literally be a divide between life and death. An invisible border extends down the middle of Ireland and a form of apartheid persists for those west and south of the line.</p>
            <p eId="para_645">Breast cancer screening is an essential and, at times, life-saving service, yet thousands of women are being denied it because they live at the wrong address. Why did this happen and why is it allowed to continue? The answers can be reduced to one simple problem, namely, a lack of willingness on the part of the Government to provide the resources needed to roll out a nationwide service.</p>
            <p eId="para_646">The national breast cancer screening programme was started in 2000. The Government, particularly the then Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, set deadlines which it promptly ignored. Initially, the Minister promised a national roll-out for 2002, after which he promised the programme would be extended in 2005, but we are still waiting. Shamefully, the new Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has set a new deadline of 2007, with no guarantee the programme will be rolled out by that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_647">It is important that the Minister for Health and Children understands that women refuse to wait any longer. The Labour Party has been running a campaign in Connacht and Munster to highlight the issue. The latest meeting in the campaign was headed by Deputy Moynihan-Cronin in Tralee and attracted hundreds of women as well as many men. At the recent annual Progressive Democrats Party conference in Cork, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children as well as the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley, were met by cancer survivors demanding screening services there.</p>
            <p eId="para_648">It is worth noting that a new cancer support group has been established this evening in County Donegal. Women in particular are desperately concerned about the breast cancer statistics whereby women who present late have less chance of surviving breast cancer and a greater chance of being obliged to have a mastectomy. There is also a campaign underway in the south-eastern part of the country regarding radiotherapy services. In various parts of the country, despite the Minister's statements about investment in cancer services, people are organising to ensure the chance of life for themselves and their loved ones is improved by better cancer services.</p>
            <p eId="para_649">To put it mildly, it is disturbing that a Government with unprecedented resources available to it seems to believe it is all right to keep women waiting which, as a result, puts their lives at risk. Somehow, this Government has not got around to giving this issue the priority it needs. We understand there are not always simple answers in the provision of cancer services and that choices must be made and standards of excellence must be balanced with accessibility. However, as far as breast cancer screening is concerned, there is no difficulty. Everyone understands the issue and wants to see a nationwide roll-out of the programme. However, time and again, the Government promises the implementation but does not deliver. The wonderful thing about BreastCheck is that it works and is a very fine service. The people working in BreastCheck can take pride in what they are doing. They deliver a high quality service and have been able to reach many of their targets. It is a part of our health system that works well. The problem and shame is that so many women are denied it.</p>
            <p eId="para_650">It is also important to observe that while many women might be fearful of coming forward for breast cancer screening, it is an experience that should not engender fear. It is a very professional and accessible service and no woman who qualifies should feel any worry or anxiety about coming forward for breast cancer screening. This is demonstrated by the high numbers of women who come forward where the service is available. There is a twin benefit in screening in that in areas where it takes place, a higher level of awareness and information about breast cancer, how it can be tackled and how women can assist in protecting their own health exists. However, where screening is not available,a lack of information and to a degree, a lack of knowledge persists.</p>
            <p eId="para_651">I will defer to my colleagues who are directly affected by the issue as they represent constituents who are denied the service. I represent a county that has the service. I want to support the people and women in particular who are denied access to a screening service to which they are entitled by right, that literally protects lives and would ensure a reduction in the death rate from breast cancer, as we have seen in Northern Ireland, Britain and other countries that have done what this Government should have done but has yet failed to do.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_298">
            <from>Ms O’Sullivan</from>
            <p eId="para_652">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this debate. I speak, as Deputy McManus noted, as a representative of a constituency where breast screening has not been rolled out. If it had been rolled out according to the original timetable which envisaged its introduction in 2005, I would be one of 12,976 women in County Limerick who would be screened this year, the constituency also represented by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Tim O'Malley. According to the statistics provided by BreastCheck, approximately 30 of that 12,976 women could expect to have early detection symptoms, had the implementation in County Limerick proceeded. However, the roll-out of the programme has not taken place and as it appears that we must wait until 2007, we will not be screened and will not know whether we have early symptoms of breast cancer which could be detected by BreastCheck. It is extraordinary that women in the west and south should be obliged to live with this. If the screening programme was in place, we would know if we were safe.</p>
            <p eId="para_653">Our lives are as important as the lives of women in other parts of the country and there is a deep anger in this region that the issue has not been given the priority it deserves. Many other issues have been prioritised by this Government in a time of wealth in our Celtic tiger economy. However, despite the fact that this programme was planned and announced many times by the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, it has not happened, as Deputy McManus noted. We are now expected to wait until 2007, which is not good enough. It is not good enough for someone like me, with no reason to believe that I might have breast cancer. However, it is particularly unacceptable for women coming from families with a high incidence of cancer, for women who have an internal fear that they might be one of the 30 women who could be detected this year in County Limerick. I speak for County Limerick, as my other colleagues will discuss the statistics in other areas, where if cancers were detected at an early stage, women would have a very good chance of complete recovery. This is how serious the issue is and why people are so angry that the programme has not been rolled out in accordance with the timetable.</p>
            <p eId="para_654">We listen to an advertisement on radio featuring Marian Finucane which tells women to be tested, that it is a positive thing with nothing to fear and that early detection is vital. However, at the end of the advertisement, she states that this only applies if one lives in the eastern or midland regions. Women in our region listen to this advertisement and come to us as public representatives to ask why they cannot be included in the screening programme. We listen to it on national radio and yet it is not available to us. On the other hand, people know the statistics from Northern Ireland for example, where breast cancer has been reduced by 20%. We are aware of the statistics and the value of the service but it is not available to us.</p>
            <p eId="para_655">The Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has been in office for nearly six months. However, she has not seen fit to further this programme to any great extent. As far as I understand, it is a question of resources. There is no reason why the headquarters buildings in Cork and Galway could not have proceeded at this stage, or could not have gone ahead during Deputy Martin's tenure as Minister. It was simply a lack of political will to deploy the resources to ensure that women in our regions are screened for breast cancer. This is what is most unacceptable. It is quite clear from reading the reports of BreastCheck that it was willing to proceed and had the internal resources and skills to do so, if given Government resources. Clearly, it was a matter of political decision-making and we will not accept any further delay. It is not sufficient to make announcements every six months or year that the programme will be implemented when it still has not been.</p>
            <p eId="para_656">Women in these regions will not be satisfied until we see the screening buildings and programmes up and running and we will no longer tolerate any delay. The campaign referred to by Deputy McManus in which the Labour Party is involved will continue to escalate until such time as we see real progress. Good government is about making decisions that matter to people's lives. Unfortunately, in this case, we do not see good government and we will not tolerate it. We will continue to campaign until such time as BreastCheck is rolled out throughout the country.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BreedaMoynihanCronin" eId="spk_299">
            <from>Ms B. Moynihan-Cronin</from>
            <p eId="para_657">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I am amazed at the amendment commending the Government. If anyone from the Government parties attended the public meeting referred to by Deputy McManus in Tralee two weeks ago, which I organised, they would have seen very little commendation for the Government. Hundreds of men and women attended the meeting. Some of them did not understand the issue prior to attending the meeting. However, when they learned about the apartheid-like practices in the area of women's health, they understood that people in the south west are again being treated differently from those on the east coast.</p>
            <p eId="para_658">At the meeting, people whose lives have been affected by cancer, particularly breast cancer, spoke publicly about their frustration and outrage at the failure of this Government to extend BreastCheck to Kerry, Cork and the Munster region. What really annoyed them was the fact that the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Micheál Martin, had promised that the BreastCheck programme would be extended to the entire country by 2002. We now hear the scheme will only be extended in 2007 or 2008. However, people in Kerry are not prepared to wait any longer for the roll-out of BreastCheck and will mobilise because they have accepted this system from this Government for too long.</p>
            <p eId="para_659">A woman who was born in Germany and who spoke at the meeting could not believe that she was denied access to a service simply because she chose to live in County Kerry. It is not only the people of Kerry, Cork and Limerick who are frustrated about the lack of action over BreastCheck. The PRO of BreastCheck is also exasperated with the Government's delay in sanctioning the roll-out of the programme to the rest of the country. He said recently:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_660">We are ready to go but we need approval from the Department of Health and we have not got the go-ahead. Each week that we have no decision from Mary Harney, the later this will happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_661">This statement puts the ball in the Government's court. I assure the Minister for State and all his Cabinet colleagues that we will pursue this matter until the extension of BreastCheck is delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_662">What is the Minister for Health and Children saying to the women of my county who rightly ask why they are being discriminated against because of where they live? What makes the lives of these women — and my life — less valuable than the lives of women on the east coast, including my colleague Deputy McManus? It would only cost €25 million to extend the scheme to the rest of the country, which is not a huge amount in the order of things. I ask the Government to take the opportunity tonight to announce the provision of the money to deliver the scheme to the rest of the country because the Minister will rue the day if it does not. Irish women now realise that a form of apartheid exists regarding access to health services and they will not tolerate it anymore.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#KathleenLynch" eId="spk_300">
            <from>Ms Lynch</from>
            <p eId="para_663">It is interesting to examine the issues this Government considers important —€18 million was allocated for stables for horses without the issue coming before the Cabinet and €56 million was allocated for electronic voting, disregarding the cost of storing the equipment. The overall cost must be approximately €70 million at this stage. Yet this same Government cannot spare €25 million to extend the BreastCheck programme to the entire country. If this had taken place approximately 15 years ago, the Government's reluctance to sanction the release of an amount like that would be understandable. However, it is not understandable given the country's current wealth. The Government is prepared to put the lives of women outside Leinster at risk for a paltry amount of money.</p>
            <p eId="para_664">It was not just in 2000 that promises that BreastCheck would be extended to the rest of the country were made. The former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, made the same promise in 1999 on a local basis. He again announced it in 2002 and 2004. Just before he left office, he again assured us that the programme would be extended in 2007. These dates are significant because they were election years. The former Minister played politics with BreastCheck. The willingness of people in the rest of the country to believe Deputy Martin because he was from Cork always worried me. He did as little in Cork as he did in the rest of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">Ministerial promises on the delivery of linear accelerators go back to 1998. A linear accelerator, which is now about to be installed in CUH, is at the end of the pipeline. We hope that there would be many women who would never need to be treated with a linear accelerator if BreastCheck was rolled out to the Munster area. We will all be using linear accelerators if we have to wait as long for the delivery of promises by the current Minister as we did for those of the previous Minister. I do not think that is a pleasant experience.</p>
            <p eId="para_666">Last weekend, the Progressive Democrats had their conference in Cork. The only thing I looked forward to was listening to Deputy Harney's speech, which had to be more entertaining than "Friends", for example. However, I received a telephone call on Wednesday from a woman called Noreen who had never attended the meetings and demonstrations about BreastCheck because she believed the Government's promises and who is now being treated for breast cancer. She told me that she had asked to meet the Minister for Health and Children when she arrived in Cork and planned to give her a letter. However, the Minister was refusing to meet her and she was at a loss as to what to do. She asked for my help and I provided her with assistance. If one looks at the demonstration outside Silver Springs Hotel, it was made up of women who are non-political but who had either been recently diagnosed with, were being treated for or had survived breast cancer. They are articulate women with no political bent who realised very early on that the political will to ensure the early detection of breast cancer in their cases was not present and who are now worried for their daughters. They are worried that their daughters will have to endure what they did. All the Minister has to do is sanction the release of the money to BreastCheck. The site survey has been done, the building is in place and everything needed to run the BreastCheck programme is present. BreastCheck is prepared to roll-out the programme in the morning. The only thing missing is the money.</p>
            <p eId="para_667">We received a visit from a Progressive Democrats politician who I will not name and who told us the decision was imminent. She would not specify which decision was imminent. Maybe she meant the decision to extend BreastCheck and that it would be announced tonight. We are all hoping that the decision regarding the money to extend BreastCheck is imminent for the sake of the women of the country.</p>

            <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
            <p eId="para_668">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise this important issue. I hope the Minister of State has some good news for us at the end of it.</p>
            <p eId="para_669">One must ask significant questions about the Government's commitment to the disabled. Why is there so much difficulty for the disabled drivers in getting tax concessions? The Taoiseach and many Ministers attended the launch of the Disability Bill 2004. The Taoiseach stated clearly that millions if not billions of euro were available to deal with the problems of the disabled, yet on the issue of tax concessions for disabled drivers we are given poor answers to our questions. The delivery of tax concessions is a matter for the Minister for Finance. If the rules are not correct, the Minister and this House have the right to change them.</p>
            <p eId="para_670">In case the Minister of State or others believe this is an isolated issue, I wish to bring to the attention of the House a number of different cases. One man living near the N2, which the Minister of State travels from time to time, made an application for a medical certificate, but was turned down. This man's right arm is completely useless. It hangs by his side and cannot be used. His wife was seriously ill at the time and I advised him to apply in her name. Thankfully, it worked. He has since lost his wife and made another application but was told that there was no point as he was previously turned down. We are appealing this case and hope that someone will have common sense on the issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_671">Another young man who is the carer of his invalid sister and aged mother applied but because they do not meet the so-called criteria of missing limbs or whatever, the authorities have seen fit to turn him down. For this young man, who lives on a carer's allowance and the benefits of the two social welfare payments for his mother and sister, there is not much spare cash and this certificate would be of much benefit to him.</p>
            <p eId="para_672">Another man from my county has been refused the certificate under the 1994 disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concession scheme. While he retains his right leg he experiences severe problems with it. That he cannot use it is unimportant as far as this scheme is concerned. Another man with a wife and young family suffered a severe stroke and has neither the use of his left leg nor arm. It is unlikely he will regain their use. He has been turned down because he does not meet the criteria. In an attempt to get an answer I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister for Finance on the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_673">In another case, a young man has very short legs and a full-grown body. However, anyone who sees him can tell there is no way he can drive a normal car. The car must be changed for him. He did not wish to write the word dwarfism on his initial application as he felt it was not right, but I encouraged him to do so.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. Gallagher)</from>
            <p eId="para_681">I apologise for the Minister for Finance who is unavoidably absent. I am pleased to take this opportunity to clarify matters concerning the disabled drivers and disabled passengers tax concession scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_682">Deputy Crawford has raised two issues that will be addressed, the eligibility criteria for the scheme and the operation of the board of appeals. The disabled drivers and disabled passengers scheme of 1994 provides for certain tax concessions for the purchase and running of a vehicle for persons who meet particular medical criteria relating to physical disability. The tax concessions include remission or replacement of VRT, repayment of VAT on the purchase of the vehicle to be used and a repayment of VAT on the cost of the vehicle's adaptation. Repayment of the excise duty on fuel used in the vehicle and exemption from annual road tax to local authorities are also allowed.</p>
            <p eId="para_683">The medical criteria set out in legislation are as follows. The applicant must be wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs, wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted in movement of the lower limbs, without both hands or without arms, without one or both legs, wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg, or has the medical condition of dwarfism and has serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>
            <p eId="para_684">It is a fundamental requirement for admission to the scheme that the applicant meets the specified medical criteria and is in possession of a primary medical certificate to that effect, issued by the appropriate senior area medical officer, an official of the local Health Service Executive. I repeat Deputy Crawford's comments that the Minister for Finance has no function in deciding whether individual certificates are issued. Where the issue of the required certificate is refused, this can be appealed to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent body whose decision is final.</p>

            <from>Mr. Crawford</from>

            <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
            <p eId="para_686">I will deal with that. I do not disagree. As the Deputy may be aware, an interdepartmental group reviewed this scheme. It examined all its aspects, including the qualifying medical criteria, the benefits and the appeal process. The report made a number of recommendations that were considered by the Government in June 2004. The report was published on the Department of Finance website in July 2004. The Government decided to implement the recommendations in respect of the board of appeal, which will be addressed separately. On the other recommendations, the Government decided that they would be considered by the Minister for Finance in the annual budgetary process having regard to the existing and prospective cost of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">The medical board of appeal is regulated by the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) (Amendment) Regulations 2004 and 2005. The 2004 regulations were signed by the Minister for Finance on 23 July 2004 and incorporated the following changes to the previous legislation: first, expansion of the panel of medical practitioners serving on the medical board of appeal from three to five and, second, amendment of the appeals process by introducing a six month waiting period between an appeal and a subsequent application and introducing the requirement for a second application to be certified by a registered medical practitioner to the effect that there has been material disimprovement in the medical condition since the previous application.</p>
            <p eId="para_688">These changes were introduced on foot of recommendations of the interdepartmental review group report. They were recommended to improve the operation of the appeals process and enable the backlog of appeals to be tackled. In addition, last week the Minister for Finance brought in further regulations that will allow him to appoint an additional five medical practitioners to the board of appeal, which will now allow for ten medical practitioners to be on the board compared with the situation prior to July of last year when there were only three doctors on the board of appeal.</p>
            <p eId="para_689">It is true that the appeals process has not operated effectively but this problem has been comprehensively addressed and the solution is being implemented. The Departments of Finance and Health and Children have been engaged in the process of reconstituting the board following a number of staff changes late last year and a number of administrative issues. Significant progress has been made and it is expected the board will resume its meetings in the National Rehabilitation Hospital shortly. On 14 March, the Minister appointed a new chairperson — senior level doctor — to the board. It is understood a new secretary is being recruited and will be in place shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">As a public representative, I appreciate there have been long and inordinate delays. We have all experienced this and it is not acceptable. The Minister has now dealt with this and I hope with the new board, chairman and secretary, this can be expedited.</p>
            <p eId="para_691">In respect of the waiting list for an appeal, there are in excess of 600 appellants. The new chairperson of the board has been asked to address the backlog as a priority and the increase in the number of doctors who can participate in appeal hearings will allow for appeals to be heard much more frequently. The necessary new appointments to the board will be made over the coming weeks to facilitate the process of dealing with the waiting list.</p>
            <p eId="para_692">These new arrangements being put in place should lead to an improved and streamlined operation of the board of appeal in dealing with appeals for the scheme.</p>

          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_693">Yet again I raise the issue of school places at primary level in Dublin 15. It is hard to believe the Minister for Education and Science and this Government can act so callously as to deprive small children of a place in primary school. However, this is precisely what the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, and her junior Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, are doing in Littlepace, Castaheaney, Ongar, Diswellstown, Tyrellstown and in many other areas of Dublin 15. Parents are being left in limbo as to whether their child will get a place in primary school in September 2005. What is happening is not acceptable in any country least of all in a wealthy country such as Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">The Minister for Education and Science seems to have a callous disregard for the needs of the children of Dublin 15. For Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, the needs of millionaire property developers seem to come before those of school children and their parents. I have been inundated with complaints from very distressed parents who in good faith put their child's name down in the local school — in some cases, the month their child was born four and a half years ago — expecting to get a place but who have now been told that because of the huge number of children looking for places, their child cannot be accommodated even though they have visited the school every year for four years since the child was born. This is a crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">Mary Mother of Hope national school, Littlepace, Dublin 15, has only been able to accept 90 children, that is, three streams of junior infants, while more than 200 children applied for places. More than 100 children have been told to go away and that there is no place for them. St. Patrick's national school, Diswellstown, Castleknock, has only been able to accept 90 junior infants while at the moment, its applications are running between 140 and 160.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">The new Castaheaney Educate Together school is also facing an uncertain September. The number of places is oversubscribed. At present the school children are being bussed to Lucan. The Minister has said she will get a school site but as yet neither she nor her Department has moved to acquire a site. It is getting very late in the year even to put a prefab on a site and get it ready for September. Other primary schools throughout Dublin 15 are inundated with requests from parents for places next September.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">The Minister for Education and Science, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have allowed the situation with primary school places in Dublin 15 to slide into chaos once more with huge upset being caused to children and parents. Given what we were told the Government learned during the by-elections in Meath and North Kildare about the increased population and all the new building and housing, we thought that something would have been done. I call on the Minister for Education and Science to establish a task force as a matter of urgency to deal with the crisis in school places manifesting itself in the Dublin 15 area and which will be truly dreadful for parents and children come next September.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, has come to the House with good news rather than more hand-wringing and saying he is sorry but the Government did not know an extra 10,000 houses were being built over the past five years in this school catchment area.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_312">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_699">I apologise to the House and Deputy Burton for the Minister, Deputy Hanafin's, inability to attend. However, on her behalf, I thank the Deputy for raising this matter and for giving me the opportunity to outline the actions being taken by the Department of Education and Science to address the school accommodation needs of the Dublin 15 area in general.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">The Minister is fully conscious that the Dublin 15 area is one of the most rapidly developing areas in the country and, as a result, there has been a marked increase in the demand for school places, particularly at primary level. The Department is taking a number of immediate measures to increase the capacity of existing schools in the area concerned along with the development of new schools to meet this growing demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">A building project at Sacred Heart national school, Huntstown, will increase its capacity to 32 classrooms. This project is nearing completion. In addition, a building project to provide a new school building for Mary Mother of Hope national school is currently on site and should be ready for use this September. To further expand capacity at this school, the Department has approached the school's board of management to discuss the possibility of expanding the school to cater for a four stream intake at junior infant level for next September. This could be achieved by the school expanding to a 32 classroom school or reorganising to form a junior and senior school.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">The area in question is also served by Castaheaney Educate Together national school. The Department is currently pursuing the issue of site acquisition for this school and the provision of a permanent school building for it will be prioritised in the Department. It is envisaged that the demand for places will be such that this school may need to grow to a 24 classroom school which would facilitate an annual intake of three junior infant classes. In the interim, temporary accommodation will be provided to meet the school's immediate needs for next September.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">Recently the Department met the management authorities of St. Patrick's national school, Diswellstown, and St. Francis Xavier junior national school to discuss enrolments for September 2005. Following this meeting, the Department sanctioned provision of a fourth temporary classroom for St. Patrick's which will enable it to offer places to a further 30 children on its waiting list.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">The Department also sanctioned provision of two temporary classrooms for St. Patrick's junior national school, Corduff, to cater for the increased demand for junior infant places. An application to establish a new Educate Together primary school in Tyrellstown is under consideration with the new schools' advisory committee and a decision on this will be made in the near future. The Department is confident the implementation of the measures I have outlined will alleviate the demand for pupil places in this rapidly developing area.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">As to the political charge that the Minister is callous, any neutral observer will appreciate she is very caring and most anxious to facilitate the many children in this growing and developing area of Dublin 15. I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.</p>

          <speech by="#JerryCowleyIND" eId="spk_313">
            <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
            <p eId="para_706">I am grateful for the opportunity to raise this important matter on the Adjournment. Gaelscoil na Cruaiche has been in existence since 1 September 1995, having commenced with seven pupils. It obtained temporary recognition in 1996 with an enrolment of 30 pupils and the sanctioning of two permanent teaching posts. Since then the school has gone from strength to strength and has moved to three different premises. The date 15 May 2000 was a historic day for the school because it received permanent recognition from the Department of Education and Science. There are almost 200 pupils enrolled in the Gaelscoil and there are nine permanent teachers on the staff. The Gaelscoil has resource and remedial teachers. The board employs ten additional part-time teachers of French, German, music, accordion, flute, sports and dance.</p>
            <p eId="para_707">During the past nine years, the Gaelscoil enrolled 30 pupils each September which resulted in the sanctioning of a permanent teaching post in the school each year. If the performance is an indication of the future enrolment it will have a ten-teacher school with well in excess of 200 pupils in 2006. It has a learning atmosphere second to none in which teachers, parents and children co-operate in realising the potential of an all-Ireland national school in Westport.</p>
            <p eId="para_708">The problem is that the school is on a temporary site in five prefabricated classrooms and since the lease will soon expire it will have to prepare for another move. The position is desperate because almost 200 pupils and nine teachers could be out on the road. The school has been expanding and for the school year 2005-06 more than 12 children are booked.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">The school has received notice to quit by 2006 and the lease is non-renewable. That means that almost 200 pupils will be on the street in 13 months' time unless alternative accommodation is provided. The reply I received to a question I tabled on the matter in December 2004 was that the OPW was examining the site. The OPW was asked in 2001 to examine the site but it decided in 2004 that it was not successful in finding one. This is a major problem in an area which has an important job to do in the education of children through Gaeilge. This is a matter that requires urgent action.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">I am aware of a shocking report on conditions and the health and safety aspects of the school, which was commissioned by the board of management. It paints a terrible picture of dry and wet rot and so on. The five prefabricated buildings were bought second-hand six years ago and are falling apart. Taking into account eviction notices, dry and wet rot and so on, the position is critical. I raised the matter with the Minister for Education and Science in February and was informed that the property management section of the Office of Public Works was exploring the possibility of acquiring a site for the school referred to by me. The Minister was unable to give me more information because of commercial sensitivities. The position is desperate. It appears OPW has to appoint a site, which it has not done so far. I am hoping for some news on that issue.</p>
            <p eId="para_711">The OPW has done its final assessment and has told the school this would be ready soon. That was nine weeks ago but yet the school has heard nothing. Nothing has been done about the provision of a school site, the shape of the school to come or the financial allocation, and it has to open on 1 June 2006. The Department has said it cannot do anything until it receives the report from the Office of Public Works. So far there is no sign of the design or planning stages. Can we please have some news on the school as the parents and pupils are desperate? Will almost 200 pupils be out on the street in 13 months' time?</p>

            <p eId="para_712">I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline on behalf of the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, the Department's proposals in regard to the provision of a new facility for Gaelscoil na Cruaiche in Westport, County Mayo.</p>
            <p eId="para_713">Since the beginning of the year the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, has made a number of announcements relating to the schools building and modernisation programme. This year alone, €270 million will be allocated to primary schools and €223 million to post-primary schools for building works. This represents an increase of 14% on the 2004 allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_714">The programmes supported will include 141 major building projects already on site and more due to go on site in the near future; 122 major school building projects countrywide which will go to tender and construction during 2005 or early 2006; 192 primary schools which have been invited to take part in the small and rural schools initiative and the devolved scheme for providing additional accommodation; approximately 120 schools which have been given approval to rent temporary premises pending delivery of a permanent solution to their long-term accommodation needs; 43 schools which have been authorised to start architectural planning of their major projects; and 590 schools which were recently given approval to complete essential small scale projects under the summer works scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_715">The new Schools Building and Modernisation Programme 2005-2009 will be underpinned not just by a significant increase in overall funding but also by major improvements in the administration of the funding. Devolving more funding to local level through the summer works scheme and the small and rural schools initiative will allow schools to move ahead more quickly with smaller projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">Gaelscoil na Cruaiche opened in September 1996 with provisional recognition and was granted permanent recognition in 2000. The school is accommodated in prefabricated classrooms on a three-quarter acre site in the town. The cost of site and classroom rental is grant-aided by the Department of Education and Science at the rate of 95%.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">The property management section of the Office of Public Works, which purchases sites for new schools on behalf of the Department, is exploring the possibility of acquiring a site for the school in question. Following a recent advertisement placed by the Office of Public Works, seeking proposals of possible sites, a number of responses have been received. As Deputy Cowley has stated, these sites have been visited and a technical report is being prepared. I shall convey the Deputy's views to the Minister that he is anxious that this be provided as quickly as possible. Of course, when sites are being examined there are commercial sensitivities and the Department is unable to comment further on specific site acquisitions.</p>
            <p eId="para_718">I assure the Deputy that the permanent accommodation needs of the school are being addressed as expeditiously as possible but, perhaps, not as quickly as the Deputy, teachers, parents and children would wish. The provision of a permanent building for the school will be progressed in the context of the school buildings and modernisation programme when a site has been acquired.</p>
            <p eId="para_719">The Department will continue to grant-aid the use of temporary accommodation at the rate of 95% of the cost pending the delivery of permanent accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_720">I thank Deputy Cowley for raising the matter. I shall bring his views to the attention of the Minister and the Department at the earliest opportunity.</p>

            <from>Mr. Neville</from>
            <p eId="para_721">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to raise an important issue on the conditions for teachers and students at Kilfinane national school, County Limerick. I have been raising this issue for the past six years. There is an increased urgency for the construction of a new school at Kilfinane. I have seen at first hand the conditions pertaining there, which are continuing to deteriorate, as the school is very old. The promises made some three years ago that a school would be built immediately after the general election should now be honoured.</p>
            <p eId="para_722">The report to the INTO made it clear that the facilities at the school are unsatisfactory and have been so for several years. The school is the base for a remedial teacher who is shared among five schools. Her classroom is a cubicle partitioned off a room also used as a staff room, library and office. The resource teacher works in similar conditions. The disruption is continuous and not conducive to a learning experience. It renders the teacher's job particularly difficult and places the children who learn in that environment at a further disadvantage. There are no indoor PE facilities, no general purpose room and no place for children to leave their gear for outdoor games. The staff is enthusiastic in encouraging the use of computers but with so little space this is extremely difficult. Toilet facilities for staff are inadequate while the outdoor facilities for children are Dickensian. I doubt that the school building would pass examination by the Health and Safety Authority. The school was forced to close for two days recently because of concern for the safety of the children.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">It is more than eight years since representations were first made regarding the provision of this school. The feasibility study carried out clearly shows that a new building is the only viable option. A site was acquired for this purpose and the Department of Education and Science commissioned a feasibility study on the site and found it suitable. The staff wants what is best for the children of the parish. They also need practical working conditions to enable them to carry out their professional duties. They have found themselves frustrated over the years. The school has a shared remedial teacher, a full-time resource teacher and a part-time resource teacher. In January 1998 the board of management applied to the Department of Education and Science to carry out structural works on the old school. The Department and the board of management decided that a new school was required. Approval was granted in 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_724">The existing building dates back to 1909. The school is housed in a converted church. It consists of six small classrooms, three of which are only 25 square metres in area. There is a tiny ancillary room used as the library and a tiny office and cloakroom. There is also a small central hall that can be accessed from the classrooms. Part of this hall has had to be sacrificed to accommodate the secretary's office. There is no staff room and the toilets are situated outdoors. The outdoor playing space is very limited and teachers are concerned for the safety of the children. Three other classrooms measure seven by five metres in area and house classes of between 25 and 30 pupils. Partitions between classrooms are wafer-thin, consisting of narrow timber boards or glass and are not sound-proof which causes difficulties for teaching and learning. The timber floors have begun to sag in many areas due to the building design. Ceilings are very high and temperature extremes are common. The present school is situated on a steep slope, which creates safety problems. There are many unavoidable drops and steps within the site, which are dangerous and always a concern to teachers and parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_725">The delay in acquiring the site was claimed as a reason for not providing the school. In November 2002 the site was acquired. The Department knew of the school's problems and the need for a new school back in 1998. There is evidence of dry rot and many of the windows cannot be opened, leading to a lack of ventilation. Sinks are provided in only three of the rooms. There is no staff room.</p>
            <p eId="para_726">Kilfinane is a developing community. In the past three years there have been 220 planning permissions for dwelling houses within a radius of three miles. The projected estimate is for 250 dwellings within the next three years. It is an expanding community in need of a new school, not alone for the present pupils and teachers but for future pupils and teachers.</p>

            <p eId="para_727">I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the House the strategy of the Department of Education and Science for capital investment in education projects and to outline the position regarding the application received in the Department for improved accommodation at Kilfinane national school, Kilfinane, County Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_728">Since the beginning of the year the Minister for Education and Science has made several announcements relating to the schools building and modernisation programme. This year alone, €270 million will be allocated to primary schools and €223 million to post-primary schools for building works. This represents an increase of 14% on the 2004 allocation.</p>
            <p eId="para_729">The programmes supported will include 141 major building projects already on site and a further 28 due to commence in the coming weeks; 122 major school building projects country wide which will prepare tenders and move to construction during 2005; 192 primary schools which have been invited to take part in the small and rural schools initiative and the devolved scheme for providing additional accommodation. This scheme is in its infancy but already it is deemed to be very successful. Approximately 120 schools have been given approval to rent temporary premises pending delivery of a permanent solution to their long-term accommodation needs. Forty-three schools have been authorised to start architectural planning of their major projects and 590 schools were recently given approval to complete essential small scale projects under the summer works scheme. I am pleased to confirm that Kilfinane national school was successful in securing funding under this scheme to carry out essential roof works to part of the school building, at a cost of around €12,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_730">Kilfinane national school is a co-educational primary school with a current enrolment of 130 pupils. Enrolments have decreased in recent years, from 162 pupils in the school year 1998-99 to 130 pupils in September 2004 and this downward trend has necessitated a further examination of proposed school size to ensure that any capital funding being provided is appropriate to meet the need. I take note of Deputy Neville's point that Kilfinane is a developing community with 220 planning permissions and increasing to 250 developments within a radius of the village. If this information is not already in the hands of the Department, I will bring it to the attention of the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_731">Arising from an application for an extension from the school authority in 1998 it has been established that the school, which was constructed in 1909 and is located on a restricted site, is subject to a preservation order. Following a feasibility study it was considered more appropriate to address the needs of the school by way of a new school. The OPW, which acts on behalf of the Department of Education and Science in respect of site acquisitions, was requested to address the issue of site purchase but the diocese decided to purchase the site for the school. I understand the site is now in the ownership of the diocese.</p>
            <p eId="para_732">The application for a new school at Kilfinane national school is being reassessed on the basis of the actual size of school to be provided. Once this has been completed the project will be banded in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria with a view to being considered for the appointment of a design team to commence architectural planning of the new school.</p>
            <p eId="para_733">The Deputy will be aware that the Department has made a series of announcements in respect of the 2005 school building programme and will make further announcements on projects to go to architectural planning in the course of the year. I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity to outline to the House the method used by the Department of Education and Science in determining in an open and transparent way the inclusion of projects in the school building programme and to assure the House that this school and all others will be treated in a fair and equitable manner.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_736">I propose to take Questions Nos. 70 and 91 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_737">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Priority Questions Nos. 62 and 63 of today's date.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">In brief, on 31 March last, I met with representatives of the main banks, An Post, the Central Bank and the major cash-in-transit service providers. I convened this meeting in the immediate aftermath of the armed robbery of a security van at Artane early the previous day, with a getaway haul of approximately €1.9 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_739">I indicated to the companies involved that my preference would now be agreement on a voluntary code of conduct that would see the industry operating to the highest international standards. This would include using the latest technology available to ensure the safety of the cash, the security employees and the general public alike.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">I informed the industry representatives that they had 120 days to reach agreement and to implement a voluntary code. If such an agreement cannot be reached, I indicated that I will legislate to ensure that standards are raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">It is also important to point out that the newly established Private Security Authority has a statutory responsibility to licence companies operating in the cash-in-transit sector of the security industry. The authority has decided to commence work on the development of a national standard in parallel with the voluntary programme being carried out by the main banks and service providers. This national standard will form the basis of statutory licensing of cash-in-transit companies. As I have already said, the authority is independent and it is not for me to prejudge its deliberations on this matter. However, I would hope that if the voluntary code of practice is of a sufficiently high standard and concluded within the time frame of the authority's work, it could form the basis of the national standard that would be required for the issuance of a licence.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">In relation to the recoupment of costs associated with the provision of armed escorts by the Garda Síochána, following consultations, my Department secured the agreement of the banks to increase their contribution to these costs to €3 million per annum, up from a mere €952,000 in previous years. This €3 million per annum contribution meets, on average, approximately 85% of the costs incurred by the Garda Síochána in providing armed escorts. Further negotiations are being conducted by my Department with the banks with a view to increasing this proportion still further in future years.</p>
            <p eId="para_743">With regard to costs incurred by the Defence Forces, although this is a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Defence, I understand that his Department is also in negotiations with the banks to secure a proper recoupment of costs.</p>

            <p eId="para_745">I assume that the Deputy's question refers to work which in itself is lawful — in other words, work which an Irish citizen, a citizen of an EEA country or a citizen of Switzerland is entitled generally, as of right, to undertake in this jurisdiction.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">There were approximately 88,000 non-EEA or non-Swiss nationals registered with the Garda Síochána as authorised to engage in employment of one sort or another in the first two months of 2005. Consequently, the following analysis covers persons other than those referred to above. Illegal working and illegal immigration are two sides of the same coin and the issue raised by the Deputy covers a spectrum of practical possibilities. This is because persons engaged in illegal employment are either persons who never had permission to remain in the State; persons who had such permission but whose permission has expired; persons who have current permission but who are in breach of a condition of that permission which prohibits employment; persons who have current permission but who are in breach of a condition which only authorises employment of a particular type, for example, for a designated employer with an employment permit; or students who have current permission but who are in breach of a condition which only authorises part-time employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">All countries such as ours which have experienced significant economic growth have great difficulty in sizing both their illegal immigrant populations and the extent to which non-nationals engage in employment unlawfully. This is because such persons do not manifest their identities to the immigration authorities or, in the alternative, the entire circumstances of their presence in the State — for obvious reasons.</p>
            <p eId="para_748">As a result any attempt on my part to put a figure on the number of persons in question would be purely speculative. However, I intend to commission research on the complex topic of illegal migration in the near future.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_750">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength of the Garda Síochána as at 8 April 2005 was 12,209, all ranks.</p>
            <p eId="para_751">The House will be aware that in October 2004, the Government approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</p>
            <p eId="para_752">As a basis for implementing this commitment the Commissioner has drawn up a project plan which has three key elements: the recruitment of sufficient additional Garda trainees to achieve the target strength; relocating the in-service training facilities from the Garda College so that the college can concentrate on training recruits; and expanding the facilities at the Garda College.</p>
            <p eId="para_753">A new recruitment campaign for the Garda Síochána was launched in November 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_754">It is proposed to induct 1,100 Garda recruits to the Garda college in 2005, consisting of four intakes of 275 recruits. The first of these four intakes, 275, commenced training on the week commencing 7 February 2005. The remaining three intakes of 275 recruits are scheduled to commence training on 3 May 2005, 2 August 2005 and 7 November 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_755">It is estimated that 523 Garda trainees will become attested members of the force in 2005. Current projections indicated that the total strength of the Garda Síochána as at the 31 of December 2005 will be 12,299, all ranks. Taking into account the projected number of retirements, the new recruitment drive will lead to a combined organisational strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 as early as end 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_756">The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_758">I have been informed by the Garda authorities that the Garda mountain bike unit was introduced on a pilot basis, on 5 June 2001, in the Tallaght and Raheny Garda districts of the Dublin metropolitan region, DMR. In February 2002, a review conducted by the Garda authorities found that the deployment of Garda personnel on mountain bikes was proven to be successful in tackling and responding to certain types of crimes and offences. Their mobility and versatility is recognised as a method of high visibility crime prevention.</p>
            <p eId="para_759">Since that time the Garda mountain bike unit has been expanded both inside and outside the Dublin metropolitan region. The total number of mountain bikes available to the Garda Síochána is 85, of which 55 are allocated to districts within the DMR and 30 are allocated to districts outside the DMR.</p>
            <p eId="para_760">I am also informed that the Garda Commissioner has approved the further expansion of the Garda mountain bike unit to Letterkenny Garda station, which will take place later on this month. Further expansion of the mountain bike unit will also take place at other locations, nationally, throughout 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">Mountain bike units have been very successful in tackling anti-social disorderly behaviour in local parks and estates and work well in conjunction with other units. Overall, the units have proven to be very successful to date due to their commitment, ability to respond quickly and effectively and capacity to provide a high visibility presence.</p>
            <p eId="para_762">Mountain bike units have made a significant and positive contribution to a proactive approach in tackling crime. Garda management has received very positive feedback from the community in relation to the work of these units.</p>

            <p eId="para_764">As the Deputy is aware, there are currently 64 Garda youth diversion projects operating in both urban and rural areas. Approximately 3,150 participants are currently involved in the Garda youth diversion projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">The Garda youth diversion projects are a crime prevention measure which seek to divert young persons from becoming involved, or further involved, in anti-social and-or criminal behaviour by providing suitable activities to facilitate personal development, promote civic responsibility and improve long-term employability prospects of participants. The type of crime that the projects were set up to address has diminished significantly in their respective areas, as reflected in crime data relating to the areas where the projects are located. There is also evidence of a reduction in anti-social behaviour and an improved quality of life for people in the catchment areas of projects. While this reduction cannot be ascribed entirely to the work of the projects, they have contributed to it. The success of each project is achieved through a close match between local problems and tailored solutions. An evaluation of the projects by the Children's Research Centre TCD, published in 2000 as The Impact and Effectiveness of the Garda Special Projects, indicated a positive experience by the young people involved and concluded that the positive impact of the projects overall justifies their retention.</p>

        the basis upon which he has the power to delegate to his officials the power to adjudicate on an application for leave to remain which is made to him; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_323">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_772">There is a solid basis in legislation and case law for the delegation to officials of authority to adjudicate on applications for leave to remain. On the other hand, the power to make a deportation order is never in practice delegated to officials. In every case deportation orders are made by the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_773">Perhaps this distinction is best illustrated by the case of P.L and B <i>v.</i> the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform [2002] 1 ILRM 16, where the Supreme Court characterised the position of failed asylum seekers as persons who “lacked any entitlement to remain in the country save that deriving from the procedure they were operating i.e. a right to await a decision not to be deported”. In other words, while a person who does not have permission to remain in the State does not have a right to remain here, he or she may submit to those administrative procedures which are necessary before a deportation order can be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_774">In the case of Tang <i>v.</i> the Minister for Justice [1996] 2 ILRM 46, a question arose in relation to the propriety of decisions taken by civil servants in the name of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform under the provisions of immigration law. In that case the Supreme Court stated that the Aliens Act 1935 and orders made thereunder, conferred extensive powers on the Minister for Justice to make orders in relation to non-nationals. The court found, in line with the Carltona principle, that it could not be supposed that it was the intention of the legislature that the Minister should personally exercise these powers. The court upheld the decision of an assistant principal officer in the Department of Justice to refuse to extend permission to remain but impugned a purported decision by that same officer to order the applicant to leave the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">In the case of Kanaya <i>v.</i> the Minister for Justice [2000] 2 ILRM 503, the High Court held that the delegation of power to an immigration officer by the Minister to refuse leave to land was not <i>ultra vires</i> the power of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_776">In the year 2004 there were approximately 133,000 persons who had permission to remain in the State at any time during that year. The main body of such persons dealt with on a given day are persons seeking an extension in permission to remain. It is clear that I could not possibly personally intervene in all these cases. The statutory provision now governing such extensions — section 4(7) of the Immigration Act 2004 — specifically acknowledges that such decisions are made by immigration officers on behalf of the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_777">Section 17(6) of the Refugee Act 1996 empowers the Minister, at his discretion, to grant permission to remain to a failed asylum seeker. This provision came into force in November 2000. It has been the practice in the vast majority of cases that such decisions are made by officials of my Department acting on my behalf. In fact the legislative provision itself did no more than give specific statutory expression to the reality as enunciated in the aforementioned Tang case which was heard in 1994.</p>
            <p eId="para_778">A decision to refuse permission to remain or a decision not to extend permission to remain is not the same as a decision to make a deportation order. Every such order, as I have already pointed out, is signed by the Minister himself.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">It has always been the case that decisions to grant or refuse leave to remain are made by officials of my Department. This practice has been repeatedly upheld by the superior courts in accordance with the Carltona principle. However, in every case where the ultimate step, that of deportation, is undertaken this is only with the express authority of the Minister in the form of a signed deportation order.</p>

            <p eId="para_784">The Deputies will be aware that, commencing on 16 February last, a number of searches were conducted at various locations in furtherance of a criminal investigation into suspected PIRA-related money laundering activities. These searches led to the seizure of significant sums of money and the arrest of a number of persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_785">I am informed by the Garda authorities that this Garda investigation, which involves personnel from the southern Garda region, the Garda bureau of fraud investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau, remains ongoing and active. In due course, files seeking directions will be submitted to the Director of Public Prosecutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">I am further informed that all possible avenues of information that might assist in furthering the case are being explored, and a key focus is the links between the money seized and the robbery of the Northern Bank last December.</p>
            <p eId="para_787">Moreover, on 25 February last, officials of my Department met, on a confidential basis, a representative of the Bulgarian authorities to consider media reports allegedly linking the suspected money laundering operation to Bulgaria and Bulgarian nationals. The Bulgarian representative expressed concern at these reports and committed the full co-operation of the Bulgarian authorities to the Garda Síochána in the latter's ongoing investigations.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">As the Garda investigation remains ongoing, I do not consider that further, detailed comment on the matter would be appropriate.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_790">In March 2005 the Government approved the establishment on a non-statutory basis of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, as an executive office within the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It is intended to provide a one stop shop approach to services relating to the admission of migrants. This decision provides a platform for the establishment of the service. It is expected to take up to a year for the new arrangements and structures to be put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_791">The service will incorporate the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform's asylum, immigration and citizenship functions and structures. The visa section of the Department of Foreign Affairs will transfer to the service in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Responsibility for the provision of visa services at diplomatic and consular missions abroad will remain with the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">The service will aim to develop a cohesive system for the issuing of work permits and visas through a virtual link between the work permit system in the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and the INIS. The overall effectiveness of these arrangements will be reviewed within two years. The economic migration policy function will remain with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_793">The service will include a new immigrant integration unit to promote and co-ordinate social and organisational measures across the whole spectrum of Government, for the acceptance of lawful immigrants into Irish economic and cultural life.</p>
            <p eId="para_794">The proposed new structure will have significant benefits from the point of view of customer service and the strengthening of the effectiveness and integrity of the State's immigration system, specifically a single contact point or one stop shop for applications for entry to the State combining the current work permit and visa application processes; a clearer system involving more streamlined processes; improved sharing of information in linked systems to simplify decision making; improved service times as applications do not have to be submitted to a number of organisations; and improved control and enforcement mechanisms.</p>

        <b>Mr. Quinn</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform</b>
        if he has completed his consideration of the report of the Dublin Lord Mayor’s Commission on Policing and Crime; if he intends to act on the recommendations contained in the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
        [10781/05]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_326">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_796">I have now had an opportunity to consider the recommendations of the Lord Mayor's Commission on Crime and Policing. The Lord Mayor and the city council are to be complimented on a very useful report, which makes a wide range of recommendations, a number of which fall within the city council's area of responsibility. I have already made a comprehensive response to the Lord Mayor.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">The Garda Síochána Bill, which I have introduced and which is currently being considered by the Dáil, addresses many of the commission's recommendations on policing. The Bill proposes arrangements which will have general application in all local authority areas throughout the State but at the same time have the capacity to adapt to the particular needs and circumstances prevailing in the areas concerned. Furthermore, changes already made to the Bill in the other House go some considerable way towards meeting the commission's proposals. These include changes to how the joint policing committees will be structured, their membership and how they will be chaired, the application of qualified privilege, the attendance of bodies and persons before the committee and the circumstances in which meetings of the committee may be held other than in public. For the most part the committees will now comprise public representatives and senior members of the Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">These changes address the commission's desire to enhance the democratic mandate for policing by ensuring that policing matters are driven by elected representatives. The commission's proposals in relation to local policing structures are not significantly different from the provisions contained in the Bill and, in terms of the outputs to be achieved, I believe the provisions in the Bill will deliver on the commission's recommendations.</p>
            <p eId="para_799">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is accountable to Dáil Éireann and through it to the electorate and therefore would exercise democratically the powers which the Bill proposes be conferred on him or her. I am therefore not convinced that a national Garda board, which the commission proposes, would enhance democratic policing more than the arrangements proposed in the Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_800">The joint policing committees, their sub-committees and the local policing fora provided for will be involved in everything that the commission proposes for the community, safety and policing teams, the area committees and the community safety fora, although there are some differences between the Bill's provisions and the commission's proposals in so far as demarcation of responsibilities is concerned. Provision is made in the Bill for drawing up guidelines relating to the establishment of the joint policing committees and subcommittees. The commission's proposals are helpful and will be further considered in the context of the preparation of these regulations when the Bill is enacted.</p>
            <p eId="para_801">A number of issues which the commission raises, such as the lack of a policing presence, problems of police numbers, responsive policing, embedding policing within the community and supplementing the gardaí are the sort of issues which I would see the joint policing committees dealing with. Addressing these issues will require a partnership approach. I believe in maximising the input of local authorities in matters which impact on crime and anti-social behaviour, such as by-laws, design of housing, public spaces, public lighting, estate management and getting the balance right in mixing social and affordable housing and avoiding ghettoisation in communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_802">I am in favour of the commission's recommendation that in areas with distinctive policing needs, community safety fora are set up, with as wide a membership as necessary, to develop and implement local crime reduction strategies. I have provided in the Garda Síochána Bill for the establishment by a joint policing committee within specific neighbourhoods of local policing fora to discuss and make recommendations to the committee as they affect those neighbourhoods.</p>
            <p eId="para_803">Some of the commission's recommendations, such as the development of community policing fora, the extension of the pilot drug court and the integration of the Government's policy on drugs and alcohol, are being examined in the context of the mid-term review of the Government's national drugs strategy 2001-2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_804">With regard to the commission's recommendation that community safety personnel with powers appropriate for dealing with low-level disorder be established, provision is made in the Garda Bill for the recruitment of volunteer reserve Garda members who will have the same powers, immunities, privileges and duties as members of the rank of Garda. Furthermore, on foot of the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government to examine the potential of the community warden service to enforce new and existing functions so as to release gardaí to operational duties, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government established wardens in five pilot areas. The pilot will be in place until the beginning of next year, so as to allow for negotiations on how to integrate the service into the outdoor activities of local authorities and for best practice in the pilot areas to be shared among all local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_805">The issue of community policing is central to the development of co-operation between the Garda Síochána, local authorities and local communities. With regard to the commission's recommendations regarding community policing, the Deputy will be aware that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights recently invited written submissions on community policing from interested parties and held hearings, and I look forward to its report with interest.</p>
            <p eId="para_806">The commission recommends that a problem-solving court in the Dublin District Courts to deal with low-level crime be piloted. The concept of community courts, to which this recommendation is similar, is receiving ongoing consideration in my Department. Officials have met the director of the New York based Centre for Court Innovation, the body responsible for the development of the Midtown Community Court referred to in the report. As the report recognises, the concept has some similarities with the pilot drug court programme which was launched in the Dublin District Court in 2001. Dublin's north inner city was chosen as the location from which to operate the pilot drug court. The project has been evaluated by consultants, who recommended that the pilot project be extended and the catchment area be widened. I welcomed the recommendations of the consultancy report and support the extension of the drug court to the catchment area proposed. Further evaluation of the operation of the court in the extended area will be carried out by the Courts Service shortly, after which a decision can be taken in relation to its further expansion.</p>
            <p eId="para_807">The commission recommends the extension of the use of the temporary closure order against premises found guilty of offences under the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000. That Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 provide for a compulsory temporary closure order in the case of convictions for the supply of intoxicating liquor to under-age persons and for a range of behaviour, including permitting drunkenness and disorderly conduct. I am not at present convinced that an extension of these strong provisions is necessary to combat public disorder, but if it does become necessary I will do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_808">The commission makes a number of recommendations on the control of liquor licenses. Matters regarding the availability of liquor licences and procedures for obtaining them will be dealt with in the liquor licensing codification Bill which I will present later this year. The Bill will make a number of proposals as regards planning and consequently the role of the local authorities. I would urge local authorities to support and implement these proposals.</p>
            <p eId="para_809">As regards the current role of local authorities, I would point out that section 11 of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 already gives local authorities a new role in relation to the duration of special exemption orders. It allows them to adopt a resolution, following consultation with relevant interests, regarding the duration of such orders in their areas and the District Court is then required to have regard to any such resolution in relation to applications for special exemption orders in the area concerned. However, despite the frequently expressed concerns of local authorities regarding public disorder and other issues, it appears that no local authority has actually availed of this provision to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_810">The commission recommends a public information campaign directed against anti-social behaviour. I share the concern about incidences of anti-social behaviour in society. I therefore have in mind to provide for anti-social behaviour orders in the current Criminal Justice Bill. The gardaí could be able to apply to the courts by way of civil procedure for an anti-social behaviour order which would prohibit any person from the age of ten years upwards from behaving in the offending way. Such an order could last for up to two years, but it could be altered or discharged on application to the court. Although the order would be a civil order, breach of the order would be a criminal offence punishable by a fine or imprisonment or both. There would be provision for an appeal against the making of an order.</p>

            <p eId="para_813">I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 130 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_814">The position is that while I have general responsibility for the liquor licensing system in my capacity as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, several other Ministers, and their respective Departments, have responsibilities in relation to particular aspects. For example, the Minister for Health and Children has responsibility for public health policies, while road safety legislation comes within the ambit of the Minister for Transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_815">The intoxicating liquor legislation for which I have overall responsibility is essentially concerned with the number and nature of licensed outlets and the persons who may hold licences, as well as the times at which, and the persons to whom, intoxicating liquor may be supplied.</p>
            <p eId="para_816">As regards consultation and co-operation with other Ministers and their Departments, the position is that I and my Department have worked with the relevant Ministers and their Departments as part of the process of preparing proposals to amend and reform the licensing laws. Extensive consultations took place, for example, during the preparation and drafting of the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 which contains measures aimed at combating drunkenness and disorderly conduct and tackling the problem of under-age and binge drinking.</p>
            <p eId="para_817">The provisions in the 2003 Act, which gave effect to certain recommendations of the commission on liquor licensing and the strategic task force on alcohol, include a strengthening of the provisions prohibiting the sale or delivery of alcohol to persons under the age of 18; restrictions on the presence of persons under the age of 18 in bars of licensed premises, and a new requirement that persons aged 18 to 20 must carry an ‘age document' in order to be in the bar of licensed premises after 9 p.m. to 10 p.m. during the period from 1 May to 30 September.</p>
            <p eId="para_818">I should add that the Government legislation programme makes provision for the publication of an Intoxicating Liquor Bill later this year. It will repeal the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2004 as well as liquor licensing provisions in other statutes — about 100 statutes in total — and replace them with updated provisions geared to modern conditions. During the process of preparing this Bill, my Department has been consulting widely with other relevant Departments and statutory bodies. I have also consulted with the other Ministers who have responsibilities in this area. Subject to the approval of the Government for its drafting, I intend to publish shortly details of the proposals which will be included in the Bill.</p>
            <p eId="para_819">In relation to murder and manslaughter, I would inform the Deputy that there were 45 such incidents in 2004, the lowest recorded number in ten years. I would further inform the Deputy that Ireland has one of the lowest rates of murder in Europe.</p>
            <p eId="para_820">In relation to assault causing harm, I would advise the Deputy that there was a reduction of 21% in assault causing harm in 2003 compared to 2002 and a reduction of 1% in assault causing harm in 2004 compared with 2003. This trend has continued in 2005 with a 15% reduction in assaults causing harm in the first quarter compared to the same period last year.</p>

            <p eId="para_831">I can assure the Deputy that strong provisions have already been put in place to combat the causes of public disorder and anti-social behaviour countrywide. Reductions in violence and public order offences have followed the enactment, during 2003, of the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act and the Intoxicating Liquor Act, which give significant additional powers to the gardaí to deal with public order and street crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_832">One of the main strategic goals of the Garda Síochána is ensuring public safety by reducing the incidence of public disorder and anti-social behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_833">I am pleased to note a reduction of 21% in assault causing harm in 2003 compared to 2002 and a reduction of 1% in assault causing harm in 2004 compared with 2003. This trend has continued in 2005 with a 15% reduction in assaults causing harm in the first quarter compared to the same period last year. The reduction in the number of offences in this category reflects an improving public order situation and a curbing of some of the excesses in the abuse of alcohol. An improving public order situation is to be welcomed by all those concerned with the preservation and maintenance of law and order.</p>
            <p eId="para_834">However, I am taking a number of initiatives to strengthen the powers available to the Garda Síochána to combat anti-social behaviour. I have proposed a fixed charge procedure in relation to certain public order offences in the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 which is currently awaiting Second Stage in the Dáil. Section 29 of the Bill amends the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 to provide for a fixed penalty procedure in relation to certain public order offences under that Act. The procedure will apply to an offence under section 4 — intoxication in public place — and section 5 — disorderly conduct in a public place. It is intended that the fixed penalty procedure will be an alternative to criminal proceedings being taken in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">In general, section 29 provides that a member of the Garda Síochána who has reasonable grounds for believing that a person who is not less than 18 years old is committing, or has committed, an offence under section 4 or section 5 of the 1994 Act may serve on the person personally or by post a fixed charge notice. In default of payment the person will be prosecuted for the offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">I am concerned that people, particularly the elderly, feel threatened by forms of harassment which of themselves may not be criminal offences but which may cause distress. I intend to include in the Criminal Justice Bill a provision which will empower the gardaí to apply to the courts, by way of civil procedure, for an anti-social behaviour order which would expand the court to deal with the matter as it sees fit.</p>
            <p eId="para_837">Last September, I relaunched the Crimestoppers initiative which is an imaginative partnership between the gardaí, the business community and the community which has been in place for a number of years. It operates a confidential freephone Crimestoppers number which is available to the public to alert the gardaí about crime or suspicious activity and to offer information in relation to ongoing Garda investigations. The confidential number is staffed by specially trained gardaí who are able to assess the value of the information being offered in the battle against crime. Crimestoppers is providing funding for the CrimeCall RTE programme which is a proven effective method of identifying the perpetrators of crime based on the assistance of the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_838">Garda youth diversion projects are funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. They are a crime prevention initiative designed to engage with young people who have been identified as being at risk of involvement in criminal or anti-social behaviour. Each project is managed by a multi-agency and community based committee, which is responsible for the strategic direction of the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_839">As the Deputy will be aware, this year I succeeded in securing an all-time historic high level of funding for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and its associated agencies. The gardaí, the courts and the prisons, together with the Department itself, have never been better resourced or equipped. This funding will enable a number of key public policy initiatives to go ahead next year. Included in these are the recruitment of additional gardaí to increase the strength of the force by 2000 within two years bringing its total complement to 14,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic law enforcement duties. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties but will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">This Government is strongly committed to the reduction and prevention of crime through strong and effective crime prevention methods. However, I cannot stress enough that while legislative measures can help to curtail the problem of anti-social behaviour, they cannot be viewed as the only solution. In reality it falls on all those with an interest in this area to play their role in helping to address the problem of anti-social behaviour.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_852">I propose to take Questions Nos. 83, 101, 106, 109, 110 and 757 to 761, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">I would first like to state unequivocally my abhorrence at the murder of Mr. Eddie Fullerton, then Sinn Féin councillor on Donegal County Council, on the morning of 25 May 1991. The attack was callous and cold-blooded, and it also involved the taking hostage of another family in Buncrana. The so-called Ulster Freedom Fighters subsequently claimed responsibility for the murder. Unfortunately, to date, no person has been made amenable for this appalling crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">In June 2003, solicitors acting on behalf of the family of the late Mr. Fullerton submitted to me what was described as a ‘preliminary memorandum' setting out the concerns of the family in relation to the murder and the ensuing investigations and calling for an inquiry into the matter. These concerns had, to some extent, already been raised directly with the Garda Síochána in April 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">In any event, I referred the submitted memorandum to the Garda Commissioner. In response, the Commissioner directed the establishment of a review team led by a chief superintendent to conduct a thorough and concise investigation into all matters of concern raised, <i>inter alia</i>, either directly with the Garda authorities or as part of the memorandum submitted by the Fullerton family’s solicitors.</p>
            <p eId="para_856">The Garda review is drawing to a conclusion. Outstanding matters relate to the awaited results of a mutual assistance request to the British authorities and certain police-to-police inquiries with the Police Service of Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_857">I am recently in receipt of a report from the Garda authorities on the current, incomplete status of the review. However, no final conclusions can be drawn until such time as replies from the British and Northern Ireland authorities are received, evaluated and acted upon, as appropriate, by the Garda Síochána. Nevertheless, I can state that the Garda review itself was extensive, involving the taking of more than 150 statements and the interview of more than 120 people, including a person characterised by the Fullerton family's solicitors as being a new, key witness.</p>
            <p eId="para_858">I do not intend to publish the Garda report which I recently received. However, as soon as all outstanding matters are clarified by the Garda Síochána upon the receipt of responses from the British and Northern Ireland authorities, I have already undertaken to contact the Fullerton family's solicitors with a full response to their concerns, including any action that I deem appropriate or necessary by way of further investigation or inquiry.</p>
            <p eId="para_859">I should add that I have no reason to believe — nor have I received any indication — that either the British or Northern Ireland authorities have failed or will fail to co-operate with the requests made of them.</p>
            <p eId="para_860">It should be noted that the Garda chief superintendent in charge of the review met the Fullerton family and their solicitors last December to provide them with an up-to-date briefing on developments with the review.</p>

            <p eId="para_977">I reject the Deputy's assertion that there is a crisis in child care services. As the Deputy will be aware, there have been significant improvements in the provision of supports for the development of child care over the last number of years as the Government took steps to develop a child care infrastructure in Ireland by assisting the voluntary community sector and the private sector to develop capacity in the child care area. This Government has brought investment in child care in Ireland from a benchmark of approximately €1 million per annum to €499 million for a seven year strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">Child care was identified as an investment priority under the National Development Plan 2000-2006. This was in direct response to the recommendations of the expert working group on child care established under Partnership 2000 to develop a strategy for the development and delivery of child care to support parents in employment, education and training.</p>
            <p eId="para_979">My Department has been designated as the lead Department with respect to the development of child care to meet the needs of parents in employment, education and training. The programme for Government, and the progress of my Department's equal opportunities childcare programme, are confirmation of the Government's commitment to developing child care services and to remaining focused on child care issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">The current seven year equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP, has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and facilitates the further development and expansion of child care facilities to address the needs of parents, in reconciling their child care needs with their participation in employment, education and training. The EOCP 2000-2006 aims to increase the supply of centre based child care places by 55%, some 31,372 places, by programme end. It also aims to provide support and assistance to the many childminders who are providing a childcare service across the country. The programme also encompasses many quality issues which were identified in the childcare strategy, and aims to ensure that there is co-ordination in the delivery of child care services nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">Since its inception in 2000, the funding for the programme has increased from €318 million to €499.3 million or by 57%, the most recent increase being €50 million in budget 2005. The multi-annual capital envelopes announced on budget day include increases that will give an increase of €50 million in the availability of capital under the 2000-06 phase and also the injection of a further €40 million in additional capital funding into child care between 2006 and 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_982">Total funding committed under the EOCP in the period to the end of March 2005 amounts to €347.8 million, of which €292.2 million has been allocated to child care facilities and €54.7 million to quality improvement measures. It is projected that this will create some 36,000 new child care places, and will support over 30,200 existing places. By the end of 2004 over 24,600 of these new child care places were already in place. A significant part of the remaining funding will be required for continuing support to existing projects and for the provision of capital grant assistance for the development of child care facilities in areas where there are gaps in service provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">The above measures relate to the supply of quality child care, but I would also like to draw the Deputy's attention to Government policy in the area of child benefit which aims to provide assistance to parents in paying for child care in whatever care options their parents choose for them. In the 2005 budget, this benefit was increased by €10 to €141.60 per month, per child, for the first two children and by €12 to €177.30 per month for the third and each subsequent child, from April 2005. Effectively since 1997, child benefit has almost quadrupled. This clearly indicates the Government's commitment to assisting all parents in relation to the care of their children irrespective of income and employment status.</p>

            <p eId="para_987">In January of this year the Spanish Government announced a regularisation programme for illegal migrants living in Spain. The programme which began on 7 February 2005 will run for three months to 7 May. While it is expected that there will be significant numbers involved it is not possible to obtain final numbers as the programme is still ongoing.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">The Irish Government was not consulted prior to the announcement of this decision and I am not aware of any prior consultation with other EU members.</p>
            <p eId="para_989">In recent times there have been discussions at EU level concerning the setting up of a system of mutual information and early warning on important decisions to be taken in member states between those responsible for migration and asylum policies. It is expected that the Justice and Home Affairs Council will shortly adopt conclusions on such a system for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_990">My views on whether there is a need for a unified EU approach to immigration policy is that we should be wary of harmonisation for its own sake. Member states are at different stages of migration development and the economic situations are diverse. For example, the unemployment rates vary widely between member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_991">While Article III — 267 of the draft constitutional treaty states that "the Union shall develop a common immigration policy aimed at ensuring, at all stages, the efficient management of migration flows and fair treatment of third country nationals residing legally in Member States", it also adds that this "shall not affect the right of member states to determine volumes of admission of third-country nationals coming from third countries to their territory in order to seek work, whether employed or self employed".</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_993">As the Deputy may be aware, the NESF itself has, in November 2004, presented a report to the Taoiseach entitled Fourth Periodic Report on the Work of the NESF, which the forum had prepared for the purpose of reviewing implementation and follow-through, mainly by Government Departments and State agencies, on several particular reports it had undertaken and submitted over the period 2001-03 and including its January 2002 Forum Report on the Re-integration of Prisoners. In compiling this periodic report the NESF had available to it a detailed and comprehensive update on progress in implementing the various recommendations in the 2002 report, as advanced by my Department, the Irish Prison Service, the probation and welfare service, and other agencies in the criminal justice sphere.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">In setting its conclusions in its fourth periodic report, the NESF welcomed the progress made in implementing the main thrust of its 2002 report. The NESF had, in particular, noted a number of encouraging steps including the establishment of the Irish Prison Service's regimes directorate with a dedicated director of regimes as an important first step in rebalancing the custodial and care-rehabilitations functions of the service and the establishment in prisons, in partnership with the probation and welfare service, of initiatives in outreach and inreach services to improve prisoner reintegration. These initiatives have included in-reach initiatives providing advice, referral and support to prisoners on housing, including local authority, private rented and transitional, training and employment, income maintenance, and general social welfare. In the particular context of social welfare, the probation and welfare service has contributed to the information booklet ‘What Now?' published by the Department of Social and Community Affairs, and is continuing to develop information and resources to assist prisoners on release from custody through its network of 74 funded community and voluntary projects and initiatives throughout Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">The probation and welfare service has, in conjunction with local communities, funded and fostered the two significant restorative justice initiatives for offenders before courts: restorative justice services in Tallaght, County Dublin, and Nenagh Reparation Project in County Tipperary. Under the Children Act 2001 the probation and welfare service also convenes family conferences which are directed by the court where it considers that the preparation of an action plan would be desirable in an individual case.</p>
            <p eId="para_996">The NESF fourth periodic report also recognises the establishment of HOST, homeless offenders strategy team, as a notable contribution to the development of the necessary implementation and supportive structure. HOST is a probation and welfare service led multi-agency unit established to address homelessness among offenders. A senior official from Dublin City Council is seconded to HOST, with the support of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. Since its establishment in 2002 on foot of the homeless preventative strategy, HOST works at a national level to prevent and minimise homelessness among offenders and to improve access to accommodation by offenders. The work of HOST is informed by Government strategy on adult and youth homelessness.</p>
            <p eId="para_997">Among other positive advances noted by the NESF were the inclusion of prisoner integration in future prison business plans and the inclusion of prisoners in social inclusion strategies, such as the national anti-poverty strategy, and developments in relation to meeting the accommodation needs of prisoners on release.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">The probation and welfare service has funded and commissioned major research on prisoner homelessness. This research, carried out by the Centre for Social and Educational Research at the Dublin Institute of Technology, tracked the progression of a sample of offenders in Dublin through the courts and prison, with particular reference to accommodation issues facing them. The research, which will be published shortly, will make a valuable contribution to the planning and provision of services in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">The Irish Prison Service have taken on board the suggestion made in the fourth periodic report that the option for a pilot positive sentence management project be explored and this approach is being actively reviewed at present in the Irish Prison Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">I welcome the NESF's broad conclusion that the essential foundation work is nearing completion,in consequence of which the pace of progress will increase and positive sentence management will become a reality. My Department will continue to advance the relevant recommendations of the NESF report No. 22 regarding the effective reintegration of prisoners, in partnership with the Irish Prison Service, the probation and welfare service and other services, agencies and community groups.</p>

            <p eId="para_1005">The signing of these protocols is clear evidence of the continued commitment of both Irish and British Governments to the successful implementation of the intergovernmental agreement on police co-operation and, in turn, to the implementation of the recommendations of the Patten commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_1006">Secondments will enable members of each police service to be seconded with full police powers to the other police service for periods not exceeding three years. Legislation is already in place in both jurisdictions to enable these secondments to now proceed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1007">Personnel exchanges will result in a programme of placements to enable the transfer of experience and expertise, particularly in the area of training.</p>
            <p eId="para_1008">The implementation of these protocols will take co-operation between the two police forces to a new level and will bring benefits to both jurisdictions in the form of improved effectiveness in crime prevention and detection. In addition, the implementation of these protocols will provide a two-way flow of experience and expertise which will enhance policing standards in both organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">The payment of allowances to members of the Garda Síochána who participate in personnel exchanges or secondments is the subject of ongoing discussions at the Garda Síochána Conciliation Council.

The question of disregarding such considerations, therefore, does not arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1012">I am also obliged to take into account a range of other factors, including the common good. As the Supreme Court has stated the common good may have a bearing on an individual case even though there is nothing known or relied on which reflects badly on the individual concerned. Specifically, the Minister is entitled to have regard to the State's general policy in relation to immigrants and asylum seekers; the jurisprudence on the same subject as it evolves; the volume of persons seeking asylum and the social and economic demands which this imposes; changing patterns in this volume; the matters he is required by statute to consider; the constitutional rights of all persons concerned; and the requirement of a coherent and efficient immigration and asylum system and to our international obligations.</p>

            <p eId="para_1015">The current seven year Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, EOCP, 2000-2006 has an equal opportunities and social inclusion perspective and facilitates the further development and expansion of child care facilities to address the needs of parents, in reconciling their child care needs with their participation in employment, education and training.</p>
            <p eId="para_1016">The EOCP aims to increase the supply of centre based child care places by 55%, some 31,372 places, by programme end. It also aims to provide support and assistance to the many childminders who are providing a child care service across the country. In addition, the programme encompasses many quality issues which were identified in the child care strategy, and aims to ensure that there is co-ordination in the delivery of child care services nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">Total funding committed under the EOCP in the period to the end of March 2005 amounts to €347.8 million, of which €292.2 million has been allocated to child care facilities and €54.7 million to quality improvement measures. It is projected that this will create some 36,000 new child care places, and will support over 30,200 existing places. By the end of 2004 over 24,600 of these new child care places were already in place. A significant part of the remaining funding will be required for continuing support to existing projects and for the provision of capital grant assistance for the development of child care facilities in areas where there are gaps in service provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">Staffing funding under the EOCP is only made available to help support the staffing costs of those community based-not for profit projects which can demonstrate that they are providing child care in areas of significant disadvantage and that they are supporting disadvantaged parents to access employment, education or training. It is not intended that EOCP funding will meet the full costs of running a service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1019">Over 800 community based not for profit groups receive ongoing staffing grant assistance, with over €30 million of EU and Exchequer funding going to this measure each year. It was originally envisaged that some groups would receive such funding for a period of three years, as they move towards sustainability which would normally be achievable when the service is operating at full capacity and with an appropriate fee structure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020">In a number of services, the levels of disadvantage among parents are such that the families would be unable to pay economic fees and therefore those services are likely to require ongoing State support towards their staffing costs. Supporting such services is particularly important in assisting families to break the cycle of disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_1021">The Deputy may be aware that I have approved the existing levels of staffing grant assistance until 31 August 2005, for all groups whose first three year funding had elapsed. These groups have been informed of my decision and that this funding is subject to maintaining their forecast levels of service and implementing any conditions associated with the development of the service in relation to previous grant approvals. The amounts awarded are deemed sufficient to enable the groups to maintain their approved level of service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">My Department is currently reviewing arrangements for the ongoing support of services in cases where they will have received staffing grant assistance for three or more years at any date prior to 31 August 2005. Included in the review will be an analysis of the number of services expected to require ongoing support; the number of projects which are delivering on their agreed targets; and the progress made by groups towards sustainability. When this review is completed, I expect to be in a position to take firm decisions regarding future funding arrangements. Information regarding the introduction of these new arrangements will be forwarded to the relevant groups as soon as it is available.</p>

            <p eId="para_1026">As I indicated in my reply to Parliamentary Questions Nos. 107 and 222 of 16 February 2005, the use of electronic tagging systems to monitor offenders in other jurisdictions is an issue which my Department has kept under review for some time. My Department has looked at the experience of a number of countries in the operation of these systems. These include the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Sweden and Australia. In addition, my Department is aware of the experience in Canada as outlined in the report referred to by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027">As I have explained in my previous replies to the House on this matter, difficulties have been encountered in other jurisdictions in developing fully effective electronic tagging systems, but recent developments in technology may provide solutions to these.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">These developments are now being considered by my Department, in consultation with the prison and probation and welfare services, with a view to drawing up an enabling legislative provision to allow me to introduce electronic tagging in appropriate cases when the technology has advanced sufficiently. It is my intention to bring forward this proposal by way of an amendment to the Criminal Justice Bill which is currently on Second Stage in the Dáil. Details of the proposal will be announced in the normal way.</p>

            <p eId="para_1032">A total of 11,270 deportation orders have been made under the Immigration Act 1999 since its commencement in November 1999. Of these, 2,268 deportation orders have been effected to date — 1,546 in the period 1 June 2002 to 31 March 2005 — and approximately 100 cases are with the Garda national immigration bureau for arrangements to be made for their removal from the State. The majority of these have been carried out using scheduled commercial flights on numerous dates throughout the period in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_1033">The balance of the orders have not been effected for various reasons. Approximately 6,000 persons are evading deportation. It is not known how many of these are still in the State but it is believed by the Garda national immigration bureau that a large number of these have already left of their own accord.</p>
            <p eId="para_1034">The remaining orders have not been effected because, variously: they have been revoked or have not been acted upon because of changed personal or legal circumstances, for example, the persons may have married an Irish national; they may have acquired residency rights by virtue of being a parent of an Irish born child; they may have been nationals of the ten states which joined the EU in May 2004; they may have initiated judicial review proceedings challenging the deportation orders; or the return of the persons concerned may have to be negotiated with their country of origin.</p>

            <p eId="para_1036">I have no plans to reduce opening hours or close any Garda station.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">The use of Garda stations was considered as part of the major review of the Garda organisation structures under the strategic management initiative programme of modernisation which looked in detail at a range of areas within the organisation. The Garda SMI implementation steering group's final report, which I have laid before the House and which is available on my Department's website and from the Government Publications Office, does not refer to the closure of any specific Garda station but rather makes recommendations to assist policy making in respect of the management and use of all available resources, including Garda stations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1038">It is also the case, however, that the position has changed significantly since the consideration of these issues under the strategic management initiative in that the Garda Síochána Bill 2004, which proposes the most fundamental modernisation of the Garda Síochána since the foundation of the State, provides that the Commissioner will have enhanced responsibilities in preparing proposals for organisational reform. It would be premature to anticipate at this stage what proposals, if any, might be developed by the Commissioner in this context.</p>

            <p eId="para_1040">The agreement between the Government of Ireland and the Government of the Federal Republic of Nigeria on immigration matters, which was signed at Abuja on 29 August 2001 provides, <i>inter alia</i>, for a mechanism for the repatriation of persons between the two states. Article 20 of the agreement provides that nationals of the contracting states shall not be subject to inhuman or degrading treatment in relation to repatriations carried out under the agreement. The agreement also provides guarantees in relation to access by embassy officials of the receiving state to the intended deportees in order, <i>inter alia</i>, to verify the identity of the persons concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041">While procedures to give effect to the agreement have been completed in Ireland the process of ratification is still ongoing on the Nigerian side. Nonetheless, the Nigerian authorities are operating the spirit of the agreement. I am satisfied that all deportation operations to Nigeria fully respect the human rights of the persons involved and that the agreement is being honoured in every way.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042">It should be further noted that the making of a deportation order is subject to section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, which absolutely forbids the sending of a person "in any manner whatsoever" to a place where the life or freedom of the person would be threatened on account of that person's race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. This overarching principle is the bedrock of Ireland's repatriation framework and exists independently of the provisions of any repatriation agreement to which the State becomes a party.</p>

            <p eId="para_1048">I should first point out that Garda Síochána is tasked with the execution of deportation orders. In enforcing these orders, it is a priority, as far as operationally possible, that family units which are the subject of such orders are not broken up in the process. All persons subject to such orders are required to present at Garda stations for the purpose of their removal from the State. It is only where there is a failure to comply with such orders that the Garda Síochána is obliged to take measures to enforce same. I am informed by the Garda Commissioner that, in the circumstances which gave rise to these questions, members were obliged to call to school properties to enforce deportation orders because of a failure by the parents concerned to comply with a lawful request to present the family unit to the Garda.</p>

            <p eId="para_1051">It is assumed that this question refers to unaccompanied minors who arrive in the State seeking asylum, whose claims for refugee status are refused following consideration of their cases by two independent bodies — the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal — and who subsequently reach the age of majority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1052">In such circumstances, the person is served with a notice of intent to deport under section 3(3)(<i>a</i>) of the Immigration Act 1999. A person served with such a notice of intent is afforded three options, namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of the deportation order, or to make representations in writing within 15 working days setting out reasons a deportation order should not be made and why temporary leave to remain in the State be granted instead.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053">Under section 3(6) of the Act, the Minister, in determining whether to make a deportation order, shall have regard to 11 specified considerations, one of which is the duration of residence in the State. Further, the Minister must have regard to section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 — prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>— which forbids the sending of a person in any manner whatsoever to a place where the life or freedom of the person would be threatened on account of that persons race, religion, nationality, membership of a social group or political opinion. This <i>refoulement</i> provision does not mean that persons may not be returned to countries which would have inferior welfare, educational and health services to ours. This is not in itself a basis for allowing them to remain here. It is not the case that there is a policy not to grant leave to remain to persons in the circumstances cited above. All applications are dealt with on a case by case basis, taking account of the Minister’s obligations under the law.</p>

            <p eId="para_1058">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that as of 8 April 2005 there were 86 juvenile liaison officer — JLO — gardaí and eight JLO sergeants working in the various divisions throughout the country. In addition to this, the national juvenile office has a staff of one superintendent, two inspectors and two sergeants.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059">The Children Act 2001 provides a statutory basis for the operation of the Garda juvenile diversion programme. Included in that Act is the introduction into the criminal justice system of the concept of restorative justice and family conferencing, which provisions are being put into effect by the Garda Síochána. The Garda authorities estimate that in the year 2004, the Garda juvenile office received between 17,000 and 20,000 referrals under the juvenile diversion programme. Early assessments indicated a very high level of satisfaction from those involved in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1060">Ongoing evaluation of restorative justice practice is being carried out by the Garda research unit. All Garda juvenile liaison officers have received training in restorative justice and over half have received training in mediation skills. It is expected that the ongoing development of restorative justice within the juvenile diversion programme will lead to a significant reduction in the incidence of recidivism.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061">The diversion programme already exists on a nationwide basis and is delivered throughout the country by specially trained gardaí. Details of the areas in which the programme is in existence is set out in the attached table. Resource implications are constantly under review and applications for additional resources are made on a case by case basis when and where necessary.</p>

This is a key commitment in the programme for Government and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</p>
            <p eId="para_1172">The Commissioner will be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources and, in this context, due consideration will, <i>inter alia</i>, be given to the resourcing of the juvenile liaison scheme. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</p>

Among these will be the devising of a code of ethics and the management of a process, to be set out in the Bill, for the investigation of complaints about judicial misbehaviour. An important feature of this disciplinary process will be provisions requiring lay participation, that is to say people who are not judges or lawyers, in the process. Other matters to be included in the council's functions will be responsibility for judicial education and training and the exchange of information among judges on such matters as sentencing. In these regards, the Bill will build on the report of the committee on judicial conduct and ethicschaired by the former Chief Justice, Ronan Keane.</p>
            <p eId="para_1176">It is my intention that when the scheme of the Bill has been approved by Government, I will make it available to the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. Any views that may emerge from the joint committee can be taken into account during the drafting of the Bill, which will be proceeding at the same time.</p>

            <p eId="para_1185">It is not clear if the Deputy is referring to a specific area of immigration law. There is a wide range of offences created within the overall legislative framework dealing with immigration and asylum. Data on the number of persons in detention for breaches of those laws are not maintained in a manner to enable me provide the information sought by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1186">I am aware that particular concerns have been expressed by the Irish Refugee Council and other organisations about the detention of persons under section 9(8) of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended. That Act sets out very specific safeguards in relation to the use of that provision. For example, detentions under section 9(8) are made by judicial authority and are subject to regular review for periods not exceeding 21 days and are made for specific reasons as set out in the said statute.</p>
            <p eId="para_1187">It should also be pointed out that persons in detention, for whatever reason, have remedies open to them to challenge their detention including, in particular, an application for an inquiry by the High Court in accordance with Article 40.4.2 of the Constitution.</p>
            <p eId="para_1188">This State, like every other sovereign state, has immigration laws to ensure that there is some degree of control over who enters our country and for what purposes. Our courts have reviewed various aspects of immigration laws over the years, including the power to detain persons for breaches of those laws, and it is beyond doubt that this State is entitled to and is obliged to take responsibility for the control of immigration. In certain circumstances that will involve detaining a person.</p>
            <p eId="para_1189">The European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 requires every organ of the State to perform its functions in a manner compatible with the State's obligations under the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. That convention protects the liberty of every person but acknowledges that there may be a lawful arrest and detention of a person in accordance with a procedure prescribed by law to prevent his effecting an unauthorised entry into the country or of a person against whom action is being taken with a view to deportation or extradition.</p>

            <p eId="para_1192">With regard to the issue of appeals, it is anticipated that some of those who may not be successful under this scheme will otherwise have a right to remain in the State, for example, they may be here on work permits or on study visas.

            <p eId="para_1197">I propose to take Questions Nos. 116, 776 and 777 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1198">While the number of cases of possession of firearms has decreased, it is a matter of concern to note a further increase in cases of discharge of firearms. I am conscious of the recent increase in violent crime involving firearms and the particular overriding necessity to ensure that public safety and security are given priority in any review of policy and legislation in respect of firearms. With this in mind, I have decided to bring forward at an early stage certain proposals for inclusion in the Criminal Justice Bill 2004. The Bill as published contains one of those proposals, namely, to provide for the secure custody of firearms. Other provisions will be brought forward in the form of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. The Bill is currently on Second Stage in the Dáil. These amendments will deal with better controls on the type of firearms which may be certified. They will further specify certain additional requirements which will have to be met by applicants for certificates and allow for the imposition of conditions on the granting of a certificate. They will include a provision allowing the deeming by order of firearms which may not be certified. I am considering increasing the sentences for the more serious range of such offences, including the possibility of mandatory minimum sentences in some cases, as well as new offences of illegally modifying a firearm, for example, sawing off a shotgun, and the imposition of severe penalties for this offence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1199">I am satisfied that the necessary resources are being directed towards the containment and detection of such serious criminal activity. Investigations are undertaken by divisional and district garda officers at local level. All the necessary national support services are available to supplement these investigations, such as the Garda national bureau of criminal investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1200">The following table gives figures for the number of headline offences recorded and detected. With regard to the weapons involved, 40% are recorded as shotguns and 37% as pistols.</p>

            <p eId="para_1236">I cannot agree to the suspension of our deportation process on the basis outlined by the Deputy. Deportations take place within the provisions of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and after each case has been fully considered by me with regard to the 11 considerations contained in section 3(6) of that Act and section 5 — prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>— of the Refugee Act 1996. I cannot accept the term “mass deportations” in this context, as each case is individually considered on the basis of its own facts and circumstances before a decision to deport is made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1237">A deportation process, after a person's case has been dealt with fairly, is central to the proper functioning of any immigration and asylum system. This fact is recognised universally by bodies such as the UNHCR. I am not aware of any country which does not have at its disposal the final sanction of deportation. Our asylum and repatriation system compares favourably with the best in the world in terms of fairness, decision-making and determination structures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1238">The deportation process is also subject to the scrutiny of the courts. It is open to a person to challenge a deportation order, by way of application for judicial review to the High Court, within 14 days of the notification of the making of the deportation order.</p>

            <p eId="para_1242">I presume the Deputy is referring to applications for leave to remain made pursuant to section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended.</p>
            <p eId="para_1243">Leave to remain in these circumstances arise where a non-national is served with a notice of intent to deport under section 3(3)(<i>a</i>) of the Immigration Act 1999. A person served with such a notice of intent is afforded three options, namely, to leave the State voluntarily, to consent to the making of the deportation order, or to make representations in writing within 15 working days setting out reasons a deportation order should not be made and why temporary leave to remain in the State be granted instead.</p>
            <p eId="para_1244">Under section 3(6) of the Act the Minister, in determining whether to make a deportation order, shall have regard to 11 specified considerations, one of which is any representation made by or on behalf of the person. The determination as to whether a deportation order is made or whether leave to remain is granted is not dependent on whether, in fact, the person has made representations for leave to remain. Thus, statistics are not maintained to distinguish between cases where representations have been made for leave to remain from those where no such representations were made.</p>

            <p eId="para_1260">I also published a strategic review of traffic policing on 23 November 1994, which is a blueprint for a transformation in the enforcement of road traffic law.

The position of assistant commissioner, traffic was filled on 22 February 2005. The Commissioner has tasked the assistant commissioner with implementing the recommendations contained in the strategic review in line with the implementation plan contained in the report.</p>

            <p eId="para_1262">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel that the personnel, strength of the Garda Síochána as of 7 April 2005 was 12,209 — all ranks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1263">It is anticipated that a total of 411 recruits will be attested to the Garda Síochána during the remainder of 2005. It is also planned that a total of 1,100 recruits will be inducted to the Garda college during 2005. The first intake of 275 recruits to the Garda college commenced training in the week beginning 7 February 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1264">It is projected that approximately 321 members — all ranks — of the Garda Síochána will leave the organisation between 7 April 2005 and 31 December 2005. This figure includes a total of 20 gardaí— all ranks — who are due to retire from the force on compulsory grounds between 7 April 2005 and 31 December 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1265">Current projections indicate that the total strength of the Garda Síochána as at 31 December 2005 will be 12,299 — all ranks. Taking into account the projected number of retirements, the new recruitment drive will lead to a combined organisational strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 as early as end 2006. I am further informed that local management is satisfied with current resource levels in the Border divisions, which are regularly reviewed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1266">As regards civilianisation, which is but one aspect of making more gardaí available on the streets, my Department is reviewing the position with the Department of Finance and Garda management as to how it will proceed further with the civilianisation programme in the context of the overall constraints of civil and public service numbers. The purpose of the review is to enable to the greatest extent possible the redeployment of desk-bound gardaí from administrative and technical functions to operational duties. This is in keeping with the general policy that civilianisation allows certain jobs to be done at a more economic cost and allows gardaí to focus on work more suited to their training and skills, thereby increasing overall operational capacity within the Garda Síochána.</p>

            <p eId="para_1277">The Inspector of Prisons and Places of Detention has made a considerable number of recommendations in his reports aimed at improving prison services and conditions. The position as of end-2003 in regard to implementation of the inspector's earlier recommendations is set out in detail in the Irish Prison Service Annual Report 2003, which was published last year. A copy of that report is in the Oireachtas Library. The status of implementation of the inspector's more recent recommendations will be similarly addressed in the service's 2004 annual report which will be published in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_1278">Overall, I am satisfied that the inspector's recommendations are being implemented on an ongoing basis as circumstances and resources allow. This is particularly the case in respect of the more straightforward recommendations such as appointment of additional psychologists, improvements to prison accommodation, provision of additional safety and other equipment, improvements in record-keeping and measures to frustrate the efforts of people who seek to make illicit drugs available to prisoners. Progress towards implementation of other more complex recommendations such as the replacement of Mountjoy and Portlaoise prisons and the provision of new library, medical and other facilities at Limerick Prison is ongoing. Construction of the new accommodation at Limerick Prison is under way and tenders are under consideration for provision of new prisoner accommodation at Portlaoise Prison as part of the next phase of redevelopment there. A contract was recently concluded for purchase of a site for a new prison complex to replace the existing prisons on the Mountjoy campus.</p>

            <p eId="para_1280">Mindful of the commitments in the programme for Government, a group comprising Irish Prison Service management, prison governors, health authority representatives and clinicians have been consulted in relation to a drugs policy for the Irish Prison Service. The intention is that the drugs policy will facilitate consistent regulatory and operational structures in pursuing both supply and demand reduction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">The policy will have regard to the commitment in the programme for Government to end all heroin use in Irish prisons and my commitment to achieving a drug-free prison system. Working to fulfil these commitments will involve implementation of stringent measures to prevent drugs from getting into prisons while, at the same time, continuing to invest in services within prisons to reduce the demand for illicit drugs in the prisoner population and meet prisoners' treatment needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">Central to supporting future supply and demand reduction will be the introduction of mandatory drug testing as envisaged in the programme for Government. Already, prisoners accommodated in the training unit, the open centres at Shelton Abbey and Loughan House and in the designated drug free areas of Wheatfield Prison and St. Patrick's Institution in the Mountjoy complex are required to undergo frequent drug tests to confirm their drug free status. Mandatory drug testing will, however, soon operate all across the prison system. It will enable identification and referral of drug abusers to treatment programmes, enable enhanced focusing of resources and act as a deterrent to drug misuse. The new prison rules, which are almost finalised in my Department, will include specific provision for mandatory drug testing and in this context it is intended that later in the year, the Irish Prison Service will commence implementation of a new strategy of mandatory drug-testing, addiction counselling and treatment, and increased measures to prevent drug usage to provide a more complete system of rehabilitation.</p>

            <p eId="para_1287">From January 2002 to date, 13 charter flights have been engaged for the purpose of deportation of persons illegally residing in the State. A total of 376 persons were deported in this way at a total cost of €1,628,201. Details of these charter flights, that is, dates, destinations, numbers deported — broken down into adults and minors, in so far as this information is available — and individual costs are as shown in the table supplied at the end of this answer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1288">The above costs include Garda expenses associated with these removal operations. I am advised by the Garda Commissioner that, given the wide range of immigration duties performed by the Garda Siochána and the Garda National Immigration Bureau in particular, it is not possible to identify the particular pay and overtime costs incurred by the Garda in relation to these charter flights. However, the Commissioner informs me that charter flights involve a lower ratio of Garda escorts to deportees than is the case using conventional schedule flights, resulting in savings to the Garda budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289">The number of escorting gardaí on each flight varies as it is dependent on a prior risk assessment of each removal operation carried out by the Garda National Immigration Bureau and on the policy of the particular airline. Given the large number of removal operations, it would involve a disproportionate use of Garda time and resources to provide details of the exact escort numbers used in each case. However, it is usual for two escorts to accompany a single deportee with a lower ratio used where more than one person is being removed to the same destination and on board charter flights.</p>
            <p eId="para_1290">There are two main categories of repatriation charter flights. Smaller charters that are organised to remove disruptive deportees that commercial airlines will not take on account of previous disruptive behaviour on board aircraft and bigger charters organised to return larger numbers of deportees in a more efficient way than using schedule flights. It should be stated that Ireland does not have direct flights to the destinations where these charters have taken place. The alternative to chartering is transiting through hub European airports involving longer transfer times, more inconvenience to deportees and the attendant risk of deportees absconding in transit.</p>
            <p eId="para_1291">The use of charter flights, including joint charters shared by two or more countries, are accepted and used widely across the European Union as an effective and efficient means of returning persons illegally present on the territories of member states following individual consideration of their cases. The European Council of Ministers adopted a decision in April 2004 facilitating the greater use of joint repatriation flights as a means of demonstrating solidarity among member states, increasing the rate of returns and making more effective use of resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">Ireland has carried out two such joint operations with the Netherlands on 28 November 2003 to Romania and Bulgaria and with the UK to Romania and Moldova on 18 November 2003 — details of which are provided in the table set out below.</p>
            <p eId="para_1293">It is well established that an effective deportation process is a necessary element of an immigration system. The lack of an effective means to deport persons not granted permission to remain in the State would call into question the integrity of the entire immigration and asylum laws. Failure to enforce deportation orders in the case of disruptive behaviour would produce two main outcomes. First, it would send a clear signal that deportation can be avoided by simply being disruptive. Second, disruptive behaviour by deportees on scheduled flights would become the norm leading to concerns for the safety of passengers and staff on aircraft and cause further difficulties for the gardaí in the already problematic task of enforcing deportation orders.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">Two companies were involved in the provision of suitable aircraft for the removal of deportees by charter flights prior to the appointment of Air Partner Plc as approved service providers in February 2005. These companies were Fly Ireland and Swiftair Aviation Limited. The companies were contracted individually for each charter flight.</p>

        the discussions he has had with the Garda authorities following the spate of well organised robberies in the past four months; if he has identified countermeasures to be taken; if he has intimated any such views to the Garda authorities or other security agents or agencies; if he has had discussions with any such bodies in the aftermath of the Brinks Allied heist; the reason this event was not anticipated and preventative measures put in place in view of the obvious growth of organised crime; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1388">I take it both questions relate to threats arising in relation to international terrorism rather than from indigenous terrorist groupings. Responsibility for internal national security is a matter for the Garda Síochána, with the support of the Defence Forces, as appropriate. The Garda authorities maintain an up-to-date assessment of the threat of attack from national and international terrorist groupings through analysis of intelligence gathered from domestic and international sources.</p>
            <p eId="para_1389">The Garda involvement for many years in fora within the European Union and further afield has ensured that excellent lines of communication and co-operation have been developed and fostered with police and security services worldwide. This facilitates the ongoing sharing of intelligence concerning terrorist groupings and enables a rapid operational response to be put in place where circumstances dictate.</p>
            <p eId="para_1390">Security threat assessments on the risk level to Ireland of terrorist attack are furnished by the Garda authorities at regular intervals to the Government and me. Although it is not the practice, and it would be contrary to the public interest to reveal the content of these threat assessments, the Deputy will appreciate that it is vital that the resources of the State are fully used to combat the real, ongoing threat posed by both national and international terrorism.</p>

            <p eId="para_1397">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, which are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that 1,421 recruits have graduated from the Garda College since 6 June 2002. The figure refers to those who have successfully completed the student-probationer education and training programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1398">I am further informed that a total of 1,235 members, all ranks, have resigned, retired or otherwise left the Garda Síochána since 6 June 2002. A total of 1,679 recruits have been attested to the Garda Síochána in the same period. The figure of 1,421 who have graduated from the Garda College are those members who have successfully completed the student-probationer education-training programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1399">Garda trainees are attested to the force on successful completion of phase three of their training. On attestation, Garda trainees become serving members of the force. Thus the serving strength of the force at any given time includes those who have been attested following completion of phase 3 of their training but have not yet formally graduated; formal graduation takes place following the completion of the fifth and final phase of training. The strength of the force has therefore increased by 444 members since June 2002.</p>

            <p eId="para_1404">The information requested by the Deputy in relation to court awards and out of court settlements in actions taken against members of the Garda Síochána in respect of assault, unlawful arrest or other breaches of citizens' rights is set out in the table below.</p>
            <p eId="para_1405">As of 31 December 2003, there were approximately 750 civil actions taken against members of the Garda Síochána in hand. A detailed breakdown of these actions in the form of the number of allegations of assault, unlawful arrest and other breaches of citizens' rights is not readily available. However, a database introduced in 2002 for the purposes of recording civil actions taken against members of the Garda Síochána indicates that in 2003, the first complete year for which a detailed breakdown is available, of the 142 actions initiated or received in that year by my Department there were 34 cases of alleged assault recorded and 38 cases of alleged unlawful arrest recorded. The remaining 70 cases recorded included allegations of defamation and harassment. In the year 2004, 127 actions were initiated-received. They included 40 cases of alleged assault and 26 cases of alleged unlawful arrest. In the year 2005 to date, 35 actions have been initiated-received. They include 12 cases of alleged assault and six cases of alleged unlawful arrest.</p>
            <p eId="para_1406">Civil actions may be taken by the general public against members of the Garda Síochána for compensation for alleged wrongs and personal injuries inflicted on them by Garda members in the performance of their duties. The highest percentage of these types of civil actions against the Garda Síochána is in relation to assault and unlawful arrest. The majority of these cases have been settled for less than €25,500. Settlement of cases takes place on the advice of the Chief State Solicitor, the Attorney General and State Counsel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1407">The Garda Commissioner has informed me that incidents which result in claims against the State in respect of the actions of gardaí are examined as appropriate with a view to identifying and implementing operational strategies to eliminate or reduce similar claims in the future. The Garda Commissioner has also informed me that the Garda Síochána (Discipline) Regulations 1989 are invoked in appropriate cases where the actions of individual Garda members come into question. One of the principal aims of the Garda Síochána Bill 2004 is the establishment of a new mechanism for dealing with complaints against members of the Garda Síochána which will secure public confidence and which will address the acknowledged shortcomings in the existing law and procedures on complaints.</p>

            <p eId="para_1501">I was pleased to note decreases in aggravated sexual assault, sexual assault, rape of a female and unlawful carnal knowledge in the provisional headline crime figures for the quarter ending 31 March 2005 which I have just released. I was concerned, however, to see a recorded increase in the number of cases of rape section 4.</p>
            <p eId="para_1502">With regard to the number of detections, I can assure the Deputy that any incident of rape or sexual assault reported to the Garda Síochána is fully investigated, as much evidence as possible is gathered and, subsequently, a file is forwarded to the Director of Public Prosecutions for a direction as to whether a prosecution should proceed or not.</p>
            <p eId="para_1503">The Garda Síochána actively encourages people who are the victims of any crime to report the offence to the gardaí. In addition, a number of established initiatives underpin this policy, such as the Garda confidential telephone number, Crimestoppers and Crimecall.</p>
            <p eId="para_1504">I have outlined to the House on a number of occasions that there is a high attrition rate in rape cases in Ireland, and a large number of cases reported to the gardaí do not reach prosecution stage for a variety of reasons. As the Deputy is aware, the Director of Public Prosecutions is statutorily independent in the performance of his function and it would, therefore, be inappropriate for me to comment on his decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1505">My Department has approved joint funding for comprehensive research into attrition rates in rape cases. The research, which is entitled The Understanding of Attrition, Early Withdrawal, the Trial Process and Identifying Possible Changes to Support Complainants in Rape Cases, is being carried out by the Department of Law at the National University of Ireland, Galway and the Rape Crisis Network Ireland. It is being conducted over three years and is expected to be completed in 2007-08.</p>
            <p eId="para_1506">This research should provide a greater understanding as to why some victims choose not to report cases to the gardaí, what can be done about under reporting and why, of the cases that are reported, only a relatively small percentage result in a court hearing. It is important to note that, with regard to conviction rates, the courts are independent in their function and it would therefore be inappropriate for me to comment on their decisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1507">Following completion of this research, action will be taken, as appropriate, to resolve any issue that may arise.</p>

            <p eId="para_1509">The number of miles recorded on the financial management systems in my Department for members of the prison visiting committees for the period January to December 2004 is 282,629 at a cost of €295,432.69. As I have previously explained, a visiting committee is appointed to each prison under the Prisons (Visiting Committees) Act, 1925 and Prisons (Visiting Committees) Order, 1925.</p>
            <p eId="para_1510">Vouched expenses for travel and subsistence are paid, on the authorisation of the prison governor, in line with Civil Service rates. The Deputy will be aware that it is my policy to appoint all new members of prison visiting committees to a prison in their home county or a neighbouring county. In past years, each visiting committee has undertaken an annual visit to another prison institution for instructional purposes in order to compare facilities and conditions in other institutions against their own prison. I have instructed that such visits should now only take place where the majority of the members of the visiting committee have been newly appointed, thereby reducing travel and subsistence expenses.</p>
            <p eId="para_1511">These new policies have resulted in significant savings for the Irish Prison Service. The total travel and subsistence expenses paid to members of the prison visiting committees in 2004 amounted to €338,540.58 as compared to €656,435.53 in 2002, which represents a drop of 48%.</p>

            <p eId="para_1675">In relation to all files submitted to me containing recommendations for deportation, it is plainly necessary for officials to collate and summarise all relevant information and present it in a coherent and consistent format for me to consider. Almost without exception, this involves, first, a summary of all available information on each of the 11 factors in section 3(6) of the 1999 Act and, second, a consideration of the <i>refoulement</i> issues under section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, and-or other significant issues relating to the case. A recommendation is then made to me by an officer at a grade not lower than assistant principal. The entire file is then submitted to me for a decision. I have before me both the summary submissions and all relevant supporting papers before deciding whether or not to sign the deportation order.</p>
            <p eId="para_1676">The procedures described above have been closely followed in each case where a deportation order has been made and the person deported. I cannot accept the inference in the Deputy's question that persons have been deported without full and proper scrutiny of their cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1677">It should also be remembered that where deportation orders are made in regard to asylum seekers, their applications have already been considered and rejected within the independent asylum determination process comprising, the Refugee Applications Commissioner, ORAC, and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, RAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_1678">The details of the Deputy's question refers to persons who have been involved in the Irish education system for some time. I ask the Deputy to consider what the consequences would be of a policy not to deport persons involved in the education process and, by implication, their families. I draw attention to the fact that in 2003, of the 7,900 asylum applicants almost 1,100 were accompanied minors between the ages of four and 18. Similarly, in 2004, of the 4,766 asylum applicants, over 700 were accompanied minors between the ages of four and 18.</p>
            <p eId="para_1679">By adopting a policy of non-deportation in such circumstances, Ireland would be sending out a message to the world that it is assuming an obligation to provide education for those who, having been found not to be in need of international protection, have otherwise no right to be in the State.</p>

            <p eId="para_1681">The Criminal Assets Bureau enforces the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 which provides statutory procedures of restraint. The effect of restraint orders made by the High Court is to freeze, for at least seven years, property deemed to be the proceeds of crime. After that period, a disposal order may be sought from the court to vest the property in the Minister for Finance. It is only where the court directs that such property be transferred that funds accrue to the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1682">While I have raised the matter with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, the proposal that assets, which are determined by law to be the proceeds of crime, be committed directly towards volunteer projects as a means of reinvesting in communities would involve a significant departure from Government accounting principles. These provide that it is a matter for the Government, with the approval of the Oireachtas, to determine the optimum allocation of Exchequer receipts in accordance with agreed priorities. The position of the Department of Finance is that any departure from such principles could set a precedent which would be difficult to resist in those circumstances and which, no doubt, would reactivate long-standing demands for "ringfencing" receipts in other sectoral areas.</p>

The Health (Nursing Homes) Act 1990 regulates the private nursing home sector. Under the nursing home subvention regulations the HSE makes a financial contribution to an individual towards the cost of his/her private nursing home care provided they qualify on means and dependency grounds.

Everyone over 70 years of age who is normally resident in Ireland, is entitled to a medical card regardless of means. A medical card granted to a person with full eligibility entitles them to free GP, family doctor, services; prescribed drugs and medicines, with some exceptions, under the GMS Scheme; inpatient public hospital services; outpatient services; dental, optical and aural services; medical appliances; maternity and infant care services; and a maternity cash grant. Where community-type services such as chiropody are concerned, there is no statutory obligation that automatically entitles a person to such services although some health boards do provide a level of these services. Under the Health Act 1970, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive, HSE, which devises guidelines from time to time for the administration of the medical card scheme.</p>

         asked the

        her views on whether migraine is a disabling illness.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children (Ms Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_1814">Migraine is a debilitating condition characterised by severe headache and a range of other physical symptoms. It is estimated that 10% of the UK population suffer from migraine, according to Bal and Hollingsworth in 2005. Migraine is three times more common in women than in men and is most commonly experienced between the ages of 15 to 55 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1815">There are two types of migraine: migraine without an aura, common migraine, and migraine with aura, classical migraine. Common migraine consists of a severe throbbing headache usually located on one side with abdominal symptoms, including loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, dislike of food, constipation or diarrhoea. This affects about 80% of sufferers. Sufferers may also experience sensitivity to smell, light and noise which leads them to rest in a quiet, darkened room.</p>
            <p eId="para_1816">In classical migraine, the headache is preceded by visual disturbances such as flashing lights, zigzag lines and blind spots or tingling limbs. The average length of a migraine attack is 22 hours and sufferers generally feel washed out for another one or two days afterwards. The average number of attacks suffered is 13 per year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1817">The exact reason migraine occurs is unknown. However, research suggests that attacks are linked to chemical changes in the body, serotonin release, and that blood vessels and certain nerve endings within the brain are involved. Many factors can trigger migraine attacks such as stress; physical fatigue or lack of sleep; too much sleep; certain foods such as cheese or alcohol; extreme emotions; missed meals and hormonal factors. Avoidance of identifiable trigger factors reduce the number of headaches a patient may experience. Healthy lifestyles including regular exercise and avoidance of nicotine may also enhance migraine management. Non-pharmacological type interventions for control of migraine are helpful to some patients. These include biofeedback and counselling. These, as with most elements of migraine, need to be individualised to the patient.</p>
            <p eId="para_1818">Pharmacological control of migraine includes the use of analgesics, anti-inflammatory agents, ergotamine preparations and 5HT drugs such as sumatriptan. Due to the severity of the headache, some patients may also require a narcotic analgesic but if the patient is experiencing frequent migraine attacks, habituating analgesics should be avoided. If patients have frequent migraine attacks and if the attacks do not respond consistently to migraine specific acute treatments, or if the migraine specific medications are ineffective or contraindicated because of other medical problems, then preventive medication should be given to reduce the migraine frequency and improve the response to the acute migraine medicines. In summary, migraine is a common condition which in most cases can effectively be treated by conventional medication. However, in a small percentage of patients, migraine is a debilitating condition whose symptoms are very difficult to control.</p>

            <p eId="para_1825">I am aware of the recommendations on breast screening contained in the documents referred to by the Deputy. The national breast screening programme currently covers the eastern, north eastern, midland and parts of the south eastern areas of the country. Screening is being offered, free of charge, to all women in those areas in the target age group of 50 to 64 years of age. More than 60% of women diagnosed with breast cancer in this country are under the age of 65.</p>
            <p eId="para_1826">The current priority of BreastCheck and my Department is to progress the roll-out of breast screening to women in the target age group in the rest of the country. Following the national roll-out and when the programme is sufficiently developed and quality assured, consideration will be given to extending the upper age limit. Any woman, irrespective of her age or residence, who has immediate concerns or symptoms should contact her GP who, where appropriate, will refer her to the symptomatic services in her area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1855">Under the 1970 Health Act, the Health Service Executive may arrange for the supply, without charge, of drugs, medicines and medical and surgical appliances to people with a specified condition, for the treatment of that condition through the long term illness scheme, LTI. The conditions are: mental handicap, mental illness for people under 16 only, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, haemophilia, cerebral palsy, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophies, parkinsonism, conditions arising from thalidomide and acute leukaemia. Parkinsonism, acute leukaemia, muscular dystrophies and multiple sclerosis were added to the scheme in 1975. The LTI does not cover GP fees or hospital co-payments. There are no plans to amend the list of eligible conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1856">Other schemes provide assistance towards the cost of approved drugs and medicines for people with significant ongoing medical expenses. People who cannot, without undue hardship, arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility for a medical card is solely a matter for the chief officer of the relevant Health Service Executive area. In determining eligibility, the chief officer has regard to the applicant's financial circumstances. Income guidelines are used to assist in determining eligibility. However, where a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may be awarded if the chief officer considers that the person's medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. Medical cards may also be issued to individual family members on this basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1857">Non-medical card holders, and people with conditions not covered under the LTI, can use the drugs payment scheme. Under this scheme, no individual or family unit pays more than €85 per calendar month towards the cost of approved prescribed medicines. My Department has established an editorial group to review, <i>inter alia</i>, the provision of health promotion information. I will ask the group to review the need for information referred to by the Deputy.

            <p eId="para_1859">The Cruelty to Animals Act 1876, as amended by the European Communities (Amendment of Cruelty to Animals Act 1876) Regulations 2002, provides the legislative framework for control of the use of live animals in scientific research and other experimental activity.

            <p eId="para_1860">The Act, as amended, provides that an experiment shall not be performed except for one of the following purposes: the development, manufacture, quality, effectiveness and safety testing of drugs, foodstuffs and other substances or products for the avoidance, prevention, diagnosis or treatment of disease, ill-health or other abnormality or their effects in human beings, animals or plants, or the assessment, detection, regulation, or modification of physiological conditions in human beings, animals or plants; the protection of the natural environment in the interests of the health or welfare of human beings or animals or the illustration of lectures in medical schools, hospitals, colleges or elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_1861">The Irish Medicines Board, IMB, has advised that botox is authorised as a prescription only medicine and is indicated for the management of a number of specified conditions. The IMB has also advised that the product information specifies "botox should only be given by physicians with appropriate qualifications, and documented expertise in the treatment and the use of the required equipment". The Deputy may wish to note that it is the practice in Ireland not to licence experiments for the testing of cosmetic products.</p>

The Health Service Executive has put in place the necessary administrative arrangements for this measure and has offered to meet with the Irish Medical Organisation on these arrangements on a number of occasions, and it remains available.</p>

            <p eId="para_1933">In response to the recommendations of the report of the national task force on suicide, which was published in 1998, the national suicide review group was established by the chief executive officers of the health boards. Membership of the group includes experts in the areas of mental health, public health and research. The main responsibilities of the group are to review ongoing trends in suicide and parasuicide, to co-ordinate research into suicide and to make appropriate recommendations to the Health Service Executive. The group also liaises with the suicide resource officers in each region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1934">The annual report of the national suicide review group meets the requirement of the Health (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2001 that the Minister for Health and Children will report annually on the measures taken by health boards to prevent suicides in the previous year. The report outlines the measures taken to help prevent suicide and reduce the impact of suicidal behaviour; facilitates the sharing of information regarding suicide prevention projects; and provides accurate and current information on the patterns of death by suicide in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1935">Additional revenue funding was provided by my Department to the national suicide review group since it was established as follows: 1999 —€63,000; 2000 —€127,000; 2002 —€63,000; and 2003 —€50,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_1936">Work is now under way on the preparation of a national strategy for action on suicide prevention, which will be published later this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_1993">The report of the task force on assaults on psychiatric nurses was completed in 2003. In addition to quantifying the level of assaults and making recommendations on prevention, the report contained proposals for a scheme of compensation for psychiatric nurses who have been seriously injured as a result of an assault by a patient in the workplace.</p>
            <p eId="para_1994">Government approval would be required for the introduction of any new State compensation scheme, which would be additional to the existing serious physical assaults scheme, last revised in 2001. This scheme provides enhanced sick pay arrangements for nurses assaulted at work. Medical expenses are also refunded. In circumstances where a nurse is certifed permanently unfit to resume duty he or she may be paid five sixths of full salary until retirement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1995">In 2003 a draft memorandum for Government was circulated and during the consultation process, complex legal and financial issues emerged regarding aspects of the scheme proposed by the task force and their implications for the health service and the wider public service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1996">In March 2004 the Psychiatric Nurses Association and SIPTU were advised that serious concerns that had been raised about the proposed scheme. Officials from my Department have been in ongoing consultation with the Department of Finance and the office of the Attorney General, with a view to addressing the issues raised. The issues involved are very complex and have far reaching implications for the health service. I am in the process of consulting with my colleagues in Government on this issue and I expect to be in a position to provide more definite information shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_2021">As the Deputy will be aware, responsibility for undergraduate training of dentists lies with my colleague the Minister for Education and Science. I have been informed that on access to dental education the Higher Education Authority has recommended that consideration be given to placing a range of health science courses on a graduate entry rather than undergraduate entry basis. This will potentially address the very high levels of competition among school leavers to access these courses and should provide more flexibility of access to non-traditional higher education students such as mature students and disadvantaged students. The Minister for Education and Science has asked the working group on undergraduate medical education to consider a graduate entry approach to medicine in the first instance. I understand that there are no plans at present to actively consider the extension of this approach to other courses.</p>
            <p eId="para_2022">Furthermore, I understand that the Competition Authority has announced its intention to consider issues of competition arising in a number of professions, including the dental profession. While a background paper has been published the Authority has not completed a formal study.</p>
            <p eId="para_2023">As the Deputy may be aware, in order to practise as a dentist it is necessary for an individual to register with the dental council, which was established under the Dentists Act 1985. I am informed by the dental council that under the terms of Directive 78/686/EEC and other relevant agreements that EEA nationals who hold a scheduled dental qualification are entitled to register and practise in Ireland. In 2004 the dental council registered 58 dentists from other member states of the EEA.</p>
            <p eId="para_2024">I have been informed that the dental council holds an annual examination in order to facilitate dentists from outside the EEA who wish to practise their profession in Ireland. Success in this examination confers entitlement to full registration in the register of dentists for Ireland. A total of 24 dentists from various countries such as the Philippines, India, Nigeria and Ukraine have been accepted for the 2005 examination which is being held this week.</p>

            <p eId="para_2103">The Commission on Nursing considered that registration as a midwife should no longer be a mandatory requirement for entry to the higher diploma in public health nursing or registration as a public health nurse, PHN, as follows:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2104">. . . in light of the range of services offered by public health nurses and the ongoing development of nursing and midwifery services in the community, registration as a midwife should no longer be a mandatory requirement for entry to the higher diploma in public health nursing or registration as a public health nurse. An alternative education programme relating more closely to the core generic maternal and child care service requirements of public health nursing should replace the mandatory midwifery requirement. The Commission recommends that the Board establish a working party composed of PHNs, health service providers and nurse educators to determine the content and duration of a course in maternal and child health, as an alternative to the mandatory midwifery qualification.</p>
            <p eId="para_2105">In direct response to this specific recommendation of the commission, An Bord Altranais established a working group to devise the content and duration of a course in maternal and child health. It was proposed, as set out by the commission, that this course should be offered as an alternative to the mandatory midwifery qualification for PHN students. Those with midwifery registration would not be required to undertake the course. This course addresses the professional and practice issues as they relate to maternal and child health in a primary health care setting as a dimension of the role of the PHN. The course includes both theoretical and clinical requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2106">In November 2004, the board approved a number of changes to the nurses rules, including the following amended rule in relation to admission requirements for nurses wishing to train in public health nursing.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2107">Before admission to the programme for education and training leading to registration in the Public Health Nurses Division of the Register, the name of the candidate for the registration must already be entered in the Register of Nurses and the candidate must have two years clinical experience in nursing. Unless the candidate's name is entered in the Midwives Division of the Register, the candidate must complete an An Bord Altranais approved module or unit of study on Maternal and Child Health as part of the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2108">My approval is required under section 26 of the Nurses Act 1985 and these rules were formally approved by me in December 2004 as soon as they were submitted by the board. Regulation of the nursing and midwifery professions, including the setting of requirements and standards in relation to the education programmes for registration in a division of the register of nurses maintained by An Bord Altranais, including the public health nurse division, is the statutory responsibility of the board itself. I understand that, at a recent meeting, the board decided to develop a consultation process on the implementation of the rule change.</p>

Where the issue of the required certificate is refused, this can be appealed to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal, an independent body, whose decision is final.</p>

These proposals are awaited and they will be assessed when available, not least from the need to ensure that the IMF has the resources necessary to carry out its critical functions in future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2157">The sale of part of IMF gold reserves to cover the costs of additional debt relief has been proposed, in addition to a number of other mechanisms, to fund the relief of the debts of poor countries. Agreement on any such mechanisms may be problematic given possible opposition by certain states to gold sales.</p>

        <b>Ms Burton</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Finance</b>
        the number of beneficiaries for each year from 1997 to date in respect of exemption in relation to income from artistic activity exempted from tax; the number of such beneficiaries with annual earning from exempted artistic activity below €50,000; the number of beneficiaries with annual incomes above €50,000 in bands of €10,000 and the estimated cost to the Exchequer of the tax forgone for each income band.

            <p eId="para_2159">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the relevant available information relates to the exemption of certain earnings of writers, composers and artists as included in income tax returns filed for the four income tax years 1998-99 to the short tax year 2001, the latest year for which information is available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2160">It should be noted that as PAYE taxpayers were charged to tax on their earnings in the period from 6 April to 31 December 2001 and self-employed taxpayers were assessed to tax for the short year on 74% of the profits earned in a 12-month accounting period, data provided for the short tax year 2001 may not be directly comparable with those of earlier years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2161">The information requested is set out in the following tables. However, because of the Revenue Commissioners' obligation to observe confidentiality in relation to the taxation affairs of individual taxpayers and small groups of taxpayers, the precise breakdown by income bands requested by the Deputy is not provided in relation to exempt incomes exceeding €150,000 due to the small numbers of income earners with incomes in excess of that level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2162">A married couple which has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.</p>

        if he will provide as previously requested by the Deputy, a children’s playground at the Dublin 15 end of the Phoenix Park, particularly in the vicinity of Farmleigh, in order to make provision for the tens of thousands of children now in the catchment area for such a playground for whom there are almost no public playground facilities; if his attention has been drawn to the fact that the playground at the Infirmary Road end of the park is not accessible by public transport from the Dublin 15 direction, except with great difficulty.

            <p eId="para_2516">The principle governing the management of the Phoenix Park is its conservation and presentation as a national historic park. Within these parameters, the Office of Public Works in managing the Phoenix Park maintains a careful balance between competing interests for the optimum benefits for all users. In this context, it is considered that the existing playground in the People's Gardens, which was recently comprehensively upgraded, is adequate. The provision of further public playgrounds in the vicinity of the Phoenix Park is more properly the responsibility of the relevant local authority.</p>

            <p eId="para_2518">Chesterfield Avenue was not originally constructed to deal with the current intense traffic volumes. As a result, it now needs both major repair works and the introduction of design features with a view to increasing safety and reducing the speed of traffic.</p>
            <p eId="para_2519">A fully integrated plan for the renovation of Chesterfield Avenue has accordingly been prepared by my office, and it is intended to submit the scheme for planning permission later this year. The safety of all park users has been paramount in the preparation of this plan, which has been developed in consultation with the Dublin Transportation Office, and will involve a variety of traffic calming measures, including pedestrian zones in the vicinity of the zoo, together with the construction of a roundabout at Mountjoy Cross. These features will be sensitive to the special ethos of this national historic park.

            <p eId="para_2521">Chesterfield Avenue was not originally constructed to deal with the current intense traffic volumes. As a result, it now needs both major repair works and the introduction of design features with a view to increasing safety and reducing the speed of traffic.</p>
            <p eId="para_2522">As part of the proposed fully integrated plan for the renovation of Chesterfield Avenue, which was developed in consultation with the Dublin Transportation Office, a number of traffic calming design features are envisaged with a view to reducing traffic speeds and enhancing the safety of all users of the Phoenix Park, including a roundabout at Mountjoy Cross and a pedestrian zone in the vicinity of the zoo. These features will be sensitive to the special ethos of this national historic park. It is proposed to implement the project on a phased basis in order to minimise disruption to park users and subject to the availability of funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_2523">A number of ramps were installed recently on the back road in the Phoenix Park, between the zoo and the Ashtown Gate, a stretch of road particularly badly affected by speeding traffic. The proposal to implement a one-way system at the Ashtown and Cabra Gates of the Phoenix Park has been deferred pending further research into its likely impact on traffic flows outside the park, particularly at rush hour, and to facilitate consultation with Fingal and Dublin City Councils. Apart from staff time spent on planning for the new system, no major significant costs are associated with the implementation of the one-way system.</p>

            <p eId="para_2525">The Finance Act 1999 made a number of changes to the structure of pension arrangements by introducing additional options for the holders of personal pensions and certain holders of occupational pension schemes. Traditionally the types of benefits available on retirement for such persons comprised a lump sum, a pension for life and an annuity for dependants. Under the new arrangements such a pensioner can on retirement, subject to conditions, use his or her accumulated pension fund to purchase an annuity, have it paid directly to him or herself or have it placed in an approved retirement fund, ARF, or, in certain circumstances, into an approved minimum retirement fund, AMRF.</p>
            <p eId="para_2526">Funds placed in an ARF, or AMRF, can only come from an individual's approved pension arrangement. Thus, it is not possible to pay funds directly into an ARF. Tax relief is available for contributions made to an approved pension arrangement prior to retirement. Funds placed in an ARF have, therefore, already been tax relieved at the time the contributions to those pension products were made. In the same manner as for pension funds generally, income and gains arising in an ARF are exempt from income tax and capital gains tax so long as they are held within the ARF. Any withdrawals from the ARF are subject to tax at the person's marginal rate of income tax. The same rules apply to AMRFs except that the capital, as distinct from the income, may not be withdrawn from an AMRF until the individual reaches the age of 75.</p>
            <p eId="para_2527">As there is no requirement in law for qualifying fund managers in relation to ARFs to provide the Revenue Commissioners with details of the amount of funds held in such investment vehicles or of the income and gains arising on such funds, information along the lines requested by the Deputy is not available to the Revenue Commissioners.</p>

            <p eId="para_2684">Tax relief for pension contributions by employees is normally given by way of a deduction from total income in arriving at income for tax purposes, that is, the income for tax purposes of employees is net of their pension contributions, the "net pay" arrangement. The employer's contributions are an allowable deduction from profits and are not specifically recorded in Revenue statistics. However, provisions were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality and transparency without overburdening taxpayers-employers. The Act includes provisions that require employers to provide data on superannuation contributions in the P35 form to be filed by employers in February 2006. The following table outlines the very tentative figures currently available to the Revenue Commissioners.</p>

            <p eId="para_2721">Special savings incentive accounts, SSIAs, will mature between May 2006 and April 2007 depending on when the account was originally opened. For an account to be matured, the account holder will be required to make a maturity declaration to his or her financial institution at any time within a period of three months ending on the maturity date. Accordingly, no action by account holders is necessary until next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2722">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that information regarding SSIA maturity is already published on the Revenue web site at <i>www.revenue.ie</i>. Furthermore, Revenue has arranged for the form on which the declaration is made to be issued to each SSIA holder by the relevant financial institution in advance of the maturity date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2723">The form will simply require the saver to confirm that the conditions of the scheme were met from the date on which the SSIA started until the date the declaration is made, that is, they will be asked to confirm that they — were the beneficial owner of the assets in the SSIA, had only one SSIA, were resident or ordinarily resident in the State, subscribed to the SSIA from funds available to them or their spouse without recourse to borrowings, or the deferral of repayment, whether of capital or interest, of sums borrowed when the SSIA started, and did not assign or otherwise pledge SSIA assets as security for a loan.</p>
            <p eId="para_2724">The Revenue Commissioners are in discussion with the financial institutions to ensure that the maturity arrangements will be implemented in an efficient and practical manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_2737">The SSIA scheme opened on 1 May 2001 and entry to it closed on 30 April 2002. The accounts are due to mature between May 2006 and April 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2738">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that all qualifying savings managers are furnishing their 2004 SSIA annual returns at present. The Revenue Commissioners are analysing these returns and it is expected that final details of this analysis will be available at the end of April 2005. However, all qualifying savings managers have, in advance of the annual return, provided a declaration indicating the number of active accounts held at 31 December 2004. Based on these 2004 declarations, I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the total number of active accounts at 31 December 2004 was 1,094,188 and the average monthly subscription was €175 at that date. Revisions may be necessary if amendments are received at a later date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2739">The minimum monthly contribution that could be made to an SSIA on commencement was €12.50. An individual paying this amount over five years would contribute €750 together with the Exchequer tax credit payout of €187.50, that is, 25%. Where an individual saved the maximum monthly amount of €254.00 from the outset the total contribution over five years would be €15,240 as well as the Exchequer tax credit payout of €3,810. Only the profit earned on this investment will be subject to a once-off tax of 23% on maturity provided the individual saver complies with certain conditions laid down in the legislation governing the scheme. Where an individual fails to comply with the conditions of the scheme, or exits the scheme prematurely, all the money in the account is taxed at 23%.</p>
            <p eId="para_2740">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the monthly tax credit pay-out, made in the month following the month of subscription, to investors in the special savings incentive accounts since the introduction of this savings scheme is as follows:</p>

The cost of the scheme to date is as outlined above. The estimated cost in 2005, based on the average tax credit payout in the first three months of 2005, is €572 million but this is not a conclusive figure, and the final figure may be different if account holders change their monthly contributions. The total gross cost over the period of the scheme will be reduced by the exit tax to be received at the end.</p>

            <p eId="para_2874">The SSIA scheme opened on 1 May 2001 and entry to it closed on 30 April 2002. The accounts are due to mature between May 2006 and April 2007. A total of 1.17 million accounts were opened during the period outlined.</p>
            <p eId="para_2875">The specific goal of the SSIA scheme was to encourage people to save over a period of at least five years. Its effect has been to stimulate such savings over varying income ranges which is evident in the extensive take-up by many low income earners. The scheme has been a success in those terms. The scheme has a specific duration. Any proposals for tax-based incentives for the reinvestment of SSIA savings or continuation of savings would be considered as part of the normal annual budgetary process taking account of public policy objectives and Exchequer cost implications. The use to which the moneys arising on maturity of the SSIAs are put is ultimately a matter for the individual account holder.</p>

            <p eId="para_2878">Adequate financing for debt relief is essential to help reduce poverty in many parts of the world. It is important to adequately finance the relief of debts owed to the International Monetary Fund so that the fund can continue to play a role in the poorest countries. The managing director has stated that he will, as requested, bring forward proposals at the spring meetings, covering the fund's gold and other resources. It will be for the board of the IMF and the IMFC initially to decide what action to take. These resources are part of the assets of the IMF. These proposals are awaited and they will be assessed when available, not least for the need to ensure that the IMF has the resources necessary to carry out its critical functions in future. The sale or revaluation of part of IMF gold reserves to cover the costs of additional debt relief has been proposed, in addition to a number of other mechanisms, to fund the relief of the debts of poor countries. Agreement on any such mechanisms may be problematic given possible opposition by certain states to gold sales.</p>

Following the granting of the credit for each of the tax years 1999-2000 to 2004 inclusive, overpayments of tax have arisen for each of those years.

            <p eId="para_2930">As part of budget 2005, I announced a special disability multi-annual funding package with a total value of close to €900 million over the years 2006-09. While this package includes guaranteed additional current spending of almost €600 million, it also includes capital spending of €300 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2931">The bulk of the new funding package will go to the health sector where it will be invested in services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism, services for persons with physical or sensory disabilities and mental health services. It will focus, in particular, on the provision of extra residential, respite and day places, extra home support and personal assistance, and extra places in community based mental health facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2932">The balance of the disability funding package is being allocated between the Departments of Education and Science, Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Office of Public Works where the funding will be used to enhance education services for adults with disabilities and expand pre-school provision; support projects which demonstrate an innovative and cost-effective approach to service provision and improve accessibility to public buildings and amenities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2933">Services in the disability area are particularly labour intensive, relying on highly trained and skilled staff for their effective provision. It is only to be expected, therefore, that a high proportion of the current expenditure involved will relate to staffing. It will be a matter for the service providers to ensure that the programmes are implemented in a manner which will ensure effectiveness, efficiency and value for money.</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_566">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Mr. Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_2935">There are no proposals at present to introduce new tax incentives for employers who employ persons with disabilities. Persons returning to employment after being unemployed, including persons in receipt of certain disability payments, can claim the Revenue job assist allowance where certain conditions are satisfied. The Revenue job assist scheme provides an incentive to the long-term unemployed to take up employment and employers to employ the long-term unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2936">The scheme is available to persons who have been continuously unemployed for the immediate period of 52 weeks prior to taking up a qualifying job and in receipt of an unemployment payment, unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance, the one-parent family payment, the blind persons allowance or the disability allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2937">Under the scheme, a qualifying employee may, in addition to his or her normal tax credits, claim an additional tax deduction at the marginal rate of tax for three years after taking up a qualifying employment. The allowance in the first year of employment is €3,810 plus €1,270 for each qualifying child, reducing to two thirds of these amounts in year two and one third in year three. The second part of the scheme provides a double wages deduction and a double PRSI deduction for employers who employ the long-term unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2938">Apart from the Revenue job assist scheme, my colleague, the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, continues to develop policy for vocational training and employment of people with disabilities on a three dimensional basis by developing the skills of people with disabilities to enable them to access employment; stimulating awareness amongst employers of the contribution which people with disabilities can make to their businesses and encouraging companies to more actively consider recruiting people with disabilities; and providing specific employment supports for people with disabilities and employers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2939">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has a commitment under Sustaining Progress to ". . . develop actions and a policy framework aimed at enhancing the potential of sheltered employment to provide better employment opportunities for people with disabilities". The Department sought to address this commitment through a more mainstreamed approach by developing a new full-time employment support scheme, FTESS, which would also be applicable to sheltered employment enterprises. The underlying objective of the scheme is to increase the numbers of persons with a disability in employment by creating, as far as practicable, a level playing field for them in seeking out or remaining in employment. The mechanism proposed is the payment of a wage subsidy to the employer to compensate for the reduced productivity of the disabled worker. A budget line of €10 million has been established for the scheme for 2005 — this figure includes the current years provision of approximately €5 million for the combined employment support scheme and the pilot programme for the employment of people with disabilties, PEP. FÁS has been requested to implement the proposed scheme as early as possible this year. It is hoped that the new scheme might be launched by the end of June.</p>

            <p eId="para_2947">The medical criteria for the purposes of the tax concessions under this scheme are set out in the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994. Six different types of disablement are listed under the regulations and a qualifying person must satisfy one or more of them. The six types of disablement are as follows: persons who are wholly or almost wholly without the use of both legs; persons who are wholly without the use of one leg and almost wholly without the use of the other leg such that the applicant is severely restricted as to movement of the lower limbs; persons without both hands or without both arms; persons without one or both legs; persons wholly or almost wholly without the use of both hands or arms and wholly or almost wholly without the use of one leg; and persons having the medical condition of dwarfism and who have serious difficulties of movement of the lower limbs.</p>

Repayment of the excise duty on fuel used in the motor vehicle and exemption from annual road tax to local authorities are also allowed.</p>

Sites in Longford and Newcastle West have been acquired.

            <p eId="para_2975">I propose to take Questions Nos. 369 to 372, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2976">The Consumer Director of the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, the financial regulator, is encouraging people to complain in the first instance to the company from whom they bought the policy if they are concerned about the possibility of having been missold an endowment mortgage. The recently appointed Financial Services Ombudsman, whose office was established by the 2004 Act, is statutorily independent and is empowered to deal with complaints from customers of financial service providers. The ombudsman can deal with complaints related to conduct occurring up to six years before the complaint was made.</p>
            <p eId="para_2977">The financial regulator is studying the situation with regard to endowment loan shortfalls, having commenced a survey last year, to determine whether and to what extent there will be difficulties for customers. It would be inappropriate to reach any conclusions on this issue in advance of IFSRA's consideration of the outcome of the survey.</p>
            <p eId="para_2978">There is no definitive information available to my Department on the overall numbers of cases where a shortfall may arise. Endowment loan approvals in the past five years represented just 3% of the overall mortgage market, although it has been considerably higher in the past. Since 1989, a total of 90,000 endowment loans were approved, comprising 10% approximately of total loan approvals.</p>
            <p eId="para_2979">As regards the legal framework, there is a substantial volume of legislation in place relating to these financial products. Following the enactment of the Insurance Act 1989, a code of conduct for insurance intermediaries and guidelines were drawn up by the industry in consultation with the then Department of Industry and Commerce. Key requirements of the code were that the intermediary should know the client and give best advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_2980">The Consumer Credit Act 1995, which commenced in May 1996, contains specific provisions in regard to endowment loans and in particular prescribes certain information which must be included in any application form or information document issued to consumers applying for such loans. For example, since the commencement of the Act all endowment loan application forms must contain a prominent notice to the effect that: "There is no guarantee that the proceeds of the insurance policy will be sufficient to repay the loan in full when it becomes due for payment".</p>
            <p eId="para_2981">The Act also obliges that in instances where the borrower may be required to increase premium payments on the insurance policy during the lifetime of the loan, any document approving the loan must contain a prominent statement of this possibility. Similarly, obligations apply where a policy is surrendered early resulting in a net loss to the consumer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2982">The Act also places an obligation upon insurers underwriting policies relating to endowment loans to issue a statement to the consumer every five years setting out not only the value of the policy at the time of issue but also a comparison of this valuation to the valuation at such date projected at the time the policy was first written and a revised estimate of the valuation at maturity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2983">In addition to the provisions of the Consumer Credit Act, the Life Assurance (Provision of Information) Regulations, which came into being in 2001, oblige insurers to provide policy holders, including holders of policies relating to endowment mortgages, with an annual written statement containing <i>inter alia </i>information on the current surrender or maturity value of the policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2984">More recently, the Government has already considerably enhanced the regulatory and supervisory regime governing the financial services industry, primarily through the enactment of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2003, which established the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2985">The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004 complements the Act passed in 2003 and further enhances the financial regulator's powers and strengthens the regulatory environment. This Act provides for an enhanced structure for dealing with consumers who have complaints about financial institutions and also provides consumer and industry consultative panels for the financial regulator. The consumer panel will have an important role in ensuring that the regulator is correctly reflecting the interests of consumers in its protective — issue of codes of conduct — and educational — information pamphlets and so on — roles. These provisions will help the financial regulator to ensure that consumers have all necessary information to allow them to make considered and informed choices between different financial products including in relation to mortgages.</p>

            <p eId="para_2992">Because the VAT collected from the sale of such goods is accounted for by retailers based on the totality of their sales over a taxable period, it is not possible for the Revenue Commissioners to specifically quantify the VAT in respect of an individual CD or DVD. However, I understand from the Department of Foreign Affairs, which is the accounting authority for the Vote for International Co-operation, that it is awaiting certified sales figures from the distributors before payment of the VAT content of the sales is made to the Band Aid Trust.</p>

            <p eId="para_3045">In regard to regulation of the financial sector the role of the Minister for Finance is to bring forward legislative proposals under which the financial regulator, the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority can adequately supervise and regulate financial service firms including their compliance with their obligations under the anti-money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994. The financial regulator is independent in the exercise of its powers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3046">It is clearly important that the effectiveness of the existing regulatory framework for the financial sector in combating money laundering is kept under review on an ongoing basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3047">The Deputy may also be aware that a third money laundering directive is under consideration within the EU. It received political agreement from Finance Ministers last December and is currently before the European Parliament. If agreed it will require amendments to our domestic legislation in relation to money laundering.</p>

            <p eId="para_3049">Without commenting on the individual tax affairs of the school concerned, the general position is that the scheme of tax relief for donations to approved bodies is governed by section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. Approved bodies include primary schools where their programmes are approved by the Minister for Education and Science. A voluntary contribution to an approved body qualifies for tax relief under the scheme provided it meets the conditions set out in section 848A. One such condition is that neither the donor nor any person connected with the donor receives a benefit, either directly or indirectly, as a consequence of making the donation. Accordingly, a voluntary contribution in exchange for education being provided to the donor's child would not be regarded as genuinely voluntary and would not qualify for tax relief.</p>

            <p eId="para_3051">The original scheme for tax relief on donations made to charities was governed by section 8, Finance Act 1995, and applied only to certain designated Third World charities. The current scheme for tax relief on donations to approved bodies, which includes donations made to charities, is governed by section 848A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. The scheme was introduced in Finance Act 2001 and claims under the scheme arose from 2002 onwards.</p>
            <p eId="para_3052">A separate donation scheme is provided for under section 847A in relation to donations to approved sports bodies for the funding of certain approved projects. This scheme was introduced in Finance Act 2002 and claims under the scheme arose from 2003 onwards. Private schools qualify as approved bodies under the section 848A scheme, once the programme of education being provided is approved by the Minister for Education and Science. Golf clubs and other sporting organisations are likely to qualify in the context of the section 847A scheme once the project (for which the donations are sought) has been approved by the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism.</p>
            <p eId="para_3053">As provided for in the relevant legislation, different tax relief arrangements apply in relation to donors paying tax under PAYE and those paying tax under the self assessment system. In the case of PAYE donors, the charity, approved body or sporting body recovers the tax associated with the donation on a grossed-up basis from Revenue. Donors who pay tax on a self-assessment basis claim the relief in their own tax returns.</p>
            <p eId="para_3054">The following figures of the cost to the Exchequer for the years 2000-01 to 2004 inclusive are in respect of the original charities donation scheme, Finance Act 1995, and of the current scheme for donations to approved bodies, Finance Act 2001.</p>

            <p eId="para_3073">The cost to the Exchequer of tax relief on donations by self-employed taxpayers to approved sports bodies within the meaning of section 847A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is estimated to be of the order of €0.1million for income tax year 2002, the latest year for which an estimate is available. Figures for corresponding donations by PAYE taxpayers are not readily available and could not be obtained without conducting a protracted examination of the Revenue Commissioners' records; however, on the basis of some limited indicative figures available, the cost to the Exchequer of these donations is unlikely to exceed €0.1 million for income tax year 2002 and may be less.</p>
            <p eId="para_3074">As figures of donations made by companies are not captured in corporate tax returns there is, therefore, no basis on which an estimate of the associated cost to the Exchequer can be compiled.</p>

            <p eId="para_3079">The framework for public private partnerships, November 2001, developed under the terms of the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and via the informal advisory group, sets out a statement of principles for the development of PPPs in Ireland. The advisory group has been very helpful in developing the PPP process in Ireland and it provides a forum for relevant officials and social partners to meet. The role outlined for the informal advisory group in the 2001 framework is to help to develop partnership arrangements with the private sector by reflecting the interests of the relevant social partners in the area of PPPs and to facilitating the parties involved to exchange views and information.</p>
            <p eId="para_3080">The work programme of the group from 2002 to date has focused on consultation in regard to the programme of technical guidance brought forward by the central PPP unit in the Department of Finance, on the exchange of views in regard to issues affecting the development of the PPP process to date and in providing clarifications as necessary in regard to progress on individual PPP projects. To date, the guidelines issued following consultation with the informal advisory group and the inter-departmental group on PPPs include:- interim guidelines on the procedures for the assessment, approval, audit and procurement of PPP projects; Revenue guidelines on the corporation tax treatment of PPP agreements; guidelines on the role and function of the process auditor; guidelines on stakeholder consultation for employees and their representatives.</p>

            <p eId="para_3087">The only capital grant support is that provided by Sustainable Energy Ireland through its renewable energy research, development and demonstration programme. It is open to a wide range of research, development, and demonstration projects under the support mechanism categories proposed in the Green Paper on sustainable energy, including shared cost demonstration — projects demonstrating particular renewable energy technologies or applications which although at or near commercial viability and having potential for replication, currently face market barriers due to lack of expertise, knowledge or market confidence; shared cost research and development — research and development into innovative technologies, systems or marketing approaches which support the commercial exploitation of renewable energies; commissioned public good activities — activities directed at increasing the value and impact of the programme results, which will ultimately be used to inform policy. To date the programme has committed approximately €7 million in grant support, with bioenergy accounting for the majority of the spending.</p>
            <p eId="para_3088">I am advised by my colleague, the Minister for Agriculture and Food, that her Department introduced an energy crops scheme in March 2004 in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003. Under this scheme, aid of €45 per hectare is granted for areas sown under energy crops and used for the production of products considered biofuels and electric and thermal energy produced from biomass. Any agricultural raw material, with the exception of sugar beet, may be grown under the energy crops scheme. From 1 January 2005, farmers may claim the energy crop payment in addition to their entitlement under the single farm payment scheme. In addition to this scheme, set-aside land can be used for a variety of non-food uses, including growing of crops for energy purposes, and will therefore qualify to activate set-aside entitlements under the single payment scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3090">The Government has consistently ruled out buyout as an effective means of achieving the restoration of salmon stocks and has instead, since 2002, promoted the application of quotas on commercial fishing and bag limits on angling to achieve catch reductions as the best instrument available to achieve this objective.</p>
            <p eId="para_3091">Moreover, no convincing case has been advanced as to the public good that would be acquired by the State in the context of a publicly funded buyout of commercial salmon licences nor why stakeholders benefiting from increased numbers of salmon entering the rivers should not contribute in whole or in part towards achieving that increase.</p>
            <p eId="para_3092">As a result, and as I have previously and consistently indicated to the House, I have no plans to introduce a buyout of commercial salmon fishing licences but I intend to keep the matter under review in the context of the policy outlined above.

In July 2002 the Department requested all coastal local authorities to submit proposals, in order of priority, for consideration in the context of the 2003-06 national coastal protection programmes. Sligo County Council submitted a proposal for coastal protection works at Ardnaglass river outfall structure at Dunmoran strand at an estimated cost of €325,000 and this was their number one priority.

In this context, my Department commissioned an independent pipeline expert to evaluate the onshore pipeline design code. The study addressed design methodology, operating conditions, pipeline corrosion, public safety, welding and testing, pipeline material quality and protection from interference. The recommendations of this evaluation indicated that the design code has been selected in accordance with best public safety considerations, and is appropriate for the pipeline operating conditions, and subject to the developers undertaking to comply with a number of conditions laid down in the then Minister’s approval and consents the design is generally in accordance with best national and international industry practice and the pipeline is considered to meet public safety requirements.</p>

When tasked by Malin Head coastguard, the RNLI local operations manager selected the inshore lifeboat to respond to the incident.

The decision to grant planning permission for the Corrib onshore gas refinery and pipeline is the subject of two proceedings before the High Court and a decision will be made in April whether or not to grant leave for judicial review.</p>
            <p eId="para_3139">Work on preparing the specification for a feasibility study and cost-benefit analysis of possible routes to Sligo is under way. However, considering the costly nature of this study, it will not be proceeded with until there is a measure of certainty on the Corrib appeals process. Taking this into account, it is hoped the study will proceed later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3140">As regards a joint initiative of the kind the Deputy suggests, it is not clear there is a counterpart for BGE in Northern Ireland. BGE itself constructed the pipeline from Belfast to Derry. It is intended to link the two gas grids with a South-North interconnector to be put in place next year and to which the Government has agreed to give a substantial grant.</p>

            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_3152">The Corrib gas field is a sub-sea development with gas processing at a terminal onshore. Offshore processing for the Corrib gas field is not the preferred development option as it would mean that production would be weather-sensitive, a serious drawback in the hostile environment at Corrib, and there would be greater capital and operational expenditure compared to a sub-sea development. The Deputy will accept the increased capital and operational expenditures that would be needed could make the development uneconomic and that there would be increased safety concerns as the offshore facilities would have to be manned.</p>
            <p eId="para_3153">In January 2001, the developers submitted to my Department a plan of development for the Corrib gas field. This states that, in terms of facilities engineering, the area in which Corrib is located is characterised by a harsh marine environment, being directly exposed to the Atlantic fetch, a lack of existing hydrocarbon production infrastructure and the presence of active fishery industry interests.</p>
            <p eId="para_3154">Section 4 of the plan of development sets out the proposed concept, onshore terminal, and the alternative offshore concepts that were considered. The offshore alternative concepts were eliminated in the plan of development due to a number of considerations. The water depth and hostile nature of the environment at Corrib do not favour the use of a fixed steel jacket or guyed tower. The latter has not been used outside the benign environment of the Gulf of Mexico. The floating production concepts are similarly not ideally suited to extended field life in the prevailing harsh environment, with large bore high-pressure gas export risers being a particular design issue. Remote control buoy technology has not been developed for the extreme environmental conditions experienced at Corrib. Development of an acceptable and reliable system could not be guaranteed within the proposed project timescale.</p>
            <p eId="para_3155">Furthermore, all the proposed manned facilities options incur high operational expenditure and have increased adverse safety implications, particularly with respect to offshore transfer of personnel. High capital cost of all the floating or fixed platform options combined with the requirement for extensive gas transport infrastructure rendered the options sub-economic with predicted Corrib reserves and envisaged gas sale price. The relatively dry nature of the Corrib gas, eliminating the need for offshore processing, and high reservoir productivity, educing the number of wells, allow the use of much simplified production facilities with high reliability. This permits the practical adoption of sub-sea production technology for Corrib.</p>
            <p eId="para_3156">In December 2000, my Department requested from the developers the results of its alternative concept studies. These were examined and reviewed in January 2001 by the consultant petroleum engineer advising my Department. He advised the Department that the developers of the Corrib gas field should not be required to change or consider changing the Corrib development scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3167">Ireland is a member of the International Energy Agency, IEA, an OECD body which, <i>inter alia</i>, monitors developments in the international oil market. The IEA keeps the oil market situation under constant review. While international oil prices are currently high, the IEA considers that the supply-demand fundamentals should not lead to a supply crisis.</p>
            <p eId="para_3168">As a member of the IEA, Ireland is required to maintain emergency oil stocks equivalent to at least 90 days of net imports of crude oil equivalent in the previous year. The EU imposes a similar requirement based on consumption. At the end of December 2004, the combined stocks of IEA member countries, including Ireland, were equivalent to 114 days of net imports. Ireland's stocks were estimated at 115 days' net imports on 1 February 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_3169">My Department has contingency arrangements in place to deal with major oil supply disruptions. In the event of a significant global oil supply crisis, Ireland's oil reserves would be eked out over an extended period to supplement commercial supplies which would continue to be available, albeit at a reduced level, in the normal course. In this context, reserves provide cover for periods far in excess of their expression in terms of number of days.</p>
            <p eId="para_3170">There would be no question of Ireland or any other oil-consuming country attempting to deal on its own with an international oil crisis. If such a crisis were to occur, the response, including the release of emergency stocks and the identification of alternative sources of supply, would take place primarily within the framework of the formal emergency regime developed and maintained by the IEA. Under this regime, member states would be entitled to a share of available IEA oil stocks in the event of a reduction of at least 7% in normal global supply levels. There are also provisions for a co-ordinated international response to an emerging crisis, without the oil-sharing component, in advance of the 7% trigger.</p>
            <p eId="para_3171">I am satisfied Ireland's emergency stock levels are more than sufficient to ensure that we would be in a position to participate effectively in an internationally co-ordinated response in the event of an oil supply crisis. In addition, it is clear that if all countries and all users turned their attentions in a focussed way to increased energy conservation, this would impact on market sentiment which is a key driver of the crude oil price.</p>

Expenditure on this measure is not co-funded by the EU and is, accordingly, totally Exchequer-funded. Expenditure under this measure up to the end of 2004 was €32.2 million and €2.882 million is the amount of Exchequer funding made available in 2005 for the coast protection measure of the National Development Plan 2000-2006. The question of allocating additional funding for this measure this year does not arise.</p>

He further indicated that it is appropriate for the pipeline operating conditions and, subject to the developers undertaking to comply with a number of conditions laid down in the then Minister's approval and consent, the design is generally in accordance with best national and international industry practice and the pipeline is considered to meet public safety requirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_3278">My responsibility in relation to safety issues at mobile phone masts relates solely to emissions of non-ionising radiation from these sites. There is currently no scientific or medical evidence that emissions below the level of internationally recognised guidelines from mobile telephone masts are injurious to health.</p>
            <p eId="para_3279">Over recent years, more than 25,000 peer-reviewed studies into possible health effects of non-ionising radiation, the class of electromagnetic emissions associated with mobile phone technology, have been published. No definite causal link has been proven between the emissions and any adverse health effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_3280">By consensus among many countries, guidelines are established for safe levels of exposure to various kinds of electromagnetic emissions. These guidelines are set at levels which are many times less than the experimental levels at which no adverse effects have been established. Ireland has adopted the guidelines established by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection, ICNIRP, and participates in the work of the International Committee on Electromagnetic Safety, which sets standards in this area. All licensed telecommunications operators in Ireland are required by the terms of their licences to observe the ICNIRP guidelines for limiting exposure of the public to electromagnetic emissions from their facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3281">The Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg, has in the past audited emissions of non-ionising radiation from communications sites including masts.

            <p eId="para_3304">The programme for Government contains a commitment to set out a long-term strategy for the sustainable development of our fishing industry, which operates within the overall framework of the Common Fisheries Policy. To date, a number of specific policy initiatives have been progressed, including a new CFP Regulation agreed in 2002, following comprehensive sectoral consultation in Ireland. A new, fully transparent fleet licensing policy has been introduced and a legally independent licensing authority has been established to implement that policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_3305">A policy statement on the future directions for the sustainable development of the sea-fishing industry was launched last year. This will involve the development of a comprehensive plan to deliver sustainable fishing for the whitefish fleet, infrastructural development and sustainable management and development of inshore fishing. These are fundamental elements of the challenges facing the future of the commercial fishing industry in Ireland and I assure the Deputy that these urgent issues will receive the necessary degree of time and analysis to ensure an effective outcome. I also assure the Deputy that the views of stakeholders in the industry will be fully taken into account as this important work progresses.</p>
            <p eId="para_3306">The Department will shortly be inviting applications to tender for a major consultancy study on the whitefish industry. It is hoped that this review will be completed towards the end of this year, following which I will bring forward a plan in full consultation with the sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_3316">The tsunami which struck southern Asia on 26 December last, was also felt as far away as the coast of Somalia on the Horn of Africa. I have been deeply concerned by reports that the huge waves which reached Somalia are believed to have stirred up tonnes of nuclear and toxic waste illegally dumped in the war-racked country from the late 1980s and throughout the 1990s.</p>
            <p eId="para_3317">Apart from killing about 300 people and destroying thousands of homes, the waves are said to have broken up rusting barrels and other containers and dumped the hazardous waste contained therein along Somalia's long coastline. These claims have been made in a post-tsunami report prepared by the United Nations Environment Programme, UNEP, earlier this year. UNEP reported that waste ranging from medical to chemical waste products is now scattered on land. UNEP also reported, worryingly, that higher than normal rates of Somalis in the north-eastern areas were ill with diseases such as respiratory infections, mouth ulcers and bleeding, abdominal haemorrhages and unusual skin infections. UNEP has also warned that this current situation poses an environmental threat to all areas in the eastern Africa sub-region.</p>
            <p eId="para_3318">Somalia has been without a central Government since 1991 and although progress has been made in recent times with the installation of a transitional Government, much still needs to be done. There are suspicions that some European companies may have used Somalia in the past as a dumping ground for hazardous waste including uranium radioactive waste, lead, cadmium, mercury and hospital waste. There is little information available on the extent to which illegal dumping may be continuing to take place in Somalia.</p>
            <p eId="para_3319">In its report, UNEP called for the dispatch of a multi-agency expert mission to the region in order to fully investigate the situation. The joint UNEP-UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs environment unit in Geneva continues to look into reported hazardous waste and nuclear deposits along the Somali coastline. Along with other relevant parties, the unit is planning an inter-agency field assessment mission to identify the scope and nature of the problem and to determine the follow up actions required.</p>
            <p eId="para_3320">Ireland continues to keep apprised of this issue and I look forward to receiving further information on the current situation in Somalia from planned field assessment missions.</p>

            <p eId="para_3322">Since the events of 29 December 2003, my Department has been endeavouring to establish the full circumstances of the ambush which led to Archbishop Michael Courtney's tragic death. My predecessor, the former Minister for Foreign Affairs Deputy Cowen, discussed this issue on a number of occasions with both the President and Foreign Minister of Burundi, most recently on 21 September 2004 when he met the President in New York at the United Nations General Assembly. The Government was also presented in February 2004 with the results of the initial investigation conducted by the Burundian authorities. This report, which was presented simultaneously to the Holy See, was provided in confidence to the Government and to the Holy See. Ongoing contact has also been maintained throughout between my Department and the Holy See.</p>
            <p eId="para_3323">Arising from the investigation by the Burundian authorities, an individual, said to have suffered serious injury during the ambush which resulted in Archbishop Courtney's murder, was arrested in February 2004.

The Burundian authorities have assured us they are continuing to pursue others who they believe may have been involved in the ambush.</p>
            <p eId="para_3324">The Government remains in close contact with and seeks regular updates from the Burundi authorities regarding developments in the investigation.

            <p eId="para_3331">I assure the Deputy that I am committed to providing a quality passport service to the public which includes having telephone inquiries dealt with quickly by friendly, experienced and helpful staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_3332">The Passport Office has 19 staff in its customer care and telephone helpline sections. The office has 15 external lines which are manned between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. daily. A 24-hour recorded information service is also provided. As the Deputy will appreciate, the volume of calls varies from time to time and, at peak periods, customers may experience some delays in getting through by telephone. In response to this, the Passport Office redeploys staff from other areas to its customer care and telephone helpline sections whenever required.</p>
            <p eId="para_3333">The telephone numbers to which the Deputy refers are Passport Office staff internal lines. It is departmental policy to have voice mail on officers' internal lines. In the case of the single extension to which the Deputy refers as not having voice mail, there was a problem with this line which has now been corrected.</p>
            <p eId="para_3334">In general, I am satisfied that the service provided by the Passport Office meets the standard set out in the Department's mission statement which commits it to providing a modern and efficient passport service. There have been some exceptional problems in the recent past associated with the implementation of a new passport system and these have had an impact on the accessibility of the customer care and telephone helpline sections. However, these problems are being actively resolved and, when the new system is fully operational, I am confident that there will be an improved service to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_3335">Demand for passports has almost doubled since 1997 with over 500,000 passports being issued here in Ireland for the first time last year. This has necessitated a complete upgrade of the systems and operations in the Passport Office. The new system, which is currently being implemented, incorporates the most advanced technologies for producing passports and will give Ireland one of the most secure passports in the world. The new system commenced operation here in Ireland last December and is being extended to our overseas missions on a phased basis throughout the remainder of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3336">To assist passport applicants, passport information is available in a number of ways in addition to telephoning the Passport Office. Passport application forms are available from the Passport Office, all Garda stations and most post offices. The application form itself contains a four-page explanatory notice which provides section by section advice to assist applicants when completing the form. The Passport Office website, <i>www.passport.ie</i>, also provides additional information on how to obtain a passport as well as on how to avoid the most common mistakes made with passport applications.</p>

            <p eId="para_3340">I propose to take Questions Nos. 444 to 446, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3341">Following the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the United States enacted legislation which includes a requirement that citizens of countries that participate in the visa waiver programme, including Ireland, must present a passport that incorporates biometric identifiers as a condition of entering the United States under the visa waiver programme after 26 October 2004. Last year, the deadline for introducing biometric passports was extended to 26 October 2005. This requirement applies to passports issued after the deadline only and does not affect holders of machine-readable passports issued before the deadline.</p>
            <p eId="para_3342">Last December, the European Union adopted a regulation which sets security standards for EU passports, including the incorporation of biometric identifiers. However, as the legal base for this regulation is in the Schengen part of the treaty, Ireland is not legally bound by the measure.</p>
            <p eId="para_3343">Following detailed consideration of all the issues involved, the Government decided on 14 December 2004 to proceed with the introduction of biometric passports. My Department has launched a procurement process to obtain the necessary systems. A notice inviting firms to submit expressions of interest was placed in the Official Journal of the European Union on 17 December. Based on the responses received, a request for tender was issued to a number of qualified companies on 14 March.</p>
            <p eId="para_3344">After the closing date for receipt of tenders of 25 April, it is proposed to award the contract for the project as soon as possible. A condition of the contract will be that the production of biometric passports should commence on a pilot basis by October 2005, with full production following as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_3345">The process will involve storing a digital image of the passport holder's face, taken from a photograph supplied by the applicant in the usual way. The information will be held by the Passport Office just as it now holds photograph records. As the data will be used only for passport purposes, there are no legal implications.</p>
            <p eId="para_3346">The deadline for introducing biometric passports has already been extended once and it cannot be excluded that a further extension will be granted. My Department is in contact with the US authorities regarding these matters and will publicise the requirements fully, both at home and through our missions abroad, as soon as the arrangements are finalised.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_3355">I propose to take Questions Nos. 449 and 450 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3356">Trade is one of the most powerful engines of economic growth and ultimately of poverty reduction in developing countries. The Government is committed to the WTO Doha ministerial declaration and to the integration of developing countries into the global trading system. The Fairtrade mark is an independent assurance that producers in developing countries receive a fair price for their products. It provides a vital opportunity for producers in the poorest developing countries to access international markets on fair terms of trade. I fully support the objectives of the Fairtrade campaign. It provides an opportunity for people in Ireland to make a practical contribution to improving the conditions of producers in developing countries. On the Deputy's suggestion that Fairtrade products be used in my Department, I am glad to confirm that this is already the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_3357">Since 1996, Development Co-operation Ireland has been making grant aid available to Fairtrade Mark Ireland, the national fair trade labelling organisation. Fairtrade Mark Ireland received a grant of €40,994 in 2004 through the development education grants scheme to support its main activities, including promotion of the concept of fair trade with businesses; development education; and raising public awareness, in particular through the Fairtrade fortnight and the Fairtrade towns initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_3358">Development Co-operation Ireland is also assisting community-based Fairtrade agricultural projects in Central America. Over the three-year period 2003 to 2005, funding of €567,000 has been provided to promote access to fair-traded marketing options for coffee co-operatives in Honduras, Guatemala and Nicaragua. Funding is channelled through the regional office of the Fairtrade Labelling Organisation based in El Salvador. Del Campo, a Fairtrade certified co-operative in Nicaragua, has received funding of €187,000 to support small grain producers over three years to process and market a variety of products, including sesame seed.</p>

            <from>Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr. D. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_3363">I propose to take Questions Nos. 452 and 453 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3364">For the period in question, the Government's development co-operation programme, Development Co-operation Ireland, provided funding for two projects that provide services primarily for men, and boys. Details of these projects are included in Annex A.</p>
            <p eId="para_3365">As part of its overall commitment to poverty reduction and sustainable development, Development Co-operation Ireland, DCI, has prioritised the issue of gender equality as an integral part of the fight against poverty. In this regard, two complementary strategies are implemented: mainstreaming gender equality through all policies and programmes, and funding specialised interventions that support and contribute to women's empowerment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3366">On support through multilateral agencies, the Department has made voluntary contributions in the last three years from the development co-operation budget to two UN agencies dealing with women's issues. These are the United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA, which works in developing countries to save the lives of women and promotes human rights through better reproductive health care, and UNIFEM, which is the United Nations Development Fund For Women. Ireland contributed €2,539,000 in 2003 to UNFPA's core resources. This level of contribution was maintained in 2004 and the contribution increased to €2,920,000 this year. Some €550,000 was contributed to UNIFEM in 2003. This increased to €600,000 in 2004 and to €690,000 for 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_3367">Details of relevant bilateral contributions in DCI's seven programme countries — Ethiopia, Lesotho, Mozambique, Tanzania, Timor Leste, Uganda and Zambia — and in South Africa are set out in Annex B.</p>
            <p eId="para_3368">Included in Annex C is a list of the support for the period 2002 to 2004 provided by DCI to NGOs working throughout the developing world, the Balkans and Commonwealth of Independent States, which are involved in projects specifically targeting women. On support to Irish-based development education organizations, Annex D outlines DCI's support to Irish women's organisations which aim to build an awareness and understanding of development issues within Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_3369">The Irish abroad unit manages financial support for organisations in the voluntary sector engaged in the delivery of advice and information services to our emigrant community, particularly to vulnerable and marginalised Irish people living abroad. Funding in 2005 has reached the unprecedented sum of €8.27 million, an increase of 63% on 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_3370">The organisations supported are engaged in a wide range of services. Areas of activity include services directed to older emigrants, the homeless, Travellers, prisoners abroad and undocumented Irish people in the United States. Only one of the recipient organisations — the London Irish Women's Centre — is focused exclusively on services for women. Otherwise, the services that are supported under this heading can be of relevance to men and women, and are accessed by both. In 2002, the London Irish Women's Centre received €39,000 in Government funding, which rose to €47,044 in 2003 and €104,760 in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_3371">The Communicating Europe Initiative, CEI, which is administered by the EU division of the Department of Foreign Affairs, seeks to promote greater public awareness of the European Union. As part of its activities, it has provided grant funding to a range of groups to develop information initiatives about the EU and its impact on the lives of citizens. Details of funding awarded to women's organisations under the CEI are set out at Annex E.</p>

        <b>Mr. Sargent</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Foreign Affairs</b>
        the Government’s position on the current instability in Lebanon and the continuing presence of Syrian troops in that country.
        [10744/05]

            <p eId="para_4030">The brutal murder of former Prime Minister Rafiq Hariri on 14 February has been the catalyst for significant ongoing developments in Lebanese politics. The massive public response has been remarkable. I welcome the fact that protests have been peaceful and that restraint has prevailed on all sides. It is to be hoped that this will continue to be the case, and we call on all Lebanese political leaders to unite in determination to ensure that violence has no place in Lebanese politics.</p>
            <p eId="para_4031">At the request of UN Secretary General Annan, Deputy Garda Commissioner Peter Fitzgerald has produced an important report into the circumstances of Mr. Hariri's murder, which the Secretary General has now forwarded to the Security Council for its consideration. The Government was pleased to be able to accede to the Secretary General's request to make Deputy Commissioner Fitzgerald available, and his speedy and professional report reflects credit upon him and Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_4032">Prime Minister Karami, who is acting in a caretaker capacity following his resignation in February, is attempting to form a government of national unity to lead the country into the elections which will probably take place in June. It is not clear yet whether he will be able to succeed in this effort.</p>
            <p eId="para_4033">While the presence of Syrian troops in Lebanon was instrumental in bringing the long civil war to an end, the withdrawal of those forces is long overdue, and their continued presence has itself become a cause of division in Lebanon. Ireland, in common with the whole international community, wishes to see the full and timely implementation of UN Security Council Resolution 1559, which calls for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon. Syria has given clear undertakings that its forces will be fully withdrawn by the end of this month. I look forward to the fulfilment by Syria of that commitment.</p>

            <p eId="para_4035">The Government is in regular and ongoing contact with the Palestinian Authority through diplomatic channels. The Taoiseach telephoned President Mahmoud Abbas to congratulate him on his success in the elections. In the course of this call, he assured President Abbas of Ireland's continuing support for efforts to bring an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I have also written to my own counterpart, the newly appointed Palestinian Foreign Minister, Nasser Al-Kidwa, congratulating him on his appointment and looking forward to an early meeting. I had hoped to meet personally with President Abbas, Foreign Minister Al-Kidwa and other key Palestinian figures this month during a visit to the region but my recent appointment by the Secretary General of the United Nations as envoy on UN reform meant that my visit to the region must be temporarily deferred. However, I was fortunate to be able to meet the Palestinian Minister for Communications, Sabri Saidam, at the Euromed ICT ministerial meeting in Dundalk earlier this week.</p>
            <p eId="para_4036">Irish aid in Palestine is applied in the sectors of education, health, local government, human rights and emergency humanitarian assistance. A new three-year programme of assistance for the period 2005 to 2007 began in January 2005. Under this programme, funding amounting to over €10 million will be allocated to Palestine. In addition to this programme, funding is also allocated to key Irish NGO's via the multi-annual programme scheme, MAPS, and the fellowship programme.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4039">I propose to take Questions Nos. 456 and 457 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_4040">Understandably, our primary aim in responding to any emergency has to be to use the best available means to deliver assistance to the vulnerable as quickly as possible. That said, we are aware that all agencies involved in responding to the aftermath of the tsunami have been overwhelmed by its scale. Given this exceptional situation we have been disposed to the use of some of the funds allocated to Irish NGOs to build or augment their capacity on the ground to deliver this assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_4041">As a general point, Development Co-operation Ireland has been committed to ensuring that its engagement with the many forgotten emergencies is not diminished by the response to the tsunami and we are aware that many NGOs have made similar commitments.</p>
            <p eId="para_4042">Ireland recognises the importance of honouring aid pledges and the need for them to be disbursed fully and effectively in line with best international practice. In response to the UN flash appeal last January, donors pledged US$871 million to assist countries affected by the tsunami. Of that, $810 million, or 93% of the pledge, has been converted into confirmed contributions — 84% from governments and 9% from private sources. From this, it can be seen that there has been a high delivery on the original pledges.</p>
            <p eId="para_4043">In addition, the Development Assistance Committee, the DAC, of the OECD, which represents 22 donor countries, has announced that it proposes to monitor disbursement by governments against their pledges of assistance for tsunami victims. Ireland and its NGOs have also repeatedly raised this issue at EU level. Ireland has pledged €20 million for the tsunami, of which almost50%, €9.8 million, has already been allocated. Work is ongoing to allocate the balance of €10.2 million in an efficient, effective and accountable manner. Former Minister of State, Mr. Chris Flood, who has been appointed as envoy for the tsunami follow-up, will track the use of Ireland's funds and ensure that these are employed in line with best international practice.</p>
            <p eId="para_4044">On the situation in Sudan, I can confirm that I paid a visit to the country last week to assess the needs on the ground ahead of the Oslo pledging conference. I am delighted to inform the Deputy that the Government will give €15 million to Sudan for the period 2005 to 2007. This money will be allocated to different regions in the country and will reflect the priorities expressed to me by UN agencies, NGOs and local leaders with whom I have discussed the situation on my recent visit.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs (Mr. C. Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_4046">A list of pledges made at international pledging conferences, in respect of funding for Afghanistan, Liberia, Iraq and Haiti, is outlined in the following table. From this table it can be seen that many pledges have been fully delivered. The timeframe for delivery, as agreed with the parties involved, can stretch over a number of years. However, Ireland recognises the importance of honouring aid pledges and the need for them to be disbursed fully and effectively in line with best international practice. Ireland's funding is delivered through key UN agencies and NGO partners who have the skills and capacity to operate on the ground. All programmes are in line with the needs prioritised by each country.</p>
            <p eId="para_4047">In the case of Honduras and other countries affected by Hurricane Mitch in October 1998, the Government dispersed over €760,000 for humanitarian programmes in the region affected in the immediate aftermath of the hurricane during the period November 1998 to January 1999. Since Hurricane Mitch, Ireland's funding to the Central American region has increased significantly. In 2004, it amounted to over €6 million, of which €2.65 million was allocated for development programmes in Honduras. In 2005, €7.4 million has been allocated for development programmes in the region.</p>

While allocation of funding is not made on basis of gender, the guidelines, terms and conditions of the programme stipulate that applicants must submit details of their rules and procedures as evidence of non-discrimination. This emphasis on ensuring equality of treatment is reflected in the fact that grants allocated under the scheme, while meeting any gender-specific needs, are made available only to organisations whose membership is open to both sexes.</p>
            <p eId="para_4132">The local authority swimming pool programme provides capital funding to local authorities for the building or refurbishment of public swimming pools. Funding is not allocated on the basis of gender.</p>

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4177">Research and development is at the core of the EU's Lisbon strategy. On 6 April 2005 the Commission published its formal proposal for a new EU programme for research, the seventh research framework programme — FP7 — which will run from 2007-13. The proposal involves a doubling of the research budget to approximately €73 billion over the seven-year period. The proposal is designed to give new impetus to increasing Europe's growth and competitiveness, and covers four specific research programmes as follows: co-operation, trans national collaborative research projects; ideas, frontier research — European Research Council; people, human potential — Marie Curie actions; capacities — research capacities.</p>
            <p eId="para_4178">The Commission will present its proposal to the competitiveness council on 18 April next where an initial exchange of views will take place. This will be followed by a more substantive orientation debate at the council on 7 June.</p>
            <p eId="para_4179">Many of the priorities put forward in our January 2005 position paper on FP7 have been reflected in the Commission's formal proposal. However, our openness to supporting the new priority areas included in FP7, such as, frontier research, joint technology initiatives and research infrastructures, will depend to a significant extent on the amount of funding allocated to research in the financial perspectives.</p>
            <p eId="para_4180">The adoption of the common position on FP7, which involves co-decision procedures with the European Parliament, is not expected until mid-2006 and the Government will work in the negotiations to ensure that the priorities to be funded under the programme, and the rules governing participation, are such as to facilitate the maximum level of Irish participation in the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_4181">At a national level we have taken up the challenges set under the Lisbon Agenda, with the aim of making the Union the most competitive, knowledge-based economy in the World by 2010. This includes the goal that overall spending on research and development and innovation in the EU should be increased to 3% of GDP by 2010, with two thirds of this spend to come from industry. In August 2004, the interdepartmental group set up to examine the national policy implications of the EU's Lisbon Agenda targets on investment in research and development and to make recommendations on how Ireland should respond, reported with Building Ireland's Knowledge Economy-the Irish Action Plan for promoting investment in research and development to 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_4182">The action plan took as its starting point the substantial increase in investment by the Government in science, technology and innovation which has resulted in a five-fold increase in investment in the National Development Plan 2000-2006 to €2.48 billion, compared with €0.5 billion over the period 1994-99. It sets the vision that Ireland by 2010 will be internationally renowned for the excellence of its research and be at the forefront in generating and using new knowledge for economic and social progress, within an innovation driven culture.</p>
            <p eId="para_4183">To realise this vision, the analysis undertaken reveals that the following targets must be achieved: business investment in research and development should increase from €917 million in 2001 — 0.9% GNP — to €2.5 billion in 2010 or 1.7% GNP. This would entail a doubling of the number of companies with minimum scale research and development activity and a quadrupling of the number of enterprises performing significant research and development.</p>
            <p eId="para_4184">Research and development performance in the higher education and public sectors should increase from €422 million in 2001 — 0.4% GNP — to €1.1 billion in 2010 or 0.8% GNP. The combined increases in performance in business, higher education and public sector research and development should result in gross expenditure on research and development increasing to 2.5% of GNP by 2010. Consequently, the number of researchers should reach 9.3 per 1,000 of total employment by 2010, from approximately 5.1 per 1,000 in 2001.</p>
            <p eId="para_4185">To work towards these ambitious targets, a Government strategic approach is required. The IDC, established as part of the Government decision on co-ordination and governance of STI, provides an appropriate high level and interdepartmental arena to make recommendations to Cabinet on the steps necessary to implement the research and development national action plan. This is expected to form a major part of the IDC's work programme in 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_4187">The live register figure for County Sligo for March 2005 at 1,995 shows a decrease of 8.74% compared to 2,186 for March 2004. The figure of 1,995 is one of the lowest in more than 12 years. While the live register is not a true record of the level of unemployment, it is nevertheless a useful indicator of the current employment trend.</p>
            <p eId="para_4188">During my visit to Sligo on 31 March 2005, I announced the creation of 300 new jobs in an IDA Ireland assisted customer contact centre for IDT Toucan which will be located in Finisklin Business Park. This new centre will open later this year. While in Sligo, I was informed by Lotus Automation, an Enterprise Ireland client, that the company has increased employment from 160 jobs to 226 since the beginning of the year and plans to reach 300 by the end of the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_4189">IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland will continue to promote County Sligo to potential investors from a variety of sectors, including medical technologies, pharmaceuticals and international services. Every effort will be made to secure further new investments for the area. In addition to targeting potential new projects, both agencies continue to work with their existing base of companies in Sligo with a view to supporting these companies with potential expansions and diversification of activities. Enterprise Ireland has also approved support to extend the business innovation centre at Sligo Institute of Technology and to develop a design centre of excellence. The Sligo County Enterprise Board provides support for small businesses to develop indigenous enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity at local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_4190">The industrial development agencies also work closely with Sligo County Development Board. At the board's last meeting on 2 March 2005, it was agreed that job creation and retraining issues would be discussed by its economic development sub-committee and a task force was not required. The board is best placed to co-ordinate the ongoing industrial needs of Sligo and I share the view that a task force is not required.</p>

            <p eId="para_4192">The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment does not analyse retail petrol prices in Ireland compared with the prices charged in other EU member states. However, this information is available from several organisations. The Automobile Association website, <i>www.aaroadwatch.ie</i> contains information for petrol prices in 18 EU member states. The most recent information available on this website is for February 2005 and based on the figures supplied Ireland’s petrol prices are almost 10 cent lower than the average price for the 18 listed member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_4193">Under the Retail Price (Diesel and Petrol) Display Order 1997, sellers of petrol and diesel are legally obliged to display their selling prices. This Order provides the consumer with price information to enable him or her to benefit from price differences between different petrol stations. The Order is enforced by the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_4194">If prices for petrol are affected by agreements between petrol companies or retailers or by an abuse of a dominant position the Competition Authority is there to enforce competition law. Any suspected infringements of competition law should be brought to its attention.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Killeen)</from>
            <p eId="para_4204">A full-time business development executive has been employed by Kilkenny County Enterprise Board to work with a local employment action group in Castlecomer. Enterprise Ireland is part-funding the cost for a two year period up to June 2005. An inter-agency advisory forum was established to work with the business development executive to progress the employment agenda for the Castlecomer area. The forum is chaired by the county manager. It includes the development agencies and the Castlecomer area employment action group. It is expected that the chairman will issue a report on the work of the forum when the business development executive's assignment is completed in June 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_4205">The Comerama facility was purchased by IJM Timber Engineering Ltd., the Monaghan-based timber frame housing company, in March 2004. This project is expected to create 50 jobs over the next 12 months and has the potential to create significant additional employment thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_4206">The total number of employees made redundant by Comerama was 164. Of these, 150 attended for interviews with FÁS. Subsequently, 136 people were called for training and 98 of these attended. Most of this training took place between February and June 2003. Some further training was provided for 35 individuals. Training was completed in 2003 and, at that time, FÁS records indicated that 50% of the workforce who had engaged with FÁS on training programmes had progressed to employment. There have been numerous representations made on this matter by union and public representatives, and many parliamentary questions have been tabled about the Comerama workers over the past two and a half years.</p>
            <p eId="para_4207">Regarding the question of retrospective statutory redundancy payments, the legal advice given to my Department by the Attorney General was that: enhanced statutory redundancy payments would require legislation to be enacted in order to be brought into effect, and as the payment of a statutory redundancy lump sum is a legal requirement on employers, it could not be imposed on them with retrospective effect. Employers are entitled to due notice, usually approximately two months, of the intention to require them legally to pay enhanced rates.</p>
            <p eId="para_4208">Unfortunately for the workers concerned therefore, my Department is legally precluded from paying the enhanced rates of redundancy with retrospective effect, as the workers were declared redundant some time before the new legislation — the Redundancy Payments Act 2003 — came into effect on 25 May 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_4209">The case was also made on behalf of these workers that if it was not legally possible to meet their claim for payment of the enhanced rates, the Government should consider bringing a scheme to the Oireachtas to enable them to be paid the enhanced rates from the social insurance fund as a special case. This proposal was also considered and deemed impractical. It would mean making a special case for the workers concerned on the basis that they had missed out by being made redundant quite some time before the Oireachtas passed the new enhanced rates into law. Many thousands of other workers are in a similar position and could also make a case for special treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_4210">Concerning special retrospective redundancy payments, no precedents have been set by the State with regard to closures similar to that of Comerama.</p>

In addition the agency has provided significant funding for incubation space at the regional development centre at the Dundalk Institute of Technology. Phase 4 of the project, which consists of an additional 15 units, has just been completed and Enterprise Ireland will work closely with the centre to identify suitable client companies for the units.</p>

        <b>Mr. Hogan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
        further to Parliamentary Question No. 259 of 22 March 2005, the basis on which the protection afforded under the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980 in respect of unsolicited goods is not applicable to business to business transactions; if this is due to a statutory or policy decision by the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs not to undertake investigations or handle complaints in relation to matters raised by businesses, as consumers of goods or services; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. Martin)</from>
            <p eId="para_4272">My reply to the Deputy's earlier question was based on the understanding that the practice complained of was one that was set down in the terms and conditions of supply specified by the distribution companies involved. Such terms and conditions are not uniform but they would, typically, give the supplier the right to specify a minimum order number. That being so, I took the view that this is a contractual matter for the parties concerned. However, before replying, I did consider the possible impact of regulations in force regarding unfair contract terms.</p>
            <p eId="para_4273">It is the case that contracts involving business to consumer transactions are subject to the European Communities (Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts) Regulations 1995 (S.I No. 27/1995) which empowers the Director of Consumer Affairs to seek an order from the High Court prohibiting the continued use of any term in a contract concluded with a consumer by a supplier which is adjudged by the court to be unfair. I am advised, however, that the provisions of the 1995 regulations do not extend to business to business transactions. Consequently, I stated in my earlier reply that the Director of Consumer Affairs would have no role in the matter. This remains the case, at least in so far as the enforcement of that particular regulation is concerned.</p>
            <p eId="para_4274">In his latest question, the Deputy makes reference to the Sale of Goods and Supply of Services Act 1980. Section 7 of that Act confers a role on both me, as Minister, and on the Director of Consumer Affairs, in regard to prosecuting offences under that Act. I would have to point out, however, out that the supply of unsolicited goods is not, of itself, an offence under the Act. An offence may arise in circumstances where payment is sought in respect of unsolicited goods.</p>
            <p eId="para_4275">Even so, it is not at all clear to me at this point, that the practice referred to by the Deputy involves the supply of unsolicited goods within the meaning of section 47 of the 1980 Act. Given the existence of the terms and conditions of supply that I have referred to, the provisions of any contract existing between the parties concerned and of any agreement governing the sale or return of the goods, as well as the payment terms involved, would all have to be considered. It may be that section 30 of the Sale of Goods Act 1893 which concerns delivery of the wrong quantity of goods may also be relevant.</p>
            <p eId="para_4276">In those circumstances, it is only prudent to repeat my advice that the practices referred to in the Deputy's question may impinge upon contractual law and retailers may wish to consult their legal representatives on how best to proceed in addressing such concerns. I have attempted to reply to the Deputy's question in a comprehensive manner but I stress that I do not have full details of the case the Deputy had in mind when he framed the question. Nor, at this point, have I the benefit of legal opinion in the matter. I will undertake to have my Department re-examine this matter and, if necessary, seek legal advice as to the applicability of relevant consumer law. In that regard, it would be helpful if the Deputy could supply me with any information at his disposal that might assist that process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4277">The Deputy's question raises an issue in regard to the role of the Director of Consumer Affairs in business to business transactions. Most modern law does make it clear that the protection afforded is in respect of consumer transactions only and "consumer" is most often defined as a person "acting for purposes which are outside that person's trade, business or profession". Older consumer law does not always make that distinction and, of course, the Director of Consumer Affairs does, and will continue to, exercise a role in regard to business to business transactions where the law so requires.</p>
            <p eId="para_4278">Notwithstanding the foregoing, I would see the director's primary role as being to uphold and enforce the rights of ordinary consumers under the statutes within her remit and, as a matter of policy, I would not like to see her becoming involved on a routine basis in contractual disputes involving business to business transactions. Any argument that might be made for the director's involvement in such cases would have to be considered in terms of the relevant statutory provisions, the additional burdens such involvement would place on the resources available to the Director and the implications of such involvement in terms of her primary role.</p>

            <p eId="para_5152">I am aware of the formal trade campaign with a very specific focus on raising consumer awareness which operates under the certification of the Fairtrade mark and to have Fairtrade products widely available and used.</p>
            <p eId="para_5153">The objectives of the campaign are recognised as positive, as trade is increasingly recognised as an important and effective lever for development and hence the alleviation of poverty. Ireland, in common with other EU member states has placed a very clear emphasis on the need to assist developing countries, LDCs, in their integration into the world economy as a necessary condition for their future development. Such integration, which is one element in the process of poverty reduction in the LDCs will be deeper and fairer if anchored in the WTO multilateral trading system.</p>
            <p eId="para_5154">The decision to use any Fairtrade product by my Department would be subject to compliance with public procurement rules and it is a matter for the enterprises supplying services such as cafeteria services in the Department to make their own commercial decisions in sourcing their supplies.</p>

            <p eId="para_5156">IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment. FDI, to Ireland and its regions. While I may give general policy directives to the agency, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.</p>
            <p eId="para_5157">On 23 July 2004, IDA Ireland, through a series of newspaper advertisements, invited proposals from collaborative groups of academic institutions to undertake the establishment of the National Institute for Bioprocessing Research and Training in Ireland. A detailed invitation specification document was issued to prospective applicants which outlined the background, the needs to be addressed, required elements, outputs-deliverables expected, criteria for adjudication and the proposal content details to be submitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_5158">Proposals were received from three consortia by the closing date of 15 October 2004 and a panel of international experts reviewed the quality, value and impact of the proposed activity on 15 November 2004. The panel's evaluation report, which recommends that IDA in the first instance negotiate with the consortium led by UCD, with Trinity College Dublin and Sligo Institute of Technology as partners, was considered by the board of IDA Ireland on 8 December 2004. They agreed to proceed to the next stage in the process and commence negotiations as recommended by the panel.</p>
            <p eId="para_5159">I understand these negotiations are well under way and are dealing with the wide range of substantive issues and recommendations identified in the evaluation report, which were considered by the international experts to be necessary for the successful establishment of the institute. Needless to say, the issue of location will be an integral part of this negotiation process. It is anticipated that a proposal, which addresses all the issues for success, will be considered by the board of IDA Ireland within the coming months before being recommended to Government for consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_5178">I propose to take Questions Nos. 499 and 500 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5179">The projects listed have been awarded assistance from the European Social Fund by my Department under the EU's EQUAL community initiative programme. EQUAL seeks to identify and address fundamental forms of discrimination and inequality in the labour market through the development of new and innovative policies and practices. Projects are operated by consortia known as development partnerships. While all development partnerships funded under EQUAL have a wider equality dimension, the first project is specifically targeted at men, and the subsequent projects are targeted specifically at women. The projects were awarded a global allocation in 2002 to cover the period to mid 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_5180">The Traveller Economy Sectoral Partnership was awarded €740,471. The aim of the project is to develop innovative responses to address the underlying issues impeding the engagement of Traveller men in the Traveller economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5181">The Work Life Balance Network Partnership was awarded €824,839. The aim of the project is to explore and facilitate the absorption of work life balance policies and promote models of good practice in semi-state bodies, local authorities and some private organisations that are currently facing a period of significant change.</p>
            <p eId="para_5182">The National Flexi-Work Partnership was awarded €1,205,604. The aim of this project is to develop new models of working, which will facilitate the reconciliation of work and family life and to encourage employers and policy makers to incorporate these models into their normal practices.</p>
            <p eId="para_5183">The Longford Equal Development Partnership Limited was awarded €375,934. The aim of the project is to develop a partnership that will devise and implement comprehensive, integrated and effective inter-agency strategies and actions in order to address the structural and attitudinal impediments to women becoming self employed.</p>
            <p eId="para_5184">In addition to the projects mentioned, the following were awarded ESF funding in March 2005. The Longford Equal Development Partnership Limited was awarded €525,000. Longford EQUAL aims to bring about a radical improvement in the sustainability and development of women-led businesses by articulating and enhancing the understanding of lessons learned from practice, so that they can impact on policy formulation in the area of support for women's entrepreneurship.</p>
            <p eId="para_5185">The North West Alliance for Improving Working Lives was awarded €844,643. The project aims to improve the quality of working life for women and men by creating the conditions at work to promote attendance, particularly among vulnerable workers, to support and retain staff by using innovative organisational work based supports, to reduce the gender pay gap and to contribute to the modernisation of public and community sector services.</p>
            <p eId="para_5186">The Leadership Initiative — Females in Trade Unions — LIFT was awarded €1,058,208. The LIFT project aims to achieve organisational change and develop skills targeted towards addressing the under-representation and participation by women at leadership level in the trade union movement.</p>

            <p eId="para_5209">I propose to take Questions Nos. 511, 513, 517, 527, 542 and 546 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5210">My Department's policy is to ensure that a range of payment options is available to customers and that service is continually improved by providing access to the wide range of payment options and new services and facilities now available.</p>
            <p eId="para_5211">Current payment methods include payment at post offices by means of a pension order book, electronic or manual post draft issued to the customer's designated post office each week, payment by cheque to the home address of customers, and direct payment to customers' bank or building society accounts by electronic fund transfer. Where possible, my Department provides a payment option which best suits the needs of customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_5212">The option of having payments made at the post office is available for most schemes. In these cases the availability of the option is reflected in the claim form. Some short-term schemes, such as disability benefit, traditionally do not have a post office payment option and, therefore, that option does not appear on the claim forms for those schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5213">The growth in recent years in the number of customers opting for direct payments reflects the changing profile of my Department's customer base, the increasing use of electronic banking services in society generally, and the extension of the direct payment option to more of my Department's schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_5214">Some 59% of customers currently receive payment through their local post office, 10% are paid by cheque through the postal system, mainly short-term schemes, and 31% receive direct electronic payment through their bank or building society account. An Post provides a direct payment option to Post Office Savings Bank accounts which, however, require a seven day advance notice of withdrawal.</p>
            <p eId="para_5215">Bank charges arising for customers availing of the direct payment option are a matter for each customer having regard to their personal banking arrangements. It is understood, however, that some financial institutions offer special facilities to elderly persons involving free banking or reduced banking charges.</p>
            <p eId="para_5216">In regard to transaction costs, my Department incurs a cost of €1.24 for each payment made through the post office network. There is no cost to my Department in respect of direct payments lodged to a customer's bank or building society account.</p>
            <p eId="para_5217">As I have already announced, a comprehensive review by my Department of its payment methods is currently under way to identify a system for the future that will respond most effectively to the individual needs of customers and deliver a service that is flexible and cost effective. This review will take full account of the effectiveness of the existing systems that are used, current trends and offerings in the financial services sector, and the rapid advances in card-based technologies.</p>
            <p eId="para_5218">The increased use of electronic systems will open up possibilities for improved service and greater efficiency in payment delivery generally in the future. I am aware that An Post is actively engaged in considering these possibilities and its future role in this regard. The Government is committed to maintaining a viable network of post offices throughout the country and the issues involved are under consideration by my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, who is the Minister responsible for An Post.</p>

            <p eId="para_5220">The aim of the national fuel scheme is to assist householders in receipt of long-term social welfare or health board payments and who are unable to provide for their extra heating needs during the winter season. A fuel allowance of €9 per week is paid to eligible households, with an additional €3.90 per week being paid in designated urban smokeless zones, bringing the total amount in those areas to €12.90 per week. Fuel allowances are payable weekly for a 29 week period from mid-October to end-April each year.</p>
            <p eId="para_5221">Significant increases in recent years in primary social welfare payment rates, such as the old age pension, have improved the income position for people dependent on the social welfare system. These rates are payable throughout the year and are intended to cover basic living costs, including cooking and heating, supplemented where applicable by the fuel allowance during the winter heating season. In addition, many households also qualify for electricity or gas allowances throughout the year under the social welfare household benefits scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5222">There are no plans at present to extend the period for which fuel allowances are payable each year. Any such changes in the scheme would have significant cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context in the light of other priorities.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5264">I have met several groups representing carers, older people and people with disabilities, since I have become Minister for Social and Family Affairs. I have also given careful consideration to the recommendations of the report on carers prepared by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Social and Family Affairs. This report is based on verbal and written submissions to the committee from family carers and their representative organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5265">According to the Oireachtas joint committee, the greatest need identified by family carers is the need for a break from caring, for respite. I responded to this in budget 2005 and these proposals have now been implemented in the recent Social Welfare and Pensions Act 2005. I have provided for the extension of the respite care grant to all carers who are providing full-time care to a person who needs such care from June 2005. The amount of the grant will increase from €835 to €1,000, also in June 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_5266">Carers who receive a carer's allowance in respect of more than one person receive a double respite care grant regardless of the number of people for whom they provide care. I have made provision from June 2005 to pay a grant in respect of each care recipient for those that provide care for three or more people. This measure recognises the particular challenges which are faced by those carers who are providing care for three or more people.</p>
            <p eId="para_5267">From this month the income disregard on the carer's allowance means test increased by €20 per week to €270 for a single person and by €40 per week to €540 for a couple. This ensures that a couple with two children can earn up to €30,700 per annum and still receive the maximum rate carer's allowance. The same couple can earn up to €49,200 and receive a minimum rate carer's allowance as well as free travel, the household benefits package and the respite care grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_5268">Two improvements to the carer's benefit scheme were announced in the last budget. The first is to increase the earnings limit for carer's benefit recipients who work outside the home for up to ten hours per week from €150 per week to €270 per week from this month. This measure allows all carer's benefit recipients who are in a position to work for up to ten hours per week to earn up to €270 per week. This benefits those carers who wish to maintain contact with the labour market. Also, when applying for carer's benefit, a carer must have been employed in full-time employment for the three month period immediately prior to the commencement of the benefit claim. Full-time employment in this context is defined as insurable employment for at least 17 hours per week or 34 hours per fortnight. I have provided that entitlement to carer's benefit is extended to those who are in employment of 16 hours per week or 32 hours per fortnight for eight weeks, consecutive or otherwise, within the six month period prior to the claim. I anticipate that this more flexible arrangement will allow people who have atypical and seasonal work patterns to qualify for carer's benefit.</p>
            <p eId="para_5269">I reiterate my commitment to developing new benefits and entitlements that will, in a tangible way, further recognise and support the valued and valuable contribution carer's make to our society.</p>

            <p eId="para_5271">It is understood the Deputy is referring to the arrangements agreed voluntarily between the schools and the part-time teachers concerned, whereby an increased hourly rate is paid to encompass pay in respect of holiday entitlements.</p>
            <p eId="para_5272">Entitlement to holiday pay for part-time workers is governed by the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. Under this legislation, pay in respect of holidays is required to be paid in advance. The legislation also enables employers and employees to enter into arrangements "that are more favourable to the employee with regard to the times of, and the pay in respect of, his or her annual leave".</p>
            <p eId="para_5273">On foot of agreements reached between the Department of Education and Science and the unions, part-time teachers have their hourly rate of pay increased in lieu of holiday entitlements. For a week to be regarded as a week of insurable employment, it is sufficient only that the payment of reckonable earnings should relate to that week. The period of holiday leave to which the employees have a legal entitlement is considered integral to their period of employment and weeks of insurable employment should be recorded by the employer accordingly.</p>
            <p eId="para_5274">However, where a part-time teacher ceases to work in a school, be it temporarily over the schools holidays or permanently, a situation may arise where the number of weeks of insurable employment recorded does not include the period for which the part-time teacher is entitled to annual leave, as no additional payment has been made to trigger the recording of an additional contribution week. A contribution is nonetheless due in respect of these periods of paid holiday leave.</p>
            <p eId="para_5275">In this case, the period of entitlement to annual leave is counted as additional weeks of insurable employment as appropriate. Accordingly, should the teacher claim an unemployment payment on leaving a job, a day for which he or she either receives or has an entitlement to holiday pay is not regarded as a day of unemployment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5276">My Department is in contact with the Department of Education and Science to ensure that the number of contribution weeks in which the workers concerned are in insurable employment are properly recorded and returned.</p>

            <p eId="para_5284">Employment in the Civil Service is governed by a particular legal framework with well defined procedures and practices which reflect the special position of permanent and pensionable, established, staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_5285">Staff are appointed to a permanent position following a competition held by the public appointments service, or under recruitment licence, in accordance with the terms of the Public Service Management (Recruitment and Appointments) Act 2004. Prior to October 2004, recruitment was conducted on a similar basis under the Civil Service Commissioners Act 1956.</p>
            <p eId="para_5286">The Civil Service Regulation Act 1956, sets out the terms and conditions upon which civil servants are appointed. It also distinguishes between an established civil servant and an unestablished civil servant.</p>
            <p eId="para_5287">Under this Act, an established civil servant holds office at the will and pleasure of the Government and as such, following a probationary period, may only be removed from office following a decision by the Government. An employee cannot be made a permanent established civil servant unless he or she fulfils the requirements for establishment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5288">Established civil servants have access to a superannuation scheme. The benefits of this scheme are provided for in the Superannuation Acts 1834-2004 and in secondary legislation. Prior to 6 April 1995, the superannuation scheme for established civil servants was non-contributory. People recruited on or after 6 April 1995 contribute to the superannuation scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5289">Unestablished civil servants have access to the non-contributory pension scheme for non-established State employees. Superannuation for these employees is provided for by means of an administrative scheme which commenced in 1970. Competitions are held from time to time for unestablished staff in certain grades, for example, the grade of cleaner, to allow them to compete for establishment.</p>
            <p eId="para_5290">The occupational pension of unestablished staff and established civil servants appointed since 6 April 1995 is integrated with the social welfare contributory old age pension. This is standard practice in the civil service for all staff who are paying full PRSI.</p>
            <p eId="para_5291">In my reply to question No. 199 from the Deputy on 23 March 2005, I explained the social insurance and benefit positions of permanent and pensionable, or established, civil and public servants.</p>

            <from>Minister for Social and Family Affairs (Mr. Brennan)</from>
            <p eId="para_5333">Social welfare programmes aim to be responsive to the needs of those who depend on income maintenance support while providing incentives to assist people to become more independent financially, particularly through employment. A number of measures have been introduced in recent years to remove disincentives to taking up employment and to assist in the transition from welfare to work. These measures include special means disregards and tapered withdrawal of benefits as earnings increase, and employment support schemes such as the back to work programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_5334">The income limit referred to by the Deputy applies to people who take up employment under approved employment schemes and relates only to retention of secondary benefits, such as rent supplement. Such people are entitled to retain certain social welfare and other secondary benefits in total or in part for the duration of the employment scheme, subject to certain conditions. There is no income limit on the back to work allowance scheme itself.</p>
            <p eId="para_5335">For most people the most significant secondary benefit is rent or mortgage interest supplement, which is paid under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. An income limit of €317.43 per week applies to the retention of these supplements. While this income limit has not changed since its introduction, significant other improvements have been made to the means test. Back to work allowance and family income supplement, in cases where one or both of these are in payment, are now disregarded in the assessment of the €317.43 weekly income limit. PRSI and reasonable travelling expenses are also disregarded in the means test. In effect, this means that people who had been unemployed and who commence employment through the back to work scheme can have a weekly household income significantly in excess of the €317.43 limit in question and still qualify to retain 75% of their rent or mortgage interest supplement. For example, in the first year of their participation in the back to work scheme, a single person can have combined income from the back to work allowance and wages of €429 per week while a couple with two children can have a weekly income of €528.25.</p>
            <p eId="para_5336">Other improvements have also been made to the retention arrangements. The period for which rent or mortgage interest supplement may be retained has been extended to four years on a tapered basis, that is, 75% in year one, 50% in year two and 25% in years three and four. In addition, the maximum payment limit of €317.43 per month on the amount of supplement payable has been abolished for people on approved schemes. As a consequence of these improvements, many families retain more of their rent or mortgage interest supplement than had been the case prior to these changes taking place.</p>
            <p eId="para_5337">People availing of an employment support scheme may opt to be assessed under either standard supplementary welfare allowance rules or under the special retention rules, and will be entitled to receive payment under whichever is the more favourable option for them. A person on a community employment scheme or other back to work scheme whose household income is above the €317.43 limit for retention of secondary benefits may still qualify for rent supplement under the standard rules. In that context, I introduced amending regulations in January 2005 to increase the income disregard in the standard rules of the scheme from €50 to €60 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_5338">Overall, I consider that the current eligibility thresholds and disregards, together with improvements in the standard rules of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme, ensure that people have a financial incentive to take up back to work opportunities. The effectiveness of these arrangements will be considered further in the context of a review of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme which my Department is undertaking during 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_5341">I propose to take Question Nos. 540 and 541 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5342">Responsibility for the disabled person's maintenance allowance, DPMA, scheme was transferred from the Department of Health and Children and the health boards to the Department of Social and Family Affairs in October 1996. On the transfer of the scheme the existing qualifying conditions were retained and the scheme was renamed disability allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_5343">One of the qualifying conditions applying to the former DPMA scheme was that the payment could not be made to people who were in residential care where the cost of the person's maintenance was met in whole or in part by a health board. Since 1999 the restrictions on payment to persons in residential care have been progressively relaxed. From August 1999 existing disability allowance recipients living at home can retain their entitlement where they subsequently go into hospital or residential care.</p>
            <p eId="para_5344">A wide-ranging review of illness and disability payment schemes completed by my Department in September 2003 recommended the removal of the residential care disqualification for disability allowance purposes. The working group which oversaw the review recognised that the removal would have a range of implications, and that, in the absence of reliable data on the numbers involved and the actual funding arrangements currently in place, it was not possible to fully assess the likely impact or cost of such a move.</p>
            <p eId="para_5345">Budget 2003 provided for the take-over by my Department of the discretionary "pocket money" allowances paid to people with disabilities in residential care who are not entitled to disability allowance and for the standardisation of the level of these allowances. My Department then undertook an information gathering process with the health boards with a view to arranging for the transfer of responsibility for the payment of these allowances and of the funds involved.</p>
            <p eId="para_5346">In budget 2005, I announced that, as an interim measure, a payment of €35 a week will be payable to the persons with disabilities who are affected by the current restriction with effect from June 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_5347">There are a number of practical and administrative issues to be resolved with the Department of Health and Children, including the question of the appropriate contribution to be made by residents of institutions towards care and maintenance. It is my intention that the outstanding issues will be progressed as a matter of urgency. The issue of repayments does not arise in this instance.</p>

It is a matter for each of the issuing organisations to determine whether or not a disabled person's parking permit should be granted based on each application submitted to it. The qualifying criterion, therefore, centres on the issue of mobility impairment and no specific medical condition is stipulated in the regulations.

            <p eId="para_5378">The overall conclusion of the recent report by the Air Transport Users Council into the potential impact on Ireland of an EU-US air transport agreement is that an EU-US agreement will be beneficial to Ireland. It is my view that Shannon remains an attractive destination across the Atlantic, particularly from the east coast of the US. Aer Lingus has said that there is a strong transatlantic market for Shannon, and that it will continue to serve that market. Any change in Ireland-US or EU-US arrangements will open up new destinations in the US for Aer Lingus, and this presents new opportunities for Shannon. I am convinced that Shannon, with the right cost base for the airport and with the proper competitive environment, can maintain and grow its transatlantic business. The key to future success for Shannon lies in making sure that Shannon is freed up to find its own market niche, and that it provides its services at the best prices, and in the most transparent and cost effective way.</p>

            <p eId="para_5510">The commission of any offence established under the Road Traffic Acts may lead to the pursuit of a criminal conviction. The only general exception to that principle occurs where a person, having been accused of the commission of an offence that attracts a fixed charge, chooses to pay such a charge, which in turn means that a prosecution will not be pursued.</p>
            <p eId="para_5511">Where a person is convicted of an offence, the person is required to submit to a penalty, that is, the payment of a fine or imprisonment. In addition, the person may be subject to the imposition of either a driving disqualification or penalty points.</p>
            <p eId="para_5512">The general question of the degree to which penalties, disqualifications and penalty points can be applied to persons from other jurisdictions who have been convicted of offences must be considered across the range of penalties and other deterrents established in the Road Traffic Acts in consultation with authorities either under the auspices of the EU or on a bilateral basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_5513">The question of the development of arrangements for the pursuit of fines imposed on persons from other jurisdictions is, I understand, the subject of a separate question to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p>
            <p eId="para_5514">Section 9 of the Road Traffic Act 2002 provides the basis for judicial recognition of the EU Convention on Driving Disqualifications. That convention provides that where a disqualification is imposed by a member state on a person from another member state, in respect of any one of a number of particular behaviours, for example, drink driving or dangerous driving, the state where the convicted person resides may apply the disqualification. I understand that the authorities in the UK are considering adopting similar legislation. When that process is finalised, arrangements to facilitate the operation of the provisions of the convention on a bilateral basis between the two countries can be pursued.</p>
            <p eId="para_5515">The authorities in the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland and Great Britain are considering the issue of the introduction of a scheme to provide for the mutual recognition of penalty points between the United Kingdom and Ireland. This consideration is being pursued under the auspices of the British Irish Council, BIC.</p>
            <p eId="para_5516">The Department of the Environment — Northern Ireland — and the Department for Regional Development — Northern Ireland — are the lead agencies for transport and road safety related matters under BIC and they have been giving consideration to this matter. This Department has referred the matter to the Attorney General for his advice given the complex legal issues surrounding this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_5517">The difficulty for the Garda in accessing foreign vehicle registration information, following a detection by camera, is similar to the position encountered by enforcement agencies across Europe. Discussions are taking place at EU level in this respect but are still at an early stage.</p>

The safety of all road users is generally a matter of personal responsibility and in that context the Rules of the Road include a strong recommendation supporting the use at night by pedestrians of reflective armbands outside urban areas. While I do not consider that there should be a regulatory requirement on people to wear such clothing, I will forward the Deputy's suggestion to the National Safety Council.</p>

It is envisaged that the fleet will be fully accessible by 2012-13, assuming that Bus Átha Cliath maintains its current fleet replacement policy.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Transport (Mr. Callely)</from>
            <p eId="para_5660">I propose to take Questions Nos. 571 and 572 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_5661">Directive 92/6/EEC requires speed limiters to be fitted to goods vehicles having a design gross vehicle weight exceeding 12,000 kg and passenger vehicles with more than eight passenger seats having a design gross vehicle weight exceeding 10,000 kg so that their speed may not exceed 90 and 100 km/h, respectively. This directive was transposed into Irish law by means of the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) (Amendment) Regulations 1993.</p>
            <p eId="para_5662">Directive 2002/85/EC extends the requirement to have speed limiters fitted to include goods vehicles having a design gross vehicle weight exceeding 3,500 kg and all passenger vehicles with more than eight passenger seats. The speed limiters are required to be set so that the speed of these vehicles may not exceed 90 and 100 km/h, respectively. The directive's provisions generally apply to these vehicles that are first registered on or after 1 January 2005. I expect to be in a position to make regulations to give effect to Directive 2002/85/EC in Irish law shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_5663">The regulatory framework for vehicle standards is set at European level through a harmonised system of motor vehicle type-approval. Standards for new passenger cars in the EU are specified in a range of EU type-approval directives that are incorporated into a system known as EU whole vehicle type approval, WVTA. WVTA facilitates the achievement of a single market for cars through harmonised safety and environmental standards. New cars must have WVTA in order to be placed on the market in the EU. Once a car has WVTA, it must be given access to the EU market and it is not open to a member state to unilaterally require additional equipment to be fitted in a car.</p>
            <p eId="para_5664">The inclusion in motor vehicles of technology of the type outlined by the Deputy in order to facilitate adherence with localised traffic speed limits is not required under the EU motor vehicle type approval system. Accordingly, it would not be open to Ireland to require the installation of such equipment in motor vehicles.</p>
            <p eId="para_5665">The fitting of speed limiters to large vehicles is an important measure in furthering road safety. Given that speed limiters are vehicle specific, it would neither be appropriate nor feasible to require their fitment on the basis of the type of driving licence held by an individual driver.</p>

        <b>Mr. Broughan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Transport</b>
        if he is considering any major new initiatives or strategies to drastically reduce the continuing appalling carnage on roads here; and if there are any combined initiatives with the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in relation to this matter.

          <speech by="#MartinCullen" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_741">
            <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cullen)</from>
            <p eId="para_5667">The road safety strategy 2004-06 sets a primary target of a 25% reduction in road collision fatalities by the end of 2006 over the average annual number of fatalities in the 1998-2003period. Achievement of the target will result in no more than 300 deaths per annum by the end of the period of the strategy. This is an ambitious target and one which will require a strategic, integrated approach by all of the road safety agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_5668">Unfortunately, we have seen a greater number of road deaths in 2004 than the previous year with provisional end of year figures for 2004 showing 380 deaths on the roads. So far this year there have been 104 deaths on the roads as at 11 April compared to 102 for the same date last year. The recent increase in road deaths is a cause of concern. This places the challenge of meeting the target set for the end of 2006 into stark focus. If we are to realise that target, a significant reversal of the worrying trend that has been noticeable since early 2004 must be achieved.</p>
            <p eId="para_5669">Achievement of the target depends in the first instance on a continued emphasis on the approach that underpins the strategy. A major independent review of the previous strategy confirms that basing the primary target on the achievement of progress in the areas of speeding, drink driving and seat belt wearing remains the correct approach and these remain the key areas of the new strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_5670">The strategy proposes a range of measures in the enforcement, engineering, education and legislation areas to target further reductions in deaths and injuries. An integrated strategic approach will ensure that the road safety agencies, including my Department, the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda, work together to achieve the targets set out in the new strategy. Specific targets set in regard to speeding, drink driving and seat belt wearing are supported by the determination of associated enforcement targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_5671">A critical initiative that will have a significant impact on road safety is the establishment of the new Garda traffic corps. The establishment of a dedicated corps of gardaí, as announced late last year by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, under a distinct management structure within the overall force will provide for the significant enhancement of the deterrent effect that emanates from high levels of traffic law enforcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_5672">The operation of the penalty point system, provided for in the Road Traffic Act 2002, is dependent on the development of a new computerised processing system for the Garda Síochána. Penalty points currently apply to speeding, seat belt wearing, driving without insurance and careless driving offences. The full roll-out of the system will be operational when the IT systems being developed by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform are in place. In overall terms, the introduction of penalty points has had a positive effect on road safety and I am confident that the full roll-out of the system will further enhance that effect.</p>

            <p eId="para_5674">The reduction of aircraft noise on communities surrounding Dublin Airport is the joint responsibility of the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, Irish Aviation Authority and the airlines that operate at Dublin Airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_5675">I am advised by the DAA that in an effort to minimise the impact of aircraft noise the authority has invested almost €1 million in the installation of noise and flight track monitoring equipment which allows the authority to monitor the track flown and noise generated by each and every aircraft arriving and-or departing from Dublin Airport.</p>
            <p eId="para_5676">I am also informed by the DAA that, in August 2003, new environmental corridors were agreed which define the corridor in which it is permitted for aircraft to normally operate. However, the authority states that there may be occasions when air traffic control may be required to route an aircraft outside these environmental corridors.</p>
            <p eId="para_5677">To assist the DAA with deviations from the environmental corridors and general noise complaints a free phone aircraft disturbance line has been in operation for some time now — 1800 200 034. The authority assures me that every complaint regarding aircraft noise is logged, investigated and personally responded to, and that they take concerns regarding aircraft noise very seriously and strive to do all they can to minimise any adverse impact on both the communities and the environment in the operation of Dublin Airport.</p>

However, I understand that the telecommunications mast erected by Iarnród Éireann relates specifically to the enhancement of its centralised traffic control system, CTC, and provides for vital safety-critical communications between drivers and the centralised signalmen located at the CTC centre at Connolly Station in Dublin. Iarnród Éireann is of the view that the erection of this mast in Sligo is an exempted development under the terms of the relevant legislation and is discussing the matter with the local authority in Sligo.</p>

Vehicle in-service standards are specified in the Road Traffic (Construction, Equipment and Use of Vehicles) Regulations 1963, which require vehicles to be fitted with a silencer or other device that is suitable and sufficient for reducing to a reasonable level the noise caused by the escape of exhaust gases from the engine. An examination of the silencer to assess its effectiveness in reducing noise is part of the NCT and the roadworthiness test carried out on commercial vehicles. It is an offence to use in a public place a vehicle which causes excessive noise. Enforcement of the law in this regard is a matter for the Garda Síochána.</p>

The business case for the proposed integrated rail network is being assessed by my Department in the context of the ten-year transport investment framework that is currently being finalised. However, a revised business case specifically related to the Kildare route project is expected from the company shortly and this will be assessed separately as soon as it is received with a view to an early funding decision in the context of the existing five-year capital envelope.</p>

        <b>Ms O’Sullivan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</b>
        if he will review the system of allocating personal alarms and safety devices to elderly persons; if applications will be processed frequently throughout the year to address the problem of grants to the organisations that administer the system coming out and new applications having to wait for several months; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_5791">The scheme of community support for older people encourages and assists local support for older people by means of a community-based grant scheme to improve the security of its older members. The scheme is administered by community and voluntary organisations throughout the country on an annual basis with support provided by my Department. This allows my Department to assess the amount of funding sought under the scheme in a given year and ensure that the funding available is distributed as equitably as possible to all applicant organisations, be they small wholly voluntary operated or larger well resourced organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_5792">My Department recently completed a comprehensive review of the scheme and as a result, I am pleased to advise that the scheme has just been advertised this week, more than three months in advance of last year's scheme. I expect that this will allow for the timely installation of equipment to successful individual applicants.</p>

            <p eId="para_5835">I refer the Deputy to my reply to his Question No 177 of 02 March 2005. The twofold criterion for inclusion in the CLÁR programme was that the areas suffered an average population loss of 50% and with an aggregate current population of more than 4,000. The Deputy will see from the statistics provided for the DEDs in Counties Wicklow and Carlow that, while the appropriate population decline had occurred, the criterion of an aggregate population of more than 4,000 was not met. The DEDs concerned are not contiguous and adjoining DEDs did not experience comparable population loss. These areas, therefore, were not eligible for inclusion in either the original CLÁR areas or the revised areas following the analysis of the 2002 population census data.</p>
            <p eId="para_5836">I have no plans for any further review of the boundary of CLÁR areas. No other significant areas fulfil the population criteria for inclusion in CLÁR.</p>

            <p eId="para_6234">Ireland's quota under the special beef premium scheme is 1,077,458 animals, comprising animals in the bull or first age categories. Under the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) 1254/1999, where the quota is breached in respect of the bull or first age category, the overshoot reduction must also be applied to the second age category animals. These provisions were applied when the overshoot reduction was applied in respect of the 2002 scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6235">Under the 2004 scheme, applications for in excess of 2.418 million animals were lodged, of which 1.394 million were quota animals, that is bull or first age animals. During December, applications in respect of 930,000 animals were submitted, compared with 600,000 during December 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_6236">Following discussions with the farming organisations in late 2003, it was agreed that any overshoot reduction would not apply to the first 25 animals submitted by individual farmers. This means that any farmer who applied for special beef premium under the 2004 scheme in respect of a total of 25 or fewer animals will not suffer any reduction; all other farmers will be exempt on their first 25 animals.</p>
            <p eId="para_6237">The extent of the overshoot of the national quota for the special beef premium scheme and the numbers of farmers who will receive a reduced payment can only be definitively established when all applications are fully processed. This processing involves computer validation and, where errors or inconsistencies are highlighted in such validation, those cases require individual attention. Therefore, it will be appreciated that given the volumes of applications involved, it will take further time to establish the definitive level of quota overshoot, as ineligible animals and animals applied on in excess of each applicant's stocking density limit of 1.8 livestock units per hectare will have to be excluded from the overshoot calculation. However, mindful of the need to expedite balancing payments to farmers affected by the quota excess, I am making arrangements to enable outstanding payments to be made at an early date to special beef, suckler cow and slaughter premium applicants based on an estimated special beef premium scheme overshoot. A final residual payment can issue in respect of the special beef premium when the exact quota position has been established.</p>
            <p eId="para_6238">Some 220,000 balancing payments totalling over €98 million have already issued to farmers under the 2004 suckler cow, special beef and slaughter premium schemes. These payments have been made to farmers who applied for no more than 25 special beef premium animals.</p>

In total, 100 flocks were depopulated under this phase and restocking was not permitted for a period of two years. Flockowners received compensation for the capital value of the sheep and for income loss for that period. In addition, those who restocked in the third year also received compensation for income loss for that year. The terms of the agreement and amounts of compensation and income loss involved were clearly understood and accepted by all concerned at the time of depopulation. Further compensation in respect of later years was not part of this agreement. While my Department agreed to establish a group to examine the costs arising following restocking, it did not give any undertaking regarding the findings of the group.</p>

The cases cited by the Deputy were the subject of confidential correspondence between the Court of Auditors and Ireland two years ago. This correspondence was in the nature of preliminary comment by the court and full responses were given by Ireland. The cases mentioned are not identified other than in the preliminary confidential exchange of views and in the circumstances it would not be appropriate to divulge the details.

Payment in full has issued in respect of the first application. Payment in respect of 11 of the 14 animals applied on under the application dated 1 September 2004 has issued in full.

            <p eId="para_6280">Under the terms and conditions of the 2004 EU special beef premium scheme, applicants were required to "own, possess, hold and maintain" the animals applied on for the entire two month retention period, starting on the day after the application is received by the Department.

            <p eId="para_6281">By letter dated 13 January 2005 the person named was advised that, as the animals in question were slaughtered during the regulatory two month retention period, no payment would be made on the animals and a penalty would be applied in accordance with the terms and conditions. The person named subsequently appealed this decision and, by letter dated 28 February 2005, following consideration of the appeal, was advised that in light of new evidence the penalty as initially proposed would not now apply. However, as the animals were not retained for the regulatory two month retention period, premium cannot be paid. The animals were, therefore, deleted from his application, without penalty, and counted for stocking density purposes, as required. Payment in full has issued in respect of the third application.</p>

            <p eId="para_6393">It is assumed that the question concerns consignments of pigmeat that were imported into the European Union and subsequently forwarded to a cold store in County Tipperary during the first three months of this year. All pigmeat imported from non-EU countries is checked for compliance with EU veterinary legislation at the first EU border inspection post where it is presented for completion of import formalities. This legislation includes requirements in regard to animal health and public health status and the veterinary certificates that must accompany consignments.</p>
            <p eId="para_6394">Subsequent to release into free circulation in the EU, meat moving between EU countries is required to be accompanied by commercial documentation containing certain points of information. In the cases in question, the commercial documentation was inadequate and further documentation is awaited. Following receipt and evaluation of this documentation, a decision on release or otherwise of the meat will be taken.</p>

            <p eId="para_6419">With regard to the rural environment protection scheme, REPS, the agriculture appeals office made four recommendations. My Department took all of these recommendations into consideration when preparing for the introduction of REPS 3 in 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_6420">The first recommendation was that participants be notified of changes to the scheme at the same time as REPS planners or at their next anniversary date. However, there can up to 20 such changes in a year, most of which are minor and technical in nature and of direct interest only to planners in their professional capacity. My Department advertises fundamental changes to the scheme which are directly relevant to participants and I believe this is adequate.</p>
            <p eId="para_6421">The second recommendation indicated that my Department should define what time lapse is acceptable for the submission of amended plans in cases where land is transferred and a new applicant is submitting a new plan. In practice, these cases raise few difficulties. My Department considers that the present position in which each case is judged on its merits and dealt with as flexibly as possible, is preferable.</p>
            <p eId="para_6422">The third recommendation was that my Department examine the delays in notifying farmers of the results of inspections. This is being implemented. The fourth recommendation was that my Department should re-examine its policy relating to clawback of overpayments. This recommendation has been fully implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_6423">The agriculture appeals office made six recommendations in regard to livestock schemes. The position is that five of the recommendations are being implemented in full. As regards the CMMS, a herd profile was issued last month to all farmers with clear instructions as to how to resolve anomalies. In addition, herd profiles may be obtained on request from district veterinary offices of any Department at any stage by individual farmers wishing to verify whether transactions have been recorded on the system. Farmers who register under e-services may also access this information electronically on the Department's website.</p>

            <p eId="para_6429">The promotion and development of renewable energy, including biofuels, are matters in the first instance for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. An interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and comprising of officials from my own Department, the Departments of Finance and Transport, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, was set up in December 2003 to consider policy options for the development of a biofuels sector in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_6430">My Department introduced an energy crops scheme in March 2004 in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. Under this scheme, aid of €45 per hectare is granted for areas sown under energy crops and used for the production of products considered biofuels and electric and thermal energy produced from biomass. Any agricultural raw material, with the exception of sugar beet, may be grown under the energy crops scheme. From 1 January 2005, farmers may claim the energy crop payment in addition to their entitlement under the single farm payment scheme. In addition to this scheme, set-aside land can be used for a variety of non-food uses, including growing of crops for energy purposes, and will, therefore, qualify to activate set-aside entitlements under the single payment scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6431">I am conscious both of the potential to produce energy from biomass and of the value of wood as a carbon-neutral fuel. I consider that the production of energy from biomass offers an important potential market for forest residues. There is real potential to use thinnings from our forests to generate heat and power, thus decreasing our dependence on fossil fuels.</p>

            <p eId="para_6435">I wish to inform the Deputy that the EU legislation, jointly adopted by the European Parliament and the Council, on the cultivation of GM crops specifically prohibits the unilateral declaration of a GM-free country. There are, however, possible options available to restrict the growing of GM crops within regions of a country. These include the concept of voluntarily developed GM free regions, a concept being explored by a number of regional communities and authorities throughout the Union. Another option is to seek a derogation from the Commission that, on the basis of sound scientific evidence, coexistence is not possible in certain regions in respect of certain named crops. The cultivation of these crops can then be legitimally prohibited if the case made is accepted by the Commission.</p>
            <p eId="para_6436">The green food producing image which is associated with Ireland and promoted so successfully by An Bord Bia plays a vital role in the development and promotion of our food industry. The legislative framework on GMOs put in place by the European Parliament and Council of Ministers which is binding on all member states and which is being fully implemented in Ireland provides for a series of controls along the whole supply chain. This ensures that only food which meets the highest possible levels of safety is produced and marketed in this country and any food containing GMOs has to be labelled.</p>

            <p eId="para_6439">Under trade rules in place between Ireland, France and the UK for many years, based on a common animal health position in the equine sector, known as the tripartite agreement, intra-community export or import licences are not required for trade between these countries. However, the animals must be individually identified via their own passports, or a current signed marking sheet, and are subject to spot checks by an official veterinarian at the port of departure.</p>
            <p eId="para_6440">Although all horses certified by my Department are certified for the purposes I have outlined above, I should however point out that trade in horses for slaughter is covered by relevant EU regulations and is, subject to compliance with animal health and welfare legislation, a legitimate trade.</p>

            <p eId="para_6469">Payment of the annual forestry premiums is normally made around this time every year. Last year the premium run took place in early April. This year's payments will be a little later, due to the additional work which had to be carried out in order to fully integrate the forestry payment system with the agriculture system, following the transfer of responsibility for the forestry portfolio to my Department last year. This work involved the examination of client details on each and every file on which payment is made, the updating of such information as required and then the linking of each file into the Department of Agriculture payment system. This was a substantial challenge, scoped as a separate sub-project within the IFORIS project, and with its own dedicated team of personnel. Due to the additional work that had to be done this year my Department indicated to the forest owners that the premium run would not take place until the end of April 2005. However, I am pleased to say that the work has been completed ahead of schedule and I expect the first payments to be made before the end of this week.</p>

            <p eId="para_6471">The promotion and development of renewable energy, including biofuels, are matters in the first instance for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. An interdepartmental group, chaired by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, and comprising of officials from my own Department, the Departments of Finance and Transport, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Sustainable Energy Ireland, SEI, was set up in December 2003 to consider policy options for the development of a biofuels sector in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_6472">My Department introduced an energy crops scheme in March 2004 in accordance with the provisions of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. Under this scheme, aid of €45 per hectare is granted for areas sown under energy crops and used for the production of products considered biofuels and electric and thermal energy produced from biomass. Any agricultural raw material, with the exception of sugar beet, may be grown under the energy crops scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6473">From 1 January 2005, farmers may claim the energy crop payment in addition to their entitlement under the single farm payment scheme. In addition to this scheme, set-aside land can be used for a variety of non-food uses, including growing of crops for energy purposes, and will, therefore, qualify to activate set-aside entitlements under the single payment scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6474">I am conscious both of the potential to produce energy from biomass and of the value of wood as a carbon-neutral fuel. I consider that the production of energy from biomass offers an important potential market for forest residues. There is, I believe, real potential to use thinnings from our forests to generate heat and power, thus decreasing our dependence on fossil fuels.</p>

            <p eId="para_6500">Preparation of the national disability strategy has been guided by the Cabinet committee on social inclusion. The approach recognises the crosscutting nature of the issues and elements involved. The committee will continue in its work as the elements of the strategy are being put in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_6501">The national disability strategy was launched by the Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, on 21 September 2004. The launch involved seven Ministers with direct responsibility for the various elements of the strategy. The strategy has been advanced by a cross-departmental group of senior officials reporting to the Cabinet committee and comprises four elements, namely: the Disability Bill 2004, which is the direct responsibility of my colleague, Deputy Fahey, Minister of State in my Department with responsibility for disability equality; the Comhairle (Amendment) Bill 2004, which is the responsibility of the Minister for Social and Family Affairs; six outline sectoral plans which are the responsibility of the Ministers for Health and Children, Social and Family Affairs, Transport, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and Enterprise, Trade and Employment; and a multi-annual investment programme, from 2005 to 2009, providing over €1 billion for high priority disability support services, mainly in the health and education areas, which was announced as part of the budget on 1 December 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_6502">My Department has overall responsibility for the Disability Bill. The Bill commenced Second Stage in the Dáil on 4 November last and has been debated on 18 November 2004, 27 January 2005, 1 February 2005 and 22 February 2005, with further sessions scheduled for today and tomorrow. It is hoped that this Stage will be completed soon and that Committee Stage will commence as soon as possible thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_6503">The Disability Bill requires that each of the six sectoral plan Departments undertake consultation with stakeholders before the plans are finalised for submission to the Oireachtas. The National Disability Authority is arranging a series of regional meetings to facilitate public information and consultation on the outline sectoral plans which will take place as follows: 25 April 2005 — Tullamore Court Hotel; 9 May 2005 — Burlington Hotel, Dublin; 16 May 2005 — Silver Springs Hotel, Cork; 20 May 2005 — Landmark Hotel, Carrick-on-Shannon; and 27 May 2005 — Radisson Hotel, Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_6504">The meetings have been advertised and participation is open to people with disabilities and their families, carers, advocates and service providers.</p>

I understand the chairman intends that the steering group will meet every two to three months.

            <p eId="para_6527">As the Deputy is aware, 17 locations throughout the country, including Kilkenny, are set to receive town centre CCTV systems. This expansion is being implemented on a phased basis as follows: phase 1 — Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick; phase 2 — Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford; and phase 3 — Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and Sligo.</p>
            <p eId="para_6528">The installation of the phase 1 systems in Bray, Dundalk, Dún Laoghaire and Limerick has been completed and these systems are now fully operational. A total of 13 of the 18 cameras in Galway are now fully operational. It is proposed to install the final five cameras in tandem with the major redevelopment works currently being undertaken by Galway City Council in the Eyre Square area.</p>
            <p eId="para_6529">The issue regarding the provision of suitable space to accommodate the monitoring of CCTV cameras in Finglas Garda station is currently being considered, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, with regard to the overall accommodation needs of the station. It is hoped that work can proceed to completion in Finglas in 2005. Installation of the CCTV systems is of necessity a detailed, complex and lengthy process. The Garda authorities are giving careful consideration to a restructuring of the manner in which these Garda CCTV systems go to tender.</p>
            <p eId="para_6530">I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of the remaining CCTV programme, and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda Síochána in this regard. The proposed redesign of the tender document provides an opportunity to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest possible extent, making use not only of the technical but also of the project management expertise in the private sector. In that regard, I have asked the Commissioner to submit proposals for a revised tender document for the eleven locations in the remaining two phases, with a view to achieving implementation in priority locations by the end of 2006.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_6534">I propose to take Questions Nos. 657, 658 and 681 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6535">In my statement to the Dáil during the Adjournment Debate on Tuesday, 22 March 2005, I outlined the basis for the deportation of the person concerned and in my statement in the Seanad Adjournment Debate on Thursday, 24 March 2005, I outlined the basis for my decision to allow the person return.</p>
            <p eId="para_6536">The proposal put to me to deport this person was made in the belief of the proposing immigration service official that the order when made would not be implemented before June, when the young man in question would be sitting the leaving certificate examination for which he had been studying at Palmerstown community school since September 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_6537">As is the usual practice in relation to persons in respect of whom deportation orders are made, this person was instructed to present himself to the Garda national immigration bureau, GNIB, on 3 March 2005. He did not do so and was classified as an evader. He subsequently presented himself at GNIB on the day of a deportation flight, rather than on the earlier date specified in a letter written to him. He was, therefore, both arrested as an evader and deported by different officials acting in good faith. The assumption that he would not be deported before June was simply not acted on. So while the deportation was authorised, its actual timing was unfortunate and I reached the view that for me to leave matters stand in those unusual circumstances was inappropriate. The person concerned subsequently returned to Ireland and was assisted to do so by the Irish embassy in Nigeria.</p>
            <p eId="para_6538">It should be made clear that in respect of every person who has no legal entitlement to remain in the State, including those who have had their applications for asylum refused after consideration by two independent bodies, a letter issues under the terms of section 3(3) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, informing him or her of the Minister's intention to deport. The person is allowed 15 days in which to opt for one of the following: make representations to the Minister setting out the reasons he or she should not be deported, that is, be allowed to remain temporarily in the State; leave the State before an order is made; or consent to the making of a deportation order.</p>
            <p eId="para_6539">If a person opts to return voluntarily, assistance will be provided, including by way of special programmes established in cooperation with the International Organisation for Migration, IOM. For the three-year period up to 31 December 2004, a total of 1,879 voluntary returns have been facilitated by the IOM and my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_6540">If a person opts to make representations as to why he or she should not be deported, a range of factors must be taken into account in deciding the matter. The specific legislative provisions are 11 factors, including humanitarian considerations, as set out in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996. Section 5 forbids the sending of a person in any manner whatsoever to a place where the life or freedom of the person would be threatened on account of that person's race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. I have seen reports that the person in question was mugged and assaulted in Nigeria but I am unable to comment on the veracity of those claims. This <i>refoulement </i>provision does not mean that persons may not be returned to countries which would have inferior welfare, educational and health services to ours.</p>
            <p eId="para_6541">The deportation order in this case was made in full accordance with the above legal provisions. I do not understand the reference in the question to the person concerned being a high risk. He was not made the subject of a deportation on that basis nor did the Garda treat him as such. I accept the account of the Garda that its officers offered to escort him to his home to collect his belongings, which he declined. Furthermore, I accept that the officers did not see any adult on the charter flight wearing clothes which could be described as a school uniform. The Nigerian embassy issued a travel document in respect of this person to enable him re-enter Nigeria and, following the revocation of the deportation order against him, he was able to acquire a Nigerian passport allowing him return to Ireland.</p>

            <p eId="para_6567">The person concerned and her son, both of whom are Nigerian nationals, arrived in the State on 15 June 1998 and applied for asylum. Their claim for refugee status was considered under the process then applicable and was refused by the asylum division of my Department. They were notified of the decision on 10 December 1999. The applicants then appealed this decision to the appropriate body at the time, the appeals authority, which affirmed the decision of the asylum division. They were notified of this decision on 10 November 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_6568">In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, the persons concerned were informed on 14 November 2001 that the Minister proposed to make deportation orders in respect of them. They were, in accordance with the Act, given the options of making representations within 15 working days setting out the reasons they should not be deported, that is, be allowed to remain temporarily in the State, leaving the State before the deportation orders were made, or consenting to the making of deportation orders. Representations setting out reasons they should not be deported were subsequently received.</p>
            <p eId="para_6569">I expect the case file in this matter to be submitted to me shortly for decision. This decision will be taken having regard to considerations specified in section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended. These considerations include matters relating to the common good, the person's family and domestic circumstances, as well as humanitarian considerations. Consideration will also be given to the prohibition of <i>refoulement</i> which is contained in section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended. As no final decision has been reached on these persons’ application for leave to remain in the State, the issue of their eligibility for citizenship does not arise.</p>

            <p eId="para_6573">The Garda national immigration bureau removed a total of 35 Nigerian nationals on a charter flight to Lagos on the night of 14 to 15 March 2005. The persons concerned were mainly former asylum seekers who had their claims for refugee status refused after full consideration by one or both of the two independent statutory offices established to consider such applications, that is, the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.</p>
            <p eId="para_6574">Their cases were further considered individually under section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and section 5, prohibition of <i>refoulement</i>, of the Refugee Act 1996, before deportation orders were made in respect of each. Eleven factors, including length of time spent in the State, were considered under section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, in arriving at the decision to deport.</p>
            <p eId="para_6575">As I have previously informed the House, a deportation process, after a person's case has been dealt with fairly, is central to the proper running of any immigration and asylum system. This fact is recognised the world over by bodies such as the United Nations High Commission for Refugees, UNHCR. The Government has two basic options whereby we can operate an open door policy where anyone can come to Ireland without restrictions or we can legislate for procedures to control who can or cannot reside in our country. Since the foundation of the State, successive Governments have chosen to do the latter. This is in line with the practice of every other country in the world. I am not aware of a country which does not have immigration controls and which does not have at its disposal the final sanction of deportation.</p>

            <p eId="para_6597">This represents a total increase of 92 in the number of gardaí policing the areas in question between 31 January 1997 and 1 January 2005. The information requested in respect of the number of gardaí serving in these areas on January 1st 1997, is not readily available and can only be obtained by the expenditure of a disproportionate amount of Garda time and resources relative to the information sought. For comparative purposes, therefore, the figures given relate to January 31 1997 and January 1 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_6598">As regards Garda resources generally, I am pleased the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the commitment in An Agreed Programme for Government in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</p>
            <p eId="para_6599">The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of Lucan, Clondalkin, Rathcoole and Tallaght Garda stations will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. One thing I have already promised is that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</p>

The specific circumstances outlined by the Deputy are addressed at regulation 5(1)(<i>d</i>), which sets out that the applicant must have the necessary educational qualifications by 1 September of the year in which the competition is advertised.

            <p eId="para_6621">Entry to the Garda Síochána is governed by the Garda Síochána (Admissions and Appointments) Regulations 1988 as amended. With regard to the educational requirement in respect of the Irish language, the minimum requirement is to have obtained a grade not lower than C3 at foundation level or a grade not lower than D3 at a level other than foundation level in the leaving certificate examination of the Department of Education and Science or the leaving certificate vocational programme examination of that Department or must have obtained at least an equivalent grade in another examination. I might direct the Deputy to regulation 5(1) of the 1988 regulations, as amended, for a more comprehensive outline of these educational requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_6622">In the light of the Government's decision to approve my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000, I have asked the Garda Commissioner to review the eligibility criteria for entry to the Garda Síochána. I believe this is an opportune moment to ensure that the criteria for entry meet the needs of the Garda Síochána and the society it serves.</p>
            <p eId="para_6623">One particular aspect which the Commissioner has already studied is the maximum age of entry to the Garda Síochána. On foot of this the Government approved the commissioner's proposal to increase the maximum age of entry to the Garda Síochána from 26 years of age to 35 years of age. This is reflected in the most recent Garda recruitment campaign. There have been no other changes made to the eligibility criteria for entry to the Garda Síochána as far as the current competition is concerned. The educational requirements with regard to the Irish language remain in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_6624">However, I am of the belief that future intakes of recruits to the Garda Síochána should as far as possible reflect the composition of Irish society, and am anxious to see if there are any possible changes to the existing criteria which might facilitate recruitment from different ethnic backgrounds in our community. With this in mind I have asked the Commissioner, as part of his overall review of the entry requirements for the Garda Síochána, to examine whether any of the existing eligibility criteria militate, however indirectly, against the recruitment of members from ethnic communities in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_6625">One of the eligibility criteria which would benefit from review in this regard is the requirement for entrants to have an educational qualification in Irish — a matter which, of course, is of particular relevance not only to potential applicants from different ethnic backgrounds but to all those who did not receive their schooling within the Irish educational system.</p>
            <p eId="para_6626">I should, however, add that, notwithstanding whatever new arrangements might be put in place in this regard in the future, my position is that Irish will continue to have an important place in the Garda Síochána — in line with its constitutional status as the first official language of the State — and that everyone who wishes to must be able to communicate with the force through our native language. In this regard, the Garda Síochána has a strong commitment to delivering a service through Irish. Indeed, proficiency in Irish is strongly promoted within the force, and that will continue to be the case.</p>

            <p eId="para_6628">I made an official visit to Argentina from 14 to 20 March for the St Patrick's Day celebrations. I assure the Deputy that, in line with Government Policy, I took full advantage of my visit to Argentina to promote Ireland as a modern, democratic State, an attractive tourist destination and a country with a vibrant economy that offers attractive business opportunities. I also availed of the opportunity to explain ongoing developments in regard to the peace process in Northern Ireland. Highlights of my trip included: an address on modern Ireland to the Centro Argentino de Relaciones Internacionales; a meeting at the presidential palace with the Argentine Minister for the Interior, Senor Anibal Fernández; I hosted a lunch for significant Argentine opinion makers including academic, judicial, legal and human rights figures; I attended a meeting with the Irish community of San Antonio de Areco outside Buenos Aires hosted by Mr. Kevin Farrell, President of the Federation of Irish Societies in Argentina and Irish priest, Father Tom O'Donnell; I was guest of honour at the St Patrick's Day reception in Buenos Aires hosted by our Ambassador, Ken Thompson, for members of the expatriate Irish community and leading figures in Argentine cultural and business life, whom I addressed on behalf of the Irish Government and people; I rep-resented the Government at an homage to General Jose de San Martin, founder of the Argentine nation, organised by the Argentine Ministry of Defence; I attended as guest of honour the wreath-laying ceremony organised by the Argentine navy at Admiral Brown's monument, where I addressed the attendance as the representative of the Government; I attended a St. Patrick's Day Mass in the Holy Cross Parish Church, Buenos Aires, followed by a reception hosted by the Federation of Irish Societies, at which I addressed the guests; and I visited a Development Co-operation Ireland funded NGO project in Oberá, northern Argentina, which provides a home for handicapped and abandoned children. I also visited a nearby home for the elderly, also supported by Development Co-operation Ireland. Both of the latter projects are managed by Father Liam Hayes SMA, who as well as securing support from Development Co-operation Ireland over the years, has an extensive Irish support network.</p>
            <p eId="para_6629">Throughout the visit and on the margins of the official functions I attended, I took every possible opportunity to meet informally with members of the Irish community and influential personalities in Argentine business and official life, to promote Ireland and explore areas of mutual interest. I also gave interviews to several journalists and these were carried on local radio and TV, in the prestigious <i>La Prenza, </i>Argentina’s newspaper of record, as well as the English language daily papers in Buenos Aires.</p>
            <p eId="para_6630">There were seven persons in total in the official party, which included myself, the Secretary General of my Department, our respective spouses, my programme delivery manager, press officer and private secretary. I can confirm that the total cost of the scheduled business flight involved was €35,147.07. The figures relating to the other costs incurred are not yet to hand.</p>

            <p eId="para_6675">It is difficult to estimate a mean average waiting time for appeals to remain in the State on humanitarian grounds following a refusal of a claim for refugee status. In the context of proposed deportation orders under the Immigration Act 1999, the issue of leave to remain on humanitarian grounds is considered, irrespective of whether an application is made or not. Thus, no statistics are retained on the number of such applications made. Others subsequently received permission to remain on other grounds e.g. marriage to Irish or EU national. Further, it is believed that a significant number of persons who were refused refugee status are entitled to claim residency under the scheme announced by me in January, 2005 in respect of parents of Irish born children born before 1 January 2005. The closing date for this scheme was 31 March 2005 and just under 18,000 applications have been received.

            <p eId="para_6677">Regarding the efficiency, transparency and fairness of the asylum process, since 2000 the Government has established a comprehensive legislative and organisational framework for the processing of asylum applications. This includes the enactment of the Immigration Act 2003, amending the Refugee Act 1996, to streamline the asylum determination process so as to ensure that those genuinely in need of refugee protection receive that protection more quickly and to deal in a more robust manner with unfounded applications for refugee status. It also includes the establishment of three separate offices to deal with all aspects of asylum applications from initial decision to appeal and to co ordinate accommodation and other support needs of asylum seekers. The offices in question are the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the Reception and Integration Agency. In addition, the Refugee Legal Service has been set up to provide legal advice to asylum applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_6678">Other services provided to underpin the efficiency, transparency and fairness of our asylum process include comprehensive translation and interpretation services, staff training overseen by the UNHCR and country of origin research supported, as required, by the refugee documentation centre.</p>
            <p eId="para_6679">The operation of the repatriation process is governed by the Immigration Act 1999 which was further amended by the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000 in respect of the arrest, detention and removal of non-nationals.</p>
            <p eId="para_6680">Overall, in the region of €375 million was spent on asylum related services in 2004 a small proportion of which also relates to services provided for non-nationals. This figure was compiled following consultations with a range of Departments and offices which provide services to asylum seekers, namely, the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform — including the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, the Reception and Integration Agency and the Refugee Legal Service — the Department of Social and Family Affairs, Health and Children and Education and Science, the Office of Public Works and the Office of the Chief State Solicitor.</p>
            <p eId="para_6681">However, it still remains a fact that over 90% of the applicants for asylum, after a fair and transparent determination process, are found not to be in need of refugee protection. Arising from the substantial level of investment which I have just outlined, significant progress has been made in the area of asylum processing over recent years. The progress made to date is illustrated by both the general reduction in processing timescales in the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and the substantial reduction in the number of asylum applications on hands.</p>
            <p eId="para_6682">In terms of timescales for processing asylum applications, I would point out that on 24 January 2005, I announced new arrangements for the speedier processing of prioritised applications which were implemented with effect from 25 January. The new arrangements apply in the main to nationals of Nigeria, Romania, Bulgaria, Croatia and South Africa. At present, these applications comprise some 54% of all applications. These new arrangements include the reduction of processing timescales both at the initial stage in ORAC from six weeks to approximately three weeks, and for appeal determinations in RAT from an average of five weeks to three weeks. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that as the operation of the new arrangements has progressed, these anticipated processing timescales have in fact been reduced with an ORAC decision being made within an average of 13 working days and a decision of the RAT issuing within 6.3 working days.</p>
            <p eId="para_6683">For other cases, the typical processing time in the ORAC is in the region of six months. The average length of time taken to process and complete substantive appeals in the RAT is approximately 16 weeks and appeals which are determined on the basis of papers alone are completed in five to six weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_6684">As regards cases on hand, I can inform the Deputy that only 900 cases are in the asylum system for more than six months. This can be contrasted with the fact that there were some 6,500 cases over six months in the system in September 2001 and that some 25,000 asylum applications have been received in total in the State since January 2002. We can be justifiably proud of this result.</p>
            <p eId="para_6685">Since April 2000, over 36,000 applicants have been accommodated directly by the State under direct provision arrangements. Almost 700 staff has been recruited across the asylum and immigration system, representing the biggest influx of staff in any area of the civil service in decades.</p>
            <p eId="para_6686">The installation of a new and improved management information system in the repatriation unit of my Department is nearing completion. When fully up and running this will facilitate better tracking and management of repatriation cases. In the case of the processing of applications covered by the accelerated asylum arrangements to which I have just referred, a processing time of eight weeks is in place from the receipt of a negative decision on refugee status to the point of determining whether the person should be deported or granted temporary leave to remain in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_6687">Despite some uninformed criticism of the asylum and immigration systems, I am satisfied that our system of determination compares favourably with the best in the world in terms of fairness, decision making, determination structures and support services. I believe that the vast majority of people recognise this and have confidence in the system. The system is also subject to due process and the supervision of courts. It is open to a person to challenge a negative decision any way along the process by way of an application for judicial review to the High Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_6688">I have indicated on a number of occasions recently that I propose to produce a discussion paper on immigration legislation in preparation for the proposed immigration and residence Bill which I intend to publish later this year. As the Deputy will by now be aware, the discussion document has just today been published. Copies of the document have already been circulated to all of the Members of the Oireachtas.</p>

            <p eId="para_6692">I understand from the programme appraisal committee consideration of the application that as the project is in close proximity to another child care facility which had already received funding under the EOCP, that the proposal raised issues around possible duplication of services.</p>

Following this reassessment, a recommendation will be submitted to the PAC again for consideration.

            <p eId="para_6706">I understand that an application for capital grant assistance under the equal opportunities child care programme, EOCP, 2000-06, was submitted by the group to my Department in March 2004. The EOCP is a seven-year development programme which aims to increase the availability and quality of child care to support parents in employment, education and training. As the Deputy may be aware, the group in question has received staffing grant assistance of over €51,000 from the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_6707">The level of demand for capital grant assistance was such that I considered it important to increase the capital provision for the present programme. Following discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, an additional capital provision of €90 million was made available over the period 2005-09, in the context of the 2005 budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_6708">Of this amount, €50 million is being made available under the present programme and the remaining €40 million will flow under the next phase of the post 2006 EOCP. This augments the increased EU funding of some €12 million made available last year in recognition of the progress of the programme. This brings the total funding available for the programme to €499.3 million and now includes an increased provision for capital developments for which €205 million has been set aside. Since budget 2005, I have announced a record allocation totalling almost €68 million in capital funding to community based not for profit groups, in two tranches, one in December 2004 and another on 4 March 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_6709">The availability of the additional capital funding will enable me to make further capital grant assistance available to groups which address significant child care service gaps and where the project proposal represents good value for money when considered in respect of the current guidelines on building costs. In the light of this, the group in question was advised in December 2004, that whilst their project had not been prioritised for immediate funding at that stage, it will be reconsidered in the future. I hope to make further significant capital commitments during the remainder of 2005 and thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_6710">The ongoing assessment of the applications in the pipeline will be concluded as speedily as possible to facilitate the development of additional child care facilities and places at the earliest opportunity. When the assessment on the project in question is completed, the application will then be considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, before I make a final decision. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on this application.</p>

            <p eId="para_6722">I understand an application for capital grant assistance under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme, EOCP, 2000-2006, was submitted by the group to my Department some time ago. The EOCP is a seven year development programme which aims to increase the availability and quality of child care to support parents in employment, education and training.</p>
            <p eId="para_6723">The level of demand for capital grant assistance was such that I considered it important to increase the capital provision for the present programme. Following discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Finance, an additional capital provision of €90 million was made available over the period 2005-09, in the context of the 2005 budget.</p>
            <p eId="para_6724">Of this amount, €50 million is being made available under the present programme and the remaining €40 million will flow under the next phase of the post 2006 EOCP. This augments the increased EU funding of some €12 million made available last year in recognition of the progress of the programme. This brings the total funding available for the programme to €499.3 million and now includes an increased provision for capital developments for which €205 million has been set aside. Since budget 2005, I have announced a record allocation totalling almost €68 million in capital funding to community based not for profit groups, in two tranches, one in December 2004 and another on 4 March 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_6725">The availability of the additional capital funding will enable me to make further capital grant assistance available to groups which address significant child care service gaps and where the project proposal represents good value for money when considered in relation to the current guidelines on building costs. In the light of this, the group in question was advised in December 2004, that whilst its project had not been prioritised for immediate funding at that stage, it will be reconsidered in the future. I hope to make further significant capital commitments during the remainder of 2005 and thereafter.</p>
            <p eId="para_6726">The ongoing assessment of the applications in the pipeline will be concluded as speedily as possible to facilitate the development of additional childcare facilities and places at the earliest opportunity. When the assessment on the project in question is completed, the application will then be considered by the programme appraisal committee, chaired by my Department, before I make a final decision. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on this application.</p>

            <p eId="para_6749">I propose to take Questions Nos. 695 and 697 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6750">The applications referred to by the Deputy in his parliamentary questions were for the purposes of allowing the wife and brother of a non-EEA national employed in the State under the employment permit scheme to travel to the State to reside with him.</p>
            <p eId="para_6751">My department refused both applications at initial stage on 4 November 2004. The applicants are already aware of the reasons for refusal as written notification was sent by post on 16 February 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_6752">The first application related to the wife of the non-EEA national resident in the State. When assessing applications of this type, the visa officer will consider, amongst other factors, whether the level of salary of the worker would come within the ambit of qualifying for payment from public funds. The visa officer will expect to see sufficient evidence of the financial status of the applicant in the form of several payslips and detailed bank statements covering, at a minimum, a two to three month period. The documentation supplied should demonstrate a consistent financial history and evidence of regular income. This application was refused as the visa officer concluded that insufficient evidence had been supplied. Specifically, it was noted that two to three detailed payslips should be submitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_6753">The second application related to the younger brother of the non-EEA national already resident in the State. General policy provisions governing family reunification for employment permit holders do not extend to adult brothers or sisters of the person in question. Therefore, this application had to be considered in the context of a standard visit visa application. Accordingly, the information on the application form filled in by the applicant, indicating his intention to stay in the State on a long-term or permanent basis was a key consideration. In assessing this type of application, the visa officer will have regard to the information provided in the application and to such factors as the applicant's ties and general circumstances in their country of origin and their immigration history, as well as the relative attractiveness and feasibility of their remaining in the State. The Department's approach in these matters is informed by past experience, including experience of abuse of the system. This application was refused as it was felt that the applicant had not sufficiently demonstrated his intentions to return home to his country of origin.</p>
            <p eId="para_6754">Appeals were received by my Department in respect of both applications on 1 March 2005. However the visa appeals officer was unable to conclude that the initial decisions to refuse the visas should be overturned. Consequently the applications were refused on appeal on 14 March 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_6756">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that it is proposed to induct 1,100 Garda recruits to the Garda college in 2005, consisting of four intakes of 275 recruits.</p>
            <p eId="para_6757">The first of these four intakes — 275 — commenced training on the week commencing 7 February, 2005. The remaining three intakes of 275 recruits are scheduled to commence training on 3 May 2005, 2 August 2005 and 7 November 2005. It is estimated that 523 Garda trainees will become attested members of the force in 2005. Current projections indicate that the total strength of the Garda Síochána as at 31 December 2005 will be 12,299 ,all ranks. Taking into account the projected number of retirements, the new recruitment drive will lead to a combined organisational strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 as early as end 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_6758">The commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. Clearly the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. One thing I have already promised is that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into front line, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</p>

            <p eId="para_6907">I propose to take Questions Nos. 701 and 774 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_6908">I am informed by the Garda authorities that applications for Garda CCTV systems in both Ardee and Drogheda have been received by the CCTV advisory committee. This committee was established by the Garda commissioner to advise on all matters relating to CCTV systems. These applications are currently under consideration by the advisory committee along with applications from other cities and towns throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_6909">It should be noted that there are already 17 CCTV schemes nationwide which are either at installation, tender or planning stages. This expansion is being implemented on a phased basis as follows: Phase 1 — Bray, Dundalk, Dun Laoghaire, Finglas, Galway and Limerick Phase 2 — Athlone, Clondalkin, Tallaght and Waterford Phase 3 — Ballyfermot, Carlow, Castlebar, Clonmel, Ennis, Kilkenny and Sligo. Phase 1 has been completed in five of the six locations.</p>
            <p eId="para_6910">Installation of the CCTV systems is of necessity a detailed, complex and lengthy process. The Garda authorities are giving careful consideration to a restructuring of the manner in which these Garda CCTV systems go to tender. I am anxious to accelerate the implementation of the remaining CCTV programme and reduce as far as possible the workload of the Garda Síochána in this regard. The proposed redesign of the tender document provides an opportunity to outsource the installation of Garda CCTV systems to the greatest possible extent, making use not only of the technical but of the project management expertise in the private sector. To that end, I have asked the commissioner to submit proposals for a revised tender document for the 11 locations in the remaining two phases, with a view to achieving implementation in priority locations by the end of 2006. The inclusion of other town centre locations in the programme of Garda CCTV systems will be considered in the context of the commissioner's proposals.</p>

This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</p>
            <p eId="para_6944">The Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of Drogheda, Dundalk and Ardee Garda stations will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country. Clearly, the additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda Traffic Corps. One thing I have already promised is that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into front line, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</p>

            <p eId="para_6986">I am not aware of any minor under the age of 18 years who was deported from the State unaccompanied by either a parent or older guardian. When families are being deported every effort is made to maintain the family unit. However, there have been instances where parents have chosen not to take their children with them when being deported. In such instances, the Garda National Immigration Bureau inform the local area Health Service Executive of the situation. Statistics are not kept with regard to the numbers of minors left behind in the State after their parents are deported.</p>
            <p eId="para_6987">On the issue of children who are residents of the State being in receipt of deportation orders, I take it the Deputy is referring to Irish-born citizen children. If this is the case, deportation orders cannot, and are not, issued in respect of such children.</p>

            <p eId="para_6993">Employment in the Civil Service is governed by a particular legal framework with well-defined procedures and practices. The Civil Service Regulation Act 1956 sets out the terms and conditions upon which civil servants are appointed. It also distinguishes between an established civil servant and an unestablished civil servant. Pension terms flow from the employment status of the employee. Established civil servants have access to the superannuation scheme for established civil servants. Unestablished civil servants have access to the non-contributory pension scheme for non-established state employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_6994">An employee cannot be made a permanent established civil servant unless he or she fulfils the requirements for establishment. For practical reasons certain civil service grades are recruited at local level rather than by an open competition run by the Public Appointments Service. This is the case for a number of grades working in the Garda organisation, such as the cleaners referred to by the Deputy. These staff are employed as unestablished civil servants. However, competitions have been held from time to time at which officers who are serving in an unestablished capacity and who fulfil the eligibility requirements for the competition may compete for establishment. The Public Appointments Service is currently holding such a competition to assess candidates' suitability for establishment.</p>

            <p eId="para_7003">The person referred to by the Deputy is a non-EEA national employed in the State under the employment permit scheme. The general rule in these cases is that the worker may be joined by his or her spouse and dependent children once the worker has completed one year's service with his or her employer and has been offered a contract for a further year.

            <p eId="para_7007">The application for a re-entry visa referred to by the Deputy was refused by my Department at initial stage on 10 January 2005. When assessing the application, the visa officer noted that the applicant's permission to remain in the State was due to expire shortly thereafter, on 21 February 2005. Consequently, as it would not have been appropriate to grant a re-entry visa in this case, the application was refused on grounds of immigration history, IH.</p>
            <p eId="para_7008">An appeal was subsequently received in respect of the application in question. However, based on the additional documentation supplied, the visa appeals officer was unable to conclude that the initial decision should be overturned. Consequently, the application was refused on appeal on 30 March 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_7009">If the applicant has, in the interim, applied successfully for an extension of her permission to remain in the State, then it is open to her to submit a fresh application for a re-entry visa via the Department of Foreign Affairs.</p>

            <p eId="para_7011">The level of judicial resources is kept under continuous review. As the Deputy may be aware, the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 increased by two the statutory maximum number of District Court judges. The total number of posts is now 55. A vacancy exists by virtue of the retirement of a judge of the District Court on 3 April 2005 and arrangements are in hand to request the Government to nominate a successor.</p>

            <p eId="para_7013">A significant number of psychologists have been appointed to the Irish Prison Service in recent months and this recruitment process is not yet complete. By June of 2005 there will be 14 psychologists working in the Irish Prison Service and, with these increased resources, the psychology service will be better placed to meet the complex and diverse needs of the Irish Prison Service for psychological services.</p>
            <p eId="para_7014">As a result of this recruitment process, there are now five psychologists assigned to the Mountjoy Complex. This figure is comprised of two psychologists, including a senior psychologist, assigned to the male Prison, one psychologist assigned to the Dóchas Centre, one psychologist assigned to St. Patrick's Institution and one psychologist who was due to take up her appointment in the training unit today.</p>
            <p eId="para_7015">There is one senior psychologist assigned to Wheatfield Prison. There is also a psychologist assigned to Cloverhill Prison who will also undertake some clinics in Wheatfield Prison. A range of interventions for prisoners with addictions, including addiction counselling, are provided by the medical, psychology and probation and welfare services and the many community and voluntary organisations operating in the prison system. With regard to the appointment of dedicated addiction counsellors, the position is that a joint committee, comprising representatives of the Prison Service and the Health Service Executive, are currently exploring contractual arrangements for an external service provider to provide an enhanced counselling service in prisons and it is envisaged that a tender competition will be held in the near future.</p>

The base year for these targets is 2000. Heroin seizures increased by 13% between 2000 and 2003. The data also shows significant increases in the volumes of cannabis and stimulant drugs seized. The latter include cocaine, amphetamines and ecstasy. Between 2000 and 2003 seizures of these drugs increased by 497%, 1069% and 132%, respectively. The Garda remain fully committed to further increases in drugs seizures for the remaining period of the national drugs strategy.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_7096">I propose to take Questions Nos. 726 and 727 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7097">The Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000-2006, EOCP, is a central pillar in the Government's child care strategy and is intended to increase the availability and quality of child care supports for parents in employment, education or training. The programme is funded by the Exchequer and the European Union Structural Funds as part of the regional operational programmes of the national development plan. The programme provides for capital grants to create and enhance new or existing child care facilities, multiannual staffing grants to community-based not-for-profit groups who provide child care services for disadvantaged families and a range of grants to support the enhancement of quality for the child care sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_7098">Considerable progress has already been achieved in terms of increasing the number of child care facilities and places available, as well as increasing the number of people employed directly in child care facilities and the programme is now ahead of and will exceed its targets.</p>
            <p eId="para_7099">I understand the data relating to the programme is not readily available on an annual basis as requested by the Deputy due to the roll-over ongoing nature of the programme, which is a seven year strategy. However, I have been informed that provisional figures to the end of 2004 indicate that 24,636 child care places have already been created in new and existing child care facilities, in addition to the 21,000 existing places also receiving staffing grant support under the programme, and that 2,213 child care staff, working directly with children in disadvantaged areas, have been supported under the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_7100">I also bring to the Deputy's attention a comprehensive review of progress under the Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme 2000 — 2006 entitled <i>Developing Childcare In Ireland</i> which was published by my Department during the summer of 2004. This document was circulated to all members of the Oireachtas and was also posted on the Department’s web site. A wealth of useful information on the development of child care, up to the end of 2003, is included in this report. It is intended in future to update these statistics periodically. The first such update, which will cover the period up to end of 2004, is expected to become available over the summer of 2005 and will be posted on the Department’s web site as well as being circulated to interested parties, including members of the Oireachtas.</p>
            <p eId="para_7101">The table details the outturn for capital and current expenditure for the child care measures of my Department for the five year period between 2000 to 2004 and the estimate for 2005:</p>

            <p eId="para_7128">It may interest the Deputy to know that since it was launched in 2000, funding for the programme for the 2000-06 period has increased from €318 million to €499.3 million or by 57%, the most recent increase being an additional €50 million announced in the 2005 budget under the capital investment framework to 2007. A further €40 million in additional funding for the period from the end of the national development plan to 2009 was also included in the budget announcement.</p>

Her subsequent appeal was refused by the office of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and she was notified of this recommendation by letter of 17 February 2004. In accordance with section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, the person concerned was informed on 20 May 2004 that the Minister proposed to make a deportation order in respect of her. She was, in accordance with the Act, informed of the three options open to her at that point. She could leave the State voluntarily before the Minister decided whether to make a deportation in respect of her, consent to the making of a deportation order in respect of her or make written representations to the Minister setting out reasons she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_7818">Her case was examined under section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 and section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (Prohibition of Refoulement) including consideration of all representations received on her behalf.

The order was served by registered post and she presented herself to the Garda National Immigration Bureau on Thursday 7 April 2005 so that travel arrangements could be put in place to effect her removal from the State. She has been requested to again attend the Garda National Immigration Bureau on 27 April 2005. The enforcement of the deportation order is a matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau.</p>

        [10753/05]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_877">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_7822">There is an extensive set of criteria applied when assessing any visa application. These criteria depend to a large extent on the context in which the application is made, the personal circumstances of the applicant and the nature and purpose of the application. Government policy of the day will also have an influence on the assessment of applications falling into specific categories. There is no provision in Irish law for granting a visa to a person purely on the basis of parentage of a spouse of an Irish national. Therefore, a person in that situation applying for a visa, will have his or her application processed in accordance with the standard procedure. The central tenet of the visa application system in this State is that the onus is at all times on the applicant to satisfy my Department that it would be appropriate to grant them a visa. Credibility is key and, not surprisingly, inconsistencies on the application form or in the supporting documentation may result in a refusal. Applicants are expected to submit suitable levels of documentation appropriate to their circumstances and the purpose of their proposed trip.</p>
            <p eId="para_7823">Likewise inconsistencies or questions that arise with regard to an applicant's immigration history or the immigration status of a named reference in Ireland, will similarly result in a refusal, unless the Department's concerns are adequately addressed. Prior visa refusals, while not automatically leading to the refusal of a subsequent application, will be a consideration. It has been the long-standing practice that an applicant is notified as soon as possible after a decision has been made on their application, whether it be a decision to grant or a decision to refuse. This decision is communicated to the applicant via our colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and their overseas missions. This method ensures the most timely and efficient means of informing applicants of a decision. If the application has been refused, the applicant is invited to submit a request in writing for the reasons for refusal, at which time my Department will supply him or her, in writing, with the reasons for refusal to enable them to address the identified shortcomings at appeal stage. This is the normal process that most applicants would be expected to follow.</p>
            <p eId="para_7824">Due to administrative and technical constraints and the sheer number of embassies, consulates and missions involved throughout the globe, it has not been possible in the past to operate a system whereby applicants are automatically notified of the reasons for refusal with the notification of the decision. To do so would have required ongoing, extensive manual exercises which would detract from the efficiency of the visa system in general. However, recent developments and significantly increased resources have enabled officials in both my Department and that of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to jointly develop a proposal for a system to facilitate the inclusion of the reasons for refusal, if they apply, on the decision letter that is currently issued to an applicant. I am informed that this system is currently in the implementation stage and it is expected that reasons for refusal will be automatically included on decision letters in the very near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_7825">With regard to the specific reasons for refusal of the applications in question, in both cases, the visa officer could not reasonably be satisfied on the basis of the documentation supplied to my Department that the applicants would observe the conditions of the visas applied for. In particular, it was felt that the applicants had not displayed evidence of their obligations to return home following the proposed visit. Additionally, it was noted that in both cases, no evidence of finances was supplied. The stated means of support recorded on the applications was "own funds", however I am informed that none of the required two to three payslips or a detailed bank statement covering a two to three month period, were supplied. Finally, in the case of one of the applications, No. 1340006, it was noted that duly notarised official translations of certain documents were not supplied. Consequently, this application was refused on grounds of insufficient documentation in addition to the reasons listed above that were common to both applications.</p>
            <p eId="para_7826">It is open to the applicants to appeal the refusal decisions, by writing to the visa appeals officer of my Department within two months of the date of receipt of their decision letter. Any appeal should be accompanied by additional documentation designed to address the reasons for refusal outlined and with regard to the criteria previously explained.</p>

In August 2001, the group in question was awarded a staffing grant of €126,974, over three years under the EOCP. On 20 January 2005, the group was approved staffing continuation funding of €24,689 up to 31 August 2005. All funding approvals are subject to the conclusion of a contractual agreement with Area Development Management limited, ADM, which administers the grants on my behalf.</p>
            <p eId="para_7833">I understand that ADM was in dialogue with the group on the conditions which must be met on operating hours each day and weeks per year before a contract is finalised. These discussions have concluded and ADM has informed the group that its existing level of staffing grant assistance will be continued up to 31 August 2005 subject to the group maintaining its forecast levels of service and meeting the associated conditions.</p>

            <p eId="para_7869">The Schengen convention provides for the abolition of checks at the borders of participating states and for the development of enhanced co-operation on law enforcement matters and judicial co-operation. Ireland has successfully applied to operate the elements of the Schengen arrangements which are not concerned with the abolition of border controls. Ireland has not, however, sought to participate in the border control element of the Schengen arrangements as to do so would be inconsistent with the maintenance of the common travel area between Ireland and the United Kingdom. The common travel area could not continue to function if Ireland were to remove border controls with Schengen states generally if the United Kingdom did not do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_7877">I propose to take Questions Nos. 746, 747, 748, 753, 754 and 755 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_7878">As the Deputy may be aware, I recently signed the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002 (Register of Reserved Judgments) Regulations 2005, which came into effect on 31 March 2005. The regulations provide for the establishment and maintenance on computer by the Courts Service of a register of the judgments reserved by the Supreme Court, the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court. They set out where the various parts of the register are to be kept, the arrangements for getting a copy of an entry in the register and other relevant matters.</p>
            <p eId="para_7879">The information to be kept in the register includes the date on which judgment was reserved; the court before which the proceedings were heard and the name or names of the judge or judges concerned and, if the court is the District Court or the Circuit Court, the area or place where the judgment was reserved; the title of the proceedings or the nature of the proceedings; the relevant number of the proceedings; where relevant, the date or dates on which the proceedings were listed under section 46(3) of the Courts and Court Officers Act 2002; where relevant, the date specified under section 46(4), on which the judgment is to be delivered; and the date on which the judgment is delivered.</p>
            <p eId="para_7880">The Deputy has referred to the practice in the UK of giving judges time off to write up their judgments. In this jurisdiction, the allocation of judges and their caseloads is a matter for the President of the Court and, as Minister, I have no function in the matter. The issue of judicial resources is kept under continuous review. As the Deputy may be aware, the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 increased the statutory maximum number of judges by eight in total providing three in both the High Court and Circuit Court and two in the District Court. The number of judicial posts as of 31 December 2003 was 122. There are now 130 judicial posts.</p>
            <p eId="para_7881">The Deputy requested statistics on reserved judgments. Under the Courts Service Act 1998, the Courts Service is independent in the performance of its functions, which include the provision of statistics. As Minister, I therefore have no function in the matter. In relation to the Deputy's question on the number of times the State has been sued over the delays in the issuing of reserved judgments, information has not been compiled in such a way to readily provide the information sought. However, I am aware of four cases in which the State was sued in the European Court of Human Rights in recent years over the delays in the issuing of reserved judgments.</p>

            <p eId="para_7951">On 10 March, residents in Athlone who were identified as suitable for transfer to self-catering were offered a transfer so as to facilitate refurbishment of the mobile homes on site. When the transfer offer was made, it was not possible to advise the residents of the location of the new accommodation as the RIA was in negotiation with proprietors of self-catering accommodation in various areas of the country and no contracts were yet in place. Subsequently, a contract was agreed between the RIA and the proprietor of Carroll Village which commenced on 29 March 2005 and residents who wished to move to Dundalk were facilitated. In accordance with normal practice, the RIA liaises with local agencies as required so as to support asylum seekers as they settle into new communities.</p>

It is not intended that the EOCP funding will meet the full costs of running a service.</p>
            <p eId="para_7957">Every consideration is given to all applications when they are being assessed for funding. Applications for staffing funding undergo a thorough assessment by Area Development Management Limited, ADM, which has been engaged by my Department to carry out the day-to-day administration of the EOCP grants. Following this assessment all applications are then considered by the programme appraisal committee, which is chaired by my Department, before I make a final decision in regard to funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_7958">The criteria used during the assessment and appraisal of all applications for staffing grant assistance includes the socio-economic and demographic profile of the area; the quality of the proposal; the capacity of the group to implement the project; the level of integration and co-ordination; and if the proposal represents value for money. The level of funding will not normally exceed €63,487 per annum for full time services or €31,743 per annum for part time child care services.</p>
            <p eId="para_7959">In a number of services, the levels of disadvantage among parents are such that the families would be unable to pay economic fees and therefore those services are likely to require ongoing State support towards their staffing costs. My Department is currently reviewing the arrangements for the ongoing support of such services in very disadvantaged areas, in cases where they will have received staffing grant assistance for three or more years, at any date prior to 31 August 2005. Information regarding the outcome of the review will be forwarded to the groups in question as soon as it is available.</p>
            <p eId="para_7960">The relevant groups have been informed that their existing level of funding for staffing grant assistance will be continued up to 31 August 2005, subject to the groups maintaining their forecast levels of service and implementing any conditions associated with the development of the service in regard to previous grant approvals. The amounts awarded are deemed sufficient to enable the groups to maintain their approved level of service.</p>
            <p eId="para_7961">Application forms are available from the child care directorate of my Department for first-time applicants for staffing grant assistance. In the interim, it would be premature of me to comment further on future staffing grant assistance.</p>

This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</p>

In this context, the needs of Ballymun, Finglas, Santry and Whitehall Garda stations will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country. The additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</p>

            <p eId="para_8032">As the Deputy is aware, in May 2002, my predecessor laid the groundwork for a grant aid scheme to facilitate community-based groups who wish to press ahead with their own local CCTV system.</p>
            <p eId="para_8033">It is my intention now to implement that scheme with clear details of the application process, terms and conditions, a timescale within which to apply in the first round and a clear commitment as to when funding will be available.</p>
            <p eId="para_8034">To this end, a project board was convened in January 2005 to arrange the commencement of the community-based CCTV scheme as soon as practical and possible and to oversee the implementation of the scheme. The membership of this project board consists of representatives of my Department, the Garda Síochána, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_8035">A number of meetings of the board have been held to date where a wide range of topics have been discussed and agreement reached on a number of items, including the code of practice and technical specifications required for the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_8036">I am also delighted to say that further to discussions between our respective Departments, my colleague, the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, has given a commitment to provide successful applications from RAPID areas with a further grant to a maximum of €100,000. This means that RAPID areas wishing to install their own CCTV system will be able to avail of an overall maximum grant of up to €200,000, subject to the terms and conditions of the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_8037">A decision has also been taken to engage Area Development Management Limited, ADM, to administer and project manage the scheme and evaluate applications in light of its experience with the child care and equality for women measures funded by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_8038">There is a demonstrated demand from local communities across Ireland for the provision of community CCTV systems. In some areas, significant work has been done in developing proposals which will allow communities to quickly define their needs and submit high-quality proposals for funding which have broad local support and high levels of sustainability. In many other areas, however, communities will not yet be ready to fully utilise funds and will need time to develop sustainable proposals. ADM will provide pre-development supports for such areas to assist in the formulation of high-quality proposals which will have the necessary elements of local support and sustainability.</p>
            <p eId="para_8039">Based on the progress of the board to date, I intend to launch this scheme in the coming weeks as outlined. By the end of July 2005 we should know the list of applications to be funded in the first round. By year end, these communities could be well on the way to having their CCTV systems in place.</p>

          <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_900">
            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_8044">The An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in regard to Garda numbers states: "We will complete the current expansion of the Garda Síochána and increase recruitment so that the numbers will increase by a further 2,000."</p>
            <p eId="para_8045">When I became Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in June 2002, the strength of the Garda Síochána stood at 11,748. After June 2002, and despite the cap on public service numbers announced in the budget of 2002, I proceeded with Government approval to increase the strength of the force to 12,200 by 2004, and I am pleased to say that target was achieved on time.</p>
            <p eId="para_8046">The House will be aware that, in October 2004, the Government approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</p>
            <p eId="para_8047">As a basis for implementing this commitment the commissioner has drawn up a project plan which has three key elements: the recruitment of sufficient additional Garda trainees to achieve the target strength; relocating the in-service training facilities from the Garda college so that the college can concentrate on training recruits; expanding the facilities at the Garda college.</p>
            <p eId="para_8048">A new recruitment campaign for the Garda Síochána was launched in November 2004. It is proposed to induct 1,100 Garda recruits to the Garda college in 2005, consisting of four intakes of 275 recruits. The first of these four intakes, 275, commenced training on the week commencing 7 February, 2005. The remaining three intakes of 275 recruits are scheduled to commence training on 3 May, 2005, 2 August, 2005 and 7 November, 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_8049">It is estimated that 523 Garda trainees will become attested members of the force in 2005. Current projections indicated that the total strength of the Garda Síochána as at 31 of December 2005 will be 12,299, all ranks. Taking into account the projected number of retirements, the new recruitment drive will lead to a combined organisational strength, of both attested gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 as early as end 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_8050">I have been informed by the Garda authorities that 1,421 recruits have graduated from the Garda college since 6 June, 2002. The figure refers to those who have successfully completed the student-probationer education and training programme. I am further informed that a total of 1,235 members, all ranks, have resigned, retired or otherwise left the Garda Síochána since the 6 June, 2002. A total of 1,679 recruits have been attested to the Garda Síochána in the same period.</p>
            <p eId="para_8051">Garda trainees are attested to the force on successful completion of phase three of their training. On attestation, Garda trainees become serving members of the force. Thus the serving strength of the force at any given time includes those who have been attested following completion of phase three of their training but have not yet formally graduated — formal graduation takes place following the completion of the fifth and final phase of training. The strength of the force has therefore increased by 444 members since June 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_8052">The Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources that are coming on stream. The additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</p>

            <p eId="para_8054">Under the Courts Service Act 1998, the Courts Service — which is responsible for the day-to-day management of the courts — is independent in the performance of its functions. I am responsible for ensuring that the service is adequately funded and, in this regard, €96.7 million has been provided for 2005. Furthermore, I have given the go-ahead for the new Criminal Court complex — to be located at Infirmary Road, Dublin — which will be the first public private partnership, PPP, project undertaken in regard to the courts building programme. I recently announced a further PPP package of some €50 million under which courthouse projects in Drogheda, Limerick, Cork, Wexford, Waterford, north Kildare, Swords, Letterkenny and Wicklow will be undertaken.</p>
            <p eId="para_8055">The funding provided allows the Courts Service to progress the implementation of its strategic plans and policies and I am confident that the level of funding provided is adequate, not only to maintain existing levels of service but also to provide for improvements in services and in court accommodation.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_8058">I propose to take Questions Nos. 781 and 783 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8059">As the Deputy will be aware, police operations are a matter for the Garda Síochána. In the context of regular Government business and bilateral contacts, policy issues concerning the tackling of organised crime are discussed with my ministerial colleagues. A number of multidisciplinary and interdepartmental structures are in place which facilitate an integrated and co-ordinated approach to tackling and-or preventing serious and organised crime, e.g., the Criminal Assets Bureau, the institutional structures under the national drugs strategy and the money laundering contact steering committee chaired by the Department of Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_8060">The establishment of specialist Garda units such as the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau, the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Garda National Drug Unit, operating under the assistant commissioner in charge of national support services, has enabled the Garda Síochána to tackle organised crime effectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_8061">Moreover, a broad range of strong legislation is available to the Garda Síochána to confront organised crime. Our criminal legislative framework reflects international developments to respond to the global growth of organised crime and specific measures enacted to meet our own domestic situation and is kept under continuous review.</p>
            <p eId="para_8062">The Deputy will be aware that the Criminal Justice Bill 2004 provides for a comprehensive package of anti-crime measures which will enhance the powers of the Garda in the investigation and prosecution of offences. In particular, the Deputy may wish to note that Part 3 of the Bill makes provision for the admissibility as evidence in court of statements by witnesses who subsequently refuse to testify or who retract their original statements. In addition, I am considering bringing forward a number of amendments to the Bill, including proposals to provide for criminal offences in relation to participation in a criminal organisation, to increase the sentences for firearms offences and to provide for better controls on firearms.</p>
            <p eId="para_8063">A further measure which will assist in tackling organised crime is the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Act 2004 which came into effect on 1 October, 2004. The main purpose of the Act, which gives effect to an EU Council framework decision, is to provide for the setting up of joint investigation teams by mutual consent of member states of the EU for a specific purpose and limited period. The teams will carry out criminal investigations with a cross-border dimension in one or more of the member states setting up the team. The Act is a further example of the Government's commitment to taking measures to facilitate more effective co-operation in combating crime, particularly serious crime such as terrorism, drug trafficking, fraud and organised crime generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_8064">The Garda authorities assured me that combating organised crime will remain at the forefront of its operational activities and my Department will continue to review the situation to ensure that organised crime is tackled efficiently.</p>

            <p eId="para_8066">The purchase of properties by persons engaged in criminal conduct is a recognised money laundering technique. While Garda money laundering investigations have shown that the proceeds of serious crime have been used to acquire properties both in Ireland and other jurisdictions, I would add that the criminal law in this jurisdiction does not make it easy for criminals to launder money or invest the proceeds of crime in the legitimate property market. In this regard, I would refer the Deputy to my comprehensive reply to Parliamentary Question Nos. 8, 294, 295, 296, 297, 298 and 299 tabled for answer on 8 July, 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_8067">The efforts of specialist Garda units, such as the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation, have been at the forefront of the drive to tackle the issue of money laundering and the Garda Síochána will continue to focus on this problem in its operational activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_8068">In addition, amendments earlier this year to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 and the Criminal Justice Act 1994 are designed to further ensure that the Garda, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Director of Public Prosecutions have all the tools available to them to investigate and seize property acquired from the proceeds of criminality, including foreign criminality.</p>

            <p eId="para_8220">In regard to Garda resources generally, I am very pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</p>
            <p eId="para_8221">The Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of the DMR will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country. The additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. One thing I have already promised is that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into front line, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</p>

            <p eId="para_8305">In regard to Garda resources generally, I am very pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</p>
            <p eId="para_8306">The Commissioner will now draw up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of the Garda stations in County Kildare will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country. The additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. One thing I have already promised is that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</p>

The currency of these systems is reviewed on a yearly basis and, subject to the appropriate funding being available, are upgraded, enhanced or extended, appropriate to operational requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_8309">I have previously indicated my plans in regard to the provision of a new national digital radio system for the force. In addition, it is planned to commence a national replacement of the public access callbox system during 2005. Other developments include an upgrade to PULSE computer workstations and printers which is currently under way and will be completed over the coming months.</p>

            <p eId="para_8441">Local Garda management state that resources are utilised to ensure that stations are opened for the periods outlined, in conjunction with ensuring car patrols, foot patrols and all other areas of policing are also addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_8442">I am further informed that local Garda management do not intend to extend the opening hours of any of the stations in County Kildare attached to the Carlow-Kildare division, at this time, as it is considered that the extension of the opening hours of any of those stations would necessitate the employment of more staff on indoor administrative duties who may be employed more productively on outdoor policing duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_8443">In regard to Garda resources generally, I am very pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with the An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</p>
            <p eId="para_8444">The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of the various Garda stations throughout County Kildare will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country. The additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to very significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. I have already promised that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</p>

In addition, I am informed that local Garda management has allocated an additional garda to Carnew Garda station on a temporary basis since 3 January, 2005. Policing at Carnew is augmented by patrols from Gorey, Bunclody and the divisional traffic unit. The allocation of Garda resources to Carnew, together with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy is continually monitored and reviewed. Such monitoring ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources and the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_8455">As regards resources generally, I am, of course, very pleased that the Government has approved my proposal to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members on a phased basis, in line with An Agreed Programme for Government commitment in this regard. This is a key commitment in the programme for Government, and its implementation will significantly strengthen the operational capacity of the force.</p>
            <p eId="para_8456">The Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources. In this context, the needs of the Carnew Garda station will be fully considered within the context of the needs of Garda stations throughout the country. The additional resources will be targeted at the areas of greatest need, as is envisaged in the programme for Government. The programme identifies in particular areas with a significant drugs problem and a large number of public order offences, but it will be possible to address other priorities as well, such as the need to significantly increase the number of gardaí allocated to traffic duties as part of the new Garda traffic corps. One thing I have already promised is that the additional gardaí will not be put on administrative duties. They will be put directly into frontline, operational, high-visibility policing. They will have a real impact.</p>

It is in communication with the association at central level in relation to its funding requirements.</p>

Where some classes in a school are greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.

The pupil-teacher ratio, which includes all the teachers in the school including resource teachers, has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in 2003-04. More than 4,000 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997.

            <p eId="para_8515">I am aware of the paper to which the Deputy refers. It highlights the importance of success in school as a major factor in preventing crime, alcohol and drug abuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_8516">Approximately €600 million is being provided by my Department in 2005 for measures specifically designed to tackle educational disadvantage in accordance with the Government's National Action Plan against Poverty and Social Exclusion 2003-2005, and Sustaining Progress. While these measures provide a continuum from early childhood to adulthood, there is a key focus on preventative strategies, targeting and integrated community responses.</p>
            <p eId="para_8517">Following completion of a review of the measures in place, I will shortly publish a new framework for tackling disadvantage in education. The new action plan will build on the success of existing programmes, while addressing the issues that have diluted the overall effectiveness of some measures. The new approach to tackling disadvantage will include better identification of levels of disadvantage in our schools and a single integrated programme of supports for schools with concentrated levels of disadvantage which will bring together, and build upon, some ten existing schemes and initiatives.</p>
            <p eId="para_8518">Each school in the programme will benefit from a package of supports, with the highest level of assistance being targeted at children in the most disadvantaged schools. Critical attention will be paid to literacy and numeracy issues. The new framework will be introduced on a phased basis, starting in the next school year, and will involve an additional annual investment of €40 million and provision of some 300 additional posts across the system on full implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_8519">I am aware of the importance of preventive programmes in the area of substance abuse being appropriately tailored to the social and cultural background of students. Social, personal and health education, SPHE, is a mandatory part of the curriculum in primary schools and at junior cycle in post-primary schools. The curriculum is designed to promote personal development and the health and well-being of students, to help them create supportive relationships and encourage the values and skills for responsible decision-making. Issues as regards belonging and integrating, handling conflict constructively, dealing with peer pressure, influences on decision-making, substance misuse, relationships and sexuality are dealt with specifically.</p>
            <p eId="para_8520">In addition, all schools are required to have an agreed school policy and a suitable relationships and sexuality education programme in place for senior cycle pupils. An integrated SPHE programme at senior cycle incorporating RSE is being developed. The curriculum is supported by guidelines for teachers and a full-time support service operating in collaboration with the health boards. An evaluation of the implementation of SPHE is currently under way and is being carried out by the author of the paper referred to in this question. The Department will examine carefully the issues and recommendations arising from his report in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_8534">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule, agreed between my Department and the education partners. The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school are greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_8535">In accordance with the schedule, the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the school year 2004-05 is a principal and 11 mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 314 pupils at 30 September, 2003. In addition, the school has a full-time resource teacher, a learning support teacher and a resource teacher for Traveller children. The Department will finalise the staffing schedule for the 2005-06 school year shortly and thereafter notify school boards of management. According to data submitted to the Department by the board of management the enrolment on 30 September, 2004 in the school was 288 pupils. The staffing for the 2005-06 school year will be determined on the basis of this figure and in accordance with the agreed staffing schedule.</p>

            <p eId="para_8544">As confirmed above, the school referred to by the Deputy currently has the services of one full-time resource teacher, one full-time learning support teacher and a full-time resource teacher for Traveller children.</p>
            <p eId="para_8545">I trust that the Deputy is aware of the proposed new system for resource teacher allocation which involves a general allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs-borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability. This system also applies to those with learning support needs, that is, functioning at or below the tenth percentile on a standardised test of reading and or mathematics.</p>
            <p eId="para_8546">I am conscious of difficulties that could arise with the proposed model for children in small and rural schools, if it were implemented as currently proposed. Accordingly, my Department is reviewing the proposal to ensure that it provides an automatic response for pupils with common higher incidence special educational needs. The review involves consultation with educational interests, including the National Council for Special Education, NCSE. The revised procedure for providing a general allocation of resource hours to schools will be announced in the coming weeks, in time to be implemented for the next school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_8547">The NCSE, which was established recently, and which has been operational since 1 January 2005, is responsible for processing applications for special educational needs supports. Seventy one special educational needs organisers have been recruited throughout the country and will be a focal point of contact for schools and parents.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_8556">I take it that the Deputy is referring to concerns in the school group's area regarding the proposed model of resource allocations for pupils in the high incidence disability categories.</p>
            <p eId="para_8557">In light of the reality that pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are distributed throughout the education system, my Department, in consultation with educational interests, developed a general model of resource teacher allocation to schools to support students in these disability categories. This model, which was announced by my predecessor in 2004 to come into effect from September 2005, was designed to put in place a permanent resource in primary schools to cater for pupils in these categories.</p>
            <p eId="para_8558">The model was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_8559">The advantages of using a general allocation model are as follows: it facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place in the school when the child enrols; it reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments; it puts resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels; it gives more security to special education teaching posts and makes special education teaching a more attractive option; it allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources, leading to a more effective and efficient delivery of services; and it will automatically adjust a school's general allocation on the basis of changing enrolment.</p>
            <p eId="para_8560">I have made it clear that while I am in favour of using a general allocation model for the reasons I have just given, I am conscious of the particular difficulties that the model announced last year could cause for small and rural schools if implemented as originally announced. For this reason I have asked the Department to conduct a review of the model announced last year. The review will be completed in the coming weeks and its outcome will be announced in time to be implemented for the next school year.</p>

            <p eId="para_8572">In October 2004 my Department issued details to all primary and post-primary schools regarding arrangements for parent-teacher meetings for the school year 2004-05. These arrangements were agreed by the parties to the Teachers Conciliation Council on foot of proposals from the Teachers Arbitration Board. In post-primary schools in respect of three formal parent-teacher meetings per year, meetings will commence at 4.15 p.m. in all schools with each school closing 15 minutes earlier than normal and will conclude at 6.45 p.m. In accordance with good practice parents who are waiting at 6.45 p.m. will be seen if this can reasonably be done.</p>

If such a meeting cannot be facilitated at a formal parent-teacher meeting then the parent will be offered a suitable and convenient appointment for same.</p>

In April, 2001 the new payroll operated by my Department was introduced which has helped to reduce the workload for boards of management and facilitated the introduction of improved conditions of service for the special needs assistants. The data necessary to place the special needs assistants on payroll was obtained from the boards. This data was input to the payroll.</p>

The total enrolment includes all children in ordinary and special schools and the total teaching posts include administrative principals, learning support teachers and recognised teachers of pupils with special needs in ordinary primary schools as well as teachers in special schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_8583">The national pupil-teacher ratio is an indicator of the ratio of overall full-time teaching staff to pupils at primary level. It takes account of all teachers in a school. The pupil-teacher ratio provides a picture of all of the teaching resources available to provide service to primary school children. The improvements in the pupil-teacher ratio in recent years show the significant levels of additional teaching resources made available to primary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_8584">My Department also publishes details of average class size in the annual statistical reports. This indicator includes mainstream class teachers only and refers to ordinary pupils in ordinary classes. The average class size indicator provides a picture of the size of classes at primary level. Since this indicator takes account only of mainstream classroom teachers, resource teachers and teachers other than classroom teachers at primary level are not captured by this indicator even though these are teaching resources available to pupils. These are included in the calculation of pupil-teacher ratio. While both indicators are different, they are complementary.</p>
            <p eId="para_8585">Significant improvements have been made in this area in recent years. The average class size at primary level is now 23.9, down from 26.6 in 1996-97. The pupil-teacher ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in 2003-04. More than 4,000 additional teachers have been employed in our primary schools since 1997. These additional teaching posts have been used to reduce class sizes, to tackle educational disadvantage and to provide additional resources for children with special needs. Significantly smaller class sizes have been introduced in disadvantaged schools involved in the giving children an even break/ breaking the cycle programme, with approximately 47,700 pupils in 243 participating schools availing of reduced class sizes of either 15 or 20 pupils per class. In line with Government policy, the position will be further improved in the future within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those in junior classes.</p>

            <p eId="para_8587">Under existing schemes for tackling educational disadvantage, 47,700 pupils in 243 schools are in classes of either 15 or 20 at junior level. Pupils in senior classes in these schools are in classes of 27. The new policy framework which I will be publishing shortly will extend smaller class sizes of 20 at junior level to children in more schools, based on the results of a new survey of the levels of disadvantage in primary schools to be carried out by the Educational Research Centre, starting this month. This survey will enable schools who did not qualify the last time a survey was conducted to qualify for smaller class sizes next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_8588">The extra staffing to provide for more classes of 20 at junior level in disadvantaged schools and classes of 25 at senior level in the most disadvantaged schools will be put in place in the next school year. Ensuring that more children from disadvantaged areas are taught in smaller classes is a priority for me as an important step in delivering on the Government's commitments on class size in the primary school system.</p>

            <p eId="para_8590">In light of the reality that pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are distributed throughout the education system, my Department, in consultation with educational interests, developed a general model of resource teacher allocation to schools to support students in these disability categories. This model, announced by my predecessor in 2004 to come into effect from September 2005, was designed to put in place a permanent resource in primary schools to cater for pupils in these categories. The model was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_8591">There are advantages of using a general allocation model. It facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place in the school when the child enrols. It reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments. It puts resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels. It gives more security to special education teaching posts and makes special education teaching a more attractive option. It allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources, leading to a more effective and efficient delivery of services. It will automatically adjust a school's general allocation on the basis of changing enrolment.</p>
            <p eId="para_8592">While I am in favour of using a general allocation model for these reasons, I am conscious of the particular difficulties that the model announced last year could cause for small and rural schools if implemented as originally announced.

The review will be completed in the coming weeks and its outcome will be announced in time to be implemented for the next school year.</p>

            <p eId="para_8606">I am fully conscious that the Dublin 15 area is one of the most rapidly developing areas in the State and, as a result of this, there has been a marked increase in the demand for school places, particularly at primary level. My Department is taking a number of measures to increase the capacity of existing schools in the area concerned along with the development of new schools to meet this growing demand. A building project to provide a new building for the school is on site. To further expand capacity at this school, my Department has approached the school's board of management to discuss the possibility of expanding the school to cater for a four stream intake at junior infant level for next September. This could be achieved by the school expanding to a 32 classroom school or re-organising to form a junior and senior school. I am confident this development will cater for the needs of pupils wishing to attend this school for next September. In addition, a building project underway at Huntstown national school will increase the capacity of that school to 32 classrooms. This project is nearing completion.</p>
            <p eId="para_8607">The area is also served by Castaheany Educate Together national school. My Department is pursuing the issue of site acquisition for this school and the provision of a permanent school building for it will be prioritised in my Department. It is envisaged that the demand for places is such that this school will need to grow to a 24 classroom school which will facilitate an annual intake of three junior infant classes. In the interim, temporary accommodation will be provided to meet the school's immediate needs for next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_8608">I am confident that a combination of the measures outlined will alleviate demand for pupil places in the area for the foreseeable future.</p>

The school was oversubscribed for the 60 available places for enrolment to first year 2005-06. The appeals committee found that, in allocating the available places, the school adhered to the terms and provisions of its enrolment policy and the criteria for the selection of successful applicants. It also adhered to the procedures for the implementation of that policy including the use of random selection.

Each application submitted is examined having regard to the level of anticipated demand and existing similar provision available in the area. My Department is in receipt of a proposal from Limerick city vocational education committee to establish a Gaelcholáiste in Limerick from September 2006 and this is under active consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_8664">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule agreed between my Department and the education partners. The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use the teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_8665">In accordance with the staffing schedule, the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the school year 2004-05 is a principal and eight mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 224 pupils at 30 September 2003. In addition, the school has the services of a learning support teacher and a resource teacher. My Department will finalise the staffing schedule for the 2005-06 school year shortly and thereafter notify school boards of management.</p>
            <p eId="para_8666">According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management of the school, the enrolment on 30 September 2004 was 235 pupils.

            <p eId="para_8687">I propose to take Questions Nos. 864 and 919 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8688">My Department's policy on the retention of pupils in primary schools is set out in primary circular 32/03 which issued to all primary schools in December 2003. Under my Department's policy, pupils should only repeat a year for educational reasons and under no circumstances should an additional grade level — middle infants or repeat sixth class — operate through the retention of all or a substantial number of pupils for a second year at a grade level. The level of provision now available should enable pupils to make progress in keeping with their needs and abilities and to move consecutively through the different class levels in the school in keeping with their peers.</p>
            <p eId="para_8689">In addition, pupils who have completed sixth class must not transfer to another primary school to repeat sixth class. In the event that a school were to enrol pupils from another school to repeat sixth class, the pupils shall not be included as eligible pupils for staffing and other purposes. Capitation and other grants in respect of such pupils shall not be paid.</p>
            <p eId="para_8690">The primary school curriculum is designed as an eight-year course, including a two-year infant cycle followed by six years in standards from first to sixth, with children progressing to the next grade at the end of each school year. I am aware that there may be individual cases where a principal teacher, following consultation with the learning support teacher-resource teacher, class teacher and parent or parents of the pupil may conclude that a pupil would benefit educationally by repeating a grade level. In such cases, as outlined in circular 32/03, my Department would allow the retention provided there is an educational basis for it and there is a clear programme for the pupil to follow.</p>
            <p eId="para_8691">The compulsory school starting age in a national school is six years of age and rule 64 (1) of the rules for national schools provides that a child must be at least four years of age before she or he may be enrolled in a national school. In accordance with the rules and programme for secondary schools, a child may be enrolled as a recognised pupil in a post-primary school provided that he or she is not less than 12 years of age on 1 January of the school year and who has, as a rule, completed a full course of primary education.</p>
            <p eId="para_8692">Primary circulars are reviewed regularly by the officials in the primary branch of my Department in consultation with the inspectorate to ensure that there is clarity for schools in the operation of various schemes. Circular 32/03 was issued following such a process. My officials are in regular contact with the education partners, including parents, about the provision of education services in the primary school system. There are no plans at present to review circular 32/03.</p>

            <p eId="para_8703">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule agreed between my Department and the education partners. The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use the teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_8704">In accordance with the staffing schedule, the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputies for the school year 2004-05 is a principal and 21 mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 591 pupils at 30 September 2003. In addition, the school has two learning support teachers, two special class teachers, two full-time resource teachers, one shared resource teacher and one temporary language support teacher. Hence, the pupil teacher ratio in the school is 20.37:1. My Department will finalise the staffing schedule for the 2005-06 school year shortly and thereafter notify school boards of management.</p>
            <p eId="para_8705">According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management, the enrolment on 30 September 2004 in the school was 588 pupils. The staffing for the 2005-06 school year will be determined on the basis of this figure and in accordance with the agreed staffing schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_8706">Significant improvements have been made to the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, which has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-04 school year. In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those in junior classes.</p>

            <p eId="para_8710">I propose to take Questions Nos. 868 to 870, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8711">The compulsory school starting age in a national school is six years of age. Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can between them cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_8712">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard, a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_8713">Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases, appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the board of management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.</p>

            <p eId="para_8721">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule agreed between my Department and the education partners. The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use the teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_8722">In accordance with the staffing schedule, the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the school year 2004-05 is a principal and nine mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 244 pupils at 30 September 2003. In addition, the school has one learning support teacher, one special class teacher, one resource teacher and one shared temporary language support teacher. Hence, the pupil-teacher ratio in the schools is 19:1, not including the shared post. My Department will finalise the staffing schedule for the 2005-06 school year shortly and thereafter notify school boards of management.</p>
            <p eId="para_8723">According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management of the school, the enrolment on 30 September 2004 was 243 pupils. The staffing for the 2005-06 school year will be determined on the basis of this figure and in accordance with the agreed staffing schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_8724">Significant improvements have been made to the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, which has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-04 school year. In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those in junior classes.</p>

            <p eId="para_8738">The issue of legal costs relating to an application to the Residential Institutions Redress Board is addressed in section 27 of the Residential Institutions Redress Act 2002. This section provides that the redress board shall pay an applicant to whom the board has made an award a reasonable amount for expenses incurred by the applicant in the preparation and presentation of the application to the board. The board also pays the costs of any proceedings instituted by the applicant that arise from the circumstances of the application to the board and to which the waiver under section 13(6) applies. In the event that agreement cannot be reached between the board and the applicant or the applicant's legal representative, the matter is referred to the taxing master of the High Court for a decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_8739">The redress board deals with each bill of costs separately and there is no agreement on a fixed fee of 20% per case. In the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the redress scheme, a figure of 15% was identified as an estimate for legal and other application costs and 5% for the board's administration costs. Based on information available to my Department from the redress board, the average amount paid to date in legal and other application costs, including costs of other proceedings instituted, is in the region of 15%. This level of costs is significantly below the average costs paid to date in civil cases settled by my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_8752">My Department provides library facilities of 100 sq.m. in second level schools with an enrolment of 200 to 499 students, while it provides 136 sq.m. of accommodation for a library in schools with more than 500 students. Schools with fewer than 200 pupils are examined individually.</p>
            <p eId="para_8753">Responsibility for the stocking of school libraries falls to be met by individual school authorities from within normal school budgets. In recent years two grants, amounting to €6.6 million, have been issued to second level schools in the free education scheme to assist them with the development of their library resource materials. Schools were informed that the grants were to be used to improve the range and quality of library books and an information note offering advice on book purchases was issued. The provision of general library services for the community at large, including the school referred to by the Deputy, is a matter for Dublin City Council. My Department understands that the council's library section would be prepared to discuss any proposals in this regard with the school.</p>

            <p eId="para_8755">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule agreed between my Department and the education partners. The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_8756">Since 1997, the Government has dramatically increased the number of teachers in primary schools. In that time, more than 4,000 additional teachers, including nearly 2,500 resource teachers, have been employed. These additional teaching posts have been used to reduce class size, tackle educational disadvantage and provide additional resources for children with special needs. Average class size has been reduced from 26.6 in 1996-97 to 23.9 in 2003-04. With regard to primary schools in Galway city, I am pleased to say that the average class size in the 2003-04 school year was 23. In fact, the number of pupils in classes of more than 30 in Galway city halved between 1996-97 and 2003-04. In accordance with the staffing schedule, the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the school year 2004-05 is a principal and 11 mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 310 pupils on 30 September 2003. In addition, the school has the services of a learning support teacher and a resource teacher. My Department will finalise the staffing schedule for the 2005-06 school year shortly and thereafter notify school boards of management.</p>
            <p eId="para_8757">According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management of the school, the enrolment on 30 September 2004 was 312 pupils. The staffing for the 2005-06 school year will be determined on the basis of this figure and in accordance with the agreed staffing schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_8758">Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-04 school year. In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio and average class size for junior classes within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those in junior classes.</p>

            <p eId="para_8766">Under the terms of my Department's 2004 third level student maintenance grant schemes, students entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the prescribed conditions with regard to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.</p>
            <p eId="para_8767">The condition relating to residency requires, in the case of a candidate under 23, the candidate's parents or guardians to have been ordinarily resident in the administrative area of a local authority or VEC from 1 October 2003. In the case of an independent mature candidate, he or she must have been ordinarily resident in the administrative area of a local authority or VEC from 1 October 2003. The local authority or VEC has discretion to waive this requirement in exceptional circumstances. A mature candidate is defined as a student who is at least 23 years of age on 1 January of the year of entry or re-entry to an approved course.</p>
            <p eId="para_8768">Mature candidates are categorised as either independent mature candidates or mature candidates dependent on parents. An independent mature candidate is defined to mean a mature candidate who was not ordinarily resident at home with his or her parents from 1 October 2003. Independent mature candidates are assessed without reference to either their parents' income or residence. For the purpose of the residency requirement, normal residence is defined to mean the permanent or ordinary address of the candidate's parents or guardians from 1 October 2003, or, in the case of an independent mature candidate, his or her ordinary or permanent address from 10 October 2003.</p>
            <p eId="para_8769">Candidates continue to be assessed under the terms and conditions, including the residency requirement, of the scheme appropriate to their year of entry to an approved course. There is, however, provision under the terms of the schemes for candidates who are re-entering as mature students, following a break in study of at least one year, to pursue or complete an approved course for the first time. Such candidates may be assessed with reference to the terms of the scheme appropriate to the year in which they re-enter. Under this provision, candidates who do not meet the residency requirement of the scheme relevant to the year of first entry may subsequently be eligible with reference to the residency requirement prescribed in the scheme relevant to the year of re-entry.</p>
            <p eId="para_8770">An example of the type of circumstances where it would be considered appropriate for the local authority or VEC to use its discretion to waive the residency requirement would be in the case of an independent mature candidate who has been outside the State for a short time during the period from 1 October 2003 but who can provide satisfactory proof that he or she had been permanently resident in the State prior to going abroad and subsequently resumed independent permanent residency in the State after the brief period abroad.</p>

            <p eId="para_8801">I propose to take Questions Nos. 897 and 898 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8802">I am aware that Louth, like many areas located within close proximity to Dublin, continues to experience population growth, a position that almost inevitably places some strain on existing educational provision. However, a range of significant measures has been undertaken by my Department to address the current and future need for pupil places in these areas. In 2004 extensions were provided at Walshestown national school, Tullyallen national school, scoil náisiúnta Mhuire in Muchgrange, and Scoil Náisiúnta Mhuire Gan Smal in Cartown. In 2005, 11 primary schools in Louth have been invited to participate in the devolved small schools initiative to provide additional accommodation at their schools and to date all have accepted this initiative. Details of the conditions for drawing down the grant are being forwarded to the schools in question. In addition, a new 32-classroom school is proposed for Drogheda, and an eight classroom extension is proposed for scoil náisiúnta Mhuire na nGael in Dundalk. Both of these projects are starting architectural planning this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_8803">At post-primary level, an extension to Scoil Uí Mhuire, Dunleer, is under construction. An extension to Ardee Monastery is due to go to tender and construction this year. In addition, the extension projects at Drogheda and Dundalk Grammar Schools are at early architectural planning. These initiatives represent huge capital investment and demonstrate my commitment to meeting the needs of the area concerned. The school planning section of my Department will keep the position under review to ensure that any additional emerging needs are met as expeditiously as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_8804">A new school planning model involving published area development plans is being piloted in five areas over the current school year. Drogheda is included in the pilot scheme as part of an overall plan for the north Dublin, east Meath and south Louth area. The need for additional primary and post-primary schools in that area will be considered in this context. The purpose of this new approach to school planning is to ensure that the provision of school infrastructure will be decided only after a transparent consultation process. In this regard, parents, trustees, sponsors of prospective new schools and all interested parties from a locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_8805">Arising from this process, an individual plan will set out the blueprint for the future of educational provision in an area, which will be the touchstone against which all decisions in relation to capital investment will be made for the next decade. The draft plan for north Dublin, east Meath and south Louth area is nearing completion in the school planning section of my Department and I hope to be in a position to publish it soon.</p>

            <p eId="para_8813">According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management of the school, the enrolment on 30 September 2004 was 44 pupils.

The school has the services of part-time resource teaching hours and a shared learning support teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_8814">There is a proposed new system for resource teacher allocation which involves a general allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence of special educational needs. This system also applies to those with learning support needs, such as those functioning at or below the tenth percentile on a standardised test of reading and mathematics. I am conscious of difficulties that could arise from the proposed model for children in small and rural schools if it were implemented as currently proposed. Accordingly, my Department is reviewing the proposal to ensure that it provides an automatic response for pupils with common higher incidence special educational needs. The review involves consultation with educational interests, including the National Council for Special Education. The revised procedure for providing a general allocation of resource hours to schools will be announced in the coming weeks in time to be implemented for the next school year.</p>
            <p eId="para_8815">The NCSE, which has been operational since 1 January 2005, is responsible for processing applications for special educational needs supports and 71 special educational needs organisers have been recruited throughout the country and will be a focal point of contact for schools and parents.</p>
            <p eId="para_8816">With regard to accommodation, my Department's building unit wrote to the school in July 2002, recommending the appointment of a consultant architect to prepare tender documentation for the purchase of a temporary classroom to accommodate the school's resource teacher. The school authorities did not reply and therefore the matter went no further. If the school authorities still propose to extend the school's mainstream accommodation, they must submit an application to the planning section in my Department which will assess the application against the published criteria. The project will be considered in the context of the schools building programme from 2006 onwards.</p>

            <p eId="para_8822">I propose to take Questions Nos. 904, 1032 and 1034 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_8823">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule agreed between my Department and the education partners. The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_8824">In accordance with the staffing schedule, the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the school year 2004-05 is a principal and ten mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 288 pupils on 30 September 2003. The school also has resource teachers, a resource teacher for Travellers, special class teachers and an extra post due to its disadvantage status. My Department will finalise the staffing schedule for the 2005-06 school year shortly and thereafter notify school boards of management.</p>
            <p eId="para_8825">According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management of the school, the enrolment on 30 September 2004 was 281 pupils. The staffing for the 2005-06 school year will be determined on the basis of this figure and in accordance with the agreed staffing schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_8826">Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-04 school year. In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those in junior classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_8827">There is a new proposed new system for resource teacher allocation which involves a general allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs, such as borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability. This system also applies to those with learning support needs, such as functioning at or below the tenth percentile on a standardised test of reading and-or mathematics. My Department is reviewing the proposal to ensure that it provides an automatic response for pupils with common higher incidence special educational needs. The review involves consultation with educational interests including the National Council for Special Education before it is implemented in September 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_8828">The ancillary services grant scheme provides additional <i>per capita</i> grants for primary schools towards caretaking and secretarial services. This scheme does not provide for the linking of the grants to any particular pay scale. The scheme, by its nature, is flexible and gives boards of management discretion as to the manner in which caretaking and secretarial services are provided.</p>
            <p eId="para_8829">The level and extent of services provided is a matter for the school authorities which, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for secretarial services as resources permit. As the secretaries are employees of individual schools, this Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_8830">It is a matter for each individual school, to decide how best to apply the funding to suit the school's particular needs. The standard rate of the ancillary services grant has been increased from a rate of €102 per pupil in 2002 to €133 per pupil this year. The question of increasing the rate of grant in the future will be considered in the context of available resources and priorities within the education sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_8831">The school to which the Deputy refers is currently included in the disadvantaged areas scheme and Giving Children an Even Break scheme and benefits from a range of supports under both of these programmes.</p>

            <p eId="para_8835">My Department has already decentralised with offices in Tullamore and Athlone.</p>
            <p eId="para_8836">There is also a network of regional offices set up throughout the country. Under the Government's decentralisation plan, the Dublin offices will be moved to either Athlone or Mullingar, with 300 staff moving to Mullingar and 100 staff moving to Athlone. This will be done in two separate phases while at the same time maintaining existing services. In planning how the organisation should be structured post-decentralisation, the criteria to be applied includes minimising the disruption to existing decentralised locations. However, as part of optimising the future structure of the Department, there is an opportunity to integrate business units where there is a high degree of interaction or co-dependancy and where these units are split among different locations. While there may be some movement from existing decentralised locations where there is a business case to be made for such a move, the overall numbers in each location will remain constant.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_1017">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_8854">Walk Tall and On My Own Two Feet are resource programmes for implementation, by primary and post-primary schools respectively, in the context of social and personal health education, SPHE. They are designed to assist schools in educating pupils in the area of substance use and in preventing substance misuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_8855">In 2003, at the request of my Department, an evaluation of Walk Tall was carried out by Dr. Mark Morgan, St. Patrick's College, Drumcondra. Following the launch of Walk Tall in the mid-1990s, an earlier "formative" evaluation of the pilot phase had also been carried out, in 1981, by Dr. Morgan.</p>
            <p eId="para_8856">The recent, 2003, evaluation was concerned with an outcome evaluation based mainly on the perceptions of the teachers who were involved in the programme. It was concerned with how the programme fulfilled the main aims that it was intended to achieve, frequency of implementing the programme, satisfaction with the methodology of Walk Tall and the associated lesson plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_8857">The main findings are as follows. An analysis of the results of the questionnaire indicated that teachers held a very positive view of the programme in terms of its potential outcomes for children, including safety, drug prevention, self-esteem, personal responsibility and decision-making. About 90% of the teachers had taught the Walk Tall programme at least on a monthly basis and the perception of these teachers was that the children enjoyed those lessons. In relation to lesson plans, teachers expressed a high level of satisfaction especially with respect to appropriateness of lessons for class, opportunity for activities and having the correct amount of material.</p>
            <p eId="para_8858">There was almost unanimous agreement that there was "a great need" -"a very great need" for a programme like Walk Tall. Findings confirmed that that the Walk Tall programme has a widely accepted rationale and is based on principles that are in line with modern thinking on prevention. The relevant in-service programme was well received by teachers. The questionnaires to the various parties involved — teachers, trainers and children — indicated that it was seen as an important contribution to the curriculum. About 90% of the teachers had taught the Walk Tall programme at least on a monthly basis and the perception of the vast majority was that the children enjoyed the lessons. In the teachers' views, the Walk Tall programme links in extremely well with SPHE in the curriculum. This is of importance, particularly in relation to the contextualisation of Walk Tall in the curriculum, as well as addressing the issue of "time available within school day", which emerged as a concern for teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_8859">The evaluation found that there was inadequate progress in schools in relation to policy development on substance misuse prevention. It should be noted that considerable attention had been devoted to this matter in the meantime and that a new survey of schools is in preparation in order to determine the current situation regarding such policies in schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_8860">A full on evaluation of On My Own Two Feet has not been carried out. However, a full evaluation of SPHE implementation at post-primary level is about to be carried out and this will include references to how useful post-primary schools find On My Own Two Feet as a resource. In the meantime, informal reports through the SPHE support service indicate that post-primary schools regard On My Own Two Feet as a valuable source.</p>

            <p eId="para_8862">I should explain that for the purpose of the post-primary education scheme, the country has been divided into catchment areas, each of which has its own post-primary centre. While it is the prerogative of parents to send their children to the school of their choice, it is not the object of the school transport scheme to facilitate parents in exercising that choice. Recognised post-primary pupils who live at least 4.8 kilometres from the post-primary centre of the catchment area in which they reside, are eligible for transport under the scheme to that centre. Eligible pupils who wish to attend a post-primary centre other than their appropriate one may be allowed transport from within the catchment boundary of the centre being attended, subject to there being spare accommodation available on the service and provided that no additional State cost is incurred.</p>
            <p eId="para_8863">It is the practice of my Department to consult local educational interests, where any adjustment is being proposed to the existing catchment boundary arrangements. My Department has no plans to review the catchment areas in question.</p>

            <p eId="para_8865">The Mullingar catchment area is served by 21 primary schools, including a gaelscoil and a new multi-denominational school which commenced operation last September. Excluding the gaelscoil, which has developed into an eight teacher school, as expected, and the new multi-denominational school which is developing, the total number of extra primary school pupils who came on stream in the Mullingar catchment area between the years 1999-2000 and 2003-04 is 190. At current pupil-teacher ratios, this equates to approximately an extra 6.5 class groups. While this would have a significant impact on a single school, it is not unreasonable to expect that 19 schools could between them cater for this number.</p>
            <p eId="para_8866">In recent years my Department has provided temporary accommodation in a number of schools in the area to ease pressure. This includes provision at two schools — Curraghmore and Gainstown — which, between them, are catering for almost 100 of the 190 extra pupils referred to above. Two other schools received funding under the new devolved initiatives to improve accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_8867">It is important to understand that many parents, when enrolling pupils, do so in a number of schools. This has the effect of distorting pre-enrolment lists and creating the impression that there is a shortage of places. In addition, some parents may be disappointed in not obtaining a school of first choice especially if a school is particularly popular. This can also be interpreted as representing a shortage of places.</p>
            <p eId="para_8868">One of my Department's chief concerns in any given area is to ensure that schools can between them cater for the number of pupils presenting. This is the case in Mullingar. Boards of management are expected to manage the situation to reflect this position.</p>
            <p eId="para_8869">While there is pressure on some schools for places, one school in particular, in the centre of the town, has lost 50 pupils in the last five years. With the exception of an extra demand for places in the gaelscoil, which my Department is taking action to rectify, there has been no indication whatsoever that pupils have had difficulties in gaining access to schools last September.</p>
            <p eId="para_8870">In the Mullingar town plan for 2002 to 2008, the local authority specifically states "the existing school infrastructure is considered to be of a capacity to meet the needs of the school-going population over the period of the plan". My Department accepts that Mullingar is a developing town in the medium to long term and is taking a number of steps to ensure that its future needs are met in a timely fashion. First, a number of extension projects will be considered for progress under the 2005 school building programme. Second, the extension of the gaelscoil to 16 classrooms to provide an extra 240 pupil places is being pursued together with the development of the new multi-denominational school to 16 classrooms which will provide an extra 480 pupil places. Third, a senior Department inspector recently visited all primary schools in the area and his findings will form part of an in-depth analysis of both primary and post-primary infrastructural provision in Mullingar which will be carried out as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_8872">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule, agreed between my Department and the education partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_8873">The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_8874">In accordance with the staffing schedule, the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the school year 2004-05 is a principal and three mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 95 pupils at 30 September 2003. The school also has a resource teaching post.</p>
            <p eId="para_8875">My Department will finalise the staffing schedule for the 2005-06 school year shortly and thereafter notify school boards of management. According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management of the school, the enrolment on 30 September 2004 was 91 pupils. The staffing for the 2005-06 school year will be determined on the basis of this figure and in accordance with the agreed staffing schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_8876">Significant improvements have been made in the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level in recent years. The ratio has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-04 school year. Average class size has also fallen from 26.5 in 1996-97 to 24.9 in 2003-04. In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio and class size at junior level within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those in junior classes.</p>

            <p eId="para_8880">A sum of €4,329,738 was spent on specific capital projects in primary schools in County Wexford in 2004. In addition, each primary school in the county received both a minor works grant in the amount of €3,809 per school and €12.70 per pupil and a science grant in the amount of €1,000 per school and €10 per pupil. The science grant is to assist in the acquisition of appropriate resources for science classes.

            <p eId="para_8888">The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, was established in December 2003, as an independent statutory body with responsibilities as set out in the National Council for Special Education (Establishment) Order 2003. There are 71 special education needs organisers, SENOs, employed by the council since September 2004, who have been deployed on a nationwide basis, with at least one SENO being deployed in each county. Each SENO is responsible for the primary and second level schools in their area and they have made contact with each of their schools and informed them of their role. A recruitment process for a further nine SENOs has been commenced by the council to bring their total up to 80 persons nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_8889">With effect from 1 January 2005, the NCSE has taken over responsibility for processing resource applications for children with disabilities who have special educational needs. Under the new arrangements, the council, through the local SENO will process the relevant application for resources and inform the school of the outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_8890">The establishment of the NCSE will greatly enhance the provision of services for children with special educational needs, SEN, and result in a timely response to schools which have made application for SEN supports. The local service delivery aspect of the council's operation through the SENOs will provide a focal point of contact for parents-guardians and schools and will, I am confident, result in a much improved service for all.</p>

            <p eId="para_8892">Officials of my Department are participating in a working group on student councils, which was established in June 2003 by the National Children's Office. The working group, as part of its brief, will seek to identify the barriers, if any, to the establishment of student councils and the measures needed to encourage the establishment of student councils, including supports for student council structures at national and local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_8893">The working group on student councils, which is chaired by the National Children's Office and is representative of students and all the partners in education, was set up to encourage the establishment of effective and democratic student councils in all post-primary schools in the country. This is in accordance with the Education Act 1998, which encourages the establishment of student councils in all post-primary schools and with goal one of the national children's strategy which is to give children and young people a voice in matters that affect their lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_8894">Under section 27 of the Education Act 1998, students in a post-primary school may establish a student council, the role of which is to promote the involvement of students in the affairs of the school in co-operation with the board of management, parents and teachers. This development originated in my Department's recognition that students have a voice and a contribution to make to their school and these councils can play an integral and important role in the school community by providing a representative structure through which students can debate issues of concern and undertake initiatives of benefit to the school and the wider community.</p>
            <p eId="para_8895">In 2002, my Department issued comprehensive guidelines on student councils to all second level schools. The guidelines, entitled, Student Councils: A Voice for Students, provide practical guidance for school management, teachers and students in relation to the establishment and operation of student councils.</p>
            <p eId="para_8896">The working group will report on its findings, including a proposed three-year strategy to support the establishment and development of student councils, to the Minister of State with responsibility for children by June 2005.</p>

            <p eId="para_8899">As part of this initiative, an additional 75 speech and language therapy places were provided at University College Cork, UCC, the University of Limerick, UL, and the National University of Ireland Galway, NUIG.

The provision of these extra places has meant that the number of places on speech and language therapy courses has quadrupled from 25 in the 2002-03 academic year to 100 for the 2003-04 academic year.</p>

The continued funding of special projects through this scheme is intended to provide out-of-school youth work programmes and services for young people in particular need, that is, those young people who are deemed to be at risk due to a number of factors, including substance abuse, early school-leaving, crime and homelessness. Projects facilitate the personal and social development of participants, thus enabling them to realise their full potential. This aim underpins all programmes and activities of special projects for youth. Funding was made available on a once-off basis in 2004 to one project providing services exclusively for females as follows: Young Mothers in Education project, Galway received €25,000 in 2004.</p>

            <p eId="para_8973">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule, agreed between my Department and the education partners.</p>
            <p eId="para_8974">The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where some classes in a school have class sizes of greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_8975">In accordance with the staffing schedule, the staffing of the school for the school year 2004-05 is a principal and four mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 129 pupils at 30 September 2003. In addition, the school has one learning support teacher based in the school sharing with one other school and one full-time resource teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_8976">My Department will finalise the staffing schedule for the 2005-06 school year shortly and thereafter notify school boards of management. According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management, the enrolment on 30 September 2004 in the school referred to by the Deputy was 135 pupils. The staffing for the 2005-06 school year will be determined on the basis of this figure and in accordance with the agreed staffing schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_8977">A revised system for allocating resource teachers and learning support teachers was announced last year and a review of this system is taking place with particular reference to its impact on small and rural schools. I expect this review to be completed in the coming weeks in time to be implemented for the next school year.</p>

            <p eId="para_8979">I am aware of the situation in the school in question. I trust that the Deputy is aware of the proposed new system for resource teacher allocation announced by my predecessor in 2004 which involves a general allocation for all primary schools to cater for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs — borderline mild and mild general learning disability and specific learning disability — and those with learning support needs, that is, functioning at or below the tenth percentile on a standardised test of reading and-or mathematics.</p>
            <p eId="para_8980">I am conscious of difficulties that could arise in relation to the proposed model for children in small and rural schools, if it were implemented as proposed. Accordingly, my Department is currently reviewing the proposal to ensure that it provides an automatic response for pupils with higher incidence special educational needs. The review involves consultation with educational interests, including the National Council for Special Education, NCSE. The revised procedure for providing a general allocation of resource hours to schools will be announced in the coming weeks, in time to be implemented for the next school year. My officials will liaise with the school following the completion of the review process.</p>

            <p eId="para_8995">The compulsory school starting age in a national school is six years of age. Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters. My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.</p>
            <p eId="para_8996">It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act. In this regard, a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful. In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.</p>
            <p eId="para_8997">Where a board of management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science. A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality. In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the board of management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.</p>

            <p eId="para_8999">The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. The number of teachers required to implement any adjustment to the staffing schedule will depend on the level of improvement introduced and on pupil numbers. In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those in junior classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_9000">The total intake to the colleges of education has more than doubled since 1995-96, from 500 students in 1995-96 to 1,280 students this year.

            <p eId="para_9003">My Department launched a pilot project for modern languages in primary schools in September 1998. The aims of the pilot project included the development of communication skills in four target languages which are French, German, Spanish and Italian, the fostering of positive attitudes to language learning and the diversification of the languages taught in schools. To achieve these aims in the project schools the teaching of a modern European language to pupils in fifth and sixth classes was introduced. Currently, 394 schools are participating in the initiative at primary level.</p>
            <p eId="para_9004">At the request of my Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, has carried out a feasibility study of the teaching of modern languages in the primary curriculum. The report, completed last year, recommended that any decision on the place of modern languages in the primary curriculum should be deferred until the revised primary curriculum has been implemented in full. This will be 2007 at the earliest. Until then, the initiative will continue with support provided by a team of language specialists and funded by my Department. Also, the NCCA is engaging in additional research and some pilot projects with initiative schools to further inform its advice when the primary curriculum has been fully implemented.</p>
            <p eId="para_9005">My Department is working closely with language experts from the Council of Europe to facilitate the analysis of language practice at primary and post-primary level, with a view to the formulation of an integrated language policy. This analysis will include Irish as well as the development of criteria for decision-making on issues such as the inclusion of additional languages in the curriculum. This will complement ongoing work by the NCCA, which is engaged in reviewing languages in the post-primary curriculum and the feasibility of expanding provision at primary level.</p>

            <p eId="para_9010">In light of the reality that pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are distributed throughout the education system, my Department, in consultation with educational interests, developed a general model of resource teacher allocation to schools to support students in these disability categories. This model, which was announced by my predecessor in 2004 to come into effect from September 2005, was designed to put in place a permanent resource in primary schools to cater for pupils in these categories. I have made it clear that while I am in favour of using a general allocation model, I am conscious of the particular difficulties that the model announced last year could cause for small and rural schools if implemented as originally announced.

However, the tender outcome was significantly in excess of the budget for the project. My Department has advised the school authority that the project can proceed as early as possible in 2005 provided significant cost reductions are achieved. The briefs for other two classroom schools on the school building programme comprised a combination of new build and renovation. In recent years, my Department has provided funding for smaller schools through the small schools' initiative to enable these schools refurbish and extend existing properties or build new two teacher schools.</p>

It would be expected that the pupil's SEN can be met from within the current resource-learning support teaching allocation available to the school. The school has the services of a shared learning support teacher and resource teaching hours. It is a matter for the school to deploy these resources to meet the SEN of the pupils in the school.</p>

This model, which was announced by my predecessor in 2004 to come into effect from September 2005, was designed to put in place a permanent resource in primary schools to cater for pupils in these categories. The model was constructed in order that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_9021">The advantages of using a general allocation model are as follows: it facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place in the school when the child enrols; it reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments; it puts resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels; it gives more security to special education teaching posts and makes special education teaching a more attractive option; it allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources, leading to a more effective and efficient delivery of services; it will automatically adjust a school's general allocation on the basis of changing enrolment.</p>

However, officials in the school planning section of my Department are reviewing the overall primary educational needs of the area. As the Deputy will be aware, a new school planning model involving published area development plans is being piloted in five areas in the current school year.

In this regard, parents, trustees, sponsors of prospective new schools and all interested parties from a locality will have the opportunity to have their voices heard in the process. Arising from this process, an individual plan will set out the blueprint for the future of educational provision in an area, which will be the touchstone against which all decisions in relation to capital investment will be made for the next decade. The draft plan for north Dublin-east Meath and south Louth area is nearing completion in the school planning section of my Department and I hope to be in a position to publish it shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_9037">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule agreed between my Department and the education partners. In accordance with the staffing schedule, the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the school year 2004-05 is a principal and 21 mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 593 pupils at 30 September 2003. In addition, the school has two learning support posts, seven resource posts, two temporary language support posts and one temporary disadvantaged concessionary post, hence the pupil-teacher ratio in the school is 17:1.</p>
            <p eId="para_9038">My Department will finalise the staffing schedule for the 2005-06 school year shortly and thereafter notify school boards of management. According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management, the enrolment on 30 September 2004 in the school was 586 pupils. The staffing for the 2005-06 school year will be determined on the basis of this figure and in accordance with the agreed staffing schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_9039">Significant improvements have been made to the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, which has fallen from 22.2:1 in the 1996-97 school year to 17.44:1 in the 2003-04 school year. In line with Government policy, my Department will continue to provide further reductions in the pupil-teacher ratio within available resources and subject to spending priorities within the education sector. Priority will be given to pupils with special needs, those from disadvantaged areas and those in junior classes.</p>

Under this review, all projects are being assessed against the published prioritisation criteria which were revised last year following consultation with the education partners. Each project will be assigned a band rating and the progress of all projects will be considered in the context of the school building programme from 2005 onwards. In addition in 2004, a new school planning model involving published draft area development plans was piloted in five areas. Included in the pilot scheme is the area around the N4-M4 from Leixlip to Kilbeggan. Included in this are the areas referred to by the Deputies.</p>

            <p eId="para_9132">My Department funds four maintenance grant schemes for third level and further education students. These are the higher education grants scheme, the vocational education committees' scholarships scheme, the third level maintenance grants scheme for trainees and the maintenance grants scheme for students attending post leaving certificate courses. The higher education grants scheme is administered by the local authorities. The other three schemes are administered by the vocational education committees. The process of assessing eligibility for third level or further education grants is a matter for the relevant local authority or VEC. Among the factors which give rise to delays in processing applications is where the administering body is awaiting further information and-or documentation from applicants.</p>
            <p eId="para_9133">My Department, in recognition of the importance of the timely provision of payment to eligible students, is engaged in ongoing consultations with the Irish Vocational Education Association and the County and City Managers' Association with a view to improving the existing arrangements and ensure the earlier processing of applications and the making of payments to eligible students. In this regard, a working group with representatives from both associations has been established. The broad terms of reference of this group is to examine ongoing operational issues with the current system of administration of the schemes. Issues regarding the early payments of grants to eligible students are included in the discussions and-or deliberations of this group.</p>
            <p eId="para_9134">My Department is also in discussions with the existing stakeholders on the future administration of the schemes. My intention is that whatever future administration of the schemes we put in place, it will be one which delivers a quality and timely service to students, and ensures consistency of application and client accessibility.</p>

The ABA approach is based on understanding a set of behaviours, breaking down the components of the tasks involved in learning and the application of consequences to reduce-weaken or increase-strengthen a particular behaviour or set of behaviours. My Department allocated €1,149,192 to Saplings for the 2004-05 school year.

            <p eId="para_9197">I am aware that Sallins, Naas and Kill, like many areas located within close proximity to Dublin, continue to experience population growth, a position that almost inevitably places some strain on existing educational provision. However, a range of significant measures has been undertaken by my Department to address the current and future need for pupil places in these areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_9198">At primary level, an entire new school has been provided at Killashee, while temporary accommodation has been provided at Scoil Corbain, St. Conleth's and St. Mary's national school and St. Conleth's Naofa in Naas. Temporary accommodation has also been provided at one of the two nearby national schools at Caragh. In addition approval has been given to St. Corban's and Gaelscoil Nás na Ríogh in Naas, Scoil Naomh Bríghde, Kill, and Caragh national school for additional accommodation for September 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_9199">A seven classroom extension is under construction at Sallins national school. When completed, this extension will increase capacity from nine classrooms to 16 classrooms. An extension to bring the school up to 24 classroom is being allowed into architectural planning this year. A brand new state-of-the-art 16 classroom school together with a double autistic unit is under construction in Naas town. This project, in particular, will assist in easing any difficulties for primary pupil places that may exist in Naas. Additionally, there are proposals to improve accommodation at St. David's national school and Two Mile House national school. The accommodation needs of the national schools at Ballycane, Caragh and Convent of Mercy in Naas are also being assessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_9200">At post-primary level, the management authority of St Patrick's post-primary school, County Kildare VEC, is progressing plans to relocate the school and extend capacity to 1,000 pupils. Additionally, an extension project is under construction at St Mary's College, which will increase capacity at the school to 900 pupils. A similar extension is under construction at Meanscoil Iognaid Ris and further accommodation needs at the school are in planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_9201">All these initiatives represent significant capital investment and demonstrate my commitment to meeting the needs of the areas concerned. The school planning section of my Department will keep the position under review going forward to ensure additional emerging needs are met as expeditiously as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_9209">The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by applying the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous school year to a staffing schedule agreed between my Department and the education partners. The system for allocating teachers to primary schools is based on ensuring an overall maximum class of 29 in each school. Where classes in a school have numbers greater than 29, it is generally because a decision has been taken at local level to use their teaching resources to have smaller numbers in other classes.</p>
            <p eId="para_9210">In accordance with the staffing schedule, the staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the school year 2004-05 is a principal and 11 mainstream class teachers based on an enrolment of 301 pupils at 30 September 2003. The pupil-teacher ratio for the school measures the number of pupils for each teacher in the school, including the principal and resource and learning support teachers. In addition to the having a principal and 11 mainstream class teachers, this school also has the services of a learning support teacher and a resource teacher for Travellers. My Department will finalise the staffing schedule for the 2005-06 school year shortly and, thereafter, notify school boards of management.</p>
            <p eId="para_9211">According to data submitted to my Department by the board of management of the school, the enrolment on 30 September 2004 was 292 pupils. The staffing for the 2005-06 school year will be determined on the basis of this figure and in accordance with the agreed staffing schedule. As outlined in primary circular 19/02, an independent appeals board was established to adjudicate on appeals from boards of management on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. The appeals board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final. Appeals must be submitted to primary payments section, Department of Education and Science, Athlone, on the standard application form, clearly stating the criterion under which the appeal is being made, after the schedule for the 2005-06 school year has issued.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_9213">In light of the reality that pupils in the high incidence disability categories of mild and borderline mild general learning disability and dyslexia are distributed throughout the education system, my Department, in consultation with educational interests, developed a general model of resource teacher allocation to schools to support students in these disability categories. This model, which was announced by my predecessor in 2004 to come into effect from September 2005, was designed to put in place a permanent resource in primary schools to cater for pupils in these categories. Circular SP ED 09/04, which issued to schools in June 2004, introduced this new model.</p>
            <p eId="para_9214">The model was constructed so that allocations would be based on pupil numbers, taking into account the differing needs of the most disadvantaged schools and the evidence that boys have greater difficulties than girls in this regard. The advantages of using a general allocation model are as follows: it facilitates early intervention as the resource is in place in the school when the child enrols; it reduces the need for individual applications and supporting psychological assessments; it puts resources in place on a more systematic basis, thereby giving schools more certainty about their resource levels; it gives more security to special education teaching posts and makes special education teaching a more attractive option; it allows flexibility to school management in the deployment of resources, leading to a more effective and efficient delivery of services; and it will automatically adjust a school's general allocation on the basis of changing enrolment.</p>
            <p eId="para_9215">This is a model for resource allocation to schools. These resources may, in turn, be allocated, as appropriate, by schools to those pupils with special educational needs in the categories mentioned and to pupils with learning support requirements. While I favour using a general allocation model for the reasons I have just given, I am conscious of the particular difficulties that the model announced last year could cause for small and rural schools if implemented as originally announced. For this reason I have asked my Department to conduct a review of the model. The review will be completed in the coming weeks and its outcome will be announced in time to be implemented for the next school year.</p>

            <p eId="para_9255">I have made it clear that while I am in favour of using a general allocation model for the reasons I have just given, I am conscious of the particular difficulties that the model announced last year could cause for small and rural schools if implemented as originally announced.</p>
            <p eId="para_9256">For that reason, I have asked my Department to conduct a review of the model, something announced last year. The review will be completed in the coming weeks, and its outcome will be announced in time to be implemented for the next school year. In carrying out the review, my Department is consulting with representative interests, including the National Council for Special Education.</p>

            <p eId="para_9258">My Department provides funding towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services in primary schools under two separate schemes. One scheme is the 1978-79 scheme for the employment of full-time secretaries and caretakers in primary schools, under which my Department meets the full cost of salary. That scheme is being phased out as posts become vacant, and no new posts are being created. That scheme has been superseded by a more extensive grant scheme now referred to as the ancillary services grant.</p>
            <p eId="para_9259">The ancillary services grant provides additional funding for primary schools towards the cost of secretarial and caretaking services. The scheme does not provide for the linking of the grants to any particular pay scale and is flexible by nature, giving boards of management discretion as to the manner in which secretarial and caretaking services are provided. The school referred to by the Deputy receives secretarial grant assistance under that scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_9260">The amount of grant paid to an individual school is determined by the enrolment in the school, subject to a minimum grant being paid in the case of a school with 60 pupils or less and a maximum grant being paid in the case of a school with 500 or more pupils, and whether the school in question has either caretaking or secretarial services under an existing Department scheme. The standard rate of grant was increased from €102 to €127 per pupil in 2004 and was increased by a further €12 per pupil this year. The rate that applies in the case of a school which already has either caretaking or secretarial services under an existing Department scheme, as is the case of the school referred to by the Deputy, is €66.50 per pupil.</p>
            <p eId="para_9261">The level and extent of services provided is a matter for the school authorities who, through the discretion afforded by the scheme, apply diverse arrangements for secretarial services as resources permit. As the secretaries are employees of individual schools, my Department does not have any role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities. It is a matter for each individual school to decide how best to apply the funding to suit the school's needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_9262">The question of increasing the rate of the ancillary services grant in the future will be considered in the context of available resources and priorities in the education sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_9266">Military service allowance, MSA, was made pensionable in the case of Defence Forces personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990 on foot of a recommendation of the Commission on Remuneration and Conditions of Service in the Defence Forces, the Gleeson commission. That approach is fully consistent with settled public service pensions policy, which provides that the benefit of an allowance being made pensionable for serving personnel does not extend to existing pensioners. As the person in question retired before 1 August 1990, he is not eligible to have MSA taken into account in the calculation of his pension.</p>

            <p eId="para_9269">I propose to take Question Nos. 1043 and 1045 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_9270">The Army Pensions Acts provide that a disability pension may, following retirement, be granted to a former member of the Permanent Defence Force in respect of permanent disablement due to a wound or injury attributable to military service, whether at home or abroad, or to a disease attributable to or aggravated by overseas service with a United Nations force. A wound is defined in broad terms in those Acts as "an interruption of the normal continuity of body tissue caused by direct or indirect violence". An application for a disability pension in respect of psychiatric or depressive illness could be considered if the condition was due to a wound or injury or to overseas service.</p>
            <p eId="para_9271">The specific provisions in the Army Pensions Acts covering disease attributable to or aggravated by overseas service with the United Nations were introduced in 1960 in the context of the additional risks and dangers associated with such service. Similar provisions previously applied only where the disease was attributable to home service during the 1922-24 period or the emergency period of 1939-45 because service conditions during each of these periods were regarded as exceptional.</p>
            <p eId="para_9272">The advice of the military medical authorities is that there is no reason to believe that the incidence of psychiatric and depressive illness among military personnel is different from that of the general population or, where depressive illness does occur, that it is related to or is a direct result of military service.</p>
            <p eId="para_9273">Under existing superannuation arrangements, viz. the Defence Forces pensions schemes, an NCO or private with 12 or more years' service who is discharged on medical grounds qualifies for a service pension and a retirement gratuity regardless of whether the medical condition is service-related. In addition to benefits under those schemes and the Army Pensions Acts, NCOs and privates are insured for the full range of benefits under the Social Welfare Acts, including unemployment benefit, disability benefit and invalidity pension. They are also covered for hospital and medical services, including medical cards, under the Health Acts on the same basis as other members of the community.</p>

            <p eId="para_9289">Wind energy projects and bio-gas plants are considered development within the meaning of the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2004 and consequently require planning permission from the planning authority where the developments are proposed.

            <p eId="para_9290">Guidelines for planning authorities on the development of wind energy projects were published in draft format for public consultation in August 2004. I intend publishing them in definitive form in the near future.

            <p eId="para_9293">The Referendum Acts 1998 and 2001 provide for the establishment of a referendum commission whenever a referendum falls to be held. A referendum commission has the statutory role of explaining the subject matter of the referendum to the electorate and providing any other relevant information which it considers appropriate. Since 2001, the commission must also promote public awareness of the referendum and encourage the electorate to vote at the poll.</p>
            <p eId="para_9294">Regarding the referendum on the European constitution, the Government has made clear its commitment to ensuring that the commission to be established in respect of the referendum will have the time and resources that it requires to fulfil its mandate.</p>
            <p eId="para_9295">I understand that the additional funding made available to the European Commission through this year's EU budget has been allocated to all member states on a <i>per capita</i> basis to support the provision of non-partisan information on the European constitution to all EU citizens, including initiatives at Commission level, such as an information website and distribution of information brochures. I further understand that the proportionately small element of the funding allocated to Ireland is being used by the Commission office in Dublin to ensure that an adequate supply of copies of the constitution is available free of charge to members of the public.

        his views on whether having to visit more than one post office to get a voter registration application form and subsequently having to make a visit to the Garda station with identification to be included on the supplementary voting register is a disincentive to people registering to vote; and if he has proposals to change this system in view of the fact that the old system of visiting each house to check the applicants no longer applies.

            <p eId="para_9353">The compilation and publication of the register of electors is a matter for the appropriate local authority in accordance with electoral law and involves the carrying out of house-to-house or other local inquiries, including in many cases delivering registration forms to households for completion. In addition, application forms for inclusion on the register of electors, or the supplement to the register, are widely available from local authorities, post offices, Garda stations and public libraries, and increasingly may be accessed via local authority websites.</p>
            <p eId="para_9354">In making voter registration as accessible as possible, it is important to have appropriate measures in place to guard against potential personation or abuse of the electoral system. It is, therefore, a legal requirement that completed application forms for inclusion on the supplement to the register of electors are witnessed by a member of the Garda Síochána before being returned to the appropriate local authority. If a person cannot attend the local Garda station, his or her application may be witnessed by an official of the local authority. If, because of a physical illness or disability, a person cannot attend either the local Garda station or the local authority, his or her application form can be accompanied by a medical certificate.</p>
            <p eId="para_9355">I am concerned to ensure that the legislative and administrative arrangements in place regarding registration are as flexible and user-friendly as possible consistent with maintaining the security and integrity of the electoral process. While I will continue to keep current practice under review, I am satisfied that the present arrangements strike a reasonable balance.</p>

            <p eId="para_9357">Section 23 of the Derelict Sites Act 1990 provides for the imposition of an annual derelict sites levy in respect of urban land registered by the relevant local authority for the purposes of the Act.

            <p eId="para_9358">I am satisfied that this levy, consistently applied and rigorously enforced, constitutes a sufficient financial incentive to property owners to eliminate dereliction, and I have no proposals at this time to increase the amount of the levy.</p>

            <p eId="para_9361">The Waste Management Acts 1996 to 2003 place a general duty of care on any holder of waste not to hold, transport, recover or dispose of waste in a manner that causes or is likely to cause environmental pollution. Local authorities have specific powers under the Acts to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused by the holding or disposal of waste and mitigate or remedy the effects on the environment of any such activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_9362">While enforcement is a matter for the local authorities and the Office of Environmental Enforcement, I will continue to ensure that the regulatory framework and the resources for effective enforcement are appropriate to deal with the problem. Very significant powers were made available to local authorities under the Waste Management Act 1996 to enable them to tackle illegal waste activity, and those powers were further strengthened by the Protection of the Environment Act 2003. Those grant an authorised person of a local authority powers to halt vehicles and inspect premises for any purpose connected with the Acts. Maximum penalties attaching to illegal waste activities are substantial and were increased in the 2003 Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_9363">To assist local authorities further in acting on those powers, for the second consecutive year, over €7 million has been allocated from the environment fund to support a more vigorous approach to environmental enforcement, with a particular emphasis on combating dumping and other unauthorised waste activities. That is now being reflected in the presence of additional enforcement personnel on the ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_9364">On a related matter, as part of the very successful Race Against Waste campaign, two initiatives aimed specifically at the business community were launched with a view to heightening awareness among businesses of their obligations regarding waste and of the need to increase recycling rates. The Small Change initiative was launched in February 2004 and provides step-by-step information on how to reduce, reuse, recycle and compost waste in the workplace for small and medium-sized businesses. It was run in partnership with the Chambers of Commerce of Ireland and included a printed guide, website and seminars, all of which remain highly popular and in constant demand since the programme's launch.</p>
            <p eId="para_9365">In February 2005, I launched the Action at Work programme, which targets large organisations and aims to teach such organisations how to implement a better waste management strategy; provide information on what permits waste contractors should have; focus on waste minimisation and recycling; notify organisations of their legal obligations; and present examples on how other organisations are implementing reduce, reuse, recycle policies, such as my Department, Dublin Bus and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_9366">The programme comprises an action at work guide produced in print and CD format as well as nationwide seminars running from March to June 2005 along with website and lo-call phone line support.</p>

            <p eId="para_9368">The detailed information requested is not available in my Department. Nonetheless, I regard the effective operation of the regulatory regime for the waste sector as a key priority for my Department. Failure by any business or person to comply with waste legislation is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. To that end, several significant initiatives designed to achieve more vigorous enforcement of the waste code have been introduced. Those are designed to support the activities of the local authorities who are the primary enforcement authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_9369">The Protection of the Environment Act 2003 provides new enforcement powers and increases the maximum fines for contraventions of the waste code. Conviction on indictment for an offence under the Waste Management Acts now carries a maximum fine of €15 million as well as a term of imprisonment of up to ten years.</p>
            <p eId="para_9370">Second, the Office of Environmental Enforcement, OEE, located within the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has been established and is fully operational. While it has a wide remit, the OEE is focusing on waste-related enforcement activities in its early stages and has established a national enforcement network to ensure a consistent standard of enforcement quality and evenness of activity across local authorities in the area. Several working groups have been established under the auspices of the national enforcement network to examine local authority enforcement activities over a range of specific areas, including packaging waste.</p>
            <p eId="para_9371">Third, the importance of providing additional resources to underpin the waste enforcement effort has been acknowledged. In that regard, €7 million from the environment fund was allocated to local authorities in 2004 to support the first year of a major five-year programme of local authority waste enforcement activities. A further €7 million is being provided in 2005. The aim is to provide a stronger and more visible local authority enforcement presence on the ground and to ensure more frequent inspections and speedier responses to reported allegations of non-compliance with waste legislation. Local authorities have been requested to give particular priority to enforcement of the 2003 packaging regulations in their functional areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_9372">I intend to continue to place a major emphasis on the importance of effective enforcement by competent authorities — local authorities and the EPA or OEE — across all environmental legislation and will continue to consider further measures which may prove necessary to further progress in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_9374">The information sought is not available in my Department. Enforcement of the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003, as amended, is primarily a matter for local authorities. In that regard, it should be noted that €7 million was allocated to local authorities in 2004 from the environment fund to support stepped-up enforcement of waste management legislation generally, and a further €7 million is being allocated for 2005. Local authorities have been requested to give particular priority to enforcement of the 2003 packaging regulations in their functional areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_9375">In addition, the Office of Environmental Enforcement, OEE, located within the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has now been established and has in turn established a national enforcement network to ensure a consistent standard of enforcement quality and evenness of activity across local authorities in this area. Several working groups, including one on packaging waste, have been established under the auspices of the national enforcement network to examine local authority enforcement activities over a range of specific waste-related areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_9376">In light of the above, I am confident that the comprehensive new structures now being put in place are delivering a significantly enhanced waste enforcement service. The allocation of dedicated waste enforcement staff to local authorities, coupled with the efforts of the national enforcement network in co-ordinating activities and providing training, means that we are now in a better position to identify and tackle non-compliance with waste legislation, including the packaging regulations, in a more targeted and focused manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_9377">The 2003 packaging regulations, which revised and replaced previous regulations made in 1997, are intended to facilitate the achievement by Ireland of the 50% packaging waste recovery target by the end of 2005 as set out in Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste. Those regulations were streamlined further in amending regulations made last year. The current body of regulations provides the necessary legal framework to facilitate the recovery and recycling of packaging waste in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_9378">Under those regulations, all producers participating in the placing of packaging on the Irish market are obliged to segregate the packaging waste arising on their own premises into specified waste streams, that is, waste aluminium, fibreboard, glass, paper, plastic sheeting, steel and wood and have it collected by authorised operators for recycling. In addition, major producers, that is, those who have an annual turnover in excess of €1 million and who place more than 25 tonnes of packaging on the Irish market, have additional responsibilities with regard to the recovery of packaging waste from their customers.</p>
            <p eId="para_9379">Major producers have the option of either complying directly with their producer responsibility obligations, that is, self-compliance, or alternatively getting an exemption from those requirements by becoming a member of a packaging waste compliance scheme. Repak Limited, established by Irish industry in 1997 to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste with a view to achieving Ireland's packaging waste recovery and recycling targets under Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste, is the sole approved compliance scheme for the recovery of packaging waste in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_9380">While it is not possible to ascertain with any degree of certainty the level of non-compliance among business, I am aware that membership of the Repak scheme now stands at circa 1,900, up from 700 at the end of 2000, which reflects not only the efforts of Repak in its drive to recruit new members but also in large part the increased and more targeted enforcement activities by local authorities in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_9382">The provision of appropriate heating systems is eligible for funding under both the disabled persons and essential repairs grant schemes. Decisions on the type and extent of work which may be grant aided in individual cases are matters for the local authorities, which are responsible for the administration of the schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_9383">Under the terms of the special housing aid for the elderly scheme, which is operated by the Health Service Executive, provision of a suitable heating system appropriate to the needs of the elderly person in the context of the other improvements and repairs works to dwelling may also be funded. In addition, in July 2004, my Department introduced a new central heating programme to assist local authorities in providing central heating facilities in their rented dwellings which lack them. That scheme has been extended for a further period in 2005.</p>

The Department will not deal with planning or environmental issues relating to the project because such matters are decided on independently by An Bord Pleanála and the EPA respectively.

            <p eId="para_9535">Sewage sludge is an inevitable and potentially useful by-product of advanced waste water treatment processes. The national volume of sewage sludge is increasing as a result of the continuing major investment in waste water treatment facilities under the national development plan. It is desirable and in accordance with EU requirements that sewage sludge should be reused where appropriate. I note that the recent EPA report on urban waste water discharges in Ireland confirms that sludge reuse in agriculture increased significantly from 23.9% in 1998-99 to 63% in 2002-03.</p>
            <p eId="para_9536">When sewage sludge is reused in agriculture it is subject to compliance with the Waste Management (Use of Sewage Sludge in Agriculture) Regulations 1998, as amended, which give effect to Council Directive 86/278/EC on the protection of the environment and, particularly, of the soil when sewage sludge is used in agriculture. The regulations specify sampling, analyses and monitoring requirements, set limit values for metal concentrations for the use of sewage sludge in agriculture and require that sewage sludge is used only in accordance with a nutrient management plan. The regulations also place a responsibility on local authorities to plan, control and enforce the disposal or reuse of sewage sludge within their functional areas.</p>

I understand that the programme is undertaking further investigations following the recent tsunami which is reported to have uncovered evidence of such materials. As parties to the Basel Convention on the control of transboundary movements of hazardous waste, for which the UN programme is responsible, Ireland, the EU Commission and other member states are committed to the regulation of waste transhipments in an environmentally responsible way.</p>

Ireland, through its participation together with its EU partners in the Basel Convention and its ongoing and increased support of the UN programme, will continue to support the objective of full compliance with agreed protocols in this important matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_9543">All provisions of the Planning and Development Act 2000 are now in force. Neither the Act nor the subsequent amendments to it contain provisions prohibiting planning applications for retention. The retention permission system allows for the assessment of an unauthorised development to determine whether it meets the criteria, including environmental impact assessment where relevant, for development consent. Allowing an application for retention permission for an unauthorised development does not ignore the offence that has been committed by the developer. Planning legislation was amended in 2000 so that an application for retention permission is no longer a defence to a prosecution for unauthorised development. The legislation clearly envisages a situation where a developer might apply for and obtain retention permission, while being simultaneously fined in the courts for his or her original breach of the law.</p>
            <p eId="para_9544">There are many other strengthened enforcement provisions in the Planning and Development Act 2000. Planning authorities must take action in response to well-founded complaints about unauthorised development, unless it appears to the planning authority that the development in question is of a trivial or minor nature. The 2000 Act greatly increased fines, with a maximum penalty on conviction on indictment of €12.7 million and two years' imprisonment. Planning authorities are now entitled to retain fines imposed by courts for planning offences to help finance more active planning control. The period for taking action was extended from five to seven years in the 2000 Act, which increased the fees for retention permission. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government does not propose to add to or amend the recently reviewed provisions of planning legislation on unauthorised development and retention.</p>

It is not considered necessary to instigate a specific programme in this respect, as the Department has been requested by local authorities to do so. An information leaflet, Asbestos in your Home, is available from ENFO, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government's public information service on environmental matters. The leaflet, which includes advice on the maintenance, removal and disposal of asbestos materials, advises the public to contact the Health and Safety Authority to obtain information about the handling and use of asbestos.</p>

            <p eId="para_9552">The compilation of a register of electors is a matter for the appropriate registration authority in accordance with electoral law. To be able to vote, a person's name must be entered in the register of electors for the constituency in the State in which the person ordinarily resides. A person's citizenship determines the polls at which he or she is entitled to vote. Irish citizens who are registered to vote may vote at all polls. British citizens may vote at Dáil, European and local elections, EU citizens other than Irish and UK citizens may vote at European and local elections and non-EU citizens may vote at local elections only.</p>
            <p eId="para_9553">Postal voting is provided for certain categories of person as specified in electoral law. The Electoral Act 1992 provides for postal voting for members of the Garda, whole-time members of the Defence Forces and Irish diplomats serving abroad and their spouses. The Electoral (Amendment) Act 1996 extended postal voting to electors living at home who are unable to vote because of a physical illness or disability. The Electoral Act 1997 extended postal voting to electors whose occupation, service or employment makes it likely that they will be unable to vote in person at their local polling station on polling day, as well as to full-time students registered at their home who are living elsewhere while attending an educational institution in the State. The Electoral (Amendment) Act 2001 extended postal voting to certain election staff employed at the poll outside the constituency in which they reside.</p>
            <p eId="para_9554">The question of voting rights for Irish citizens living abroad has been considered in detail on a number of occasions, most recently by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution in its examination of the Parliament.

The section of the report that deals with emigrant participation in political life concluded that the right to vote in Dáil elections should remain confined to citizens ordinarily resident in the State and that the right to vote at referendums should not be granted to emigrants. While electoral law is subject to ongoing review, there are no proposals to alter the existing arrangements.</p>

            <p eId="para_9556">The Planning and Development Act 2000 contains significant provisions regarding the completion of housing estates. A planning authority may require as a condition of a planning permission for the development of an estate that the development be satisfactorily completed within a period of not less than two years from the commencement of works. The 2000 Act also provides that a planning authority may attach a condition to a planning permission requiring the giving of adequate security for the satisfactory completion of a development and, if the development is not subsequently satisfactorily completed, it may apply the security to that satisfactory completion. It is the responsibility of the local authority to ensure that adequate security for the completion of estates is obtained.</p>
            <p eId="para_9557">Section 180 of the 2000 Act provides that if an estate is not completed satisfactorily by the developer, a planning authority must, if requested to do or by the majority of the qualified electors who are owners or occupiers of the houses involved, initiate the procedures for taking an estate in charge. The decision on whether to take the estate in charge is ultimately one for the democratically elected members. It should be noted that the enforcement of planning control provisions have been considerably strengthened in the 2000 Act. Fines have been greatly increased. Planning authorities are obliged to follow up genuine complaints about breaches of planning control within a given time period and are entitled to retain fines imposed by courts for planning offences. Moreover, that an application for retention permission has been made is no longer a defence to a prosecution for unauthorised development.</p>
            <p eId="para_9558">The 2000 Act contains a further relevant provision in this regard. Section 35 provides that the planning authorities may apply to the High Court for authorisation to refuse to grant planning permission to a developer who has substantially failed to comply with the conditions of a previous permission. A Private Members' Bill, the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2005, proposes to amend this provision. The Government did not oppose the second reading of the Bill despite reservations about possible legal difficulties. The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is considering the Bill and has sought the advice of the Office of the Attorney General.</p>

Section 261 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 introduced a one-off system of registration for all quarries, other than those for which planning permission was granted in the five years prior to 28 April 2004. Under the registration system, quarry operators must supply full details of their operations to the planning authority, including information on the area of the quarry, the material being extracted, the hours of operation and the traffic, noise and dust generated by the quarry. The information must be supplied by 27 April 2005.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_9563">Under the rental accommodation scheme announced by the Government in July 2004, local authorities will over a four-year period progressively assume responsibility for accommodating supplementary welfare allowance rent supplement recipients of 18 months or more continuous duration with a long-term housing need. The scheme is a collaborative project between the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, local authorities, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the community welfare service.</p>
            <p eId="para_9564">All local authorities are due to implement the new arrangements in 2005. Roll-out has commenced in an initial group of lead authorities, namely, Dublin, Galway and Limerick city councils, south Dublin, Donegal, Offaly and Westmeath county councils and Drogheda Borough Council. The main actions to date have been to put in place the structures necessary to commence the project, identify and resolve issues arising and to engage resources needed to support implementation.</p>
            <p eId="para_9565">Programme managers have been appointed initially to assist the lead authorities but thereafter to be available to support other authorities over the implementation period. Regional and local implementation groups in the lead authority areas have been established to ensure effective ongoing liaison and co-operation locally between housing authorities, Health Service Executive areas and other welfare agencies. A number of seminars have been held in the lead authorities to inform accommodation providers of the new scheme and to receive their views.</p>
            <p eId="para_9566">Work is ongoing in the lead authorities towards identifying those on rent supplement who are in need of long-term housing support. Starting with persons who have been in receipt of rent supplement for 18 months or more, community welfare officers in Health Service Executive areas have commenced a review of cases which, subject to meeting eligibility criteria, are in the process of being transferred to the relevant housing authority for the purposes of establishing long-term housing need. If a long-term housing need is identified by the local authority, it will start to source suitable accommodation for the household under the rental accommodation scheme as quickly as possible. The pilot local authorities have already initiated contact with accommodation providers in their areas. Pilot projects to secure long-term contracts for the supply of rented accommodation are also being advanced.</p>
            <p eId="para_9567">The rental accommodation scheme is an additional housing option. Eligible persons can indicate their preference to be accommodated by local authorities under the scheme or social housing, or to be considered under both. Tenants will initially make the same rent contribution under the rental accommodation scheme upon transfer as they have done before now under the rent supplement scheme, subject to there being no change in the tenant's family circumstances. The contribution under the rental accommodation scheme will be brought in line with the differential rents scheme for the area over time.</p>

            <p eId="para_9571">Under the Building Control Act 1990, compliance with Part M of the building regulations, which relates to access of people with disabilities, is primarily the responsibility of the designers, builders and owners of buildings. The enforcement of Part M is the function of the local building control authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_9572">The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, with the co-operation of building control authorities, conducted a survey of such compliance in the case of non-domestic buildings in 2003, as part of the European year of people with disabilities. Almost 600 buildings were covered by the survey, of which over one third did not fully comply with Part M. Local authorities sought to achieve full compliance by seeking the co-operation of building owners or by instituting enforcement action.</p>
            <p eId="para_9573">The results of the survey confirm a disappointing level of compliance with Part M. The Department has for some years been pressing building control authorities to step up enforcement and, in particular, to give priority to the enforcement of Part M. It is clear that seeking full compliance with Part M in a completed building involves serious practical problems and that such problems should be avoided by checking compliance at the design stage. Accordingly, the proposed building control (amendment) Bill will provide for the introduction of a disability access certificate system, as recommended by the report of the Commission on the Status of People with Disabilities. Under this system, the designs of non-domestic buildings and apartment blocks will have to be certified by the local building control authority as being compliant with Part M before work commences. This will be similar to the existing fire safety certificate system, whereby designs are certified as compliant with Part B — fire safety — of the building regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_9574">Part M of the 1997 building regulations required disabled access within a building, but it was restricted to those parts of a building to which it is reasonable to have access. This restriction has been removed by amending Part M regulations made in 2000 which require, without qualification, that adequate provision should be made to enable people with disabilities to access independently and use a building.</p>

            <p eId="para_9579">The allocation of houses under the affordable housing schemes is a matter for each local authority, in accordance with the scheme of allocation priorities adopted by its elected members. Each local authority must establish a scheme that determines the order of priority to be accorded to persons to whom affordable houses are made available for sale, where the number of persons applying for such houses exceeds the number of houses available. A working group of officials from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and a number of local authorities was established to assist local authorities in preparing schemes. Following the working group's consideration, guidelines on a model scheme of allocation priorities were prepared and circulated to local authorities in June 2001. Notwithstanding this, the making and amending of a scheme is a reserved function and, accordingly, it is a matter for the elected members to decide the precise form the scheme should take, having regard to the requirements of the relevant legislation. The Department does not have information on the composition of the various schemes operated by local authorities. It does not have details of affordable housing schemes where a lottery was used for allocation purposes.</p>

            <p eId="para_9782">Under the Building Control Act 1990, local authorities inspect buildings for compliance with the building regulations. However, my Department's housing inspectorate is involved in the inspection of houses in connection with various grant schemes and with certification for taxation and other benefits. This includes inspections carried out for floor area compliance certificates, the requirements of which include, but are not limited to, compliance with the building regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_9783">It is appropriate, at a time of record activity in the construction sector, that standards are maintained at a high level. An independent inspection service such as that provided by the Department is an important contribution to the achievement of consistent standards in the current circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_9784">Significant State benefits, by way of tax and stamp duty relief, accrue to those providing and purchasing new houses and the present inspection system helps to ensure protection of these tax expenditures and also to provide a measure of consumer protection. Where differences of interpretation and misunderstandings arise my Department's inspectorate meets the relevant parties with a view to clarifying and where possible resolving such issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_9788">The clawback provisions provide that if a house purchased under the affordable housing schemes at a discount from market value is resold before the expiration of 20 years from the date of the purchase, the person selling the property shall pay to the local authority a percentage of the proceeds of the sale. This percentage is equal to the percentage discount allowed by the local authority on the original sale of the house where the house is resold within the first ten years. The amount payable is reduced by 10% in respect of each complete year after the tenth year during which the person who purchased the property has been in occupation as his or her normal place of residence.</p>
            <p eId="para_9789">For example, if an affordable house is purchased from a local authority for €120,000 and has a market value at the time of purchase of €150,000, the discount received is 20%, and this is the clawback percentage payable in the event of a resale. If the house was resold after five years for €180,000, taking account of improvements by the purchaser, the clawback payable to the local authority would be 20% of this amount, €36,000. If the house were resold after 12 years for €200,000, the clawback would amount to €32,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_9790">The provision for a clawback is necessary to ensure that there is no short-term profiteering on the resale of a house provided by a local authority at a discount from market value. I am satisfied that the provision works well in protecting the State's interest in these affordable houses.</p>

          <speech by="#NoelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Environment,_Heritage_and_Local_Government" eId="spk_1173">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_9962">The Government is continuing to work towards ensuring that housing needs, and in particular social housing needs, are adequately addressed. The Government's strategy on housing has the overarching aim of enabling every household to have available an affordable dwelling of good quality, suited to its needs, in a good environment and, as far as possible, at the tenure of its choice. The general strategy for realising the overall policy aim is that those who can afford to do so should provide housing for themselves, with the aid of the fiscal incentives available, and that those unable to do so from their own resources would have access to social housing or income support to rent private housing. Existing legislation and funding programmes support this strategy. Consequently, the Government believes that it would be inappropriate to legislate for a specific right to housing on the basis that the funding commitment to the various housing programmes is leading to increased outputs and that decisions on the allocation of financial resources are a matter for the democratically accountable Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_9963">Within the current legislative framework, the Government has been able to place a strong focus on assisting homeless households in recent years. According to the assessment of housing need carried out by local authorities in March 2002, there were a total of 3,773 homeless households in the country at the time of assessment compared to 3,743 households in 1999. The vast majority of these were in homeless accommodation ranging from emergency to long-term supported housing rather than on the streets.</p>
            <p eId="para_9964">As part of the Government's homeless strategy, local authorities, together with the Health Service Executive and other statutory and voluntary bodies, are required to draw up local action plans to tackle homelessness. These plans are now being implemented under the aegis of the local homeless fora and significant progress is being made in meeting the accommodation and care needs of homeless persons. A wide range of additional accommodation has been provided, ranging from emergency night shelter to long-term sheltered accommodation, to enable homeless persons move out of emergency accommodation into long-term accommodation that is more suited to their needs. Increased levels of day care facilities as well as specific provisions to meet the needs of people with addiction problems or who are sleeping rough as well as homeless offenders have been put in place. Further facilities will be provided as part of the full implementation of the homeless action plans.</p>
            <p eId="para_9965">While the emphasis to date has been on the provision of emergency accommodation, the focus is now shifting to the provision of long-term accommodation and the supports required to meet the non-accommodation needs of homeless persons. This aspect will be addressed in the context of the Department's social housing programmes in future years.</p>
            <p eId="para_9966">Substantial additional funding has been made available to support the implementation of the homeless strategies. Capital funding for the direct provision by local authorities of accommodation for homeless persons is being doubled from €25.4 million to €50.8 million during the period 2001-05. Funding continues to be made available to the voluntary sector for the provision of accommodation for homeless persons under the Department's capital assistance scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_9967">Current funding provided by my Department for accommodation related homeless services has increased substantially from €12.6 million in 2000 to €51 million this year. This brings the total provision since 2000 to €236 million. Substantial funding is also provided via the Department of Health and Children to meet the care and support needs of homeless persons. An independent review of the operation of the homeless strategies and action plans is underway. I anticipate that the draft outcome of the review will be available around the end of May.</p>
            <p eId="para_9968">In addition to homelessness, the Government has been very conscious of the need to address a broad spectrum of housing need. Over €2 billion will be spent in 2005 on a range of targeted housing measures. This is double the level of investment in 2000. It is anticipated that existing social and affordable housing measures will assist approximately 15,000 to 16,000 households in 2005, including households assisted through the new rental accommodation scheme. Resources are also being used to improve the living environment of existing tenants of social rented accommodation and to adapt homes of people with special housing needs in owner occupied housing. Recently introduced five-year action plans for social and affordable housing prepared by local authorities at city-county level will ensure that these resources are used effectively to provide the optimum level of quality housing in a manner which breaks cycles of dependency and disadvantage.</p>

            <p eId="para_10186">Under the Waste Management Act 1996, there is a general duty of care on the holder of a waste certificate to ensure that such waste is disposed of in a manner that does not cause, or is unlikely to cause, environmental pollution. All businesses have a general responsibility to ensure their waste is collected by an authorised operator to be disposed of in the proper manner. Under the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003, major producers have the option of either complying directly with the producer responsibility obligations — that is, self compliance — or alternatively obtaining an exemption from such requirements by becoming a member of a packaging waste compliance scheme. I am satisfied that adequate options are available in regard to the proper treatment of waste arising from commercial activities.</p>

            <p eId="para_10188">Waste management planning is primarily a function of local authorities and they are responsible for ensuring that facilities identified as being necessary in their regional waste management plans are provided. In general, access to such facilities for recycling purposes is in many cases provided free of direct charge in respect of normal household waste being sent for recycling. Those generating waste as a result of commercial activity can reasonably be expected to pay for its recovery, recycling or disposal. Since November 2002, €50 million has been allocated nationally from the environment fund in capital grant assistance towards the provision of a range of waste recycling and recovery facilities by local authorities, including composting-green waste facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_10189">A further call for projects requiring funding under my Department's waste infrastructure capital grants scheme has recently been issued and I hope to allocate a fourth major tranche of funding before this summer. In addition to providing capital support to local authorities for recycling and recovery facilities, funding is also being provided from the environment fund on an ongoing basis towards the current operating costs of such facilities.</p>

        <b>Mr. Gormley</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</b>
        the reason the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 specifically exclude educational facilities, child care facilities and hospitals from the schedule of buildings on which telecommunications antennae can be installed without planning permission; and if this exclusion was made on a whim or on foot of advice or research available to his Department.

            <p eId="para_10197">The Planning and Development Regulations 2001 were approved by the Oireachtas in December 2001 following discussion at the Joint Committee on Environment and Local Government on 13 December 2001. As the then Minister stated in his address to the committee, the main concern relating to health issues as regards telecommunications antennae was whether it was likely that there could be public exposure to non-ionising radiation and in excess of those limits specified by the Director for Telecommunications Regulation and, to address this matter, the regulations stipulated that the emissions from any antennae must comply with the limits set down by the Director for Telecommunications Regulation. However, as the Minister also stated, he appreciated the concern that some members of the public had about perceived health risks and telecommunications antennae and, in view of the concerns expressed by committee members, he excluded educational buildings, child care facilities and hospitals from the type of permitted buildings to which antennae may be attached.</p>

        his views on the recommendation of the British independent expert group on mobile phones (details supplied) and on the British Government’s response; his views on whether the British approach is an example of good practice in this area; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_10199">The erection of all telecommunications masts already requires planning permission from the relevant planning authority unless specifically exempted under the Planning and Development Act or Regulations. The proposed British Government response to the report from the independent expert group on mobile phones appears similar to our requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_10200">The legislation governing the planning system has been comprehensively reviewed in recent years culminating in the Planning and Development Act 2000 and associated regulations. I am satisfied that requirements relating to mobile phone masts have been well addressed from a planning perspective within this process.</p>
