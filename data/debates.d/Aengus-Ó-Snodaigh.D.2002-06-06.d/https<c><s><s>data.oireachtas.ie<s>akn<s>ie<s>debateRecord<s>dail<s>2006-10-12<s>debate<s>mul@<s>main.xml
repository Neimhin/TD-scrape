          <p eId="para_2">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the situation in which 18% of all trolley-bound patients in Ireland are located in two hospitals in the north-east region, that is, Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, with 10% of the national total of patients and Cavan General Hospital with 8%, which is a regular feature of the region; and call for the opening of the new six-bay treatment room at Monaghan General Hospital on a seven day, 24-hour basis, particularly as staffing complements have been agreed and its operation will be cost-neutral.</p>

This matter now requires urgent attention as we are only weeks away from a predictable crisis.</p>

          <p eId="para_4">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 31 to raise a matter of national importance, namely, the reason taxpayers should be obliged to pay €675,639 for ten days of Garda overtime, not including Garda salary costs, to pay for the cost of hundreds of gardaí to quash a peaceful protest against the building of the Corrib gas refinery that will be of little use to the people of County Mayo or Ireland and which Shell is able to pay, given its profits of $3 million per hour; and that the 114 gardaí deployed from divisions outside Mayo were badly needed elsewhere and the 69 who remain, not including gardaí from Mayo, are required elsewhere, such as in Moyross.</p>

          <p eId="para_35">That was an extraordinary response from the Minister for Finance.  The House collapsed last Thursday at 2.35 p.m. and was not reconvened until 3.30 p.m. because of a lack of business.  The House collapsed yesterday evening at 5.15 p.m. and could not reconvene until 7 p.m.  Today, the House has a single measure before it that probably will not occupy it beyond lunchtime.  The pretence that the Opposition orders the business of the House is completely transparent.  The reason there is no legislation, of course, is that the Government has been so preoccupied since the return of the Dáil with saving its own skin that there is no legislation to put to the House.  If the Government does not have any legislation to propose, why does it not make provision for a discussion on one of the three Morris reports?  Would it not be possible to provide for a discussion on the botched privatisation of Aer Lingus?</p>

          <p eId="para_37">Why can the House not discuss the Barr report on Abbeylara, or the conclusions of the investigation on the Dean Lyons case?  Why was no thought given to avoiding yesterday's situation, when the House was meeting but had no business to conduct?  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform spoke last week about the new laws which were proposed to allow the Government to shut down tribunals.  It was reported that Government sources had made it clear that the Minister, Deputy McDowell, had indicated the legislation was a priority for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  If it was a priority for the Department, why did it fall off the schedule yesterday and today?  It is not on the schedule for next week, although some other major business is planned that should last approximately half a day in each case.  I understand the House will debate the Nuclear Test Ban Bill 2006, which decrees that "a person who carries out, or causes the carrying out of, a nuclear explosion in the State shall be guilty of an offence".</p>

          <p eId="para_94">The White Paper on Irish Aid refers to the need for a debate in the parliamentary assemblies of Europe on the issue of development.  What arrangements are being made for a debate on the White Paper in this House?  The White Paper does not include a commitment to the UN Convention against Corruption being ratified by Ireland.  I want to save time in future by putting it to the Minister for Finance now that he should give the House a list of the UN conventions which have been signed by Ireland but not ratified.  Is the Minister not concerned that the UN Convention against Corruption will not be ratified in the lifetime of this Government?  Is he concerned that the White Paper on Irish Aid, which took such a long time to produce, does not include a commitment to passing the legislation needed to ratify the convention in the lifetime of the Government?  Perhaps the House will be given an assurance next week as to whether the iodine tablets are out of date.</p>

          <p eId="para_95">I agree with the Deputy that the ratification of international conventions is important.  The leader of his party ridiculed one such convention in his contribution earlier this morning.  The various conventions deal with important matters which need to be addressed.  I am glad some people in the Labour Party do not regard it as a matter of ridicule that international conventions should be ratified and discussed in the House.  I will seek to obtain the list required by the Deputy.  As he is aware, there have always been delays between the ratification and signing of international conventions.  The domestic business of the House has taken precedence on many occasions.  I accept this matter has been of continuing interest to the Deputy.  I will ask the relevant Departments to convey the current position to him.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_202">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_203">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_204">This amending legislation responds to a number of issues, some of which have been raised by industry as matters of concern for Irish companies.  In particular, the development and growth of the securitisation industry, which has enormous potential, has been placed at a significant disadvantage by the reluctance of insurers to underwrite risks that their international competitors would not be similarly required to undertake.  The provision on dematerialisation is necessary to allow Irish companies to continue to compete in international markets, thereby allowing us to maintain our competitiveness in key areas where it has been established.  The need to increase the audit exemption threshold for companies also requires priority treatment.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">In addition, key provisions are included to allow for the smooth and effective transposition of the EU transparency directive which deals with the disclosure of information by certain listed companies on an ongoing basis.  This directive is due to be transposed by January 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">Provisions are also included relating to the amendment of the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997.  Some of these provisions are consequent on the transposition of the EU takeovers directive on 20 May last in line with the EU target date.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">It is necessary to amend the Consumer Information Act 1978 to allow for the appointment of a person to perform the functions of the Director of Consumer Affairs for a period of more than six months.  The need for this arises as a result of the resignation of the previous incumbent and in order to allow the functions of the director to continue to be carried out by a temporary appointee until the National Consumer Agency is established on a statutory basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">In summary, the amendments proposed in this Bill are designed to facilitate business development, copperfasten our competitiveness in key sectors where it has been developed and ease the regulatory burden on business while facilitating the giving of full effect to EU directives we must transpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">Ireland is now a modern, highly globalised, credibly regulated, competitive economy.  We need to ensure we retain our attractiveness as a place to do business and as a location for foreign direct investment <i>vis-à-vis</i> competitor jurisdictions.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">We will achieve this objective by committing ourselves to fostering the conditions which support enterprise and in meeting the challenges and opportunities of an increasingly knowledge-based, regulated, globalised and environmentally sustainable economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">Dublin today is recognised as a global centre for securitisation.  It is ranked only second to London and ahead of Frankfurt in terms of asset-backed securities.  The aggregate amount of asset-backed securities investments, managed by Dublin-based investors, has experienced considerable growth in recent years.  In 1999, the aggregate amount of asset-backed securities investments was around €6 billion.  This grew to between €30 billion and €35 billion in 2003 and today the figure is at least €80 billion.  These figures demonstrate the position and importance of securitisation in terms of the domestic economy and the tremendous strides made in recent times.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">The strong track record that Ireland has developed in the asset-backed securities sector is a result of many factors.  These include a conducive business environment, a common law system and the presence of skilled personnel with considerable international experience.  All of these factors, together with Government support, have fuelled the growth I have described.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">Existing developments in securitisation afford us the potential to develop as a primary centre for specialist debt-financing products.  Business regulation in the field of company law feeds into improvements to our national competitiveness, through high standards of corporate governance, and brings about a stable and predictable environment in which entrepreneurs can establish businesses, investors can invest, creditors can lend and the interests of the employees, consumers and other stakeholders are protected.</p>
          <p eId="para_214">Ireland's economic future is inextricably bound up with the global economy through investment, trade, people and business generally.  We must be at the top of the game in every aspect that affects competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_215">I will now turn to the provisions of the Bill and explain in greater detail what each is designed to achieve.  Part 1 of the Bill, which covers sections 1 to 5, contains some preliminary technical matters, including the commencement of the legislation, interpretation, the making of orders and regulations and how parts of the Bill will relate to the existing Companies Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_216">Part 2, which covers sections 6 to 8 of the Bill, provides for various amendments to company law legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_217">Section 6 amends section 32 of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1999 to increase the audit exemption limits for turnover and balance sheet totals, which will allow more companies to avail of the audit exemption.</p>
          <p eId="para_218">Exemption from audit removes the need for companies to engage an independent, external auditor and is allowed under EU law since 1978.  Audit exemption was introduced in Ireland in February 2000 under Part III of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1999.  The provision in this Bill increases the turnover limit to €7.3 million and the balance sheet total limit to €3.65 million.  The existing thresholds are €1.5 million and €1.9 million, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_219">The background to this initiative is that, in July 2005, a small business forum to was set up to consider the environment in which small businesses operate in Ireland.  Among the topics the forum examined was the current level of audit exemption allowable in Ireland.  Its examination focused on the disparity between the turnover threshold in Ireland of €1.5 million and that in the UK and a number of other member states where it was pitched at the EU maximum permissible threshold of €7.3 million.  It reasoned that increasing our audit exemption threshold to €7.3 million would bring Ireland into line with its nearest competitor and a number of member states, and this formed the basis for one of the recommendations in its report of April 2006.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">I am most anxious that the new thresholds should be available to companies for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2007.  However, one will note from the text of the measure that a minimum two-month gap has been provided for between commencement of the provision and the financial year in which it can take effect.  This delay has been inserted to allow for a stipulated minimum minority of shareholders to object to a company availing of the audit exemption.  With the provision as drafted at present, and given how close we are to the end of the year, it is unlikely that the Bill could be enacted in sufficient time to enable companies to avail of the new exemption thresholds for the financial year beginning on 1 January 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_221">Rather than simply accepting this, I have asked officials of my Department to re-examine the measure to determine whether it could be refined in such a way as to make it capable of being availed of from the desired date.  As a result, a formula that I hope will achieve this objective is being worked on and it will, I hope, form the basis of an amendment to address this issue on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_222">Section 7 amends section 239 of the 1990 Act to allow the Minister to provide by regulations for the introduction of mandatory dematerialisation of securities of listed or unlisted PLCs.  Dematerialisation is an electronic system to replace paper share certificates and stock transfer forms.  These will be replaced by a paper shareholder statement and shareholder reference number.  The provision also allows the regulations to provide for any necessary consequential provisions to implement this requirement.  Securities markets worldwide are undergoing significant changes as to the manner in which transactions are processed with a view to providing a more efficient and harmonised processing of securities transactions.  An extensive consultation carried out by the Irish Stock Exchange in late 2004 established that dematerialisation should be pursued as a matter of priority for the Irish equity market.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">As many Irish equities are listed on both the Irish and UK markets, it is desirable from an Irish perspective that dematerialisation is implemented in as similar a manner as possible in both markets.  The Irish market generally is keen to ensure that Ireland responds appropriately and immediately so that it is in line with best international practice.  Failure to progress this issue will be a competitive disadvantage to the Irish market in an increasingly harmonised European securities market.  Both retail and professional investors in the Irish equity market would directly experience the benefits of dematerialisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">The removal of share certificates from the Irish equity market is a strategic imperative in order to meet the best practice benchmarks of the global market.  Dematerialisation will facilitate ease and speed of trading by investors; enhance the international competitiveness of Ireland for securities trading; reduce the current costs associated with the cumbersome process of managing paper-based transactions; and avoid the risk of the escalation of the current settlement costs for Irish certificated transactions, which would occur if there was a successful implementation of dematerialisation of UK securities, with share certificates still remaining for Irish securities.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">The European Commission's financial services action plan is the legislative backdrop to a considerable amount of change fundamentally impacting the operation of securities markets.  One of the core themes of the next phase of the European Commission's policy drive is clearing and settlement.  In order to prosper in this changing global environment, markets need to continually critically assess and develop their offerings to ensure they are meeting the demands of their customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">Dematerialisation has already taken place in many other countries such as France, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, India, Australia and New Zealand.  I understand it is being considered in the UK, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and the US.  It is important to reiterate that dematerialisation will not impact in any way on the legal ownership rights of shareholders, as those who currently hold shares in certificated form and who are on a share register will continue to hold securities on the share register in their own name.  Shareholders will also continue to retain the right to receive information that is currently provided to those whose names appear on the share register of the company, such as annual reports and corporate action information as well as dividends.  This information will continue to be provided directly by the company, or its registrar, to the shareholder.</p>
          <p eId="para_227">Section 8 amends section 43 of the 2005 Act relating to prospectuses in order to limit the obligations of a guarantor in respect of statements included in, or omitted from, a prospectus relating to non-equity securities, apart from those that relate to the guarantor or the guarantee.  This amendment is designed to address an issue which is causing great concern for the securitisation industry.  The current wording of the law relating to prospectuses which was introduced last year has created a potential liability for financial guarantee insurers known as "monoline insurers".  This has resulted in the monoline industry advising issuers that it is not willing to insure their products listed in, or issued out of, Ireland.  Business lost to other jurisdictions as a result of this will be difficult to attract back, so swift action is required to deal with this situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">Part 3 covers sections 9 to 14 of the Bill.  It contains provisions designed to facilitate the smooth and effective transposition of the EU transparency directive.  The directive applies to certain listed companies, those whose securities are admitted to trading on a regulated market, and is due to be transposed into Irish law by January 2007.  The transparency directive will raise the quality of information available to investors on companies' performance and financial positions as well as on changes in major shareholdings.  This should contribute to better investor protection, enhanced investor confidence and a better functioning of European capital markets.  The provisions of Part 3 mirror similar provisions included in the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005 in connection with the transposition of the market abuse and prospectus directives last year.  Section 9 provides for definitions used in Part 3.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">Section 10 gives the Minister power to make regulations to give effect to the transparency directive and any other supplemental measures.  Regulations to implement the transparency directive are being prepared.  However, certain provisions must be made in primary law.  Section 11 provides for penalties on conviction on indictment for offences under Irish transparency law.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">Section 12 gives the Financial Regulator, who is being designated competent authority for purposes of the directive, the power to make supplementary rules to allow the regulator to fulfil his or her role as competent authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">Section 13 amends the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended, to include the transparency directive in the list of directives which the Central Bank and Financial Regulator have responsibility to enforce.  This deals with confidentiality of information obtained by the competent authority and effectively prohibits its disclosure except by virtue of Irish transparency law.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">Section 14 provides that the Minister may, by order, cite the markets to which transparency law shall apply.  It is important that requirements under the transparency directive be capable of being applied to markets outside the scope of the directive, for example the Irish Enterprise Exchange market, and to any new market that may be established in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_233">Part 4, which covers sections 15 to 21 deals with miscellaneous amendments to the Takeover Panel and Consumer Information Acts.</p>
          <p eId="para_234">Sections 15 and 16 amend section 2 of the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997.  Under section 2 of the Irish Takeover Panel Act as originally enacted, the provisions applied to companies whose securities were quoted on markets regulated by a recognised stock exchange.  The Irish Stock Exchange was the only prescribed recognised stock exchange.  Moreover, the focus of the Act was on securities that gave the holders voting rights — that is, enabled them to effectively control a company.  By virtue of the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997 (Relevant Company) Regulations 2001, SI 87 of 2001, Irish companies whose securities were not listed on the Irish Stock Exchange, but were listed on a number of specified foreign markets, were brought within the scope of the Irish Takeover Panel.  The 2001 regulations applied in respect of companies which, while no longer being listed on any of these markets, had been listed on any one of them in the previous five years.  In view of the fact that the focus of the Irish Takeover Panel Act is on those securities that give effective control over the affairs of a company, as represented by the holding of securities carrying voting rights, and as the Financial Services Funds Industry has increasingly used the company structure as one of its entities of choice in developing investment projects, principally through the issue and listing of debt securities, where the control of the company through voting rights is not an issue, section 75 of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005 exempted such companies from the remit of the Irish Takeover Panel, but only in so far as they were listed on the market operated by the Irish Stock Exchange.  These provisions make similar changes in respect of debt securities listings on the markets brought in by the 2001 regulations.  These provisions were inserted on Committee Stage in the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_235">Section 17 amends section 8 of the Irish Takeover Act 1997 to allow the Takeover Panel to make provision in its rules to give effect to EU law in this area.  The need for this amendment to be made in primary law only arose quite recently in the context of the transposition of the EU takeovers directive which came into effect on 20 May 2006.  The Takeover Panel, which has been designated as the competent authority for purposes of the directive, already has the power to make rules under section 8 of the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997.  This power is not, however, wide enough to enable the panel to make rules directly to give effect to changes in this area arising from the takeovers directive, and such power must be provided separately and in primary law, to reflect a number of judicial decisions of recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_236">Section 18 amends the Schedule to the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997 to align the general principles in the Schedule to the 1997 Act with those of the takeover bids directive as transposed in Regulation 7 of SI 255 of 2006, except for the Substantial Acquisition of Securities General Principles, which is being retained.  The objective here is to have one set of general principles to apply to all the transactions comprehended in the 1997 Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_237">Section 19 is a consequential provision to sections 15 and 16.  It revokes the 2001 regulations I mentioned earlier and was inserted on Committee Stage in the Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_238">Section 20 is a consequential provision on section 18.  It amends regulation 7 of SI 255 of 2006 — the regulations which transposed the general principles of the Takeover Bids Directive.  The purpose of the amendment is to effectively repeal the general principles in regulation 7, as these will be reflected in the amended Schedule in section 18, and to remove any confusion which may be caused by the existence of two sets of general principles.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">Section 21 amends the Consumer Information Act 1978 by repealing section 9(11)(<i>b</i>).  The amendment is required to allow for the appointment of a person to perform the functions of the Director of Consumer Affairs for a period of more than six months.  The need for this arises as a result of the resignation of the previous incumbent and to allow the functions of the director to continue to be carried out by a temporary appointee until the National Consumer Agency is established on a statutory basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">The Government is committed to supporting industry by responding in an appropriate way to the new challenges which are presented by this ever-changing global marketplace.  The Bill is evidence of this commitment and I commend it to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_248">Fine Gael will support this Bill.  This is important legislation in the context of the issues the Minister of State alluded to, particularly regarding the dematerialisation of security certification.  This has become an issue in recent times, with particular reference to our relationship with Britain.  I am conscious that this is an urgent issue.  The Bill also deals with the transposition of an EU directive on transparency and takeovers.  The Bill gives us an opportunity to assess where we stand on investment, consumer law and the health and well-being of our companies.  Today's economic climate is excellent.  All the economic growth indicators are solid.  We have warnings from time to time from the usual sources such as the Central Bank and the ESRI——</p>

          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_254">It is an independent group that meets from time to time to assess our performance.  The Taoiseach and the then Tánaiste were warned in December 2001 that Ireland was becoming a high cost location for business.  The electoral cycle intervened in 2002 and the issues that were raised have not been addressed.  In recent years, the solution for dealing with matters of direct and indirect cost problems in the economy was to establish a regulator.  No matter where the problem was in the economy, regulators were established under the guise of enhancing competition.</p>
          <p eId="para_255">Regulators have failed for one reason: no political perspective or direction has been given to them.  It should have been given to them on their establishment so that they understand it is not just a matter of bringing new players into the market, but also ensuring that it does not grant increases in prices across the public utilities and local government charges on top of the existing high cost base.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">We need to assess where we are going with the regulators that have been appointed and the policy remit that has been given to them.  We do not need to look any further than the recent activities of the Commission For Energy Regulation.  It has sanctioned 34% and 20% increases in gas and electricity prices respectively.  At a time when wholesale prices on the oil markets are going down, these price increases have been suggested.  The ordinary business consumer cannot understand it.  The manner in which the CER makes its calculations often uses a historical cost base.</p>
          <p eId="para_257">The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resource, Deputy Noel Dempsey, stands idly by and sees no necessity to meet with the CER and seek to understand the rationale for approving these price increases.  I ask the Minister of State to convey this view to the CER.  I do not mind if he does so directly or indirectly.  This House is not satisfied that the establishment of a Commission for Energy Regulation has been successful from the perspective of the consumer or the economy as a whole.</p>
          <p eId="para_258">We were told that we would have to raise energy prices in order to encourage other firms to compete with the ESB in the provision of electricity generation.  What kind of logic is that?  At a time when small business people must be conscious of the competition they endure from eastern Europe and the Far East, our policy gives the regulator a free hand to increase costs irrespective of properly explaining the necessity for this to either the Government or the public.  We require a trigger mechanism, politically as well as economically, for the Government to deal with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_259">The Central Bank regularly preaches about the high level of personal indebtedness of our citizens.  It talks of the irresponsible nature of people in taking 100% interest only loans from the associated banks and building societies.  The Central Bank could do something about this in the morning if it wished.  In conjunction with IFSRA, the Central Bank is the supervisory authority for dealing with the associated banks.  The Central Bank and the Department of Finance set down banking policy.  The Governor of the Central Bank regularly lectures on the dangers of holding high levels of personal debt.  If there is, as expected, a further 1% rise in interest rates from the ECB, what impact will this have on disposable household income?  If the Central Bank is so concerned about the irresponsibility of these practices, why has it not done something about it?  This would ensure a soft landing if there were to be changes in the construction or property sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_260">The level of personal indebtedness is at a record high.  We have moved from having a high national debt to having a high level of personal indebtedness.  Citizens are still in debt, in an irresponsible way according to the Central Bank.  The role and function of the Central Bank needs to be called into question if it is going to allow itself to be drawn into a debate about the fact that it has done nothing towards meeting the policy objectives regularly enunciated by the Governor.</p>
          <p eId="para_261">The increase in the cost base of the economy caused by the indirect taxes and charges imposed by the Government since 2002 has been over the top.  VAT was increased by 1% in the first budget after the 2002 general election.  The Government also applied a 9% stamp duty rate, up from 6%, on commercial transactions in that budget.  I know substantial revenue has been raised by this, but people have to trade and do business.  They must now factor this into their costs.  Enormous sums of money are required to keep small businesses going.  In addition to those issues, the inactivity of regulators in introducing new competitors to the market and reducing costs has been striking.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">I have been critical of the Competition Authority for some time.  It exposed its own ineffectiveness as recently as this week when it allowed the Statoil takeover to take place by letting the time in which it had to make a submission expire.  That is disgraceful action by the Competition Authority.  Has the Minister called in the new chairman, Mr. Prasifka, and his team to find out the reason that happened?  That action has effectively created a monopoly in petrol station outlets in this jurisdiction.  There are many examples of companies being put through the rigours of the law by the Competition Authority for what appears, on the face of it, less dominance in the marketplace.  What is in place now is effectively a monopoly in terms of the sale of petrol in forecourts throughout the country.  The authority stands indicted on that matter and it should be deeply embarrassed about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">In conjunction with my colleague, Deputy Lynch, I intend to invite representatives from the authority to the next meeting of the Oireachtas committee to ask them what went wrong, what they are doing about it and what resources they require, if resources are an issue, to keep up with the takeover issues mentioned, even throughout this Bill.  Perhaps we should amend the legislation in that context to ensure nothing like that happens again, notwithstanding the incompetence of the Competition Authority on this occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">The Internal Market has enormous potential for Irish consumers.  As an island nation, we are on the periphery of Europe but consumers here do not get the benefits of bulk purchasing, buying or selling available to consumers on the mainland of Europe.  It is critical that the Commissioner, Mr. McCreevy, takes every opportunity, with the necessary support and impetus of the Government, to implement the trans-frontier trading and Internal Market services that can be provided much more freely than is available currently to us.  If the Internal Market is brought to its logical conclusion, it will create difficulties, but it will set up consumers for a bonanza and it is up to Irish business, and the Government through its policy, to ensure we are competitive.  It is a challenge, and I realise some vested countries here will not want that, but if we are serious about keeping prices down for consumers and business, we must take action in the Internal Market.  Commissioner McCreevy has promoted the concept of completing the Internal Market in a number of areas as quickly as possible.  He deserves the full support of this House in realising the potential for small businesses and consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">On the audit exemption, as the Minister of State is aware, I tabled an amendment in that regard in previous legislation and it was voted down.  I am glad the Government has changed its mind and brought into line our own audit exemption thresholds with our neighbours in Northern Ireland and in the United Kingdom in particular.  The Minister of State will be aware from his previous profession that there is substantial leakage of business from this jurisdiction into Northern Ireland because of the failure to implement the issue of increasing audit exemption thresholds.  When I proposed such an amendment on Committee Stage of the Companies Bill, the then Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, appeared not to fully understand the leakage of business that was taking place.  I am glad the Minister of State has now rectified that matter and brought it into line in terms of the competitive area in respect of those services, namely, the British and Irish markets.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">The role of financial services in this jurisdiction has been enormous.  I add my support and congratulations to the efforts made to make the Irish financial services sector in Dublin one of the leading such sectors in Europe and the world.  The number of well-paid, good quality jobs that have been created in Dublin arose from the foresight in the late 1980s of the former Taoiseach, the late Charles Haughey, who did not get sufficient credit for it.  Nevertheless, the support of the financial sector in bringing the necessary hedge fund companies into the financial services area has not only benefited financial services in Dublin, but there has been a trickle of employment into the various regions arising from the financial services dynamic created by that initiative.  In my constituency and that of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, there is an important employer, State Street International, which now employs up to 400 people in the city of Kilkenny.  That is just one example of the considerable progress that has been made in bringing some modicum of financial services employment and understanding of this complex area into the regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">We cannot be complacent about these issues, however, because there is keen competition from Belfast and Luxembourg.  If foreign direct investment is coming to this jurisdiction, those companies do not see the difference between North and South of Ireland and Luxembourg or any of the countries in Europe.  They see Europe as the location and we must be ever vigilant of making the necessary changes and be adaptable to ensure we have a strong financial services sector here.  The Government must be conscious of that aspect.</p>
          <p eId="para_268">On consumer protection, I have been critical of the Government about the lack of consumer policy in recent years.  The Minister, Deputy Martin, decided belatedly that the National Consumer Agency should be established on an interim basis.  He took his time about doing that because he did not appreciate the urgency of it.  The previous Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, did not see the need for it.</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#PhilipHogan" eId="spk_217">
          <from>Mr. Hogan</from>
          <p eId="para_270">In an open market it is fine, in theory, to say we must shop around but Irish consumers are in a small market, often in areas where there is not much choice, particularly rural areas where the question of shopping around does not arise.  If we are talking about the basic basket of goods on which people must survive on a day-to-day basis, the Government's policy of abolishing the groceries order was welcome but what it put in its place was critical.  The Companies (Amendment) Act did not address the issues that would have ensured that the pockets of consumers benefited from whatever competition came into the food sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_271">The Government's policy has put more money into the pockets of the large multinational companies and the major supermarkets at the expense of small suppliers and consumers.  We have not seen the benefits of the notional figure trotted out by the then chairman of the Competition Authority, Dr. Fingleton, that there would be an annual saving of €500, on average, per household.  That was nonsense but, unfortunately, the Government accepted his view without any analysis in terms of how that laudable objective would be achieved.  We are all in the business of trying to ensure that customers have the highest possible disposable income and that they are not ripped off, but a theoretical notion of how that might be achieved was advanced by the Competition Authority and the Minister of the day accepted it without question.</p>
          <p eId="para_272">Legislation must be introduced to ensure that the rebates and discounts available now to the large suppliers with financial muscle in this jurisdiction in terms of the purchase of food products are passed on to consumers rather than pocketed in higher profits.  One multiple has boasted that it offers significant grocery price cuts on products previously covered by the groceries order, but it did not highlight the increases on products not covered by the groceries order.  The overall budget available to the Irish consumer means that prices have increased by an average of 10% in the past year.  That is because the Government would not listen to the advice it got on the issue from many quarters, including Members of this House who sit on the Government benches.</p>
          <p eId="para_273">The Minister should consider amending the Companies Act to ensure greater transparency in the food sector and in price sensitive areas generally that are important to the household budget.  We should amend the Companies Act to ensure transparency in turnover and profitability on the big multiples here.  That was a recommendation in the report of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business which was not implemented.  This legislation provides another opportunity to do so in order to know whether the price strategies of these companies are contributing to higher profits at the expense of the consumer.  We know the companies' turnover in this jurisdiction, as well as the turnover of some private companies which are not obliged to release this information.  From the information they release we can see the pricing areas on which we must focus in the interest of consumers.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Another area of consumer protection is the lack of information given to clients purchasing investment products.  As an accountant, the Minister of State is aware of the plethora of policy proposals, including life policies or investment intermediary products, available to consumers.  Little information is available to consumers before they sign on the dotted line and begin paying the premium, which is frustrating for them.  As a former insurance intermediary, I was always conscious of the lack of information available to people who were not brought up in the culture of understanding investment, the stock exchange, equity investment and other factors that make up the return one should receive as suggested by the sales pitch.  Insufficient information is provided and insurance companies should be required to give further information to clients on investment and to be transparent in explanations.  Funds may perform well or badly and there is a minimum and maximum return on a fund, depending on performance.  At a time when people have money to spend and as many SSIAs will be maturing shortly we must work to make more investment information available to clients.  The differences between products are confusing and there may be hidden charges of which banking institutions or building societies are not fully informing customers.  Analysis is required by IFSRA to demonstrate the difference between products so people can compare them and not be exposed to risk or hidden charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">In the 1970s and 1980s, some financial investment brokers played on the weaknesses of ordinary people when they received a lump sum from the sale of property or road construction works being carried out.  We cannot be overprotective of such a sum on behalf of people who wish to have a nest egg for retirement or for family members.  There are too many examples of misappropriation of money.  This Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill provides an opportunity to reflect on whether we have sufficient protection and information for consumers.  For the people involved this may be a very important investment decision and may have a major impact on how they retire.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Fine Gael supports this legislation and understands the valid reasons why the Government is bringing it before the Houses.  I will table some amendments, to which I have referred.  I hope this legislation will provide an opportunity to demonstrate to the Irish people that the Competition Authority is awake to the consequences for consumers of investment funds and takeover bids.  It will not stand idly by and allow such matters to occur without regulation.  We also have a review of regulators, who regulate on behalf of the country, its citizens and customers and not on behalf of vested interests.</p>

          <p eId="para_283">The potential of the sections of this Bill dealing with the securitisation industry is important.  The securitisation industry is a major sector of international financial business, and our current legislative framework is restrictive compared to our European counterparts.  The success of the new financial services hub in the Dublin docklands, and of the business it generates across the country, will rest on the ease with which international financial services business can be conducted under Irish law.  The securitisation industry is one of many where we must be sure we get the right mix of regulation for the protection of customers, most of whom are businesses, and flexibility of operation for businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">The owners of small and medium businesses will welcome the thrust of increases in audit exemption thresholds.  Reducing bureaucracy and the regulatory burden on small businesses is a key element of Labour's enterprise policy.  This move will bring us to approximately the same limits as the United Kingdom and to the EU maximum.  Small businesses are the great drivers behind our economy.  All companies started small.  We must work to enable as many as possible to grow to become large companies, a matter on which the Government and Opposition agree.  While we may wish for fewer companies to be covered by the audit requirements we hope more companies can grow to the size that will require full audits.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">There is a minor anomaly in this section of the Bill, which we will examine more closely on Committee Stage.  The Minister of State might consider it with respect to amendments he may make.  New international auditing standards are to be implemented from now on in auditing of company accounts.  Many small accountancy firms have a large proportion of clients who currently fall within the requirements for audited accounts, but would fall outside those limits after this Bill is passed.  The cost to small accounting businesses of training up or outsourcing to meet these standards is quite significant, especially when one considers they will probably only need that knowledge for one financial year.  The Minister of State should examine this on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">The dematerialisation of securities will bring us broadly in line with the rest of Europe, especially with regard to compatibility with the CREST system.  However, there is some concern on this point.  The explanatory memorandum released with the Bill suggests that dematerialisation will affect only securities of companies trading on a regulated market.  I heard the Minister of State speak about this in his opening speech.  It appears to the Labour Party and to all those it has consulted, among them very eminent corporate lawyers, that the provisions will apply to all public companies, including those with securities listed on IEX and AIM.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">A more welcome aspect of this section is that we can be assured it will reduce paperwork.  If only we could do the same for public representatives.  The many members of the public who were stung by the Government in the Eircom flotation and now own shares in Vodafone as a result will be aware of the volumes of paperwork that pass through their hands in respect of minor changes in shareholdings, especially if they are reinvesting their dividends in the share purchase scheme.  Under current regulations, additional share certificates must be issued every time a shareholder's stake is increased or decreased, even if the change only involves a single share.  Under the changes proposed here, these alterations in shareholdings could be conducted electronically for those persons who wish it, thereby not only saving the small shareholder the significant inconvenience of securely storing valuable share certificates but also preventing the considerable environmental damage caused by printing and distributing that many share certificates.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">When he discussed this Bill in the Seanad, Senator Quinn informed the House of the difficulties which he, an eminent and highly experienced businessman, had in reconstituting some of his shareholdings after a fire in his office.  If an individual like Senator Quinn, who is an expert in the field of business and shares, could experience these difficulties, one wonders how a normal member of the public would fare.  The creation of a system allowing for electronic versions of shareholdings would give those members of the public, as well as experienced shareholders and businesses, an additional backup should events such as those which befell Senator Quinn take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">The transposition of the transparency directive is welcome.  However, I question whether the Government will steer this Bill through all Stages by the transposition deadline in January 2007.  This directive has been on the books since 2004.  Why was it not transposed in the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005?  This is an important directive and it compliments the earlier prospectus directive and market abuse directive.  It will bring an additional level of protection for small investors, in particular, who may not have the same research resources as the pension funds and larger investors.  I also hope the Minister will be allocating some additional resources to the Financial Regulator to police this new provision, one which is obviously taken seriously given the inclusion of criminal sanctions.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">The completion of transposition of the takeover directive will also be enacted by this Bill.  However, as with far too many directives recently, this final part of the transposition is significantly past the deadline agreed by EU member states, including Ireland.  The original transposition by SI 255 of 2006 was sloppy because it created two sets of general principles to be followed by the takeovers panel.  This directive should have been completely and properly transposed by last May at the latest.  Again, it was agreed in early 2004.  As with the transparency directive, I would like the Minister of State to explain why this directive was not fully transposed earlier.  If we continue to be so sloppy in respect of directives, we will quickly fall behind the rest of Europe in our corporate regulatory structure.</p>
          <p eId="para_291">In respect of the provisions of the takeover directive transposition section of this Bill, Part 4, and the amendments to the Irish Takeover Panel Act 1997, I am glad to see the takeover panel will now be empowered to consider relevant EU law when ruling on takeover applications.  However, the Labour Party has a problem with section 18 of this Bill, which would repeal section 9(11)(<i>b</i>) of the Consumer Information Act 1978, as amended, and has already been discussed by Deputy Hogan.  Section 18 allows for the post of Director of Consumer Affairs to be left empty for more than six months.  Surely a more suitable solution would be to appoint a person to replace the resigning director fully and appoint a new Director of Consumer Affairs until such time as the national consumer agency can be fully established.  Continuing for an indefinite period with an interim acting director is unfair both on the person in question and on his or her staff and must necessarily weaken the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs at a time when consumers need more protection than ever before.  On a related point, I would appreciate if the Minister could tell me when he expects the national consumer agency to be fully established by statute.  Can we take it from this section of the Bill that it is not envisaged this will happen in the immediate future?</p>
          <p eId="para_292">The moving of this Bill again brings to the forefront a problem which has been of serious concern for some time.  We are still waiting for the Company Law Consolidation and Reform Bill, which was promised several years ago.  There are at least 15, and some estimate there may be more than 20, different pieces of legislation in the field of company law which businesses must bear in mind.  The difficulties created by this and the necessary complexity of corporate legal issues that arise from time to time are a significant drain on resources, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
          <p eId="para_293">Consolidating all company law into one single piece of legislation would greatly simplify the matter for small business owners and directors.  It would allow them to easily understand their rights and obligations without requiring them to have recourse to legal advisers on even the most minor issues.  I am informed the company law review group, which was established by my colleague, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, when he was Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, will soon publish the result of its extremely extensive investigation and attempt at consolidation of the existing body of corporate law.  I hope the Minister of State will take this opportunity to assure the House that he will move this process forward to the introduction of a Bill to the House as soon as possible because it is clear to everyone that it is urgently needed.  It will be a massive Bill with hundreds of sections and require intense and deep scrutiny by every party in the House.  There is every possibility this Bill will be taken by the Labour Party in Government.</p>

          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_296">I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage.  While there may be difficulties on Committee Stage, I hope to speak on Report Stage.  A number of measures in the Bill will be welcomed across the House.  The Green Party launched a paper this year which dealt with trying to ease the burden of regulation, particularly on small Irish businesses.  I welcome the proposal in the Bill to raise the audit exemption limit to the maximum amount allowed in the EU.  It is not a fundamental change because many small companies will still have to draw up their annual accounts and submit them to the Companies Registration Office and will still use accountants in this regard.  However, it does reduce the cost somewhat.  In particular, as the audit requirements become onerous each year, it makes it easier for accountancy practices dealing with those small companies not to have to go through unnecessary regulatory and bureaucratic control.</p>
          <p eId="para_297">I was a small businessman before I entered the House and I found the relationship with my company accountant to be extremely beneficial and positive.  The annual audit was one of the few occasions when I was probably pulled back to the nuts and bolts of what the business was actually doing and whether it was making money.  It is very important to maintain and encourage this connection between the accountancy profession and small Irish businesses but it does not need to include regulated and audited accounts which more properly apply to larger businesses.  The audit exemption limit of €7.3 million is an accurate reflection of the difference between small and medium-sized companies which might be forced to take on those.</p>
          <p eId="para_298">I also understand and support the proposal in the Bill for the dematerialisation of the stock market share processing process within the Irish Stock Exchange and in our dealings with other international stock exchanges.  It has been promised for many years.  I remember approximately 30 years ago when computers started becoming commonplace it was stated we would have paperless offices in no time.  It is remarkable how the quantity of paper used has increased rather than decreased since then.  Dematerialisation makes sense and I welcome it.  However, it must be properly managed and major security provisions must be included to ensure fraudulent or other improper behaviour cannot take place.</p>
          <p eId="para_299">I welcome the opportunity provided by this Bill to transpose the European directive on transparency in business.  On many occasions in this House I spoke on the wisdom, merit and effectiveness of having greater transparency and openness in business decision-making.  This returns to what I stated about my experience as a small business person.  Commentators may argue greater transparency is an imposition or breaches the need for a business to have confidentiality.  I disagree.  The more business and commerce is conducted in the broad open light of day, the better the quality of business and commerce which will be undertaken.</p>
          <p eId="para_300">I will make my main comments on the provisions outlined in section 8 of the Bill, regarding the restriction of liability where non-equity securities are involved.  This is the one element of the Bill about which I am cautious.</p>
          <p eId="para_301">I welcome the development of the Irish Financial Services Centre.  It has been a major success.  Approximately 20,000 people now work there and traded finance amounts to approximately €4.5 billion net cash inflow.  We must seek to continue, support and develop that.  I attended an Irish Bankers Federation dinner at which the Taoiseach spoke.  It was noticeable the Taoiseach made clear to the banking industry that the Government would provide whatever flexibility was necessary to ensure the continued success of the IFSC.</p>
          <p eId="para_302">While I welcome that, I would sound a note of caution.  Banking, re-insurance and asset management industries seek flexible regulatory and Government support.  It is one of the criteria these industries use in deciding where to locate.  We must make that provision and be responsive.  It is extremely responsive to immediately change a provision of the 2005 Act which causes the financial services industry difficulty.  However, we must be careful to ensure standards in the industry are at the highest international level.  We must not be seen as an easy and attractive offshore haven of low taxes and a relatively light regulatory regime.  In the long run, a successful and stable financial services industry is one viewed as based on a good, strong regulatory system rather than a fly-by-night operation where rules can be bent.  Finance requires trust, and trust requires strong and effective governance and regulatory systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_303">We have natural advantages, such as our time zone location, English language usage and our education system.  For many years, Irish mothers urged Johnny or Mary to go into commerce or the bank.  In hindsight, after 20 or 30 years, it was not bad advice to have given the young men and women now working in the Irish Financial Services Centre and elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_304">A number of recent events increased my cautiousness about a particular provision in the Bill, as did reading the consideration of new non-equity products in a series of articles in <i>The Economist</i> and a number of newspapers.  Recently, <i>The Economist</i> stated phenomenal growth occurred in these slightly unusual non-equity securities.  According to a recent article in <i>The Economist</i>, last year approximately $600 billion was issued in equities throughout the world, $685 billion was issued in standard bonds and loan volumes of the new innovative financial packages, which I want to see regulated, increased to $3.5 trillion during the same period.</p>
          <p eId="para_305">An editorial article in <i>The Economist </i>stated central bankers and supervisors are increasingly worried about the risk to financial stability which may be lurking in the complex debt instruments dreamed up by the finance industry.  It also states a major concern is a potential danger to regulated banks from the faceless institutions, such as hedge funds, with which they now do much of their debt trading.  It is interesting to note these comments were made not in a socialist worker publication, but in <i>The Economist</i>, a publication at the heart of the free market and free capital movement.</p>
          <p eId="para_306">The article also argued particular risk is involved with new innovative products such as credit-default swaps and insurance products.  Two articles quote researchers at the European Central Bank as stating part of the problem with credit-default swaps is that they are used for speculation as well as hedging.  The European Central Bank is also quoted as stating, "We have introduced a new product, "insurance", that appears to be used by people not looking for insurance.  It is not the instrument[s] which [are] causing liquidity concerns but the way market participants may be using them."</p>
          <p eId="para_307">A current debate in the financial regulatory industry is whether the provision of liquidity itself will be good for markets or whether allowing such unregulated access to liquidity will build up a significant risk in the event of a downturn in the markets which could lead to an extremely serious crash.  We need only to look at the case of Brian Hunter, a Canadian hedge fund operator who made $100 million for himself during the first six months of the year.  He made $2 billion on a gas play in the hedge fund markets during the first six months of the year and subsequently lost $5 billion in a week.  That hedge fund was then in severe difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">These products and their prospectuses are extremely complex.  The companies involved are not like AIB, Bank of Ireland, Deutsche Bank or any other mainstream banks.  They are new innovative financial companies offering prospectuses for new non-equity, non-traditional bond funding often in insurance and on a credit worthy note.  That is the background to my concern on reading that section 8 appears to contain no liability other than the strict liability contained in the guarantee within such a prospectus.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">I need to hear from the Minister what exactly are the implications of this and how we will place ourselves internationally.  The Minister states in the absence of such a regulatory change, we may lose some of these new monoline insurance instruments and companies to other locations.  I am sure that is also argued by the industry.  However, we must be careful to protect existing jobs and asset management portfolios in the IFSC.  We must not simply chase after the latest, newest, most liquid financial instrument.  We must maintain Dublin's success and not always be at the edge or on the crest of the latest instrument.  This market changes extremely rapidly.  Suddenly, $30 billion is traded within a short period on new instruments which did not exist a year ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">We must walk a difficult line between being ambitious, creative, innovative, flexible and ahead of the pack and being as prudent, conservative, cautious, above board and exemplary as is required in financing, so Dublin will not be seen as a place which will allow slightly riskier instruments than other capital markets.  It is a thin line to walk but that is the only worry I have about this Bill.  We may be putting ourselves in an attractive position in the short term to gain certain business, but if some of the hedge funds or non-traditional fund management systems run into difficulty in Dublin, it may damage other business we have successfully built up over the past 20 years and harm the reputation of Irish financial management.  Funds of this scale would also have a significant global effect.  I wanted to raise that concern on Second Stage.  We are dealing with such complex funds and such a new industry that this must be teased out on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">Small business people welcome the audit exemptions in the Bill.  It is a concern that our economy benefits from a number of industries, with property being the main driver of growth and enterprise.  The IFSC is an example that shows we do not have to trade widgets to be successful internationally; we can trade services.  It is disappointing, however, that the export performance of indigenous industry has been declining in recent years despite the efforts of Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  If we look at the Irish Stock Exchange, we have not been successful in developing new companies that raise capital to invest in new entrepreneurial activity.  We are suffering from what used to be known as Dutch oil disease, where economies with access to a major industry, like oil, do not develop any other industry, weakening their economy.  Something similar is happening here, because the over-emphasis on property for enterprise and growth has sucked entrepreneurial activity from the rest of the economy.  That has placed us in an increasingly exposed position.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">While we are correctly opening our stock market to more innovative systems with dematerialisation of the stock exchange trading system, I am concerned about the lack of Irish companies seeking to be listed on the exchange or in London to raise capital for new projects.  Why are companies not seeking to develop wave and tidal energy, where we should have a competitive advantage?  Why are Irish companies not trying to raise €400 million on the Irish Stock Exchange to invest in research in that area?  Why are companies not investing in innovative food processes or other services where we could succeed?  That is my concern regardless of the systems on the exchange.</p>

        <!--Fix-->
        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_225">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_313">I welcome this Bill, which proposes a number of sound, common sense amendments to company law.  It is a pleasant change to come in and welcome amendments to the law.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">The amendments are designed to increase Ireland's attractiveness as a place to invest and they entail the considerable improvement of our competitiveness.  It is vital that Irish companies can compete in international markets while remaining competitive and participating more efficiently in international commerce.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Previously, I thought we were only losing low skilled jobs in the international market and that was where my concerns lay.  I heard, however, on the radio yesterday of financial analysts, whom we would consider as highly skilled, seeing their jobs moving to India.  An analyst here can earn more than €50,000, while in India he can be paid €10,000 and is considered exceptionally well paid.  Such high skilled jobs can also leave the country.  Before our concern was outsourcing — Fruit of the Loom in Donegal was a prime example.  It destroyed our clothing trade and we lost many jobs in Buncrana.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">In Cavan-Monaghan, the furniture trade was a major employer for many part-time farmers, with secure jobs available for many years.  Now, that trade is being outsourced as well and more often than not, people from Monaghan have decided to move to areas with lower cost bases.  These concerns affect us.  One would have thought that it was only major multinational companies that would suffer at such a time, but small indigenous industries have also suffered.  Effectively, they have decided to move manufacturing and purchasing to overseas locations, merely assembling the furniture in Ireland.  Many of the big employers have disseminated their workforce.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">The shoe trade was another major employer in north Monaghan but many of the shoe factories are closing because of cheap imports.  Quality does not always matter; these manufacturers are producing a top quality item but they find it difficult.  On a larger scale, beef is being imported into the country that does not undergo the same type of testing as our own produce.  It is imported because it makes a profit and is attractive to the consumer, never mind the quality assurance procedures.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">The exemption limits in the Companies Auditing and Accounting Act 2003 are totally inadequate and must be increased to a realistic level from the current level of €1.5 million.  That sounded like a lot of money once upon a time but we are now dealing in euro and wages and costs have increased.  The proposal to increase the exemption thresholds to the maximum permitted of €7.3 million for turnover and €3.65 million for balance sheets is progressive, although I would be concerned about those figures eventually becoming inadequate.  The maximum permitted might be increased further down the line.  We must look at our nearest neighbour.  The British Government has already increased these thresholds, placing us at a competitive disadvantage, especially since we share a border with Northern Ireland.  That is relevant to us and makes a lot of sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">The standards of auditing are undergoing profound change, which has contributed to the need for a realistic adjustment of audit exemption levels.  I know someone close to me in an auditing department and he is not the most popular person there.  He went from website design to auditing and the greetings he gets have changed.</p>

          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_321">My son has just discovered that; it was one of the big shocks in life.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">Small and medium sized companies were among the most adversely affected by the current low threshold figure, so this Bill is significant to them.  The raising of the audit exemption threshold to €7.3 million will considerably lighten the regulatory burden on small and medium sized business that currently must conduct an annual audit, which is costly in terms of both time and money.  It will also help to improve life for businesses and investors by dispensing with the need for red tape.  Nevertheless, it does not dispense with the necessity to maintain good day-to-day books of accounts, as required by company law.  It is important that records will continue to be kept for future examination.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">Small and medium sized businesses are the driving force of the economy and one cannot overestimate the importance of a healthy business sector.  Recently, when examining the type of employment available in my constituency I found the emphasis had shifted from small companies producing for the domestic market to firms producing goods for export markets.  Approximately 55 companies in counties Cavan and Monaghan export to world markets, with 30 of them located in the former and 25 in the latter.  Between them, the two counties account for 10% of exports by domestic companies, as opposed to overall national exports.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Companies in counties Monaghan and Cavan beaver away, quietly doing their business on the world market.  Both have some large players, for example, Combilift Limited in County Monaghan which operates across the world and Quinn Life in County Cavan, household names that have moved into the world market.  We should be proud of them, especially given that the local economy used to be dominated by small furniture companies, small farmers, etc.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">Recent changes in the business sector in my constituency were achieved without much assistance from Government agencies and can be attributed to people taking a chance.  I bump into people who tell me they have been in Shanghai, Bangkok, Australia and many other places marketing their products, getting out on the world stage and doing business.  If that is the case in my constituency, I am sure it also applies to other constituencies.  Many of those who operate successful companies have experienced a couple of company failures in the past.  It is important that the House acknowledge these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">The House should also spread the word that my constituency is an attractive location for investment.  The people of both Cavan and Monaghan have a strong work ethic and are not afraid to take a chance.  Outside companies should also be aware of the constituency's good transport connections, with access to open roads, ports and airports.  For example, it takes me approximately 90 minutes to travel from my home to Dublin Airport, a commutable distance, particularly when one considers the length of time it can take to cross Dublin by car.  South Monaghan can be reached from Dublin Airport in 45 minutes.  On the Northern side, we also have access to Belfast's airports.  We should shout about these advantages.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Small businesses will be assisted by the provisions of the legislation because they will not be required to employ professional accountants to audit their books at the end of each year.  By nature, an accountant will examine a company's turnover and submit a price based on the time required for his or her audit, the level of turnover and other factors.  Accountants also like accounts to be well prepared and maintained.  As treasurers of clubs and so forth will agree, they, too, must have their books done by professionals.  It is in the best interests of small companies to ensure their books are correct, meticulous and up to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Mandatory dematerialisation is another positive aspect of the Bill which will be welcomed by small business.  The new provision makes it mandatory to hold in electronic form stock transfer forms and share certificates.  This is the way forward.  In a modern and progressive economy such as this and given its exposure to the global economy, it is essential to maintain and improve our competitiveness.  Holding Irish securities in electronic form will be instrumental in reducing the costs involved in share dealing and should increase our competitiveness in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">To meet the challenges posed by the increasingly globalised and competitive world markets it is essential to maintain competitiveness.  We must protect the interests of the small indigenous companies which drive the economy and, where necessary, change laws to keep them intact.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">Many Irish equities are listed on Irish and United Kingdom markets.  The greatest possible degree of harmonisation in dematerialisation in both markets would be in our national interest.  It is vital that the Irish market is not placed at a competitive disadvantage with the UK and that electronic processing of Irish equities is carried out in line with best international practice.  In other words, it is in our national interest to bring our auditing processes into line with those operated in the United Kingdom, our closest neighbour.  Britain may be a close competitor but we have a good trading relationship and depend on it to take a significant amount of goods and services produced here.  We must, therefore, work closely with the UK on these matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">The elimination of paper share certificates will have a series of beneficial effects.  Trading will be processed in seconds and dependence on snail mail will be removed.  It will also improve Irish competitiveness in trading securities, considerably reduce the costs involved in paper trading and bring practices here into line with current UK practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">The Bill also makes provision for the amendment of the Consumer Information Act 1978 to permit the temporary appointment of a director of consumer affairs.  Legislation to establish a new national consumer agency was promised for 2005 after the Consumer Strategy Group recommended the creation of such a body in May of the same year.  This provision is an <i>ad hoc</i>, stop gap arrangement and will result in consumers losing out on their rights.  It is unfair to ask consumers to pay.  I hope the establishment of a national consumer agency on a statutory basis will not be further delayed.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">A further feature of the Bill is the provision to allow for the transposition of the European Union transparency directive.  Directive 2004/109/EC relates to the exercise of voting rights by shareholders of companies, having registered their office in a member state and whose shares are admitted to trading on a regulated market.  It will facilitate the cross-border exercise of shareholders' rights in listed companies through the introduction of minimum standards and ensure that shareholders, irrespective of their place of residence in the European Union, will have timely access to complete information and simple means to exercise voting rights at a distance.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I welcome the Bill, which will serve to improve the environment for business and share trading.  It meets the needs of small business and investors and, as such, I support it.</p>

          <from>Mr. Callanan</from>
          <p eId="para_337">I welcome the opportunity to address the House on the issues laid before us in the Bill.  This legislation covers many changes needed to bring the regulation of business into the next century.  In particular, it deals with our position as a market leader in asset-backed securities investment in Europe.  It will ensure that we continue to hold a lead in financial services and will address some concerns which have been raised by industry experts.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">The Bill should reflect the greater need for regulation of transparency in business which is all important.  With the near removal of barriers in the trade of securities, the legislation takes into account the greater use of technology in the exchange of securities.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">Ireland has been driven by a remarkable ability to persuade financial services companies to base their European headquarters here.  While many observers attribute this development solely to tax incentives, the supply of great human resources and the talent of the Irish workforce have been major factors in this regard.  It is vital in regulating business that we walk the fine line between ensuring business is correctly regulated and conducted in a transparent and ethical manner and ensuring it is not choked with unnecessary administration and regulations.  Business does not always recognise that politics has its best interest at heart and our imposition of regulations is often resented.  I hope this legislation will be taken in the required spirit to update and modernise our rules and regulations to reflect changing technology and a greater need to govern the information flow and transparency of companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">I wish to deal first with the changes to the Companies Acts.  I welcome the increasing of the audit exemption thresholds up to the maximum levels permitted by the EU and the new threshold for turnover of €7.3 million and €3.65 million for a balance sheet.  This means we now catch up and pass out England which has a £2.5 million audit exemption, as well as the rest of Europe, which has an average exemption of approximately €5 million.  The previous relatively low audit exemption limit was particularly significant when one considers that the auditor was obliged to report all company law discrepancies, including minor ones which were punished severely in the 2001 Act.  I also welcome the ability to hold in electronic form securities of companies based on a regulated market.  This merely reflects the manner in which securities are being traded in the modern era.</p>
          <p eId="para_341">The Minister of State has said that dematerialisation will facilitate ease and speed of trading by investors, enhance the international competitiveness of Ireland for securities trading, reduce the current costs associated with the cumbersome process of managing paper-based transactions, and avoid the risk of an escalation of the current settlement costs for Irish certificate transactions that would occur if there was a successful implementation of dematerialisation of UK securities.  Dematerialisation is being considered in the UK and has already taken place in other European countries such as France, Denmark, Sweden and Italy.  It also exists in other competing world markets such as India, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">This Bill will ensure more of the financial services industry can be based anywhere in Ireland that has good commercial broadband and telecommunications infrastructure.  With the recent roll out of fibre optic in Gort, Loughrea, Ballinasloe and Athenry, I hope we will start to see financial services jobs in the west.  Our road structure also has a part to play in this.  Ireland is now a modern, highly globalised, credibly regulated, competitive economy.  We need to ensure we retain our attractiveness as a place to do business and as a location for foreign direct investment.  We will achieve this objective by committing ourselves to fostering the conditions which support enterprise and in meeting the challenges and opportunities of an increasingly knowledge-based, regulated, globalised and environmentally sustainable economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_343">Dublin today is recognised as a global centre for financial services.  It is ranked only second to London and ahead of Frankfurt in terms of asset-backed securities.  The aggregate amount of asset-backed securities investments managed by Dublin-based investors has witnessed huge growth in recent years.  In 1999, the aggregate amount of asset-backed securities investments was around €6 billion.  This grew to between €30 and €35 billion in 2003.  Today, the figure is at least €80 billion.  These figures demonstrate the position and importance of securitisation in terms of the domestic economy and the tremendous strides made in recent times.  The strong track record that Ireland has developed in the asset-backed securities sector is a result of many factors.  These include a conducive business environment, a common law system and the presence of skilled personnel with considerable international experience.  All of these factors, along with Government support, have fuelled this growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">Existing developments in securitisation give us the potential to develop as a primary centre for specialist debt-financing products.  Business regulation in the field of company law feeds into improvements to our national competitiveness through high standards of corporate governance.  It brings about a stable and predictable environment in which entrepreneurs can establish businesses, investors can invest, creditors can lend and the interests of the employees, consumers and other stakeholders are protected.  Ireland's economic future is inextricably bound up with the global economy through investment, trade, people and business.  We have to be at the top of the game in every aspect that affects competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">Part<b> </b>2 of the Bill contains a number of amendments to the Companies Acts 1963 to 2005, which increase the thresholds below which companies are eligible to avail of exemption from having to have their accounts audited, amend the powers of the Minister to make regulations dealing with the holding of securities of companies in electronic form, otherwise called dematerialisation, and which amend the provisions of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005 dealing with the circumstances where issuers of prospectuses for non-equity securities may be held liable in civil actions to parties who may have suffered a loss as a result of subscribing for the securities in question.  The need to increase the audit exemption threshold<b> </b>for companies is seen as requiring priority treatment.  This will have a significant impact in terms of lessening the regulatory burden on small business and is seen as a priority measure in terms of maintaining our competitiveness generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">The Bill proposes to increase audit exemption limits for turnover and balance sheet totals, thereby allowing more companies avail of the audit exemption.  The provision in this Bill increases the turnover limit to €7.3 million and the balance sheet total limit to €3.65 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_347">I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinBrady" eId="spk_231">
          <from>Mr. M. Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_348">I thank the Minister of State for bringing this important Bill before the House.  I congratulate him for placing the emphasis on small businesses because these usually become large businesses.  We have many examples of this in the Oireachtas, such as Senators Quinn and White who started in a small way and now own major businesses.  In Deputy Connaughton's constituency, Mr. Pat McDonagh of Supermacs gave a talk to members of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business when we visited Ballinasloe.  It was interesting to listen to him speak about the problems he encountered along the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">The joint committee visited Ennis a few weeks ago and we met with people who set up small businesses.  One person who started employing five people is now employing 80 people.  We also met students and we asked them what they felt would hinder the setting up of small businesses.  Everybody commented that the bureaucracy involved in setting up small businesses is horrific.  One must drive all over the country to establish the assistance available.  There are agencies all over the place.  We should have a one-stop shop to advise people who want to set up a small business on grants available.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">There is a perception that we are only interested in big businesses and foreign investors — who are given everything — and that we are not concerned about small businesses.  That is not the case.  What is really being stated is that the system is so cumbersome and convoluted and contains so many layers of bureaucracy that people immediately erect mental barriers and do not proceed with their businesses.  I was informed by one woman that a friend of hers opened a small business and immediately received approximately 20 letters from the Revenue Commissioners relating to various matters.  That can be extremely off-putting.</p>
          <p eId="para_351">The provisions of the Bill involve facilitating business development and securing our competitive edge in key sectors where it has been developed.  Where possible, we should ease the regulatory burden on businesses.  That is already happening here, where a flexible, responsive and business-focused regulatory system is developing.  This is vitally important because, as has been stated, like all developed economies, our economy depends increasingly on services as it moves away from basic manufacturing to higher upscaled manufacturing and services.  If we do not have a system which will allow people to be flexible and respond quickly to changes in the marketplace, we will lose out.  I believe we will continue to be successful but we must keep our eyes on the ball.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">The Minister of State and his officials have listened carefully and responded to the concerns of small and medium-sized businesses.  As stated earlier, I hope he will take on board the points I have made in respect of small businesses and how they are set up.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">The legislation incorporates as many recommendations from businesses as fall under the remit of the Minister of State, and that is representative of the partnership-style of Government which has been so successful for our economy over the past ten years.  The most welcome development in the Bill for small and medium-sized businesses is the raising of the audit exemption threshold to the maximum allowable under EU rules, namely, €7.3 million turnover, up from €1.5 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">The Bill will ease the additional administrative burden of annual audits for thousands of businesses and create a parity in the audit exemption thresholds with businesses in the North, the United Kingdom and other EU states.  Many small businesses, such as that established by Pat McDonagh in Ballinasloe, have extended their interests to the United States and other countries.  That gives an indication of the importance of small businesses and the way they can grow and spread to other countries.  This also affects voluntary and community organisations, which will be relieved of the time and regulation burden of being audited because they fall under the new threshold.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">The roll-back of the regulation has a symbolic significance in that the process of more and more regulation will henceforth be tempered.  The important message to business people who participate on business fora, committees, etc, is that they will be listened to.  The report of the Small Business Forum, published last April, recommends that Departments should formally assess the merits of exempting small businesses from new regulations, or of modifying such regulations to make allowance for the special needs of small businesses.  The forum was set up by the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, and chaired by the general manager of Microsoft Ireland, Joe Macri.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">Raising the audit exemption threshold to €7.3 million will ease the regulatory burden and obligation on many small and medium-sized businesses to conduct a costly, cumbersome and burdensome annual audit.  This was a key recommendation in the Small Business Forum's report.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">The forum also pointed out that while there are advantages in obliging companies to undertake statutory audits, these advantages can be outweighed by the enormous cost of such an audit, which can sometimes amount to between €10,000 and €20,000.  IDA Ireland is committed to developing the breadth and depth of the international financial services industry in Ireland.  While continuing to market this country as a centre of excellence for transaction processing, IDA Ireland is also targeting other sophisticated revenue generating activities.  Existing developments in securitisation give us the potential to develop as a primary centre for specialist debt and financing products.  This is in line with lDA Ireland's strategy to drive the development of knowledge-intensive high-value investments.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">Business regulation in the field of company law feeds into improvements to our national competitiveness through high standards of corporate governance.  This brings about a stable and predictable environment in which entrepreneurs can establish businesses and investors can invest.  Ireland's economic future is bound up with the global economy through investment, trade, people and business in general.  We must be at the top of the game in respect of the transposition of the two EU directives, which will bolster Ireland's competitiveness and help us attract foreign investment in an ever more competitive global market.  They will also help us to encourage people in Ireland, if they are given proper assistance, to invest and establish businesses here.</p>
          <p eId="para_359">I commend the Bill to the House.  I thank the Minister of State and his officials for the excellent work and research invested in it.  This is an important Bill and it will prove of great assistance to small businesses.  It will also help those who are considering establishing such businesses and encourage young people in this regard.  In my view, that is the way to proceed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_232">
          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_360">Like previous speakers, my party and I welcome the Bill.  There are many aspects to the Bill and one could refer to a large number of them in the context of the changes to which its enactment will lead.</p>
          <p eId="para_361">The first matter to which I wish to refer is the increase in the audit exemption level.  This has been a topic of discussion among those in the small industries sector for a couple of years.  Everybody thought that it would have happened much sooner than has proved to be the case.  The Institute of Chartered Accountants, which has access to greater expertise than that at my disposal, has been discussing this matter, in so far as the competitive aspect is concerned, for a long period</p>
          <p eId="para_362">Everyone is aware that the Bill was introduced as a result of what happened in Northern Ireland and Great Britain.  Once the authorities in the North decided to opt for a much higher exemption level, a great deal of business began to seep across the Border.  The Government was aware of this for some time and I cannot understand why action was not taken much sooner.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">It is important that Ireland should be able to match the best in the world.  As far as its competitiveness is concerned, all is not well.  As stated in the House on a number of recent occasions, Ireland dropped from fourth in 2000 to 21st this year in the World Economic Forum's global competitiveness report.  Regardless of the scientific evidence one can produce or the political spin one can put on that, it is not a good position for Ireland to be in.  A major slippage has occurred.  One cannot state that it is directly linked to the subject matter to which the Bill relates, but it is a symptom of what is happening in this country.  The Government and the Administration that succeeds it will be obliged to pay major attention to this issue in the next couple of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_364">The National Competitiveness Council stated that Irish prices rose by 22% more than those in other EU countries in the years 1999 to 2003.  That is an official statistic.  Ireland is 20th in the World Economic Forum's global information technology report, which measures the technological readiness of countries, behind countries such as the US, the UK, the Netherlands, Sweden, Germany and Austria.</p>
          <p eId="para_365">Members are aware that in February 2006, due to the Government's failure to deregulate properly the electricity market, Airtricity announced its departure from the Irish market.</p>
          <p eId="para_366">These are not straws in the wind and legislators from all sides of the House must take note.  As a result, costs for the small business community continue to rise at an alarming rate.  For example, one can make comparisons with the United Kingdom.  It is a huge trading partner for Ireland and shares the same language.  The two countries have close business connections and have been interlinked for generations.  The cost of electricity, insurance, landfill and broadband is 50%, 20%, 350% and 10% higher, respectively, in Ireland than in the United Kingdom.  All such costs form part of small enterprise activity.  It is evident that when Irish firms compete on the British or other markets, they do so with one hand tied behind their backs.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">This raises the question of what can be done in this regard.  While I cannot claim to be an expert in this field, I have begun to wonder who will regulate the regulators.  For example, the Commission for Energy Regulation was established in a blaze of glory some time ago amid claims that this was the right way to go.  However, many voters do not understand how the regulator could allow 20% and 34% increases in the price of electricity and gas, respectively, on the day before world prices of oil began to fall.  I cannot understand this and I do not know whether the Minister of State can.  Worse, this has a fundamental cost implication for all businesses and for small businesses in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_368">Given my dealings with the small business fraternity over the years, I have noticed that the people who break out in a cold sweat in the middle of the night are those who have their assets on the line.  I refer to their houses and the last penny in their pockets.  The Minister of State understands this point.  Such people have put everything on the line that is considered to be important, such as their house, insurance etc.  I have seen business men and women in a terrible state because their expectations regarding a particular investment were contradicted by the marketplace and they were left almost penniless.  However, such people are responsible for building up this country and are the source of its prosperity.</p>
          <p eId="para_369">As Deputy Martin Brady correctly stated, many people were lucky enough at the heel of the reel to become well known throughout the world for their particular expertise.  I refer to the Smurfits of this world.  However, in a manner similar to the world of professional golf, for every such success, there is no shortage of dead bodies on the ground.  Against that background, it is incumbent on all Governments, present and future, to go out of their way for the men and women who put their neck out to keep the wheels of industry and commerce turning.  Most business people I know personally believe that, for some strange reason, no Government understands the phenomenon I have just explained.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">It would do no harm to revisit this issue in the fora that have been established.  Ultimately, Members should do their best for those who are prepared to put their neck on the line.  The nature of the game dictates there will always be failures.  While such people may start out with a profit motive — I am not silly enough to believe they do so for charitable purposes — they take terrible chances.  Although I might have taken similar chances when I was younger, I would not like to so do now and this is true for many Members.  The world of industry is difficult, big and bad and when Members get an opportunity to discuss this issue in the House, they should not forget the central issue involved, namely, the steps such people must take and the environment in which they must operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">I do not understand why it is impossible for the Commission for Energy Regulation to revisit its decision — I will refer to other decisions — once it became plain that the world price of oil was falling substantially and is likely to remain in this state for a number of months or perhaps a couple of years.  A mechanism should be put in place that would allow the process to be wound back.  I presume there will be no change in respect of the oil and gas cost increases, which poses a difficulty for small industry.  Possibly, the next increase, whenever it takes place, will be held for a longer period than normal.  However, this will do no good for small business people or industrialists who will be saddled with an unwarranted level of cost increase until the next decision is made.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">Many people will ask serious questions for the remainder of the year regarding the regulator's rationale.  Initially, no one took much notice because of developments on the world oil market.  When the regulator took his decision, everyone accepted there was a reason for doing so at the time.  At present, however, there is general acceptance that the basis for making that decision no longer exists.  Nevertheless, it appears the Commission for Energy Regulation does not intend to do anything in this regard and will permit the current status to continue.  This is a false premise because oil is no longer as costly as when the decision was made.  When Members discuss the lack of competitiveness, this is a central issue that must be addressed this year and I hope someone will do so.  Earlier, I questioned who would regulate the regulators.  I hope this will be possible under this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">I wish to raise another aspect of this legislation about which I cannot claim to have great personal knowledge.  I will approach it from a different perspective.  I refer to the proposed dematerialisation of the security certification.  I understand this to mean that those records that were paper-based will be computerised.  I see Deputy Fleming is present and I assume he will speak shortly.  He and I served on the Committee of Public Accounts for a number of years.  Indeed, he still serves on it and has always been an important member.  I did not spend a single day at that committee without hearing of major problems emanating from the computerisation of existing records.  This is true of all Government agencies that I encountered while serving on the Committee of Public Accounts.  All cases created havoc and trouble, as well as costing the taxpayer much money.  For several months, a stock answer at the committee went along the lines that the reason for a particular event was that computerisation was taking place, a new system was being introduced, no one was responsible, the hardware vendor had left — as had the person who bought it — and the system did not work.  Before we knew where we were, the thing was in a hames, to put it bluntly.  I will outline what I want to know.  There were problems with electronic voting, of course.  We have an awfully bad record in this country of doing this particular job.  I hope we can do it better in this instance.</p>
          <p eId="para_374">We are in very good company.  We are in the company of the best brains — the whizz kids of the world.  I refer to people in this country who deal with securities, for example.  We are lucky to have financial services etc., here.  I pay tribute to that sector of the community.  I have always believed in it.  I remember being in the House when it was introduced and, in fairness to Mr. Haughey, it was a step in the right direction.  We have shown that Ireland can become a centre of excellence.  It has become a centre of excellence in this regard and continues to be so.  A great deal of the work that is done in this sector relates to this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_375">I hope the changeover to the new recording system has been well thought-out.  It has been used in many other countries for a long time.  I hope there will not be any mix-ups this time.  Such difficulties would be embarrassing and would suggest to people throughout the world that we were incompetent.</p>
          <p eId="para_376">I would like to highlight a technical matter.  I hope the Minister will refer to it when he is summing up.  Does this measure have data protection implications?  I assume a raft of legislation kicks in when records are computerised.  I am sure national law is relevant in this regard, although I am not sure about international law.  I remind the House that every time a proposal of this nature is introduced, we should know what we are doing, we should implement it properly and efficiently and we should ensure there is no egg on anybody's face by the time the process has been completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_377">I want to talk about the functions of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  I understand this is a technical matter.  There is no director in place at present.  This legislation provides for someone to hold that position until the National Consumer Agency has been established on a statutory basis.  I have often wondered why the agency has not been put on a statutory footing long before now.  I cannot understand that.</p>
          <p eId="para_378">I do not intend to repeat the comments of some of my colleagues about the groceries order etc.  People tried to convince me and my colleagues on all sides of the House that there would be a visible decrease in supermarket prices the day after the groceries order was abolished.  That did not happen.  I never thought it would happen.  The concept of abolishing the order was right — I had no trouble with it.  However, we have not replaced it with anything, as far as I can tell.  It seems two vital sectors of society are being affected by the discounting which is taking place all the time.  The abolition of the groceries order was supposed to be the best thing to happen consumers in the last ten years.  However, all the figures show there has been a continual increase in the price of one's shopping basket.  If one speaks to people with limited means, they will say how expensive their shopping is every Friday.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">I do not have time to speak in detail about the manner in which consumers and primary producers are being squeezed.  Inordinate pressure is being put on people at both ends of the spectrum.  The real money is being made by middle men and retailers.  I appreciate that retailers have their own trouble.  Primary producers, such as farmers, are the last people to make money and consumers are the second last people to make money.  The people in the middle are making money hand over fist.  If the Minister responsible for this issue can bring some balance to it, it will be a good day.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanFleming" eId="spk_233">
          <from>Mr. Fleming</from>
          <p eId="para_380">I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill 2006, which deals with three or four broad issues.  It amends the parts of the Companies Acts dealing with audit and dematerialisation.  It imposes transparency requirements on the issuers of securities which are admitted to trading on certain markets.  The miscellaneous provisions section of the Bill ties up a series of loose ends.  That summarises the key issues dealt with in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">Many of the provisions of Part 3 relate to EU regulations.  They have been included on foot of the requirement to transpose various EU directives into national law.  I want to make a general comment about EU directives.  The EU has to be careful.  Ireland, as part of the EU, has to be careful.  We are making a relentless effort to ensure there is a level playing field within the EU.  As our focus is often on the internal EU market, we sometimes ignores the overall global market.  While EU member states are important, they do not constitute the majority player on the world market.  We need to bear in mind that there are other major players.  We need to resist the efforts being made to bring each member state to the level of the lowest member state.  Such efforts are being made by interests which do not have due regard to the outside world.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">I would like to strengthen the point I am making by highlighting two cases I have observed over the last year.  While there was some logic to the arguments which were made in both instances, the logic behind the final decisions was flawed.  Some time ago, Ireland submitted a proposal to the EU to be allowed to provide further grants and forms of support to Intel, one of the biggest employers in the country.  The EU rejected that proposal to a large extent on the basis that grants of a similar nature were not available in other member states.  It was argued that if Ireland were to be allowed to make such supports available, competition within the Union would be distorted.  By closing their minds in that way, those who made the final decision failed to appreciate that Ireland, as an open economy, and Intel, as a world player, were operating in the global marketplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The real problem with the decision to refuse Ireland permission to offer grants to Intel, which operates in Ireland, was that it will ultimately work to the advantage of companies outside the EU.  The supports in question would have benefitted the Irish economy, Intel and the world economy.  The failure to allow Ireland to make the supports available will help companies in places like the Far East, the Middle East and South America to make progress, with the assistance of state support from the governments in such areas.  Ultimately, companies which are operating in the EU will be disadvantaged.</p>
          <p eId="para_384">I would like to highlight another contentious case, which caused many people to jump up and down some years ago.  I refer to Ireland's decision to offer tax concessions to the horse breeding industry.  Attempts were made by some people to regularise the system by removing some of the concessions on the basis that such reliefs were not available to a similar extent under the taxation laws of other EU countries.  The approach taken by the EU seems to be that if any member state has an advantage over other member states, the first thing that should be done is to eliminate that advantage.  If we do that, however, we neglect the overall global picture.  Ireland, which is one of the major players in the international horse breeding industry, is competing with the United States and Australia.  If the EU puts Ireland at a disadvantage in that sector by forcing it to operate at the lower level of other member states, it disadvantages the entire EU within the global horse breeding market.</p>
          <p eId="para_385">If we disadvantage individual countries or companies within the EU, we will ultimately confer benefits on the EU's competitors in other parts of the world.  We must be careful of that.  We are in a global economy and one can overstate the issue of fortress Europe.  We deal not only with Berlin, but with Boston and many other places worldwide.  We are in competition with many cities, not only those in the EU.  As an open economy, Ireland has more to gain and lose by following the road of rules harmonisation within the EU without taking due cognisance of what is going on outside the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_386">I wish to address the issue of auditing, which is dealt with in section 6.  It amends section 32 of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1999 by increasing the audit exemption threshold for turnover and balance sheet totals up to the maximum levels permitted in the EU.  This will bring the new thresholds to €7.3 million for turnover and €3.65 million for the balance sheet.  I understand this will come into effect in a few months time.  The Minister will see if this is possible for financial years commencing on 1 January and will return to the issue on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_387">The essence of this is that we are exempting companies with a turnover below €7.3 million from the requirement of a statutory audit.  The logic is that they are relatively small enterprises, especially in the retail sector where there may be high purchases and sales with a limited profit margin, the effect being low profits despite high turnover.</p>
          <p eId="para_388">The issue of exemptions from audit for companies in the voluntary sector is one I would like to see included in this legislation and I believe this can be done if there is political willingness and willingness in the Department.  I wish to refer to a letter I received from the office of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on 31 December 2004.  I wrote to the Minister regarding a small rural development company in Laois called the Sliabh Margy Development Association.  I also spoke directly to the Minister in connection with the Mountrath amalgamated social employment scheme, of which I am a sponsoring member.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">I have met the people involved in these organisations and I feel that this relates directly to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  I will deal with FÁS schemes first.  There is a requirement, laid down by FÁS, that every FÁS scheme conduct an audit of its affairs.  Many schemes have a turnover of around €300,000 and 90% of this consists of wages.  Previously, this may have been unemployment assistance, disability allowance, lone parents' allowance and so on when those on the FÁS scheme were claiming social welfare.  When people join a FÁS scheme they are paid through that scheme.  Some 90% of money in most FÁS schemes covers wages and the balance covers insurance, materials and other overheads.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">Under FÁS rules, schemes must be audited each year which I understand and accept as it is taxpayers' money.  However, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment requires that such schemes be managed by a limited company and the limited company is subject to a separate, independent audit, despite the fact that it is only a shelf company.  There are no exemptions to this and the full cost must be borne.  This is where complications arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_391">It is ridiculous that a company with a turnover of €7.3 million will not require a statutory audit while a local FÁS scheme, with a turnover of €300,000, is required to have two statutory audits with two audit fees.  We are trying to eliminate bureaucracy and are doing so for profit making companies, but are ignoring the non-profit sector and the community and voluntary sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">Department staff suggested to me that this could be remedied if the company and the scheme had the same year-end, creating, effectively, one audit process.  There would be a need for two certificates and perhaps a nominal fee.  However, this is not realistic.  When a new company is formed as part of a FÁS scheme, they may have the same year-end for the first year.  The FÁS scheme may not run for a couple of months, however, and it might not resume until the following April.  The FÁS scheme will then require an audit from April to March while the company, a separate legal entity, will adhere to the calendar year for the Companies Registration Office.  It is neither possible nor practical in many situations for the two entities to have the same year-end.  There is a legal requirement for two audits.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">I will refer now to the letter I received from the Minister's office on 31 December 2004.  I am pleased to have the opportunity to raise it here, even at this late stage.  The letter stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_394">The law providing for exemptions from the requirement for a company to engage auditors is contained in section 32 of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1999.  One of the criteria that must be satisfied in order for a company to qualify for an audit exemption under the section is that a company to which the Companies (Amendment) Act 1986 applies.  The Act does not apply to a variety of classes of company, including companies that are not trading for the acquisition of gain.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">In other words, the exemption does not apply to non-profit organisations, but does apply to profit seeking organisations.  This is daft.  I would understand this if it was the other way round.  The letter continues: "Audit exemptions are, therefore, never available to non-profit companies, irrespective of their level of turnover."  I will come back to this in a moment.  The letter further states that the Company Law Review Group is the standing body charged with reviewing these matters.  I was invited to make a submission to the group, which I did in 2005, and I have not heard anything since.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The last paragraph of the letter states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_397">Any possible reforms of the audit exemptions would have to address the requirements of a wide range of non-profit companies that the law covers, such as community title management companies, management companies in housing estates, charities, sporting associations, development associations, etc.  They would also have to appropriately balance any possible benefit from a reduction in compliance costs against the importance of ensuring accountability, especially where there are public funds involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">As I mentioned, I am involved in the Sliabh Margy Development Association.  The association sought to draw a £5,000 grant, through Leader, to conduct walks in the rural area.  It was obliged, under the rules, to do this through a company.  The association set up a company to carry out two transactions — one to cash a cheque and one to pay the people who put up the signs.  The company then had to carry out a statutory legal audit.  This is farcical — something confirmed by the letter from the Minister's office.  We should treat the non-profit and voluntary sector more fairly.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">That company, which existed solely to cash one cheque, also ran foul of the Companies Registration Office because, understandably, it was late with its annual return.  I contacted the Companies Registration Office and received a small concession, but none was received from the Minister's office relating to the audit.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The Companies Registration Office wrote to me on 24 November 2004.  It stated that it is required that the non-profit status of a company must be included in the memorandum and articles of association.  It must be confirmed in the articles of association that no dividends will be paid and that, on winding up, all of the assets, which would otherwise be available to members, must be transferred to another company with similar restrictions.  The outcome was that the company in question changed its memorandum and articles of association as a result of this suggestion and was allowed a waiver or refund of fees from the Companies Registration Office.  I thank the Companies Registration Office for its help.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">A standard planning condition now applied by many local authorities for new estates or apartment developments is that the open area be managed by a management company.  I will give a practical example.  Imagine a new estate consisting of 100 houses where the planning requirement is that the management company cut the grass and manage the open area.  If the company charged each house €100 per annum for cutting the grass, there would be a turnover of €10,000 per annum.  I envisage that more money will have to be spent on the audit fee than on cutting the grass.  This is the thrust of the provision and it is a case of excessive bureaucracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">I want to highlight this matter in the House and I have done so previously in correspondence.  Section 6, in essence, is a pragmatic measure to help the profitable trading and business sector but in making this measure we are placing the non-profit and voluntary sector at a further disadvantage.  The latter sector can include sports clubs, including GAA clubs, and also charities and many other associations.  I want to see the flexibility afforded to the profit-making sector extended to the non-profit-making sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">Will the Minister make available the information he received from the Company Law Review Group, which information he mentioned to me almost two years ago?  How many companies are involved?  I suspect many organisations are being caught by the auditing provision and at every annual general meeting attendees mutter and grumble that they must pay €1,500 for auditing.  My local FÁS scheme must pay for it twice to satisfy the requirements.  It has a turnover of €300,000, 90% of which is expended on wages.  A few bob is spent on materials and the greatest remaining expense is the double audit fee.  I ask that common sense prevail sooner rather than later.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">On the increase in exemptions concerning the audit fees, will it be standard practice for the Revenue Commissioners to accept non-audited accounts from now on?  Sometimes a company with a turnover of €7.3 million can have a very small gross margin whereas a company in the production sector can have a very high gross margin of a couple of million euro.  Will the Minister of State confirm the rights of minority shareholders who might feel disadvantaged if they do not get audited accounts through the major shareholder?</p>
          <p eId="para_405">Section 7 deals with mandatory dematerialisation, which effectively means that share certificates will be stored electronically rather than on paper.  This is a fact of life in this day and age and it will facilitate and make easier trading by investors.  It will enhance Ireland's international competitiveness in securities trading and will reduce the current costs associated with the cumbersome process of managing paper-based transactions.  Dematerialisation has already taken place in countries such as France, Denmark, Sweden, Italy, India, Australia and New Zealand and I understand it is being considered in the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain and the United States.  Section 7 is therefore very worthwhile.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Section 12 deals with the Financial Regulator.  It states the Financial Regulator is the appropriate body in this area and that it may be free to introduce supplementary rules to enable it to fulfil its role.  The Minister of State said in his speech that €80 billion of asset-backed securities investments are managed by Dublin-based investors.  Will he tell us how much of this money is regulated by the Irish regulator?  Companies must be registered in Ireland before they can be regulated here.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">The question of the Central Bank arises under section 13.  Consider the confidentiality provisions concerning information available to the Central Bank and Financial Regulator.  The element of secrecy has been sacrosanct and intrinsic to the types of industries concerned worldwide but there are issues to be addressed in this regard, although not in this legislation.  If the Central Bank identifies criminal fraud on foot of its knowledge of a company, it cannot notify the Garda Síochána, Revenue Commissioners or Director of Corporate Enforcement.  I believe, however, that it can force the company in question to publish a relevant statement in its annual directors' report – this is one of the few requirements.  It can notify the Financial Regulator that an issue has arisen but it cannot provide any details thereon.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">The Garda, Director of Corporate Enforcement, Financial Regulator and Revenue Commissioners may all be investigating a major company, and may sometimes have representatives carrying out an investigation in the same company office, yet they are legally prevented from sharing information they have obtained on matters of public interest.  There should be some mechanism whereby information relevant to another State organisation can be made available to that organisation while respecting the principle of confidentiality.  It is not good enough that there is a provision for total secrecy in such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Section 18 allows for the appointment of a person to perform the functions of the Director of Consumer Affairs.  This is only a temporary measure but it is essential that it be included in the legislation to enable a person to continue to carry out that role until such time as the National Consumer Agency is placed on a statutory footing and in a position to make such an appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">I ask for a reassessment of the legislation in the Department to allow flexibility for the voluntary and community sectors, which are forced to carry out audits.  Commercial organisations, which operate on a much bigger scale, will be exempt from the requirement to produce such audits.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_234">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_411">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill, which I support.  Let me bury the myth that Independent Members are against everything, both inside and outside the House.  We support sensible Bills and one does find Independent Members supporting sensible solutions to problems, as was the case during the debate on drug-related crime last night and as is the case today in respect of investment funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">This debate is very important in so far as it impinges on business and investment.  We do not seem to have had a proper debate on the direction business is going in Ireland.  We are all very excited about and welcome the great wealth and resources that have become available over the past nine or ten years.  However, the debate on creating wealth in this society is now over and it should now focus on how our wealth and extra resources can be distributed to those most in need.  This is the key issue both in this debate and other broader economic, social and political debates.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">It is not acceptable for a Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to say we have loads of money and are looking for ideas on how to spend it when there are existing projects that deserve investment and support.  I raise this issue because of its relevance to business and investment, which are dealt with in the legislation.  There are also ethical questions to be dealt with.  The reality is that, despite the great boom and the Celtic tiger, sections of business have become damaged, just like politicians, the church and other parts of society.  We must face this reality and deal with it head-on.</p>
          <p eId="para_414">The Minister of State said in his speech that the amendments proposed in this Bill are designed to facilitate business development, copperfasten our competitiveness in key sectors where it has been developed and ease the regulatory burden on business while facilitating the giving of full effect to EU directives we must transpose.  I welcome this and the fact that the amendments are very strong.  I welcome the Minister of State's assertion that we need to retain our attractiveness as a place to do business and as a location for foreign direct investment.  We need to debate this because we do not always pay sufficient attention to our indigenous industries, including small ones, in the broader economic debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">We must face up to the reality that, because of globalisation and the fact the world seems smaller, there will be a shift of investment to locations where wages are low and where wage bills can be cut by 50%.  This shift has already started and we must ensure it does not affect our competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">We must be very careful not to allow business to dominate the economic and political agenda.  We will welcome businesses' contribution and support their sensible economic policies but we cannot allow big businesses to set the agenda as they have done in other countries.  In Ireland we have the right mix as regards the political system.  There are strong public and private sectors working in partnership, rather than seeing each other as enemies within the broader society.  I get annoyed when people, particularly in the private sector constantly push their private economic agenda to try to dominate and take over situations in which there is no need for their involvement.  For these reasons this debate is very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">As we talk about business and investments we should bear in mind that there is another Ireland outside the Dublin 4 stereotype of trendy yuppy Ireland.  It is important to acknowledge that families still live in poverty, despite the economic boom.  I have a number of suggestions as regards helping such families.  I should like the emphasis placed on the most disadvantaged areas of this and other cities, which only come to our attention when some major disaster occurs at community level.  I am not going to name the communities in my constituency or in other parts of the State again.  They have enough on their hands as regards fighting negative publicity without politicians making matters worse.  The reality is, however, that sectors of society are totally outside the whole political, social and economic zones and are not being looked after.  We must target resources to help these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">Coming up to the budget and while the Estimates are being prepared a number of sensible proposals might be put forward.  Lower income families, for example, should be allowed to meet their essential food needs.  A proposal was put forward by the Combat Poverty Agency for €10 million to support alternative sources of healthy food to increase the €20 in social welfare rates being sought and provide daily hot school dinners.  When one looks at the detail, the cost of putting a nutritious and well-balanced meal on the table can account for between 40% and 80% of the weekly income of families living on social welfare.  I ask the Government to extend the school meals programme to provide daily nutritional basic hot school dinners for an estimated 200,000 children from low income families.  I should like to see an increase of the minimum €20 in social welfare rates and up to €12 for children per week, which are recommended by many people.  These issues are related to employment, investment and the whole debate on the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">For example, parents with two children in receipt of €400 unemployment assistance per week spend a minimum of €170 on basic everyday food items such as cereals, bread, potatoes, fruit and vegetables, dairy products, meat and fish.  That to me is good budgeting and I do not know how they do it.  We need to face reality and assist people.  The radical proposal to establish a €10 million fund over a three-year period to support community initiatives, providing alternative sources of healthy food for low income families, is based on the success of such initiatives in the UK and the emerging success of Irish initiative such as the South Hill food co-operative in Limerick and the Dublin food bank.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">As we debate this Bill, it is important we start to implement the national action plan against poverty and social exclusion.  I appeal to the Minister to look seriously at increasing the income of social welfare recipients, maximising the benefits for children in poverty, rewarding participation in the labour market, fostering equality in the tax system and protecting the living standards of the most vulnerable.  This would be sensible economic planning and investment.  I assume that if the tax-welfare budget package of €2.36 billion is similar to 2006, almost half of it will be devoted to welfare improvements, some 23% will go to supports for children and the remainder will be allocated to tax reductions.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">My proposals seek to minimise the impact of this expenditure on labour activation and educational attainment.  There is an opportunity to end poverty, social exclusion and use the next couple of weeks in the run-up to the budget to do something in this regard.  While we talk about welfare increases and personal rates, it should be possible to increase the lowest rates by €20, the means-tested State pension and related payments by €18 and the contributory State pension by €15 per week.  As regards the qualified adult allowance, I propose we increase the lower rates by €16 and the contributory pension rate by €13 per week.  Increasing social welfare rates is the key mechanism for reducing poverty in Ireland.  Cash transfers are currently 20% less effective in reducing poverty than the EU average.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Section 4 of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Bill provides for the laying of orders and regulations before both Houses of the Oireachtas and empowers either House to annul the order or regulation within 21 days.  Section 5 provides for the authority to meet the expenses incurred by the Minister in the administration of the Act.  When one digs deeper into the legislation one finds that section 6 amends section 32 of the Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act by increasing the audit exemption thresholds for turnover and balance sheet totals, up to the maximum levels permitted by the EU.  The new thresholds will be €7.3 million for turnover and €3.65 million for balance sheet.  This will apply to a company in respect of a financial year that commences not earlier than two months after the commencement of this provision.  Section 7 amends section 239 of the Companies Act 1990, by providing regulations for the introduction of mandatory dematerialisation in electronic form.  I am urging that the legislation be seriously looked at while we are being very supportive of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">The purpose of Part 3 is to pass provisions which need to be enacted in primary law to ensure the smooth and effective transposition of the EU transparency directive on the harmonisation of requirements to disclose information about issuers, where securities are admitted to trading and a regulated market.  The directive replaces and updates existing EU legislation in this area and is designed to enhance transparency on EU capital markets by requiring regulated market issuers to produce periodical financial reports on shareholdings in such companies that disclose major holdings.  The directive also deals with the mechanisms through which this information will be disseminated and stored.  It is due for transposition by January 2007.  The provisions of Part 3 mirror similar provisions included in the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005 in connection with the transposition of the market abuse and prospectus directives last year.  Section 10 allows the Minister to make regulations under this Act for the purpose of implementing the directive and related permission level instruments, as appropriate.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">As regards investment, employment and sensible planning, we must also provide for the employment of people with disabilities, an area that is often left out of such Bills.  It has become noticeable over the last three years that the rate of unemployment among people with disabilities is extremely high, and this is not acceptable.  There are many people with disabilities, middle-aged and elderly included, who are very able and talented and who have a massive contribution to make to society.  This must be faced in the debate as we talk about investments.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">At this morning's meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights, there was a very interesting discussion about the sectoral plan that deals with the employment of people with disabilities.  This is very important and should be linked into this debate as well.  I note the National Consumer Agency currently works to address the needs of vulnerable consumers, including those with disabilities and where appropriate will work in partnership with and support initiatives being taken by organisations in this area.  Other features raised in the sectoral plan discussions included embedding the mainstream context costs across a range of services provided by the Department and its agencies, compliance with Part 3 of the Disability Act 2005 regarding the provision of accessible services to people with disabilities and the protocol for interdepartmental working.  All of this work is to be fully embedded within the Department's business planning guidelines in the context of further developing and expanding this process.  Disability will also be taken into account in the Department's review of the business planning process to be undertaken later in 2006.  While all these initiatives are very welcome, there is a number of serious concerns I wish to raise.  The timeframes for the roll-out of various elements of the vocational, training and employment strategy seem to be very tight and slippage in one will tend to have a knock-on effect, thus delaying the entire implementation process.  It will be crucial to structure the work programme in order to avoid this.  For example, the Departments of Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, have committed to establishing a working group to report to Ministers by the end of 2006 regarding the scope and arrangements for the phased transfer of appropriate employment services from the health sector to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  People using these services and their ancillary supports will comprise a substantial proportion of the proposed target group.  A delay in this transfer could delay everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">Research has repeatedly identified benefit traps as being a major impediment to people with disabilities taking up employment.  I consider the proposal to collaborate with other key Departments and agencies to promote the removal of these benefit trap disincentives as being much too weak.  This is further borne out by the fact that the only interdepartmental working arrangements proposed are those between the Departments of Health and Children and Enterprise, Trade and Employment.  This is only a continuation of what is already in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">I raise these issues because they are important to investment funds and general employment in the economy.  When one looks at the details of employment rights and industrial affairs, including the labour inspectorate, one feels this will impact substantially on people with disabilities, most particularly if the training and employment strategy is successful in keeping more such persons in employment.  This can be used wisely.  There are many businesses in the IT and financial sectors that could employ more people with disabilities.  They will make a massive contribution to society.  People often talk of social inclusion — let us do something about it when we are planning for the State and the economy.  This issue is part of today's debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">While I welcome the proposed initiatives regarding entrepreneurship, this should have included a policy of promoting the excellent training programmes and other supports provided to community and voluntary organisations by the county enterprise boards.  Deputy Fleming also referred to the community and voluntary sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">Section 13 amends the Central Bank Act 1942 to include the transparency directive in the list of directives for which the bank has enforcement responsibility.  This deals with confidentiality of information obtained by the competent authority and effectively prohibits its disclosure.  It is an important section.  Section 14 allows Ministers to cite, by provisional order, the markets in addition to regulated markets to which transparency laws shall apply.  It is important that the requirements under the transparency directive should be capable of being applied to markets outside the directive's scope, such as, for example, the Irish enterprise exchange market or any new market that may be established in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">The Minister of State mentioned that Dublin is now recognised for securitisation and is ranked alongside London and Frankfurt.  When one looks at the sums involved, which currently stand at approximately €80 billion, one will see this is crucial to the domestic economy.  As society develops, we must not leave any sector behind.  In this top class economy there is no excuse for leaving people behind.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">In the course of my contribution I have mentioned the economy, enterprise, trade, employment, investment and the wider debate of how resources will be distributed.  I also mentioned the specific targeting and inclusion of people with disabilities.  I was elected on this mandate in Dublin North-Central.  We must ensure these people are included and are part of the broader society.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">St. Michael's House on the north side of the Dublin is an excellent service provider for people with disabilities.  It currently has 296 people on its residential waiting list.  Some 74% of these people are living on the north side of Dublin.  St. Michael's House is looking for 70 new places per year to resolve this.  That does not seem to be asking too much in this wealthy country and would be a wise investment for this or any other Government to make.  St. Michael's House also has a deficit of €1.5 million and is under pressure to correct this.  I urge the Minister of State to use his influence with his senior colleagues in Cabinet to help provide services for people with disabilities.  The St. Michael's House project deserves our support.  Senior Ministers have spoken about stamp duty and have said they do not know what to do with certain revenue.  They need their heads examined.  They should look at the real world where people are seeking help and support.  They could also provide the resources to employ 59 additional jobs to assist this huge service provider in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">It is important to talk about investment for the future.  I thank the nuns in Baldoyle who have made a major contribution to St. Michael's House in the past week or so; they sold property and land worth €30 million to the St. Michael's organisation for €100.  I commend them on and thank them for this.  There are times when church organisations are hammered in this House by certain individuals for things they did in the past and while it is right that they should be challenged, we must also acknowledge the contribution of religious organisations.  St. Michael's House takes people with disabilities out of institutions.  This is a good investment for the future, which creates a modern and respectful life for people with disabilities.  I strongly support the legislation.</p>

        <!--Fix-->
        <speech by="#MichaelFinneranFF" eId="spk_235">
          <from>Mr. Finneran</from>
          <p eId="para_434">I compliment the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, and his Cabinet colleague, Deputy Martin, on introducing this Bill.  It deals with investment funds, updates our position on company law and brings us into line with Europe.  While part of this relates to dealing with European directives, it has also come about because of the country's success.  This country has moved forward with such great strides that it is envied by democracies across the western world.  We should not take for granted that these circumstances will remain in place no matter what happens.  It would be terrible folly for people to believe this.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">The most important factor in bringing the country to this level was strategic Government policy over a number of years that supported investment and enterprise and gave entrepreneurs the opportunity to create employment and wealth.  This did not happen by chance but came about because senior figures at departmental and Government level created a playing pitch that allows the country to move forward in the manner we have seen.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">There is another reality in that we cannot take for granted that that will be the case into the future.  We do not have to reflect back too far to see what happened in this country.  I am talking about the 1970s and 1980s.  In the marts and fairs in the midlands and the west, people left their stock behind them in the towns because they could not sell them.  They did not bother bringing them home.  I remember coming out of the mart in Ballinasloe and seeing 17 calves on Society Street that nobody owned.  Those are the facts about what happened in our country not many years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">Irrespective of what happens, we must not take for granted that the wealth available to the Minister for Finance today to look after the interests of our people, particularly those who are less well-off, will be readily available to him.  That is not the case.  Young people may not understand what I am saying but those facts must be stated.  In the past ten or 12 years, this country has experienced an unprecedented level of growth, as much as 10% in some cases although it is down to 5% now.  That is without parallel in Europe or the western world.  There may be some examples in Asian countries whose economies do not have the transparency or democracy we enjoy.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">That is a reality check for the Irish people when they go to the polls in May or June.  I am not making a party political statement with a view to pointing a finger at any Opposition representative.  I very much appreciate the constructive contributions of the Opposition spokesman on enterprise and employment, Deputy Hogan, who is in the Chamber, but some Members regularly make contributions in which they take for granted that the moneys coming into the coffers of the Department of Finance will continue to come in irrespective of Government policies.  That is a myth.</p>
          <p eId="para_439">This debate is about investment funds.  We are talking about an increase of asset-backed security investments from €6 billion in 1999 to €80 billion today.  Would any Member of this House say that happened by chance or that it fell our way because we are a little green island on the verge of Europe?  That is not the case.  It happened because many years ago people brought forward policies and legislation to underpin investment, set up the financial services sector by the Liffey, give entrepreneurs an opportunity to start their own businesses and provide security to people in terms of their investments.  That is the reason it happened.  The people at home and abroad have brought us to where we are today.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">An additional 1 million people are working in this country.  Why do people flock to our shores?  Is it because they believe we are good for a cup of tea or will say hello to them on the street?  That is not the reason.  They are here because they can make money for themselves or to send to their families in eastern Europe, Brazil and elsewhere.  Those people have fuelled our economy.  They came here because our economy is able to absorb them and give them an opportunity, and they are making a return to our economy in the taxes collected by the Department of Finance.  Deputy Finian McGrath said that the Government should give various benefits to people, but we can give nothing if the money does not come in.  If the finances are not returned to Merrion Street, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, or the Government cannot give it out.  The only way it can do that is if those in employment pay their taxes and by people investing and becoming involved in the further development of our country.  That is the reality check I spoke about on which we must remain focused.  I am concerned about statements made by some people, who may or may not be in Cabinet positions after the next general election, in terms of what they will do in that regard, but they can do nought if the money does not come into the Department of Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">The legislation before the House is welcome because it reflects where we are as a nation.  It reflects on our success and our ability to become the envy of Europe in terms of opportunity in enterprise and employment.  The circumstances that allowed that are as a result of good, strategic policies by excellent civil servants and Ministers over a period.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">The provisions in the Bill are many but what is their purpose in layman's terms?  They are to relieve the burden of regulations, facilitate business development, provide solidarity for our competitors and give effect to European Union directives.  We are sometimes criticised because of our rush to meet EU directives but in the financial and investment areas, it is important we have a clean sheet.  We have a clean sheet in the eyes of the world, and that is very important.  If we are to keep up to speed as regards financial activity and investment, this legislation is necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">This country has an acceptable common law practice that always has been supportive of the business environment.  We have the best entrepreneurs compared to those in any country worldwide.  Ireland is a country to which other countries look up.  I am a regular visitor to the United States.  My family's background is in the financial sector in the United States.  My father was the first of his generation born in this country and I have kept close links with the United States all my life.  I am always amazed by the compliments paid to young Irish graduates and businessmen and women on the way they take on new challenges in IT, finance, business and enterprise.  We should not be slow to compliment ourselves on the ability of Irish people in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">Mention was made by some speakers of the voluntary sector on which I want to comment.  Some years ago I became fearful that the voluntary sector would disappear and that people would not come forward to become involved in voluntary bodies and organisations because of our rush to live the high life in this affluent State.  I am pleased to say I was wrong because Irish people are as concerned with and committed to the voluntary sector as they ever were.  As many, if not more, people as before put themselves forward to act as committee members or officers of voluntary organisations.  It is important that the State recognises and supports this voluntary effort.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">The voluntary sector finds it difficult to deal with regulation and bureaucracy.  In some cases small grants have become albatrosses around the necks of voluntary organisations.  It is now a painful task to deal with a small grant from a State organisation.  I refer to county enterprise boards and Leader boards.  Voluntary people are involved in these matters yet the most qualified accountants and legal support people would be needed to assess and draw down grants.  We have gone overboard on regulation in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">The Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Michael Ahern, keeps his finger on the pulse of his constituency.  He would not be in this House for the past 20 years if that was not the case.  We must examine how we treat the voluntary sector.  We rush to support it with grants but we hamstring it when it tries to draw them down.  Some years ago lottery grants were a simple matter for GAA clubs, soccer clubs and boating clubs.  Now, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor has its claws in the process.  The paper trail involved in drawing down a sum greater than €50,000 is unbelievable.  These people are gardaí, county council members, farmers or secretaries and are involved on a voluntary basis.  The must try to draw down money invested in a local hall, pitch or sporting facility.  Such regulation is the way to hunt people out of the voluntary sector.  We must be careful not to exclude people from this area.  They will wonder why they should endure such hassle on a voluntary basis, with Departments piling regulation on organisations for a few euro that contribute to the common good.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">This Bill is necessary from a national and European perspective.  Today's generation must reflect on the future.  Can we maintain and improve on the level of income with changed policies?  People will realise that it would be very difficult to return to the days when Irish people were taking the boat and had difficulties.  These dangers exist unless we maintain stability of investment, enterprise, and employment.  Otherwise we cannot support what I seek, namely, that the less well-off will have a better return after the budget.  This legislation gives us food for thought in that regard.  I compliment the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, and his officials.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_448">I thank all Deputies who have spoken.  This is a technical Bill, covering company and consumer law.  The provisions in the Bill facilitate business development and secure our competitive edge in key sectors.  Our regulatory environment is a key component of our competitiveness and our international reputation.  Where possible, we should ease the regulatory burden on business, as expressed by speakers today.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">Deputy Eamon Ryan stated that we must provide flexibility to industry while keeping appropriate controls in place.  A flexible, responsive, business-focused regulatory system has been the cornerstone of Ireland's development over the past 15 years.  To ensure a level playing field it is also in our interest to give full effect to important EU directives.  I appreciate the contributions of Deputies Hogan, Lynch, Eamon Ryan and others.  Interesting points were made during the debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Deputy Hogan raised the matter of regulators but I do not accept all his points, specifically his claim about a lack of policy basis.  I agree that we should debate the manner in which regulators operate.  That is the basis of democracy.</p>

          <p eId="para_452">Deputy Hogan also referred to the Central Bank and the Competition Authority.  These matters are of concern but do not concern this Bill.  The Deputy also referred to the IFSC and the financial services sector.  This underpins a number of provisions in this Bill.  We must ensure the IFSC is controlled and maintains its reputation.</p>
          <p eId="para_453">Changes sought by Deputy Hogan to ensure the benefits of competition are passed on to the consumer will be considered in the context of the consumer competition legislation, as opposed to this amendment which deals mainly with company law matters.  Deputy Hogan mentioned that prices had risen by approximately 10% in the last year or so.  Interestingly, another spokesperson from Deputy Hogan's party claimed during the summer recess that, based on a survey carried out by Fine Gael, the price controls which had come into operation had no benefits for consumers.  When this survey was examined, it was revealed that none of the items covered ever came under the price control order so I hope the figure of 10% is not based on a similar survey.</p>

          <p eId="para_455">Deputy Lynch highlighted the training of auditors who will only use information for one year.  I would appreciate if the Deputy would contact my office to discuss the matter.  She also highlighted directives which were not being transposed.  In 2005, my Department transposed the prospectus and market abuse directives and also facilitated international accounting standards.  In 2006, the takeover directive was dealt with and this Bill completes the suites of directives with the transparency directive.  In addition, the Bill picks up on some points overlooked in the takeover directive and which needed to be tweaked.  We are working our way through these directives very speedily and effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_456">Deputy Lynch also highlighted consumer issues and asked why we were introducing an amendment to appoint a person to the post of Director of Consumer Affairs for more than six months.  The principal reason for making such an appointment is because it was considered that a competition, which is the normal procedure for appointing a director, would be impractical because it was intended to incorporate the Office of the Director of Consumer Affairs into the new national consumer agency.  Deputy Hogan also asked this question.  Deputy Lynch also asked when the national consumer agency would be established.  It is expected the Bill will be published before the end of the year and that the agency will be statutorily established in early 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">Deputy Lynch also asked when the company law consolidation and reform Bill will be published.  The company law reform group is preparing the heads of the Bill, which contains approximately 1,500 sections.</p>

          <p eId="para_463">Deputy Eamon Ryan raised the issue of the liability of a guarantor.  Section 8 substitutes a new section for section 43 of the Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005.  Essentially, the purpose of this amendment is to limit the potential liability of a guarantor to the content of a prospectus in so far as it relates to the guarantor or the guarantee given by him or her.  It is not an open-ended situation where a guarantor can be sued over issues outside the prospectus or the guarantee.  This amendment will undoubtedly be discussed further on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Deputy Connaughton raised the issue of the change to mandatory computer records and effectively questioned whether security could be guaranteed.  Some companies are already operating in this manner since the uncertificated securities regulations were made in 1996 and no particular difficulties have been brought to my or my Department's attention.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">Deputy Fleming highlighted issues relating to the types of companies which can benefit from the audit exemption.  He quoted from a letter I sent to him two years ago in which I stated the matter was being considered by the company law review group.  I raised the issue a number of years ago with my officials and the company law reform group.  The group is examining the matter because there are a number of perspectives to be examined in respect of voluntary bodies.  Where funds are involved, the perspective will differ from that of a family-owned company or a company with shareholders.  This area needs to be examined because overregulation and the burdens placed on people working in a voluntary capacity, as Deputy Finneran noted, can drive them away.  It is very important to achieve a balance and I hope this matter will be sorted out in due time.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Speakers have mentioned qualified accountants.  There is a difference between a qualified accountant and auditor or accountant-auditor.  The term "accountant" is being examined and hopefully in the not too distant future a definition will be produced to protect the public from people setting up as accountants who do not have the qualifications to make them competent in this area.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_468">It is aimed at protecting the public.  Deputy Fleming also asked about audits and the protection of minority shareholders.  A total of 10% or more of a company's members can require that the company's accounts are audited.  I do not know how the Revenue Commissioners will treat unaudited accounts but, from my experience of dealing with them, I am confident they have their own standards and procedures and will know whether the accounts presented represent a true and fair view and display the proper results.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Deputy Eamon Ryan commented on small and medium-sized enterprises and implied that Ireland depended on foreign direct investment and multinationals.  Approximately 60% of companies in Ireland are small and medium-sized enterprises, in other words, enterprises with less than 50 employees, and the sector employs over 113,000 people.  The gross national product projected for the coming year is approximately 5.5% to 6% and is greater than the gross domestic product, which reveals that indigenous companies are now making a greater contribution to employment and exports.  In this light, it is important that our regulatory burden does not prevent our small and medium-sized enterprises from growing and developing and keeping our economy going forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">Since this Bill was approved by the Government, a number of other issues have been raised with me which may require amendments to the Bill.  Most of the proposals are in the area of company law.  I will introduce amendments on Committee Stage for those proposals deemed to merit consideration by the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">The Investment Funds, Companies and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 2005 provided for the introduction of a new type of investment fund vehicle, the non-UCITS common contractual fund.  Concern has now arisen in the funds industry regarding the availability of the protections of the Netting of Financial Contracts Act 1995, as amended, to the non-UCITS common contractual funds.  My officials are examining the issue and, if necessary, I will table an amendment to the Netting of Financial Contracts Act on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">I thank all Deputies who contributed to this most useful and informative discussion.  I hope I have clarified most, if not all, of the questions raised.  A number of issues were raised on which we will reflect between now and Committee Stage.</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_250">
            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_477">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 and 5 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_478">The United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, was originally established on 19 March 1978 under United Nations Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426, following the invasion of Lebanon by Israel, with a mandate "to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli forces, to restore international peace and security and to assist the government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area".  The Secretary General of the United Nations concluded that, as of 16 June 2000, Israel had withdrawn its forces from Lebanon in accordance with Resolution 425, thus partially fulfilling UNIFIL's original mandate.  Since then, UNIFIL has continued to operate in southern Lebanon.  The mission continued to focus on the remaining part of its mandate, namely the restoration of peace and security in the region, through observing, monitoring and reporting on developments in its area of operation, liaising with the parties, with a view to correcting violations along the line of withdrawal, the so-called Blue Line, and preventing the escalation of hostilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_479">Ireland has participated in UNIFIL since 1978.  Between May 1978 and November 2001, the Defence Forces had an infantry battalion with an approximate strength of 540 personnel in Lebanon, together with approximately 100 personnel in UNIFIL Headquarters and the Force Mobile Reserve.  Since November 2001, a small number of Defence Forces personnel continued to serve at the force headquarters in Naqoura.  Five personnel are currently deployed at the force headquarters.</p>
            <p eId="para_480">In response to the crisis of July and August 2006, the UN decided, under UN Security Council Resolution 1701, to extend the mandate of UNIFIL to the end of August 2007, and to increase its troop strength from approximately 2,000 troops to a maximum of 15,000.  The council also decided that, in addition to carrying out its original mandate under Resolutions 425 and 426, UNIFIL would also monitor the cessation of hostilities, accompany and support the Lebanese armed forces as they deploy throughout Southern Lebanon and extend its assistance to help ensure humanitarian access to civilian populations and the voluntary and safe return of displaced persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_481">The nature of the expanded UNIFIL mandate is such that its role is to be considerably more robust than it was prior to the adoption of Resolution 1701, while still operating under Chapter VI of the UN Charter.  UNIFIL will assist the Government of Lebanon in exercising its authority throughout the UNIFIL area of operations.  It will take all necessary action, acting in support of the Government of Lebanon, "to ensure that its area of operations is not utilised for hostile activities of any kind".  UNIFIL is not charged with disarming the Hizbollah.  The question of disarming Hizbollah is a matter for the Lebanese Government.  Moreover, it is recognised that this can only take place in the context of an overall political process in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_482">Following on from the ceasefire, which took effect on 14 August 2006, the Government here has been monitoring the situation.  As the Deputies will appreciate, given our other existing commitments, the Defence Forces have limited resources to contribute to this mission.  Against this background, an option was identified whereby Ireland might partner Finnish troops and provide a protection detail to a planned Finnish engineering company.  On 3 October 2006, the Government authorised, subject to Dáil approval, the despatch of a contingent of the Defence Forces to UNIFIL.  The necessary enabling motion was approved yesterday.</p>
            <p eId="para_483">Following detailed discussions between the Defence Forces and their Finnish counterparts, including a joint reconnaissance mission to Lebanon, the current plan envisages the deployment of a Finnish engineering unit with an Irish protection detail in the eastern sector area of Lebanon.  The planned Irish contingent will consist of approximately 150 Defence Forces personnel.  The five Defence Forces personnel currently serving in Lebanon will continue to be deployed at the UNIFIL force headquarters.</p>
            <p eId="para_484">The Finnish and Irish engineering unit will carry out tasks in support of UNIFIL and also some humanitarian work, including dealing with unexploded ordnance clearance and reconstruction.  While the Irish element will be tasked primarily for reconnaissance, security and protection duties associated with the engineering works, it will also be available to undertake other tasks at the request of the UNIFIL force commander.  Deployment to UNIFIL will take place on 30 or 31 October 2006 and, if approved, will bring the total number of Defence Forces personnel serving overseas to about 830 which is below the ceiling of 850.</p>
            <p eId="para_485">Initial deployment would be for one year subject to renewal of the mandate and a satisfactory review of the mission at that time.  In line with standing policy that the duration of any deployment should be set at the outset of a mission, it is considered that Defence Forces involvement in UNIFIL should not exceed a maximum of two to three years in duration.</p>

            <p eId="para_486">The troops will be leaving around 31 October.  Does the Minister for Defence, Deputy O'Dea, plan to visit the troops before Christmas or will he visit the observers already out there before the troops are deployed?</p>
            <p eId="para_487">The Minister will be aware that this additional commitment, which we in the Fine Gael Party support, will place additional strain on resources.  Does he plan to increase the strength of the Defence Forces?  How will he deal with the additional strain placed on Defence Forces resources in Ireland, given overseas commitments?</p>
            <p eId="para_488">Has the Minister had discussions recently with either the Israeli ambassador or the Iranian ambassador based here in Dublin or with representatives of the Lebanese and Syrian embassies in London?  Has the Minister for Foreign affairs engaged in such discussions?  If not, would the Minister for Defence consider meeting them before Irish troops are deployed in the area?  These are the countries with influence in the region and if difficulties arise it is important we have a direct link to someone who can bring influence to bear in the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_489">I will clarify the situation on deployment for Deputy Timmins.  The first advance party, consisting of four specialist personnel will travel to Lebanon on 14 October, that is, next week, to make the necessary advance contacts at ports, airports and so on.  The second advance party, consisting of 35 personnel, will deploy to Beirut on 24 October and the balance will leave on either 30 or 31 October.</p>
            <p eId="para_490">I have no plans to increase the size of the Defence Forces.  Under the White Paper for the reorganisation of the Defence Forces the personnel limit was reduced to 10,500 on the basis that we would equip and train them to the highest possible standard.  When the mission in Liberia ends next year there will be further personnel available to partake in overseas duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_491">My colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, generally speaks to ambassadors.  I do not know of any discussions he may have had with the ambassadors mentioned but I will ask him and return to the Deputy on the matter.  I will talk to the Minister for Foreign Affairs before deciding whether I should meet these representatives.  I had one rather fraught meeting with the Israeli ambassador, accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, at the time four UN personnel were killed by Israeli munitions.</p>

            <p eId="para_496">The Minister stated yesterday and repeated today that this mandate is considerably more robust than the previous one.  Does this mean we could be drawn into hostilities at some stage?</p>
            <p eId="para_497">From what the Minister stated yesterday and today, the nature of our role in assisting the Lebanese Government is not clear.  Deputy Coveney said yesterday we will be assisting the Lebanese Government to disarm Hizbollah.  Is the Lebanese Government mandated to disarm Hizbollah?  Are we not mandated to assist it in doing so and, if so, are we not thereby disarming Hizbollah indirectly?</p>
            <p eId="para_498">The Minister stated the disarmament of Hizbollah will only take place in the context of an overall agreement.  What does he mean by this?  Does an overall agreement involve Syria and Iran sitting at the table?  Does it involve addressing the question of the Shebaa Farms, a disputed territory, and the Gaza Strip and West Bank?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_258" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_499">The mandate is more robust.  In my reply I quoted the terms of the UN resolution laying out the mandate for UNIFIL.  It includes the phrase "to resist attempts by forceful means to prevent it from discharging its duties under the mandate of the Security Council".  This is not a typical run-of-the-mill Chapter VI-type resolution.  Chapter VI-type resolutions generally come into play when a ceasefire is in operation, as it is in this case, admittedly.  Generally, Chapter VI operations involve patrolling, monitoring and observing.</p>
            <p eId="para_500">It is contemplated that attempts may be made to prevent UNIFIL from discharging its mandate and it is given the right to resist those attempts by forceful means.  The provision, although not covered by a typical Chapter VI-type resolution, is designated a Chapter VI provision by the United Nations.</p>
            <p eId="para_501">I take the point Deputy Gormley made yesterday that the people of Lebanon probably just want a Chapter VI mission rather than a Chapter VII mission.  However, we have already engaged in Chapter VII operations.  Such missions involved Liberia and Kosovo, and we are therefore well aware of the dangers.</p>
            <p eId="para_502">The disarmament of Hizbollah is a difficult matter which has been fudged somewhat by the United Nations.  The general understanding is that it is a matter for the Lebanese Government.  Granted, part of our UNIFIL mandate in southern Lebanon is to support the Lebanese army as it redeploys through the region and re-establishes its authority.  It is very unclear whether it is envisaged that UNIFIL troops will be accompanying the Lebanese army in confronting and disarming Hizbollah.</p>
            <p eId="para_503">When the UN General Secretary referred to an overall agreement, I believe he meant it would certainly involve the Shebaa Farms.  This is central to the issue.  I cannot see how the agreement would not involve Syria and it may possibly involve Iran but I do not know the exact parameters of the General Secretary's statement.  He was referring to an overall political settlement, just as disarmament took place in a part of this country in the context of an overall political settlement.  I would imagine the settlement in the region in question would involve all the interested parties.  It would certainly include Syria but I am not quite clear about Iran.</p>

        <b>Mr. Costello</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Defence</b>
         if his attention has been drawn to the recent report, A Voyage of Understanding; his views on the report’s findings of low morale in the Naval Service; if he will address the many issues highlighted in the report; and if he will make a statement on the matter. 
        [32597/06]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_262" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_510">The Naval Service is the maritime element of the Defence Forces and has a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime defence requirements.  The Naval Service operates eight general purpose patrol ships. All eight ships are involved in coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State in that part of the seas where State jurisdiction applies, such as internal waters, territorial sea and the Irish sector of the exclusive economic zone.</p>
            <p eId="para_511">The main day-to-day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  The service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the exclusive fishery limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_512">The current exclusive fishery limits extend to 200 miles off shore and cover an area of 132,000 square miles.  The Naval Service currently patrols the entire 200-mile limit and periodically patrols beyond these limits to protect specific fisheries.  These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary.  The number of patrol vessels on patrol in Irish waters at any one time varies between three and seven.  The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish exclusive economic zone at any one time.  There are 1,682 patrol days per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_513">The reorganisation of the Naval Service was designed to ensure that, when fully implemented, all personnel would spend alternate periods of two years in a shore-based appointment followed by a ship-based appointment.  Two years in a ship-based appointment does not imply that people spend two years at sea.  This is managed locally by the flag officer commanding the Naval Service.  However, where there are shortages of skilled personnel within the Naval Service, it may be necessary for personnel to carry out sea-going duties more frequently.</p>
            <p eId="para_514">The impact of seagoing is well understood by Naval Service personnel at all levels and the service endeavours to operate a planned approach to the rotation of personnel between sea and shore.</p>
            <p eId="para_515">Other than for able seamen, there is no particular problem with maintaining sea-shore rotation for personnel.  There are, however, individual cases where this may not be exactly maintained.  For example, personnel regularly apply to extend their period at sea beyond two years.</p>
            <p eId="para_516">I am very much aware of the report referred to by the Deputy.  On 19 September I held discussions with PDFORRA and I hope we are moving towards a resolution.</p>
            <p eId="para_517">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_518">I am pleased that in our meeting we agreed to a process to examine this issue and find potential solutions.  A further series of meetings will take place between the deputy chief of staff — support — and PDFORRA over the coming months.  The purpose of the meetings is to examine the complex issues raised by PDFORRA with a view to exploring a possible resolution.  I will be monitoring progress in this area closely.</p>
            <p eId="para_519">It goes without saying that members of the naval service go to sea.  My Department and I are committed to ensuring that the Naval Service and the Defence Forces as a whole offer a challenging and rewarding career and a supportive working environment.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_263">
            <from>Mr. Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_520">The Minister said he is aware of the report on the effects of long-term sea patrols on family life in the Naval Service, entitled A Voyage of Understanding.  It is a large tome and it makes a number of conclusions, the first of which states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_521">Without in any way wanting to sound dramatic, the service as experienced by the surveyed membership is in crisis.  This crisis is fixable given Government action only.</p>
            <p eId="para_522">My question relates to the low morale in the Naval Service.  A large cohort of people were surveyed in the PDFORRA study.  More than 300 people were surveyed in total, including 212 serving members and 134 spouses.  It is heart-rending to read some of the information on families and children and the references to breakdowns, depression and stress.  These arise from what seems to be a very poorly managed service in respect of shore and sea rotation.</p>
            <p eId="para_523">Everybody acknowledges that recruits join the Naval Service to go to sea.  However, they are profoundly disappointed by the manner in which the system operates.  It is very difficult to engage in family life, in spite of the expression of support for family life in the Constitution.  The personnel feel so much could be done so easily and that management, in itself, cannot rectify the problem.  Rather, it is felt that it can only be rectified directly through ministerial involvement.  Can I take it from the Minister that there will be such involvement?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_264" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_524">Deputy Costello is right.  It is a big tome and it took me a long  time to plough through it.  I do not necessarily accept all the conclusions in the report.  We do not have time to engage in a long debate on its intricate details, but I note that the situation seems to have worsened somewhat in recent times.  I accept Deputy Costello's point that PDFORRA and the Naval Service are of the view that this requires ministerial involvement.  That is why I decided to get involved personally.  I called a meeting between the relevant army officers, PDFORRA and myself on 19 September.  We set up a group comprising representatives from PDFORRA and the Naval Service as well as the deputy chief of staff on the support side.  I have asked them to try to solve this problem.  I will keep the situation monitored and I have told them to come back to me with a solution by January.  I will sit down with them again in January, at the very latest.</p>
            <p eId="para_525">From my discussions with the deputy chief of staff and the relevant officials in the Naval Service, together with the recruitment campaign that is underway at present within the service, I am reasonably confident that we will be able to solve this issue.  As I said, I have taken personal charge of it because I realise it requires ministerial involvement and I am monitoring the situation.  My approach is hands-on in this matter.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_265">
            <from>Mr. Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_526">I welcome the Minister's reply.  He is acknowledging and accepting the first recommendation in the report to the effect that the Minister should establish a formal review of the operation and management of the Naval Service regarding the patrol policy at sea.  He is reviewing the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_527">The second recommendation is that he should immediately reduce the length of long-term sea patrols as an interim measure, pending the implementation of long-term changes.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_266" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_528">I suppose one could say I am formally reviewing matters.  That committee is formally reviewing it.  Its members are working together to come up with a better way of doing things.  Nothing can be done in the interim.  We are making an attempt to get a more humane system.  However, I do not necessarily accept all the conclusions in the report, as I said.  For example, if one takes the number of patrol days we envisage, 1,680 per annum, it would require a ship to be at sea for 200 to 220 days.  The maximum we expect anyone on ship duties to be at sea is about 160 days.  In some cases, that has been exceeded.  The statistics show that, in 2005, a total of 29 personnel served more than 180 days.  In 2006, a total of 56 served more than 180 days.  I have noticed a considerable worsening of the situation and that is why I have taken a hands-on approach.  We are hoping to make one strenuous effort between us to get this matter sorted out.</p>

            <p eId="para_530">As the Deputy is aware, I undertook during Priority Questions on Thursday, 23 February 2006 to ask the military authorities to revisit this matter in light of the questions raised by him on that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_531">The Chief of Staff appointed a senior officer to examine all aspects of the Niemba ambush in the Congo in November 1960.  Due to the diversity of this investigation, this process has taken some time.  I understand that, in the course of his examination, the officer interviewed both survivors and also contacted other interested parties both at home and abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_532">I have been informed by the Chief of Staff that the report is being finalised and I hope to receive the final version by the end of this week.

            <p eId="para_533">I thank the Minister for his response.  I have a number of detailed questions.  Is the Minister satisfied that the official Army version of the Niemba massacre, which shows that nine members of an 11-man Irish patrol died that day, will be upheld by the inquiry?  If not, will the Minister explain to the House why the Army's version of events, which has been shown to be wrong in the recent excellent book, <i>The Irish Army in the Congo, 1960-1964: The Far Battalions</i>, by Dr. David O’Donoghue, has been allowed to remain uncorrected for almost half a century?  If, as now seems likely, the Army inquiry finds that eight men died at Niemba and that a ninth, Trooper Anthony Browne, died three miles away some days later in another incident, will the Minister correct the statement he made to the House in this regard earlier this year?</p>
            <p eId="para_534">Will the Minister also consider reviewing the Army's treatment of the two Niemba survivors, Mr. Tom Kenny and Mr. Joe Fitzpatrick, who claim their good names have been impugned as a result of the Army's incorrect history of the Niemba incident?  As regards the broader issue, we need to be very sensitive towards the serving and former members of the Defence Forces and the families of these men.</p>

            <p eId="para_535">Deputy Finian McGrath is somewhat premature with some of those questions.  He is asking whether I will correct the official version if the report finds that it is incorrect.  I have not read the report yet, as it has not come to hand.  I do not want to anticipate what is in it.  If the report points out that the official version is wrong, of course we will deal with it.  If I said anything incorrect on the record of the Dáil, I will be more than happy to correct it.  We will study the report in that regard.   Any complaints the two men have as regards their treatment or alleged treatment by the Army can be brought to my personal attention.  They have brought a few matters to my attention and we have been in touch with them.  Before I comment in detail on what the report will reveal, I would like an opportunity to read it first.  I am sure the Deputy can understand that point.</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_272" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_539">The Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces was established under the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004.  On 19 September 2005, Ms Paulyn Marrinan-Quinn SC was appointed by the President, upon the recommendation of the Government, as the first Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_540">The function of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is to act as the ultimate point of appeal for an administrative investigation into complaints made by members, and former members, of the Defence Forces against another member, former member or civil servant of the Department of Defence.  The Ombudsman for the Defence Forces may investigate a complaint in respect of an action or decision, which may have adversely affected the complainant personally.  The action or decision complained of must have occurred no earlier than 1 December 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_541">As I mentioned in my speech to the 2006 annual PDFORRA conference, to date, the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces has sent me 12 reports on individual cases relating to the PDF with which she has dealt.  I have either responded to or I am in the process of responding to the ombudsman in respect of each of these reports.  The Minister for Defence is obliged to inform the ombudsman of the measures taken or proposed in response to her recommendation.</p>
            <p eId="para_542">The Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is, in accordance with the Act, independent in the performance of her duties.  She is required to report annually to the Dáil.  In these circumstances, I do not consider it appropriate for me to report on her behalf or give details as regards her reports on individual cases, complaints already submitted to the ombudsman, the status of those complaints or her current treatment of those cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_543">I am happy to inform the Deputy that the primary focus in these cases has been on selection for promotion, courses and overseas service.  I can also indicate that the reports of the ombudsman have made a valuable contribution to the ongoing updating of selection procedures in these three areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_544">I do not wish the Minister to take up the role of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, but perhaps he can answer this question.  If a wrong has been done, is it the Minister who will seek to right it in the first place?  Does the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces make recommendations in her reports as to what action might be taken by the Minister?  Can he indicate how many of the 12 reports to date affect former members, as complainants, and how many affect serving members?  Finally, has the Minister recommended any disciplinary action to date on any of the reports or what action has he taken in respect of them?  I would be obliged if he would elaborate on those points.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_545">Again, I am not attempting to avoid answering Deputy Timmins's question, but the Office for the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is modelled on the public services Ombudsman.  The public services Ombudsman gives an annual report to the Dáil outlining the complaints she received and how they were dealt with by the relevant Departments.  Under the legislation, the Ombudsman will hear the complaint and give her findings to the Department of Defence outlining whether the complaint has been upheld and, if so, what action is recommended.

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_275" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_549">There are no plans to construct a training hall in Thurles, County Tipperary for the Reserve Defence Force.  The military authorities inform me that the current facility in Thurles meets the needs of the RDF.  My Department was approached some time ago by a developer who wished to access his adjoining property through a portion of the RDF property in Thurles.  However, no agreement has been made by my Department to sell any part of this military property, nor has any commitment been entered into regarding the incorporation of any portion of the property into any proposed development in the vicinity.</p>
            <p eId="para_550">There is an ongoing capital building programme in my Department designed to modernise the living, training, operational and accommodation facilities available to the Defence Forces, both permanent and reserve.  There has been an unprecedented level of spending on the programme to date with more than €200 million spent between 1999 and 2005.  This year will see a further €21.8 million invested in the programme.  The programme, based on prioritised needs, is agreed between the civil and military authorities and approved annually by the Minister.</p>
            <p eId="para_551">On the issue of protective clothing, a quantity of disruptive pattern material, DPM, wet suits is available to all members of the RDF on a pool basis within each formation.  Each formation has an allocation of 1,500 suits.  There are currently no plans to provide each member of the RDF with a DPM wet suit.</p>

          <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_276">
            <from>Mr. Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_552">If there are plans for a private development at the rear of the training centre, when are they due to come to fruition?  Has the Minister secured an agreement with the developer to replace existing buildings with new structures?  If so, will this meet the future needs of the centre?</p>
            <p eId="para_553">Considering the Reserve Defence Force is due to be more closely integrated with the Permanent Defence Force, it would be appropriate for it to have the same protective clothing as the Permanent Defence Force.  Those who give up their time voluntarily cannot be expected to serve side by side with professional soldiers where one group has the best quality protective gear while the others are sloshing around in unsuitable gear.  It is time to look again at this matter and provide clothing that is geared towards the individual.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_277" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_554">To answer the first of Deputy Costello's questions, no agreement has been entered into by, or on behalf of, the Department with any third party.  The matter was subject of an application to the local authority for planning permission and that permission, subject to conditions, was granted some time ago.  One of the conditions stipulated that the development must be carried out solely within the property owned by the applicant — which one would expect — and that no part of the development should encroach on the rights of adjoining property owners without prior consent of the owner.  I presume this refers to the Department of Defence.  My Department does not intend to pursue this proposal.  There is no agreement in place.  Refurbishment works were carried out in that building this year and money has been allocated for further works next year.  There are no plans to sell, lease, loan, or otherwise dispose of any part of the property to any third party.</p>
            <p eId="para_555">I understand the point the Deputy is making about integration between the Permanent and Reserve Defence Force.  There are 1,500 wet suits for each of the four formations.  Therefore, there are some 6,000 suits for a total reserve complement of approximately 9,500 members.  It is a matter of acquiring an additional 3,500 wetsuits.  I will look favourably on this.  I am currently engaged in detailed and difficult discussions on the Estimates with the Minister for Finance.  I estimate the expenditure on the additional wet suits would range from €1.25 million to €1.5 million.  I will make the case for it to the Minister for Finance.</p>

            <p eId="para_556">I welcome the Minister's positive response towards finding the necessary money to provide wet suits for the reserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_557">The Minister said refurbishment works have been carried out on the training hall.  My information is that the existing centre is not up to scratch and something more substantial is needed to meet the needs of the Reserve Defence Force in the area.</p>

            <p eId="para_558">The military has informed me that the current accommodation is quite suitable.  Refurbishment works have been carried out in the RDF facilities in Thurles this year.  As a result of the modernisation, the facilities now include offices, a lecture room and a reception area.  It is intended to provide modern office furniture, floor covering and IT facilities in 2007.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_282" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_569">I propose to take Questions Nos. 7, 12, 41, 46, 57, 59, 177 and 178 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_570">I have on many occasions in the House set out the background to EU battle groups, the development of which is strongly endorsed by the United Nations, and Ireland's position on them.  Following the Government decision agreeing to Ireland entering into discussions with like-minded nations on a possible contribution to a battle group, a delegation from the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces met with their Swedish counterparts in Stockholm.  The detailed parameters of a possible contribution by Ireland to the Nordic battle group are being worked through and are close to finalisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_571">The potential Defence Forces contribution will involve an EOD-IEDD contingent with its own security detail, together with staff posts at the operational and force headquarters.  The total number of personnel involved is expected to be somewhere between 80 and 100.  However, it must be remembered that this level of commitment will only arise should the battle group be called upon to undertake an operation.  In addition, battle groups are only deployed for between 30 and 120 days.  Any contribution to a battle group will be met within the context of the overall ceiling of 850 personnel serving overseas at any one time set in the White Paper on Defence and will have no adverse impact on our existing peace support operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_572">A number of issues are currently being finalised and I expect to shortly bring the matter to Government for a final decision.  As I have previously stated, any deployment of the Irish contingent as part of the battle group will be a matter for sovereign decision, which in our case means the requirements of the triple lock must be satisfied.</p>
            <p eId="para_573">Turning to the question of the voluntary nature of participation by members of the Defence Forces in battle groups, a battle group is simply another vehicle under which the Defence Forces may participate in overseas peace support operations and, as such, the standing arrangements for participation in such missions will continue to apply.  In general, the despatch of any personnel on overseas missions, including peace support operations, is undertaken, as far as possible, on a voluntary basis.  That said, however, it would be unacceptable if a mission to which the Government and Dáil Éireann were committed could not be undertaken simply because we could not get a sufficient number of volunteers.  As such, all members of the Permanent Defence Force are liable for overseas service, subject to the provisions of the Defence Acts.  I refer in particular to the Defence (Amendment) Act 1993, which excludes people who were enlisted prior to that enactment.</p>
            <p eId="para_574">There are no plans for the involvement of the Naval Service or the Air Corps on overseas operations.  However, individual members of the Naval Service or the Air Corps may be deployed on overseas peace support operations, as they have been in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_575">The Government's White Paper on Defence, published in February 2000, set out a medium-term strategy for defence covering the period up to 2010.  A major objective of the strategy is to ensure that Ireland has a world-class military organisation capable of carrying out the roles assigned to it by the Government, both at home and abroad.  This objective requires an ongoing modernisation process, including an investment programme, to ensure that the Defence Forces are properly equipped for these roles.  With the extensive investment in new equipment and training over the past number of years and with the current policy of continual recruitment to the Defence Forces, there is no requirement to increase expenditure on equipment or manpower to meet battle group commitments.  As I have already stated, any proposed battle group commitment can be met from within the existing ceiling of 850 personnel serving overseas at any one time.</p>
            <p eId="para_576">Ireland's proposed contribution to the Nordic battle group is based on capabilities and equipment already available to the Defence Forces.  A palette of potential offers, ranging from niche capabilities up to, and including, an APC mounted infantry company together with support elements, was identified as part of the study on battle groups undertaken by the interdepartmental working group I established to examine the issue.  As such, the capabilities and the requisite equipment in respect of each potential offer already resides within the Defence Forces and any commitment from the palette will not give rise to additional manpower or expenditure requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_577">Regarding training for battle groups, most training will take place in the contributing member states, that is, Irish troops will mainly be trained in Ireland.  That said, some level of joint training with other battle group elements will be an imperative.  The extent of any such joint training and whether training will extend to exercising is a matter for decision by battle group participants.  No such training has taken place to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_578">The Attorney General has advised that there is a constitutional impediment to training of foreign troops in Ireland.  As such, there are no plans for training of foreign troops in Ireland.  However, as we are not a framework nation that should not be a problem.  Sweden has confirmed, as framework nation for the Nordic battle group, that there will be no requirement for joint training or exercises by the Nordic battle group in Ireland.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_283">
            <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_579">That was an interesting answer.  The Minister said the personnel involved should be deployed on a voluntary basis as far as possible.  Will the Minister agree that section 4 of this year's Defence (Amendment) Act provides for the secondary conscription of Defence Forces personnel to undertake overseas services?  Until now, the attitude of the soldiers in the Defence Forces, and I am mindful of the word "defence" in that title, was civic-minded and the numbers volunteering usually exceeded the numbers required.  That attitude has been welcomed throughout the world in terms of United Nations missions abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_580">Will the Minister communicate with PDFORRA whose general secretary expressed major concern at the annual conference last week about the shift that section 4 of the Defence (Amendment) Act allows?  I do not know if the Minister is aware that the general secretary stated that personnel involved in these activities have always done so on a voluntary basis and that the organisation would pursue all means to defend the voluntary rights of its members on this matter.  That could create a crisis and I urge the Minister to ensure, if possible, that the situation that existed prior to the 2006 Act, and perhaps even prior to the 1993 Act, is endorsed in that members who join the Defence Forces should only be obliged to serve overseas if they volunteer to do so.</p>
            <p eId="para_581">Am I correct in stating that the majority of members of the Defence Forces join to defend the State's sovereignty rather than take part in overseas missions or battle groups in operations throughout the world?  Since our foreign affairs position has changed in that we will now take part in battle groups, will consideration be given to have 2006 as the cut-off date and that those who joined prior to that would be excused from any secondary conscription for operations overseas?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_284" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_582">Deputy Ó Snodaigh referred to the speech by the general secretary of PDFORRA.  I am very familiar with the speech; I listened to it as it was delivered and, along with everybody else in the hall, applauded enthusiastically when it ended.  It was a very good speech.</p>
            <p eId="para_583">Regarding compulsory deployment, the general position has been that when the Army wants people to take part in an overseas mission it uses volunteers, as the Deputy correctly stated.  In fact, it is usually over-subscribed, which was the case in the present instance in Lebanon.  I am open to correction but I understand that since 1993, the Minister for Defence has been able to deploy people compulsorily if a sufficient number of volunteers do not come forward.  I understand also that on occasion there have been deployments of non-volunteers under the legislation when there was a shortage in specialist areas such as cooks, drivers, engineers, technicians etc.  That situation will continue.</p>
            <p eId="para_584">I understand that people who enlisted pre-1993 are excused from being deployed on Chapter VII type missions.  If it is the law since 1993 that only people who enlisted prior to 1993 are excused, it makes little sense now to say we will excuse everybody who enlisted up to 2006.  We would be unable to deploy anybody in that case other than people who may join in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_586">People who volunteer will not be deployed in that case.  If we were short a vital member of staff such as an explosives expert, engineer or medic we would not be able to deploy them.  We would have to go without them if we did not get somebody to volunteer.  I am sure the ordinary troops and those specialists will volunteer but it is a residual right of the Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_587">We are signed up to be on standby for the Nordic battle group from 1 January 2008 for a period of six months.  If the Nordic battle group is deployed, subject to the triple lock mechanism we are committed to joining that battle group if it is to be deployed in certain circumstances.  That is a commitment by the State and the State must do everything to ensure it meets that, including ensuring its domestic laws allow it comply with that commitment, if necessary.</p>

            <p eId="para_588">The Minister said there will not be any joint training in the context of the battle groups in Ireland and that that is not required because we are not a framework nation.  In terms of the legislation we discussed before the summer and the proposal for assembling the battle groups prior to deployment, there would be areas where the troops would be assembled to allow troops from a number of nations to come together and await the signal for redeployment to the theatre of conflict.  Is it a possibility or is it encompassed in the existing legislation that such an assembly could take place in this jurisdiction?</p>

         the details of the new campaign to attract more women into the Defence Forces; his views on the comparatively low number of women in the Defence Forces; his views on whether the change in the height restriction for joining the Defence Forces will attract more women; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_596">I propose to take Questions Nos. 8 and 65 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_597">I am keen to increase the number of women applying to join our Defence Forces.  To facilitate this, with effect from 1 September 2006, I reduced the minimum height requirement for entry into both the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force from 162.56 cm, 5'4", to 157.48 cm, 5'2".  This change, which applies to both males and females, has the effect of increasing the annual recruitment pool of females from 60% to 90% and males from 97% to 98%.  It is too early to gauge whether there has been a corresponding increase in the number of female applicants to the Defence Forces.  However, I will closely monitor the situation in the coming months.</p>
            <p eId="para_598">Height is not the only issue in encouraging more women to apply to join the Defence Forces and I have recently initiated more general research in this area.  Following a tendering process TNS mrbi, an independent market research company, was awarded the contract to undertake research into the issue of recruitment and retention of women in the Defence Forces.  The research will test women's attitudes to military life and a career in the Defence Forces.  The research, which has commenced, will include interviews with serving female members of the Permanent Defence Force and the Reserve Defence Force and members of the public.  The results of the research will inform policy in this area for the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_599">The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women in the Defence Forces, including the Army, the Air Corps, the Naval Service and the Reserve Defence Force, and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities.  Women are eligible, on the same basis as men, for participation in operational and ceremonial activities, for assignment to all military appointments, for educational and training courses and for promotion.  All female personnel undergo the same training and receive the same military education as their male counterparts.  When considering how to encourage more female personnel to the Defence Forces it is important to bear this in mind.</p>

            <p eId="para_600">When will this report be available?  The Minister requested the Department of Education and Science and other groups to send in information on the reluctance of females to apply to join the Defence Forces.  Is that material available?</p>

            <p eId="para_610">How many women are working in the Defence Forces at present?  Will the Minister explain why the number is so low, apart from height restrictions?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_303" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_611">We sought proposals in the middle of last year.  Most groups, apart from PDFORRA and RACO, responded but the responses did not advance the cause.  A response that congratulates us on the idea is very different from one with concrete suggestions.</p>
            <p eId="para_612">I propose to issue a tabular statement on the number of women working in the Defence Forces.  The latest figures available show 9,837 males in the Defence Forces and 545 females.  The position is somewhat better in the reserve, with 7,141 males and 2,433 females.  Only 60% of females over 18 years of age were eligible to apply before the height requirement was reduced, making 90% now eligible.  Misunderstandings exist in the female population about life in the Army despite the best efforts of recruiting officials in the Defence Forces.  They produced literature and visited schools to explain what an attractive life it is.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_614">The number of females applying has increased.  Some 5% to 6% of the Army is female, but last year 9.5% of applicants were female and 10.5% of recruits were female.  The number recruited is proportionate to the number applying.  We are trying to increase the number of females applying by increasing the pool from 60% to 90% and by carrying out research to determine what other measures must be implemented to make the Army more attractive to females.</p>
            <p eId="para_615">Some 25% of members of the reserve are female while the figure for the Permanent Defence Force is 6%.  The same rules apply to the reserve and the Permanent Defence Force.  The height restrictions for both have been reduced.</p>

          <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_306">
            <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
            <p eId="para_616">The Minister's decision to reduce height restrictions is welcome.  I fought for this for many years because the restrictions mitigated against females disproportionately.  The Minister has referred to other issues that discourage females from joining.  It is more than a year since he wrote to various organisations and the response is disappointing.  These organisations have expertise in various areas, yet the State must spend money on researching information that should be forthcoming from them.  The Minister's officials work very hard but I would appreciate if the Minister would provide Opposition spokespersons with a copy of the initial letter and the responses he received.</p>

            <p eId="para_617">I do not see any objection to that and will discuss it with my officials.  I intended to commission research in any case and had sought Government approval for it.  The responses provided no new ideas and this disappointed me, in view of the range of organisations contacted.</p>

          <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_308">
            <from>Mr. Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_618">Height restrictions are the same in the reserve as in the Permanent Defence Force, yet the number of women joining the reserve is five times the number joining the Permanent Defence Force.  It would appear the reasons women are not joining the Permanent Defence Forces are much deeper than simple issues of height.  There must be serious matters that make the Permanent Defence Force an unattractive option for women.  I agree that the Minister should invite further submissions and perhaps give the various spokespersons a package with material that could be distributed to schools.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_619">I look forward to discovering the results of the research.  I wrote to the organisations and asked for their suggestions on how to attract more women into the Defence Forces.  The research will go deeper than this aspect.  Women who have served in the Defence Forces will be interviewed about their experience of life there and women who have not served in the Defence Forces will be interviewed about their perceptions of life in the Defence Forces.  Both perceptions and experiences will be compared.  It will be an interesting report, which I expect to receive in approximately eight weeks.  I have no difficulty with publishing it.  If Deputy Costello believes it is a good idea to write to the various organisations, I have no difficulty with sending them a reminder.</p>

        <b>Mr. Crowe</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Defence</b>
         if his attention has been drawn to the ongoing bullying and harassment of PDFORRA officials within the Defence Forces; and the steps he will take to address the problem and to ensure that a directive that members of the forces who carry out representative duties must not be disadvantaged or discriminated against is no longer ignored. 
        [32314/06]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_310" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_621">I assure the Deputy that any allegations of bullying and harassment in the Defence Forces are treated with the utmost seriousness.  There are extensive processes in place to protect the rights of Defence Forces personnel, including PDFORRA officials.  These procedures give robust protection and I urge PDFORRA officials to avail of them if they feel there are issues to be resolved.</p>
            <p eId="para_622">As I have stated in the House on previous occasions, a wide range of measures have been put in place to deal with issues in this area.  An external advisory committee, chaired by Dr. Eileen Doyle, was tasked with examining this issue in the Defence Forces and the committee presented their original report, "The Challenge of a Workplace", in March 2002.  This independent report addressed a wide range of interpersonal issues within the Defence Forces and its contents and recommendations were accepted in full by the Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_623">An independent monitoring group was established in May 2002 to oversee the implementation of these recommendations and its progress report, "Response to the Challenge of a Workplace", was launched by my predecessor on 24 September 2004.  Arising from the Doyle report, a number of steps have been taken.  Firm guiding principles have been set out in the Defence Forces dignity in the workplace charter.  A major educational awareness programme is ongoing throughout the Defence Forces.  A new administrative instruction on interpersonal relationships was introduced in March 2003.  The instruction and a user's guide were distributed to every member of the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_624">Designated contact persons, DCPs, have been fully trained and are deployed throughout all Defence Forces posts and barracks, both nationwide and overseas.  The DCPs facilitate the operation of the formal and informal procedures that may be used by any party wishing to institute a complaint.  An independent, external confidential freephone helpline and counselling service was set up for members of the Permanent Defence Force in March 2003.  An independent pilot project of exit interviews seeking the experiences and views of outgoing members of the Permanent Defence Force was conducted.  Leadership training has been given by external experts and has been the subject of NCO focus groups with an emphasis on "training the trainers".  Changes in cadet school instruction have been initiated, with issues concerning the ranking, selection and training for cadet school instructors being addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_625">Defence Forces regulations, administrative instructions, policies and procedures have been reviewed by an equality steering group under a Labour Court chairperson.  The Ombudsman for the Defence Forces has now been appointed.  An officer within the Defence Forces human resources management section has been assigned responsibility for equality matters.  A training circular entitled military code of conduct for students and instructors in all training environments was issued in 2004 and was followed by an extensive series of associated workshops for all relevant personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_626">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_627">The specific matter raised by the Deputy is currently the subject of a claim by PDFORRA under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for the Permanent Defence Force.  By agreement with PDFORRA, discussions under the scheme are confidential to the parties involved.  Accordingly, the Deputy will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on this issue at this time.</p>

          <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_311">
            <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
            <p eId="para_628">I welcome the Minister's reply.  He is correct that the Doyle report made a number of recommendations, many of which have been acted upon.  Does he consider it strange then that the president of PDFORRA said at its conference last week that certain barrack commanders punish, harass and charge PDFORRA representatives and deny them access to courses and overseas duty in order to force them out of the association?  The president of the association made a very specific charge.  Is the Minister concerned about it and how does he propose to find out if there is a basis for the charge and if there is ongoing discrimination, punishment or harassment of PDFORRA representatives as happened in the past?  It happened when PDFORRA was first set up and continued for a while.  I, like everyone else, hoped that the advent of the Doyle report would have stopped some of the harassment and victimisation of PDFORRA representatives.  Hopefully, the Minister will take some action on foot of the comments of the president of PDFORRA, Willie Webb.</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_312" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_629">As Deputy Ó Snodaigh rightly acknowledged, the situation was examined by Dr. Doyle in 2002.  She discovered a number of difficulties in respect of people making complaints about bullying.  She made a number of recommendations, which were implemented, as outlined, in 2004.  The situation is being kept under review because the Chief of Staff has a very personal interest and takes a hands-on approach in trying to eradicate bullying or any perception of bullying in the Army to the greatest possible extent.  This means that the follow-up to the Doyle report is being reviewed again next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_630">I was surprised at the PDFORRA president's comments for a number of reasons, particularly in light of all the internal procedures that now exist for dealing with bullying.  If one examines the earlier question about the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, one can see that 12 cases have been referred to her, after the internal procedure failed, following her appointment on 1 December 2005, none of which relates to bullying.</p>
            <p eId="para_631">I was doubly surprised by the PDFORRA president's remarks because I know that the specific allegation referred to by Deputy Ó Snodaigh that PDFORRA members are being discriminated against or bullied because of their membership of the association or because they are making representations has been the subject of a specific complaint.  This complaint has gone to the appropriate subcommittee of the conciliation and arbitration council.  When something goes to this council, both the Department and the other party, namely, PDFORRA, have a duty to maintain confidentiality.  I have not inquired as to how matters stand because I know I am not supposed to talk about it in detail.</p>

            <p eId="para_635">The regulations governing the promotion of enlisted personnel are provided for in Defence Force regulations A 10, part II, as issued by the Minister for Defence.

            <p eId="para_637">The Defence Forces internal grievance procedures allow individual personnel who feel that procedures have not been applied properly to appeal to higher authority.

Do we have a standardised system that is adhered to fairly and strongly by the relevant people?  Part of PDFORRA's criticism was that individual senior officers more or less take the law unto themselves and determine the criteria.  Two tiers of criteria seem to operate, namely, the standardised criteria and the informal criteria applied by individual senior officers.</p>
            <p eId="para_639">At the end of his reply, the Minister mentioned that a review will take place of the new promotions criteria to be established.  Will the Minister elaborate on what that will entail, when we can expect it and how it will operate within the various ranks?</p>

            <p eId="para_640">I do not have any independent evidence that the present promotional system is not strictly adhered to as intended.  A number of experts are of the view the present system must be updated and the Department of Defence has accepted that.  Departmental officials and PDFORRA are discussing a mutually agreeable new system and that reply also applies to the final question.  The matter is in conciliation and arbitration and they are working it out between them.  Ultimately, whatever scheme they agree will come to me for approval, and we will consider the details.  I want to let the two parties involved in conciliation and arbitration work it out between them.</p>

            <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_643">I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 39 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_644">On 2 February 2006, I received a report from Mr. Sean Hurley, whom I appointed to carry out an independent review of the interaction between the Department of Defence and Defence Forces and the parents and family of Private Kevin Barrett in the aftermath of his tragic death, on 18 February 1999, while serving with the 84th Infantry Battalion in Lebanon.  Mr. Hurley examined in detail how the Department and the Defence Forces interacted with the Barrett family after Kevin's death and identified clear failings and shortcomings.</p>
            <p eId="para_645">Immediately on receipt of Mr. Hurley's report, I contacted the Garda Commissioner and asked him to provide me with his early views on any possible assistance the Garda Síochána might be in a position to provide.  The Garda officer assigned to the case continues to examine the files of my Department and the Defence Forces on the case, with a view to determining whether the Garda Síochána can provide any assistance in the matter.  Liaison arrangements have been established between the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces, who continue to provide the fullest co-operation to the Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_646">To date the Defence Forces have assisted in providing access to the considerable number of witnesses associated with the case and have also facilitated the visit by the investigation team to Lebanon and Israel.  The weapon which fired the fatal shot was handed over by the Defence Forces to the Garda Síochána for tests.  At the request of the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces also arranged, with the agreement of the UN, for the return to Ireland of the billet in which Private Barrett died.  Garda inquiries are ongoing and when completed, I expect the Commissioner will contact me in the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_647">The scope of the Garda investigation and the manner in which it proceeds is a matter for the Commissioner.  My understanding is the Garda investigation may be completed before the end of this year.

            <from>Mr. Crowe</from>
            <p eId="para_655">On 31 July, a 20 year old prisoner, Gary Douch, made a request to prison officers in Mountjoy for protection.  They placed him in a holding cell in the basement with at least five other inmates, where he was subsequently battered to death.  One media outlet reported he was beaten for more than one hour, had his head forced down a toilet full of human faeces, his chest was stamped on resulting in its collapse and he was eventually strangled.  No one saw or heard anything.</p>
            <p eId="para_656">The cell was demolished by the Prison Service before members of the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture could inspect it this week.  Every State failure to protect the lives of those in custody, whether in a Garda station or a prison, must be subject to nothing less than an independent investigation.</p>
            <p eId="para_657">In August an investigation was established by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to be conducted by an official from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform reporting back to the Minister.  As argued by the Irish Penal Reform Trust, "Surely, a truly independent inquiry, by definition, must include investigators who are not part of the bureaucracy and ethos of the Prison Service and the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform".  The investigation established by the Minister could be described more as "in-house" than "independent" and as such, it falls far short of our obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
            <p eId="para_658">Inspectors from the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman and Degrading Treatment or Punishment, CPT, tasked with monitoring standards in our prison system, are visiting this week.  The Government was notified of the timing of this visit earlier this year.  The CPT inspectors could have conducted a genuinely independent investigation into the circumstances leading to and surrounding the death of Gary Douch.  They were denied the opportunity to do so because the Prison Service demolished the cell where his murder took place.</p>
            <p eId="para_659">I sincerely hope this action by the Prison Service does not turn out to be an indication of a culture of cover-up akin to that operating within certain sections of the Garda Síochána.  Twenty year old Terence Wheelock died in Garda custody in June 2005.  Gardaí claimed he hanged himself but it is widely believed by his family and friends that he died as a result of Garda brutality.  The Wheelock family's solicitor secured a court order to preserve the cell for forensic evidence.  However, the order was disregarded and the cell was completely renovated destroying all evidence.</p>
            <p eId="para_660">It is only right that we question and get to the bottom of the Prison Service's motive for destroying the holding cell in Mountjoy.  It was destroyed before the report of the internal investigation into Gary Douch's murder was published, and to the best of my knowledge, before this report was submitted to the Minister.  They destroyed it before any related charges could be laid by the Garda and before the European Committee on the Prevention of Torture could inspect it.  At best, the actions of the Prison Service amounts to negligence, at worst a cover-up.</p>
            <p eId="para_661">I want to use this opportunity to call for a truly independent investigation into the death of Gary Douch and all deaths occurring in custody or shortly after someone being in custody.  Will the Government ratify the optional protocol to the Convention Against Torture as is required by the equivalence provisions of the Good Friday Agreement?  Will the Minister introduce legislation to place the prisons' inspector on a statutory footing, introduce a prisoners' ombudsman and remove the current exemption of children in detention from the remit of the Ombudsman for Children?  Will the Government establish and resource an adequate number of mental health treatment centres with appropriate levels of security to bring an end to the practice whereby the prison system acts as a dumping ground for people suffering from mental illness?</p>
            <p eId="para_662">Only truly independent inquiries will uncover the truth and allow lessons to be learned.  By insisting on in-house investigations and allowing the destruction of evidence, the Government learns no lessons.  Building a super-prison will do nothing to prevent the murder, torture and inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners.  It will simply replicate these conditions on a larger scale.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. N. Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_663">The Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, which operates under the aegis of the Council of Europe, was established under the European Convention for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment in 1987.  The committee is composed of lawyers, medical doctors, prison experts, parliamentarians etc. from the member states and carries out its task by periodic and <i>ad hoc</i> visits and on the basis of full co-operation from states.</p>
            <p eId="para_664">During these visits, the committee has the right of unimpeded access at any time of the day or night to any place where persons are detained, whether it be a prison, a Garda station or a mental hospital, and are entitled to speak in private to any detained person.</p>
            <p eId="para_665">The CPT has visited Ireland for inspection purposes on a number of occasions.  The CPT submits a formal report of each visit to the Irish Government, which is subsequently published along with the Government's response.  The report arising from the visit by the CPT to Ireland in 2002 noted that its delegation had received excellent co-operation both before and during the visit.</p>
            <p eId="para_666">The Tánaiste completely rejects the assertion that the instruction to close the holding cell referred to was in any way linked to the current visit by the Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment.  In fact the Tánaiste views such an implication as quite frankly outrageous and completely at odds with the actions of his Department since this tragic incident.  The Deputy should be aware of the appointment of Mr. Michael Mellett to undertake an independent investigation into the events leading to the death of Mr. Douch.  He had been to the scene of the crime and had concluded his examination of the area prior to any action being taken to convert them for alternative usage.</p>

            <p eId="para_669">Normal procedure following a serious criminal incident in a prison is that the scene of the crime is sealed and preserved until the gardaí have concluded their examination.  In normal circumstances, the area would then be cleaned and brought back into commission in its previous use.  In this case it was clear that such a course of action would be completely inappropriate and the Director General of the Irish Prison Service made the decision, in the immediate aftermath of the incident, that for operational reasons, the holding cells would be closed with immediate effect and that they would no longer accommodate prisoners.</p>
            <p eId="para_670">The Tánaiste has repeatedly stated on the record that Mountjoy Prison is an unsuitable prison for the requirements placed upon it and that it is incapable of acting as a modern place of rehabilitation and detention for sentenced persons.

            <from>Mr. Costello</from>
            <p eId="para_675">I would like the Minister for Finance to explain the OPW's new transport policy for the Phoenix Park.  The residential community surrounding the park is concerned about the new transportation and traffic plans that the Minister and the OPW have for the park.</p>
            <p eId="para_676">This 1,750 acre park, the largest public park in any capital city in Europe, is a wonderful amenity for the people of Dublin.  The purpose of the new plan is to reduce through traffic and to make the park more pedestrian friendly.  Unfortunately, the new proposals are such that residents fear they will have the opposite effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_677">Chesterfield Avenue bisects the park from Castleknock Gate to Parkgate Street and the quays.  The new proposals will introduce a bus service for the first time, with 20 new buses on the route.  There are no proposals, however, for a quality bus corridor.  Consequently, the new service will only add to existing peak hour traffic, making Chesterfield Avenue a major commuter feeder route into the city.</p>
            <p eId="para_678">The changes to the other roads in the park will make them unidirectional, with a one way entrance from west and north and a one way exit to the east through Cabra, the North Circular Road and Parkgate Street, directing traffic towards the city every morning.  If the OPW is serious about traffic reduction, it would introduce a bus lane and restrict commuter traffic at peak traffic hours through the park.</p>
            <p eId="para_679">Outside the park, Blackhorse Avenue in Cabra will undoubtedly experience a considerably greater volume of traffic, as will the North Circular Road, Infirmary Road, Prussia Street and Aughrim Street, which already have high levels of traffic.</p>
            <p eId="para_680">I hope the Minister of State can assure us that the report that has just been published will be open for discussion and amendment with the local authority traffic management office, with public representatives and local communities around the park who will be affected by the new changes and that this will all be done before any action is taken regarding the implementation of the report's recommendations.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_681">In mid-March of this year, the Commissioners of Public Works commissioned a traffic management study for the Phoenix Park and the following advertisement was published on 15 April 2006:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_682">PHOENIX PARK TRAFFIC STUDY</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_683">The Phoenix Park is Ireland's premier National Historic Park, and Europe's largest enclosed city park.  It is widely acknowledged as a valuable amenity resource and a major environmental lung for Dublin City.  On the other hand there are competing demands arising from increased development and traffic congestion in Dublin City.  As a result the Phoenix Park faces a number of challenges in ensuring it remains a sustainable, highly valued and safe recreational amenity.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_684">Against this background the Commissioners of Public Works have commissioned Messrs. Faber Maunsell, Consulting Engineers to carry out a comprehensive traffic study of the Phoenix Park.  The study will address the growing pressures on existing Phoenix Park infrastructure and develop proposals designed to protect the Phoenix Park and its users, both now and for the future, while making every effort to facilitate through traffic.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_685">The study will analyse current and future commuting patterns, road safety issues and traffic management proposals.  It will examine the potential for public traffic and road safety improvements.  Proposals will be made for long-term management and monitoring of traffic in the Phoenix Park, in keeping with the objectives of the Phoenix Park Management Plan.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_686">The study involves an extensive public consultation process with interested parties, which will take place over the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_687">This advertisement sets out the background to the study, which included a public consultation process.  A total of 26 submissions from the public were received——</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_689">——and in addition to that, stakeholders in the park, the local authorities, the Garda authorities, the Dublin Transportation Office and the Office of Public Works were consulted.</p>
            <p eId="para_690">In formulating the study therefore, Messrs. Faber Maunsell took a wide range of views into account and a firm of environmental consultants, Messrs. ERM Limited, was also engaged to assess the proposed measures contained in the study from an environmental protection perspective, a vital consideration in the context of this national historic park.</p>
            <p eId="para_691">On completion of the study earlier this month, a number of presentations on the study were arranged on 10 and 11 October for the parties outlined above who contributed to the process.  This included a presentation to resident associations on the perimeter of the Phoenix Park, which I understand Deputy Costello may have attended.</p>
            <p eId="para_692">The commissioning of an independent traffic management study for the Phoenix Park was necessary on a number of counts: to protect this national historic park from growing traffic pressures, to ensure the amenities of the park are not degraded, to ensure public access to the park and its amenities is enhanced, to significantly reduce risks to the public arising from traffic movements, to collate a range of proposals to achieve these objectives and to enhance public awareness on the need for these measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_693">The commissioners are satisfied that positive intervention to address these challenges is absolutely essential and that the "do nothing" approach is not an option.  Following the recent consultation process, the commissioners are considering the phased implementation of a number of the principal measures proposed in the report.</p>

          <speech by="#CatherineMurphy" eId="spk_332">
            <from>Ms C. Murphy</from>
            <p eId="para_694">In the past, we were told it was possible to predict the life chances of babies by looking at their addresses in the maternity ward.  The addresses to which this statement alluded tended to be in areas of significant poverty and disadvantage.  If the same review of maternity wards were to take place today, the address of a baby would still play a part.  However, if a child has a special need or disability, where the child lives will dictate the level of support services available and, as a result, his or her life chances.  The reason is inequality in current service provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_695">Although the Health Service Executive is a single entity, it appears that eight former health boards continue to function behind this organisation.  To highlight what I mean I will refer to three children.  Conor, who is aged three years and has a problem with his speech, requires speech and language therapy and has been placed on a list for assessment.  I received from the HSE a reply to a query informing me that it currently takes 23 to 24 months to complete an assessment and it is working off the 2004 list.  The reason for this waiting period, according to the HSE, is low staffing levels relative to the number of referrals.  On checking further, it emerged that more than 1,500 children are on the County Kildare waiting list, a threefold increase since 2002.  As Conor's mother cannot afford to go privately, her child will have to wait, with the result that he may commence school before receiving an assessment, not to mention treatment.</p>
            <p eId="para_696">In replies from the Health Service Executive, I have been informed that under the "staff employment ceiling" it is not possible to approve all necessary posts.  Rapidly expanding counties such as Kildare are disproportionately affected by this embargo on further recruitment.  The State is perfectly willing to allow a child to attend school with a known disadvantage in a county with the highest class sizes in the country, yet it wonders why he might underperform.</p>
            <p eId="para_697">The second child to whom I draw attention is Tim who was born 18 months ago with Down's syndrome.  He lives in my constituency and featured in an article in the most recent issue of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i>.  The article compared the services available to Tim with those available to another child with the same diagnosis who was born on the same day and lives three miles away in Lucan.  Both children reside in the old Eastern Regional Health Authority region, albeit in different sections of it.  While the parent in County Kildare had to fight for every service the child secured, the other parent in the Dublin area received a seamless service.</p>
            <p eId="para_698">Services for children with Down's syndrome in south Kildare are substantially better than those available in north Kildare.  Tim, like all children with Down's syndrome, requires early intervention which would make him much more receptive to learning at an early stage, an obvious advantage.  He cannot wait until the State gets around to providing services.</p>
            <p eId="para_699">The third case relates to a child of seven years who also lives in my constituency.  He was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder when he was three years old but despite his disability, he is doing well in school.  Initially placed in a special class, he has since progressed to mainstream.  Until now he has had support from Beechpark services which focuses on early services for children with autism.  The child in question requires occupational therapy and speech and language therapy to ensure he does not regress.  In response to a query, his parents received the following incredible statement from the HSE:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_700">Unfortunately we must inform you that we do not have resources to treat children with autism as we are not an autism specific service and our staffing levels are particularly low at present.  We regret to inform you that we do not have an occupational therapist nor a psychologist on our team presently.  We realise that this is an unsatisfactory situation, however it is outside the control of this team.  We can only apologise and regret our lack of resources at present.  Should you be in a position to source the above therapists in a private capacity, we can forward you some information.</p>
            <p eId="para_701">This is shocking.  While it is understandable that the major focus of the HSE has been on hospital beds and accident and emergency departments, the life chances of children are being badly affected by the unequal service the organisation provides.  As I indicated, the little boy to whom I refer is doing well in school.  However, his parents have been told following a professional assessment that if he does not receive the necessary occupational therapy, he will regress.  Providing support to this child now is an investment in ensuring he leads an independent life.</p>
            <p eId="para_702">There is no problem in finding the parents of the children in question when the State seeks taxation.  We need to ensure they receive equal levels of service from the taxes they pay.</p>

            <p eId="para_703">I take this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney.  I am pleased to have an opportunity to address the general issues raised by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_704">I emphasise the Government's commitment to providing high quality services to all people with a disability.  This commitment is illustrated by the substantial investment we have made in services in recent years and the multiannual investment programme provided by the Government for the period 2006 to 2009.  The Government's six sectoral plans on disability, including the plans for the health sector, set out in some detail how we plan to improve the experience of people with a disability.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_707">I accept some of the points raised by the Deputy and will not defend the HSE regarding some of the unacceptable responses all Members receive.  If the Deputy is correct, services should not relate to where one lives.  However, considerable improvements have taken place in services for people with a disability.  For example, between 1997 and 2005 additional revenue and capital funding of €464 million was provided for persons with intellectual disability and autism.  This is not acknowledged in the article the Deputy cited.</p>
            <p eId="para_708">The Government provided additional revenue funding of €74 million<b> </b>in 2006 for services for people with physical, sensory and intellectual disability and those with autism.  The priority this year is to enhance the assessment and support services for children with disabilities.  In particular, these moneys are to meet the costs associated with the commitments in the multiannual investment programme for specific high priority disability services.  This will also help to build the additional capacity in multidisciplinary and other support services required under the Disability Act 2005 and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_709">With regard to the specific services raised by the Deputy, I understand from the HSE that the relevant services in County Kildare are provided in the north of the county by a partnership arrangement between the HSE and the St. John of God services at St. Raphael's Celbridge and in the south of the county in a partnership arrangement between the HSE, Kare and Moore Abbey.</p>
            <p eId="para_710">I also understand that the service in west Dublin and south Kildare has developed extensively in recent months but it has proved difficult for logistical reasons to achieve similar progress in north Kildare.  The HSE has assured me it will work closely with the St. John of God service to develop early learning services in order that it can attain the type of provision available in south Kildare.  The HSE and St. John of God are committed to developing a holistic service that meets children's needs in the area.</p>
            <p eId="para_711">The development of high quality services, available on an equitable and equally accessible basis, throughout the country is an important objective of the Minister and HSE.  I am confident that, over time, the varying levels of service provision will be standardised and that the HSE, as a single national organisation, will achieve this objective.</p>
            <p eId="para_712">I draw the Deputy's attention to the Disability Act, Part 2 of which will be commenced on 1 June next for children under five years.  This Part entitles people with a disability to an assessment of need and to a formal statement of services to be provided.  It will offer greater certainty and consistency in the level and type of services available for children in the circumstances outlined by the Deputy.  I will draw the Minister's attention to the cases raised by the Deputy.</p>

          <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_336">
            <from>Mr. Broughan</from>
            <p eId="para_713">Ongoing media reports about the sale by Dublin City Council of 23 acres of land in the area of Balgriffin, Clare Hall and Belmayne in the Dublin North-East constituency have raised serious concerns locally which must be addressed by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The lands are part of the massive new urban district called the north fringe, which is being created in this constituency and which may ultimately contain more than 20,000 housing units and a major ancillary commercial development around a new city boulevard running from Coolock to the sea at Baldoyle and Portmarnock.</p>
            <p eId="para_714">Concerns were originally expressed about this sale at the Dublin North-Central area committee of Dublin City Council.  The then city managers, Mr. John Fitzgerald and Mr. Sean Carey, informed members that the original sale price was €48 million.  When city councillors queried the reasons for this sale and the price, they were informed the sale was necessary to ensure a new city plaza and linkage to the new east-west central boulevard could be created quickly, since the prospective purchasers, Stanley Holdings, already owned some of the lands necessary to create this important public realm.  The city council was also informed last July that the funds realised by the sale would be ploughed back into public facilities of all kinds in the<b> </b>north fringe and in Dublin North-East generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_715">Despite these assurances, it has emerged that an independent valuation report on these lands, commissioned by Lisney Auctioneers for the city council, was never published or made known to councillors before they approved a managerial report on the sale.  This is an extraordinary state of affairs and another typical example of the need for a root and branch reform of local government.  How could city councillors possibly do their job when they did not know the real value of the land?  I call for the new city manager, Mr. John Tierney, to publish immediately the valuation of the Balgriffin and Clare Hall lands which was prepared by Lisney Auctioneers.  It has been alleged the city council's chief valuer at that time has moved to new employment with Lisney Auctioneers.</p>
            <p eId="para_716">A key difficulty with this sale from the time it first became known is that there was no open public tender process.  The earlier city managers had reported that because part of the site was landlocked from some of the new road developments, the sale price would have been driven steeply down by going to public tender.  However, the original north fringe master plan signally failed even to outline the general uses of most of this district, including the 23 acres in question.  That was one reason I strongly opposed that area action plan in the late 1990s until it was forced through the city council by outgoing city manager, Mr. John Fitzgerald, defeating a motion in my name calling for a new detailed mixed density master plan with a range of community and public transport facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_717">It emerged recently that the original commitment to sell these lands last June included an uplift clause, allowing the city council to renegotiate a higher price which could be exercised any time up to March 2007.  The city council triggered this clause recently and secured a new higher sale price of €60.4 million.  City officials are also claiming there will be additional public realm costs of €7 million in favour of the council when the new Clare Hall plaza and boulevard is built.  However, with six months to go in the timeframe of the uplift clause and with no end to steadily escalating property values on the north side, many of my constituents still wonder if €60.4 million represents full value for these lands and whether they would be worth €100 million by next March.  In an earlier debate in this House on affordable housing, the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, stated the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, provided this land to Dublin City Council for affordable and social housing.  For that reason, the sale of this land should be examined by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who should then report on it to the Committee of Public Accounts.</p>
            <p eId="para_718">A key failure of local and national government in the development of the north fringe lands is the serious lack of joined up planning and public accountability.  The three main developers, Ballymore Homes, Gannon Homes and Shannon Homes, accounting for up to 12,000 housing units alone, have never been the subject of a detailed urban master plan prepared jointly by Dublin City and Fingal County Councils.  There have been planning applications, but there has never been a detailed plan.  The plan put repeatedly before Dublin City Council was only for part of the city council area of the fringe and is based on vague aspirations and principles which are turning out to be a developers' heaven as they go for ever increasing densities.  At the same time, there is almost no public accountability.  I proposed the creation of the north fringe forum which was accepted by the then city manager, Mr. Fitzgerald, and which held its tenth meeting last Tuesday and is composed of residents, public representatives and stakeholders.  However, the forum is powerless and just an interested talking shop.</p>
            <p eId="para_719">For these reasons and because of the disturbing controversy over the Clare Hall and Balgriffin lands, I urge the new Dublin City and Fingal county managers to consider applying to the Minister for strategic development zone status for the remaining undeveloped north fringe lands in Dublin City and Fingal.  The SDZ route should especially be considered for the lands of Belcamp College, where Gannon Homes applied last year for a Manhattan style development of skyscrapers and some of the highest residential density ever seen in Ireland.  I call on the Minister of State to ensure the valuation is published and that there will be an open public tender, that the city council gets full value for money and that the Comptroller and Auditor General examines this matter.  I also call on him to consider strategic development zone status for the north fringe.</p>

            <from>Mr. N. Ahern</from>
            <p eId="para_720">I am pleased to update the House on the proposed sale of lands at Clare Hall and Belmayne.  The purchase of the site was not directly funded by my Department.  The site was part of a 30-acre site bought by Dublin City Council in 1999 for €18.8 million, for social and affordable housing purposes, by means of a housing finance agency loan.  That purchase had the approval of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The council now proposes to sell 23 acres of the site to Stanley Holdings, which owns sites adjacent to this land, for €60.4 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_721">There was some discussion between Department officials and Dublin City Council on the council's decision to dispose of the site.  While a public tendering process often yields a higher value, the council felt the particular circumstances surrounding this site meant the preferable option was to negotiate with the adjacent developer.  The site being sold is surrounded by lands belonging to Stanley Holdings and any successful bidder under a public tendering process would have to negotiate with that company to secure access rights.  This would have the effect of reducing any bid for the lands being sold by the council.  It was the view of the council that negotiating directly with the adjacent developer would leverage the maximum possible outcome for the site.</p>
            <p eId="para_722">In May 2006, the council negotiated a price of €48 million with Stanley Holdings, with an uplift clause built in that would enable the council to revisit the deal if it felt subsequently that a higher valuation of the site was merited.  The council subsequently invoked this clause and recently negotiated a deal worth €60.4 million.  Contract negotiations are nearing completion at this stage.  However, the deal is worth more than the €60.4 million agreed.  Part of the north fringe master plan involves a plaza and the development of a new main street and DART station from Baldoyle to this junction at the Malahide Road end.  As part of the deal negotiated with Stanley Holdings, the company will construct this plaza and new main street on their property within 18 months, and it will then come back into public ownership.</p>
            <p eId="para_723">A resolution agreeing to the disposal of the lands was passed by Dublin City Council.  It is proposed the council will use the funds arising from the sale of these lands for capital projects within the city.  The remaining seven acres from the original 30-acre site purchase by the council in 1999 is being held as part of the council's land bank for future housing needs.</p>
            <p eId="para_724">The Deputy will note that I had reservations about the sale of this site.  It was bought for social and affordable housing and I thought it should be used for that purpose.  The Deputy's party has a majority on the city council and the job of disposing of land is the responsibility of the councillors.</p>

         the co-operation involved between the Irish and US Defence Forces arising from the fact that Ireland is listed as within the area of responsibility of the US European command, with area of responsibility defined as the geographical area within which the US European commander has authority to plan and conduct operations; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_730">There is no co-operation involved between Irish and US Defence Forces arising out of the existence or the role assigned to EUCOM by the US military authorities.  Obviously there is a longstanding relationship with the US Military Forces generally.  Moreover, US Forces have also participated in UN mandated peacekeeping operations alongside Irish troops.  Cooperation with US Forces generally involves attendance at training courses, equipment demonstrations, exchanges of experience and briefings on current operations.  This is the same sort of engagement that the Defence Forces would have in the normal course with the military forces of any country with whom the State has close and friendly relations.</p>
            <p eId="para_731">I understand that there are nine unified combatant commands within the US Military Command structure.  Five of these have regional responsibilities which, taken together, cover the entire surface of the Globe. The US European Command (EUCOM) is one of these regional combatant commands.  Within the US military structures it has responsibility for all of Europe, most of Africa, and parts of the Middle East.   However, this assignment of responsibility does not entail any bilateral arrangements between USEUCOM and Ireland.   In addition, there are no arrangements in place under which the Commander of EUCOM can exercise any authority to plan or conduct operations in Ireland, nor is any such arrangement foreseen.</p>

            <p eId="para_734">I propose to take Questions Nos. 14 and 62 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_735">Ireland is currently contributing 677 Defence Forces personnel to 19 different missions throughout the world. Full details of all personnel currently serving overseas on UN mandated operations, observer missions or undertaking representative or staff postings are listed in the table.</p>
            <p eId="para_736">The main overseas commitments are to the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL), with 328 personnel, to the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo, with 213 personnel and to EUFOR, the EU-led operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with 58 personnel.  Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the UN, EU, OSCE and NATO.</p>
            <p eId="para_737">UNMIL was established in September 2003.  A contingent of the Permanent Defence Forces was deployed for service in December 2003, comprising a motorised infantry battalion of 430 personnel.  The main Irish contingent operates as the Force Commander's Rapid Reaction Reserve.  The role of the Irish personnel is the provision of an immediate response capability, deployable in sufficient strength and with the required level of force, to provide a swift and decisive military reaction in any crisis situation.  The contingent undertakes regular daily patrols within Monrovia and is available to the Force Commander to provide support in the event of a breakdown of law and order or further conflict.  Ireland and Sweden agreed in December 2005 to provide support in expanding the area of operations to include Sierra Leone, including protection of the Special Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_738">Ireland was due to complete its participation in UNMIL in November 2006.  However, in response to a request earlier this year from the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, to the Taoiseach, it was decided to extend the duration of the deployment in Liberia to May 2007, in order to give the UN time to find a suitable replacement for the QRF capability.  The Swedish contingent, which currently partners Ireland in the QRF, will withdraw in November, 2006, and will be replaced by a Company from Pakistan.  In May, 2007, the Irish contingent will be withdrawn and, to this end, mission downsizing has now commenced with the agreement of the UN.  Pakistan will assume overall responsibility for the provision of the QRF in UNMIL on Ireland's withdrawal.</p>
            <p eId="para_739">KFOR was established in June, 1999 to support the maintenance of civil law and order within Kosovo, so as to develop a climate of safety and security, which will enable the transfer of increased responsibility to the civil authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_740">Ireland has participated in the KFOR since August 1999.  The Irish contingent currently comprises an APC Mounted Infantry Group of some 213 personnel including a number of personnel in staff posts at various KFOR Headquarters.</p>
            <p eId="para_741">A reorganisation and downsizing of the forces in KFOR, including the Irish contingent, was planned and had partly commenced when civil disturbances broke out in March 2004 in Kosovo.  That downsizing was deferred to allow the situation to settle, this remains the current situation.  Having regard to the fragility of the peace in Kosovo and subject to ongoing assessments of the situation on the ground, Ireland has decided to maintain a continued presence in KFOR in 2006/2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_742">Last month, the Government agreed to the Defence Forces undertaking an additional responsibility as Framework Nation for the Multinational Task Force Centre (MNTF (C)) in KFOR from August 2007.  This will be a new development for the Defence Forces as we have never before commanded a brigade size force in multinational PfP-led peace support operation.  Undertaking this new responsibility will contribute significantly to the development of the Defence Forces, improving its capabilities and heightening its profile as a professional and well-organised force within the international peacekeeping community.</p>
            <p eId="para_743">Operation Althea — EUFOR, an EU military mission, was established in November 2004 to replace Stabilisation Force (SFOR), a NATO-led mission in Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina.  Ireland had participated in SFOR since 1997.  Ireland is part of the Austrian-led Multinational Task Force (North) and provides personnel for the headquarters, the Military Police Unit, Verification Teams and a National Support element.  Ireland currently acts as the Framework Nation for the Military Police Platoon.</p>
            <p eId="para_744">UNIFIL</p>
            <p eId="para_745">Earlier this month, the Government agreed, subject to Dáil approval, the despatch of a contingent of the Defence Forces for service as part of a joint Finnish/Irish Unit with United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL). The necessary enabling motion was moved in the Dáil on 10 October, 2006 and was approved yesterday.</p>
            <p eId="para_746">The Finnish engineering unit will carry out tasks in support of UNIFIL and also some humanitarian work, including dealing with unexploded ordnance clearance. While the Irish element will be tasked primarily for reconnaissance, security and protection duties associated with the engineering works, it will also be available for other taskings by the Force Commander of UNIFIL.</p>
            <p eId="para_747">The Defence Forces contingent of approximately 150 troops will bring the numbers currently serving overseas to approximately 830.  Ireland's commitment under the United Nations Stand-by Arrangements System (UNSAS) is 850, which represents 10% of the total Army strength.  This is the figure set in the White paper on Defence and is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas operations.  There are no plans at this time to increase the level of our commitment to UNSAS and any contribution to EU or UN Missions will be met within the context of the 850 ceiling.</p>

            <p eId="para_825">Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel is the principal base of the Air Corps. With the withdrawal of aircraft from Gormanston and the relocation of Air Corps headquarters to Baldonnel, the Air Corps has the basis for better management of its resources. Baldonnel will continue to be the centre of military aviation in Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_826">Periodic interest has been expressed by the private sector during the past decade or so in relation to the use of Casement Aerodrome for Civil Aviation purposes.  No recent approaches, however, have been made to my Department in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_827">The establishment of facilities for civil aviation purposes is primarily a matter for the Minister for Transport. Under the Irish Aviation Authority Act 1993, however, aerodromes under my authority are precluded from regulation by the Irish Aviation Authority. Only the regulation of military aviation activities at military aerodromes comes within my remit.</p>
            <p eId="para_828">Before any consideration could be given to having commercial aviation at Baldonnel it would be necessary to bring Casement Aerodrome within the licensing and regulatory control of the Irish Aviation Authority, which would require an amendment to Section 3 of the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993. This is a matter for consideration in the first instance by the Minister for Transport.</p>

            <p eId="para_833">I propose to take Questions Nos. 16, 29, 44 and 67 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_834">The Naval Service provides the maritime element of the Defence Forces and has a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime Defence requirements. The Naval Service operates eight general-purpose patrol ships. All eight ships are involved in coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State in that part of the seas where State jurisdiction applies such as Internal Waters, Territorial Sea and the Irish Sector of the Exclusive Economic Zone.</p>
            <p eId="para_835">The main day-to-day role of the Naval Service is to provide a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  The Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the Exclusive Fishery Limits.</p>
            <p eId="para_836">The current Exclusive Fishery Limits extend to 200 miles offshore and cover an area of 132,000 square miles.  The Naval Service currently patrols the entire 200 mile limit and periodically patrols beyond these limits to protect specific fisheries. These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary.  The number of Patrol Vessels on patrol in Irish waters at any one time varies between three and seven. The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time.</p>
            <p eId="para_837">Last year the Naval Service achieved a total of 1,682 patrol days, of which 93% related to fishery protection.  This was an increase of more than 5% over the total patrol days for 2004.  In the course of these patrols, a total of 2,068 vessels were boarded, 41 were detained and 111 warnings were issued.  These outputs reveal a focused and committed Naval Service that is continuing to produce high levels of performance.</p>
            <p eId="para_838">The reorganisation of the Naval Service was designed to ensure that when fully implemented all personnel would spend alternate periods of two years in a shore based appointment followed by a ship based appointment.   In this regard, I should point out that two years in a ship based appointment does not imply that people spend two years at sea.  This is managed locally by the Flag Officer commanding the Naval Service.  However, where there are shortages of skilled personnel within the Naval Service, it may be necessary for personnel to carry out sea-going duties more frequently.</p>
            <p eId="para_839">The impact of seagoing is well understood by Naval Personnel at all levels and the Naval Service endeavours to operate a planned approach to the sea/shore rotation of personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_840">Other than for Able Seamen there is no particular problem with maintaining sea/shore rotation for personnel. There are however, individual, cases where this may not be exactly maintained e.g. Personnel regularly apply to extend their period at sea beyond 2 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_841">I believe that it is essential that we retain highly trained and experienced personnel in the Naval Service.  However in recent years there are great opportunities in the private sector for well qualified and highly motivated people.  As one might expect, members of the Permanent Defence Force, including the Naval Service take up offers of civilian employment in times of economic prosperity.  There are two quite distinctive factors which specifically impinge upon the general Permanent Defence Force situation in this regard.  Firstly, the immediate availability at a relatively young age of pension and gratuities.  Secondly, it is widely recognised, not least by private sector employers, that the programmes of personal development and training available in the Defence Forces are second to none and can stand comparison with the best in the private sector.   Obviously, such personnel, already pre-trained and well experienced to the highest levels, are a tempting target to the private sector.  In addition, the unique leadership and management skills of personnel has made them a very attractive target for recruitment in the private sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_842">To date this year there have been 60 discharges from the naval service.  Of this figure 16 retired on pension/age grounds, 38 left at their own request and the remaining 6 were discharged on a variety of grounds.</p>
            <p eId="para_843">I am very much aware of the report A Voyage of Discovery and in fact on the 19th September I held discussions with a PDFORRA delegation and representatives of the Naval Service regarding the effects of patrol duties on personnel of the Naval Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_844">I am pleased to say that our meeting reached agreement on a process to examine this issue and find potential solutions.  A further series of meetings will take place between the Deputy Chief of Staff (Support) and PDFORRA over the coming months.  The purpose of the meetings is to examine the complex issues raised by PDFORRA with a view to exploring a possible resolution.  I will be monitoring progress in this area closely.</p>
            <p eId="para_845">It goes without saying that members of the naval service go to sea. At the same time both my Department and I are committed to ensuring that the Naval Service and the Defence Forces as a whole provides a challenging and rewarding career and a supportive working environment.</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_346">
            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_851">I propose to take Questions Nos. 17, 20, 43, 52 and 175 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_852">UNIFIL was originally established on 19 March 1978 under United Nations Security Council resolutions 425 and 426, following the invasion of Lebanon by Israel, with a mandate "to confirm the withdrawal of Israeli Forces, to restore international peace and security and to assist the Government of Lebanon in ensuring the return of its effective authority in the area".  The Secretary General of the United Nations concluded that as of 16 June, 2000 Israel had withdrawn its forces from Lebanon in accordance with resolution 425 (1978), thus partially fulfilling UNIFIL's original mandate. Since then, UNIFIL has continued to operate in Southern Lebanon. The mission continued to focus on the remaining part of its mandate: the restoration of peace and security in the region, through observing, monitoring and reporting on developments in its area of operation, liaising with the parties, with a view to correcting violations along the line of withdrawal, the so-called Blue Line, and preventing the escalation of incidents.</p>
            <p eId="para_853">Ireland has participated in UNIFIL since 1978. Between May 1978 and November 2001, the Defence Forces had an infantry battalion (approx. strength 540 personnel) in Lebanon, together with approximately 100 personnel in UNIFIL Headquarters and the Force Mobile Reserve.  Since November 2001, a small number of Defence Forces personnel continued to serve at the Force Headquarters in Naqoura. Five (5) personnel are currently deployed at the Force Headquarters.</p>
            <p eId="para_854">In response to the July/August 2006 crisis, the UN decided, under UN Security Council Resolution 1701, to extend the mandate of UNIFIL to the end of August, 2007, and to increase its troop strength from approx 2,000 troops to a maximum of 15,000.  The Council also decided that, in addition to carrying out its original mandate under Council resolutions 425 and 426, UNIFIL would also monitor the cessation of hostilities; accompany and support the Lebanese armed forces as they deploy throughout Southern Lebanon; and extend its assistance to help ensure humanitarian access to civilian populations and the voluntary and safe return of displaced persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">The nature of the expanded UNIFIL mandate is such that its role is to be considerably more robust than it was prior to the adoption of Resolution 1701, while still operating under Chapter VI of the UN Charter.  UNIFIL will assist the Government of Lebanon to exercise its authority throughout the UNIFIL area of operations.  It will take all necessary action, acting in support of the Government of Lebanon, "to ensure that its area of operations is not utilised for hostile activities of any kind and to resist attempts by forceful means to prevent it from discharging its duties" under the mandate of the Security Council.  UNIFIL is not charged with disarming the Hezbollah.  The question of disarming Hezbollah is a matter for the Lebanese Government.  Moreover, it is recognised that this can only take place in the context of an overall political process in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_856">Following on from the ceasefire, which took effect on 14 August, 2006, the Government here has been monitoring the situation with a view to determining how best Ireland might contribute to the expanded UNIFIL II mission.  As the Deputies will appreciate, given our other existing commitments, the Defence Forces have limited resources to contribute to this mission.  Against this background, an option was identified whereby Ireland might partner Finnish troops and provide a protection detail to a planned Finnish Engineering Company.</p>
            <p eId="para_857">While there are risks attaching to any peacekeeping operation, a key aspect and the primary concern in relation to participation in any mission is the safety and security of Defence Forces personnel.  For this reason, the Defence Forces undertook a joint reconnaissance mission to Lebanon last month.  Following consultation with our Finnish colleagues, UNIFIL and other parties, it is assessed that there is no direct threat to UNIFIL personnel.  That said, the uncertain and volatile situation means that incidents, misunderstandings or wider political developments all have the potential to impact negatively on the peacekeeping operation, while the large quantity of cluster-bomblets and other unexploded ordnance also present a risk.  However, the ceasefire seems to be holding well and the Defence Forces have assessed the overall threat as "LOW within a volatile situation", not dissimilar to that encountered by Irish personnel on other peace support missions. Given the Defence Forces equipment, training and experience, the Chief of Staff has advised me that the mission is within the capability of Defence Forces personnel and that they can play a meaningful role.</p>
            <p eId="para_858">On 3 October, 2006, the Government authorised, subject to Dáil approval, the despatch of a contingent of the Defence Forces to UNIFIL.  The necessary enabling motion was moved in the Dáil on 10 October,  2006 and was approved yesterday.</p>
            <p eId="para_859">Following detailed discussions between the Defence Forces and their Finnish counterparts, including a joint reconnaissance mission to Lebanon, the current plan envisages the deployment of a Finnish engineering unit with an Irish protection detail in the Eastern Sector area of Lebanon.  The planned Irish contingent will consist of approximately 150 Defence Forces personnel.  The five (5) Defence Forces personnel currently serving in Lebanon will continue to be deployed at the UNIFIL Force Headquarters.</p>
            <p eId="para_860">The Finnish/Irish engineering unit will carry out tasks in support of UNIFIL and also some humanitarian work, including dealing with unexploded ordnance clearance and reconstruction. While the Irish element will be tasked primarily for reconnaissance, security and protection duties associated with the engineering works, it will also be available to undertake other tasks at the request of the UNIFIL Force Commander.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">Deployment to UNIFIL will take place on 30/31 October 2006 and,  if approved,  will bring the total number of Defence Forces personnel serving overseas to about 830 personnel which is within the UNSAS ceiling of 850.</p>
            <p eId="para_862">Initial deployment would be for 1 year subject to renewal of the mandate and a satisfactory review of the mission at that time.  In line with standing policy that the duration of any deployment should be set at the outset of a mission, it is considered that Defence Forces involvement in UNIFIL should not exceed a maximum of 2 to 3 years in duration.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_866">I propose to take Questions Nos. 18, 21 and 66 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_867">KFOR was established on 10 June, 1999, in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 1244, for an initial period of twelve months, to continue thereafter unless the UN Security Council decides otherwise. KFOR's mandate is to establish a secure environment in Kosovo conducive to the implementation of refugee return and reconstruction. KFOR has a current strength of approximately 15,000 troops drawn from 24 NATO countries and 11 non-NATO countries including Ireland, Austria, Finland and Sweden.  The KFOR mandate is expected to continue for some considerable time to come.</p>
            <p eId="para_868">Ireland has participated in KFOR since August 1999, following Government Decision and subsequent approval by Dáil Éireann of the necessary enabling motion. The Irish contingent currently comprises an Infantry Group of some 213 personnel including a number of personnel in staff posts at various Headquarters.  The Infantry Group was first deployed in September 2003. Previously a Transport Group had been deployed with KFOR.</p>
            <p eId="para_869">KFOR is organised into five Multinational Task Forces (MNTFs), each having a designated area of responsibility.  Each Task Force comes under the command of a Framework Nation, being one of the States contributing to the particular Task Force. All Task Forces fall under a single chain of command, namely the Commander of KFOR, located at KFOR HQ, in Pristina.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">The Irish Infantry Group serves in the Multi-National Task Force (Centre), which comprises approximately 1,200 personnel.  Five other nations participate in this Task force: — Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden, Finland and Latvia with Sweden currently acting as Framework Nation.  The Task Force's area of responsibility is generally the Pristina region, covering 7 municipalities with a population of approximately 1 million people. The Irish commitment comprises a MOWAG mounted APC Company together with support and logistic elements and various HQ personnel.  Twelve personnel are also serving at KFOR HQ.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">Ireland will take over from Sweden as Framework Nation in the Multinational Task Force (Centre) in KFOR for the first time in August 2007 for a period of one (1) year to 31 July 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">The role of the Framework Nation is to assume responsibility for the coordination and control of the Headquarters of the Multinational Task Force (Centre), commanding, controlling and directing task force operations.  The Framework Nation provides the Force Commander for the task force and most of the key planning and logistics appointments in the Force Headquarters.  It is obliged to provide assets and capabilities to the Task Force, including a substantial input of resources to cater for accommodation, building maintenance, water, electricity, sewerage, catering, communications, transport, security, administration and barrack services. In addition, the Framework Nation is responsible for supporting other Task Force contributors in their operations so as to maintain the overall effectiveness of the Task Force as a whole.</p>
            <p eId="para_873">Assumption of the role of Framework Nation will entail the deployment of approximately 60 additional personnel to KFOR.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">KFOR is a multinational operation with contributions from a wide range of countries, each of which undertakes particular responsibilities, and lead roles in relation to certain activities.  In the case of MNTF (Centre), the Finns have the lead role in the area of Civil Affairs, more commonly known as Civil-Military Cooperation or CIMIC.   They have performed this role successfully for a long period of time.  Ireland will continue to deploy a Staff Officer in the CIMIC cell in MNTF Centre.  However, there are no plans to increase our contribution to this part of the headquarters structure. That said, the Irish contingent will continue to undertake CIMIC type work and humanitarian tasks within its area of responsibility with support from Irish Aid.</p>
            <p eId="para_875">Ireland becoming Framework Nation will represent a significant progression in the development of Defence Forces peacekeeping capabilities.  For the first time an Irish officer will be in command and control of a multinational brigade sized force in a Partnership for Peace (PfP) led peace support operation.  A large number of Defence Forces Officers and NCOs will serve in core HQ posts, exercising overall command and control over the operations of the Task Force.  In addition, Ireland will be seen by its partner nations as being prepared to share the burden of Framework Nation, which is seen as an extremely important and high profile, if onerous, responsibility.  Benefit will also accrue to the Defence Forces, both at operational and individual level, enhancing the depth of experience and contributing to the overall development and modernisation of the Defence Forces.  Other nations, which have served as Framework Nation, have remarked on the positive impact it has had on the modernisation and transformation of their armed forces.  A term as Framework Nation will also maintain and add to Ireland's profile and reputation as a provider of professional and interoperable forces for international peace support operations, which is a key objective of our participation in PfP generally.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_877">I presume the Deputy is referring to a recent press article concerning allegations made on a Lebanese television station that a member of the Irish Army had been fighting alongside Israeli soldiers during the recent conflict in Lebanon.  As the basis for its assertion, the television station reported that the identity card of a member of the Irish Defence Forces was found amongst items recovered in an area recently vacated by personnel of the Israeli Defence Forces in South Lebanon.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">There is no information available to the military authorities to substantiate the claim made by the Lebanese TV Station ‘AL MANAR', which I understand is owned and controlled by Hezbollah.  However, I can state categorically that no member of the Defence Forces was fighting alongside the Israeli forces and the person, whose ID was found, is still a member of the Defence Forces and was not in Lebanon during the recent conflict.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">The military authorities have confirmed that an incident occurred in 1997 and was reported by them at the time, when an Irish unit serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) was engaged in mine-clearing duties outside a village close to one of the outposts manned by the then South Lebanese (Christian) Militia (SLA).  A member of the Irish unit was injured and medical assistance was rendered by a member of the SLA, which required the removal of the soldier's trouser leg containing his wallet and ID card.  The loss was reported at the time and the ID card, which I understand has since expired, was cancelled.  We have no information as to how the ID card, which, as I have said, was lost in 1997, came to be found in items discovered during the recent conflict in Lebanon.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">I have had no contact with the Israeli or Lebanese authorities arising from the recent article.</p>

            <p eId="para_883">I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 47 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_884">The White Paper on Defence outlines the blue print for a new Reserve Defence Force. The new Reserve will have a clearly defined role, an enhanced relationship with the PDF, better equipment and training and opportunities to serve on overseas peace support missions.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">The Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Plan, which was formally launched in July 2004, is progressing on schedule. This plan provides for the phased enhancement of Reserve capabilities over the period to end 2009. To date the Reserve has been reorganised along similar lines to the Permanent Defence Force with three Brigades, a Reserve Defence Force Training Authority located in the Defence Forces Training Centre in the Curragh and a dedicated Naval Service Reserve. These new organisational structures were introduced on 1st October 2005. In addition to the reorganisation, the Reserve has seen significant improvements in clothing, equipment and enhanced training opportunities.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">The development of the integrated element of the Reserve is currently being progressed and it is planned to introduce elements of the integrated Reserve, on a pilot basis, in 2007.  This element of the Reserve will provide personnel who will integrate with PDF units in contingency situations. The Integrated Reserve will be provided with enhanced military training and PDF unit commanders will be responsible for the training of such Reserve personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">The phased enhancement of Reserve capabilities and improvements in interoperability between the Reserve and the PDF, as provided for in the plan, are significant enablers in facilitating any future participation by Reserve personnel in overseas peace support missions.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">While there are no immediate plans for participation by members of the Reserve in overseas missions, policies to support the selection of suitably qualified personnel for overseas duties will be developed over the lifetime of the Implementation Plan i.e. over the period to end 2009.  In other countries, service by Reservists on overseas peace support missions is quite common, although as specified in the Plan, any such participation by members of the Reserve is likely to be in specialised areas such as medical, transport, engineering and communications and information services. This will also be subject to personnel having suitable qualifications, their personal availability and appropriate advance training.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">Development of policies to support the selection of suitably qualified Reserve personnel for overseas duties will include consideration of the impact of overseas duties on the employment of Reserve personnel.  The question of legislation will also be considered in this context.</p>

            <p eId="para_891">Since 1958, the Defence Forces has had a continuous and distinguished presence on peacekeeping duties throughout the world and are currently contributing 677 personnel to 19 different missions.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">The main commitments are to the United Nations Mission to Liberia (UNMIL), to the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo and to EUFOR, the EU-led operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations (UN), the European Union (EU) and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the UN, EU, OSCE, and NATO.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">Last week the Government approved my proposals for the despatch of a contingent of the Defence Forces to Lebanon as part of a joint Finnish/Irish Unit to UNIFIL 2.  While the final details are being worked out it is expected that the Irish contingent will comprise approximately 150 personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_894">When visiting Irish troops serving in Liberia and the Balkans I saw at first hand the dedication and professionalism of military personnel in bringing comfort and hope to those who are less fortunate than us.  I want to again express my appreciation and that of the Government for the tremendous work being done by the Defence Forces on the international stage in the cause of peace.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">The current rate of Overseas Peace Support Allowance (OPSA) payable to enlisted personnel serving overseas ranges from €52.86 to €56.62 per day.  In addition to this, an Overseas Armed Peace Support Allowance (OAPSA) of €21.36 per day is payable for certain missions. When addressing the Annual Delegate Conference of the Permanent Defence Force Other Ranks Representative Association (PDFORRA) in Waterford last week, I stated that should the Association wish to submit a claim for an increase in these allowances, such a claim would receive sympathetic consideration. Any such claim would, of course, have to be processed through the normal conciliation and arbitration channels and would have to meet the conditions required by the new Public Service Pay Agreement-Towards 2016.</p>

            <p eId="para_898">I propose to take Questions Nos. 25 and 56 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">The Government Task Force on Emergency Planning and the Inter-Departmental Working Group meet on a regular basis. The last Task Force meeting was held on Tuesday 3rd October 2006. The Inter-Departmental Working Group (IDWG) last met on 20 September 2006.  While dates have not been decided for the next Task Force or IDWG meetings, these are normally held every four to six weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">The State's response to any security alert is primarily a matter for the Tánaiste &amp; Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. While it would be inappropriate to comment on a particular security issue, I can reassure the Deputy that the Garda authorities maintain an up-to-date assessment of threats through analysis of intelligence gathered from domestic and international sources.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">I can confirm that the Garda Síochána has developed excellent lines of communication and co-operation with police forces and security services in the European Union and further afield.  The ongoing sharing of intelligence enables a rapid operational response to be put in place where circumstances so warrant.  This includes monitoring of any alerts relating to aviation security, in consultation with the Department of Transport.</p>

            <p eId="para_903">The Government decision on decentralisation, announced by the Minister for Finance in his Budget statement on 3 December 2003, provides for the transfer of all of my Department's Dublin based civil service staff to Newbridge, Co. Kildare.  The number of staff to be relocated to Newbridge is 200. Sixty staff from within my Department have opted to move to Newbridge, and in addition twenty-nine staff have been assigned from other Departments to date, giving a total of 89 staff in place who will be assigned to Newbridge. I would expect to have close to my full allocation of staff in place in my Department in the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">The Office of Public Works is in advanced negotiations with Kildare County Council in relation to the acquisition of a site in Newbridge. Once this site is acquired, I would anticipate that my Department will relocate to Newbridge by late 2008. There are currently no plans to move staff to Newbridge in advance of this date.</p>
            <p eId="para_905">The Government decision on decentralisation also provides for the transfer of 300 Defence Forces Headquarters staff to the Curragh, Co. Kildare.</p>
            <p eId="para_906">The brief for the new Defence Forces Headquarters building has been finalised and preliminary topographical and site investigations have been completed.  The Office of Public Works is finalising the outline design currently, to enable the project to be sent to tender.

            <p eId="para_908">The European Defence Agency Steering Board met in National Armaments Directors formation in Brussels on 20th September, 2006.  The EDA Steering Board meets at different levels i.e. at ministerial level and at official level.  In the case of meetings at National Armaments Directors level, an official from my Department acts as our representative at the Steering Board and attended the meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">Among the responsibilities of the EDA is to explore ways in which to strengthen the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base (EDTIB).  In this regard, the Agency has been examining a number of areas to support greater cohesion and to reduce the level of fragmentation in the sector.  At the Steering Board in National Armaments Directors format on 20 September 2006, the Board discussed a range of issues relating to the Defence Equipment Market and the Technological and Industrial Base both of which are complimentary in seeking to reform, rationalise and strengthen the defence industrial sector.  The Board reviewed the operation of the code of conduct on procurement, the code of best practice in the supply chain, together with issues relating to security of supply, security of information and offsets.  All these initiatives are designed to improve the overall operation of the defence equipment market, eliminate market distortions and reduce the level of recourse by member States to Article 296 for defence equipment procurement.</p>
            <p eId="para_910">In tandem with these market initiatives, the Agency is also examining how it can support greater co-operation among companies in the European defence industry so as to maintain and strengthen the industrial base.  The report of the Agency on the European Defence Technological and Industrial Base recognises that, given the pressure on current national Defence Budgets and continuing fragmentation in both supply and demand, it is likely that the European defence industry will struggle to remain globally competitive into the future.  The Agency set out a number of proposals to start addressing this issue.   The view of the Agency is that the industry, in the future, must be Capability driven (responsive to PMS and EU defence needs), Competent (capable of delivering cutting-edge technology on time) and Competitive.</p>
            <p eId="para_911">The Steering Board agreed with the Agency's analysis and tasked the Agency to identity, in consultation with Aerospace and Defence Industries Association of Europe, the main challenges and opportunities for the European defence industry, and to work with participating Member States to identify priority technologies for preservation or development at European level with a view to improving effective R&amp;T collaboration.</p>

            <p eId="para_919">The Garda Síochána have primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State.  The potential threats to the State arising from terrorism are continuously monitored by them in cooperation with the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_920">The Defence Forces make contingency plans for a range of scenarios where the security of the State may be at risk.  In addition, the Defence Forces have contingency plans in place in relation to the provision of Aid to the Civil Power (meaning in practice to assist, when requested, an Garda Síochána), and the provision of assistance to the Civil Authorities for a range of emergency situations.</p>
            <p eId="para_921">The Defence Forces have available to them equipment for monitoring and protecting their members in dealing with Nuclear, Biological or Chemical (NBC) threats identified from time to time.  They hold an extensive range of modern NBC equipment that meets their current requirements. This range includes approximately 9,500 NBC suits, of which 800 were delivered in January 2006. In addition, the Defence Forces has sufficient stock of Respirators for each individual soldier. They also have 98 of the most technologically up to date Chemical Agent Monitors and Defence Forces personnel have been trained on their operation. Other equipment on hands includes Biological Agent Detector and Screening Kits, Group Decontamination Equipment and Personal Decontamination Equipment.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">The requirement for additional NBC equipment is kept under continuous review by the Defence Forces. A programme for the purchase of NBC equipment is ongoing and whatever equipment deemed necessary is purchased expeditiously to meet the changing requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">On the issue of body armour, a tender competition was held in 2005 for the provision of body armour for the individual soldier on operational duties. An order was placed for 6000 units for delivery this year. The delivery of the 6000 units is ongoing at present. The new body armour provides significantly greater protection, comfort and coverage than the old model as well as a doubling of the range of sizes available. A further order for 2000 units has been placed. It is expected that delivery of the 2000 units will also be made by the end of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_926">The revised cadetship competition is now seen as the primary means of commissioning from the ranks. The cadetship competition has been revised to increase the maximum entry age to 28 and to award bonus marks to candidates with previous experience in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) or Reserve Defence Force (RDF).  Results for the 2006 cadetship competition were encouraging with 13% of PDF and 8% of RDF applicants being successful in obtaining cadetships as against 4% of "civilian" candidates.</p>
            <p eId="para_927">Consultations with the representative associations are ongoing regarding the conditions for a Commissioning From the Ranks competition, which it is intended to hold in the coming months. This competition will provide an opportunity for enlisted personnel who have passed the cadet entry age to compete for entry on a potential Officers Course and ultimately, a commission.

            <p eId="para_932">I can advise the Deputies that in recognition of the valuable work of the Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA) and to mark almost 50 years of Defence Forces involvement in international peacekeeping with the United Nations, I was yesterday pleased to mark this important contribution by supporting the work of IUNVA in the form of a once off grant of €50,000 from my Department. I hope that this will go some way towards assisting IUNVA in its most valuable and worthwhile activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_933">The Irish United Nations Veterans Association (IUNVA) was formed in 1990. The Association is non-denominational, non-political and non-sectarian. Membership is available to any Irish resident who has successfully completed a tour of duty with a UN Force or Organisation, whether he or she is serving or retired.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">IUNVA's primary role is providing advice and counselling to members and their families who have been affected by their overseas service. The Association, which is financed by membership fees, voluntary contributions and fundraising, also organises social, cultural and sporting events for its members.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">As fellow veterans of U.N. operations world-wide, IUNVA supports soldiers, Gardaí and civilian personnel who serve in often dangerous and difficult circumstances. These personnel have contributed to almost 50 years of peacekeeping with courage and professionalism. IUNVA continues to support such personnel where the need arises with an understanding and insight born of their own personal experiences of overseas service.</p>

            <p eId="para_937">The case to which the Deputy refers relates to the killing of Private Thomas Barrett and Private Derek Smallhorne while serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in 1980.  The question of the measures open to the Irish Authorities to bring the alleged perpetrator of this crime to justice has been examined in detail in the Department of Defence in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Attorney General's Office.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">The Attorney General has advised that there are no provisions in Irish law which provide a basis for Ireland to pursue a prosecution against the alleged perpetrator.  The Attorney did indicate, however, that while untested and potentially difficult, it might be possible for Ireland to pursue a prosecution under the provisions of the Geneva Conventions.  While this appears an outside possibility, nevertheless, the Minister for Defence has asked the DPP, who would be responsible for pursuing any prosecution, to review the matter.  The Office of the DPP has examined all the available evidence in the case and has concluded that he cannot pursue a prosecution against the alleged perpetrator.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">The country with primary jurisdiction in this case is Lebanon.  At the request of the Minister for Defence, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, through the Embassy of Ireland in Cairo, which is accredited to Beirut, has conveyed to the Lebanese authorities our earnest desire and determination to see the alleged perpetrator brought to justice and to advise them that we will assist in whatever manner we can, should the Lebanese authorities be able to bring him to justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_940">The Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs are also in contact with the US authorities, where the alleged perpetrator resides as a naturalised US citizen. The US authorities have been kept apprised of developments in the case.</p>
            <p eId="para_941">The Minister for Defence will continue to explore such avenues as may be open to him to seek justice in respect of Privates Barrett and Smallhorne. However, it will be appreciated that the long passage of time since the tragic incident will create its own difficulties in terms of mounting a prosecution, even if we can make the alleged perpetrator amenable to justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">The Defence Forces continue to maintain contact with the Barrett and Smallhorne families.</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_359">
            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_951">I propose to take Questions Nos. 34, 36, 53, 54, 60, 174, 176 and 180 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_952">The strength of the Permanent Defence Force on 31 August 2006, the latest date for which detailed figures are available, as advised by the military authorities is 10,382.   A detailed breakdown of the numbers in the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps by rank and gender are in the form of a Tabular Statement which I propose to circulate with the Official Report.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">In total there are currently 545 female personnel serving in the Permanent Defence Force.  Over the past nine years, the strength of female personnel in the Permanent Defence Force has increased from 244 at the end of 1997 to 545 at present.  This constitutes an increase of over 100% in the number of females serving over this period.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women in the Defence Forces (Army, Air Corps, Naval Service) including the Reserve Defence Force, and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army.  It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces. Recruitment into the Permanent Defence Force will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper as required to meet military needs. The Defence Forces continue to have a proactive approach to all aspects of recruiting.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">The Defence Forces manage recruit intakes to keep its annualised monthly average strength at or around 10,500.  The strength of the Defence Forces as at 31 December in the years 2003, 2004 and 2005 respectively was 10,498, 10,551 and 10,446.</p>
            <p eId="para_957">There is a planned total intake of 255 personnel (Cadets, Apprentices &amp; General Enlistment) before the end of 2006, with an expected outflow of 150 personnel in the same period.  Recruit intake will be finalised in December 2006 to ensure that the annualised monthly average strength is at or around 10,500.</p>
            <p eId="para_958">The White Paper on Defence provides for an allocation of up to 850 Permanent Defence Force personnel to be deployed overseas at any one time through the United Nations Standby Arrangements System (UNSAS).  While this may be exceeded for short periods, deployments above this level are not sustainable on an ongoing basis within existing resources.  Any commitments to EU or UN missions will be met within this context. There are no plans to increase the numbers serving in the Defence Forces above the levels provided for in the White Paper.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">There are currently 663 personnel deployed on overseas operations with a planned deployment of 158 personnel to UNIFIL at the end of October, 2006.  On deployment to UNIFIL the number of personnel deployed on overseas operations will be 821 which is within the 850 allocation for overseas deployments that is the maximum overseas capability of the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_960">Details of the sick leave levels experienced by the Army, Naval Service and Air Corps over the last twelve months are not readily available. The Military Authorities are compiling this information such detailed information will take some time to collate from individual records at unit level, and I will write to the Deputy with this information, as soon as it is available.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_1375">I propose to take Questions Nos. 35, 37 and 179 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1376">The United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) was established on 19 September, 2003, under United Nations Security Council Resolution 1509.  The resolution authorized the deployment, under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, for a period of twelve months, of up to 15,000 military personnel, to include up to 250 military observers, 875 civilian police officers and a civilian component.  UNMIL has a current strength (31 January 2006) of 15,037 military personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1377">Following Government and Dáil approval, a contingent of the Permanent Defence Force was deployed for service with UNMIL in December, 2003, comprising a motorized infantry battalion, of some 430 personnel.  A small number of additional personnel were also deployed at Force Headquarters and as Military Observers.  On 2 November 2004 and 6 December 2005 the Government reviewed and approved the continued participation of the Defence Forces in UNMIL.</p>
            <p eId="para_1378">The main Irish contingent operates as the Force Commander's Rapid Reaction Reserve. The role of the Irish personnel is the provision of an immediate response capability, deployable in sufficient strength and with the required level of force, to provide a swift and decisive military reaction to any crisis situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1379">Initially, the Irish Battalion in UNMIL mainly operated in a path-finding and reconnaissance role, supporting the deployment of other UN contingents.  It has also conducted long-range patrols beyond Monrovia and well into the interior of Liberia, showing a UN presence, deterring lawlessness and protecting local populations.  The contingent also undertakes regular daily patrols within the Monrovia area.  The Irish Battalion is available to the Force Commander to provide support and a rapid response capability in the event of a breakdown in law and order or further conflict.  Additionally, the Quick Reaction Force (QRF) conducted patrols to support Election Profiling efforts for the National Elections held on the 11th October and 8th November, 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_1380">On 11 November, 2005, the UN Security Council extended UNMIL's mandate to include the apprehension, detention and transfer to the Special Court for Sierra Leone of the former Liberian President, Charles Taylor, in the event of his return to Liberia. UNMIL assumed responsibility for the security of the Special Court for Sierra Leone from 1 December, 2005. At the request of the UN, Ireland and Sweden agreed to provide support in expanding the area of operations of the QRF to include Sierra Leone, in particular, the Special Court for Sierra Leone.  This allowed Irish and Swedish troops to be made available for extraction operations should there be a requirement to evacuate the staff and detainees of the Special Court of Sierra Leone in Freetown.</p>
            <p eId="para_1381">The QRF assisted in the transfer from Monrovia to the Special Court for Sierra Leone in Freetown of the former President, Charles Taylor, for trial in accordance with the requirements of the UN, following his arrest in Nigeria on 29 March 2006.  The QRF also assisted and provided security for the transfer of the former President from Sierra Leone to the court in the Hague where he will stand trial.</p>
            <p eId="para_1382">Ireland was due to complete its participation in UNMIL in November 2006. However, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, Kofi Annan, requested Ireland to consider postponing the withdrawal of its troops from UNMIL for a period of at least six months, in order to give the UN time to find a suitable replacement for the QRF capability. The Government following a detailed review of the request, was happy to be able to respond positively to the UN Secretary General and the Defence Forces will undertake one further 6 month rotation to May, 2007, whereupon the contingent will then be withdrawn.  Mission downsizing commenced in June 2006, following discussions with the UN.  The Swedish contingent, which partners Ireland in the QRF, will withdraw in November, 2006, and will be replaced by a Company from Pakistan, who will eventually assume the role of QRF on Ireland's withdrawal.</p>

            <p eId="para_1384">The Garda Síochána have the primary responsibility for law and order, including the protection of the internal security of the State.  Among the roles assigned to the Defence Forces is the provision of aid to the civil power (meaning in practice to assist, when requested, an Garda Síochána), which duties include the protection and guarding of vital installations, the provision of certain security escorts etc.</p>
            <p eId="para_1385">On occasion the Defence Forces are requested to provide assistance to the Garda Síochána when prisoners from Portlaoise are attending the Portlaoise Hospital.  This mission is achieved by means of mobile and foot patrols, providing a very visible and identifiable presence outside the hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_1386">The manner in which escorts are conducted and where guards are placed on hospitals at which prisoners from Portlaoise Prison are attending, has been under review for some time.  I am informed by the military authorities that the construction of a permanent guardroom at Portlaoise hospital is not considered a military requirement at this time.</p>

         asked the

         the number of personnel who have failed drug tests in the Defence Forces for the years 2004 and 2005; if all these personnel were discharged; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#WillieODea" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_364">
            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_1394">The military authorities advise that the number of personnel who tested "positive" under the Compulsory Random Drug Test programme in the Defence Forces in the years 2004 and 2005 was four and seven respectively. The four members who tested "positive" in 2004 were discharged and six of the seven who tested positive in 2005 have been discharged. The proposed discharge of one of the members who tested "positive" in 2005 is the subject of legal action therefore I cannot comment further on that case.</p>
            <p eId="para_1395">Drug abuse has long been recognised as a serious and escalating problem in our society and while there have been relatively few instances of drug related problems within the Defence Forces, it is recognised that the Defence Forces, as a component of the wider community, mirror the community at large. The implications of drug abuse in an organisation where personnel have access to firearms are too obvious to require elaboration.</p>
            <p eId="para_1396">A Compulsory Substance Testing Programme was introduced on 1 February 2002, as part of a Defence Forces Substance Abuse Programme, following a long consultative process involving the Office of the Attorney General, the Deputy Judge Advocate General and the Defence Forces Representative Associations.  Prior to the launch of the programme, an education programme and awareness briefings were conducted throughout the Defence Forces. All personnel were issued with a booklet devised to inform them of the purpose of the new Compulsory Random Drug Testing programme, the administrative procedures involved and the potential administrative action and liability for discharge or retirement for those who test positive. All necessary measures, including pre-enlistment screening, education, compulsory random drug testing, monitoring and sanctions, will be taken to maintain a drug free environment within the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_1397">The primary objective of Compulsory Random Drugs Testing is deterrence. In order to provide a credible level of deterrent, the testing programme has been devised to maximise the possibility of random selection for testing. A trained Drugs Testing Team is responsible for taking urine samples for compulsory random testing throughout the Defence Forces. Testing commenced on 14th November 2002 and the programme is now in its fourth year of operation. The target of testing 10% of the Permanent Defence Force each year has been achieved and it is anticipated that this target will also be reached in 2006. A member of the Permanent Defence Force, randomly selected, may be required, at any time, to provide a urine sample which will be tested for evidence of use of controlled drugs, or the abuse or misuse of other substances, or for the detection of the metabolites thereof. A member of the Permanent Defence Force who refuses to provide a urine sample, or who provides a urine sample which tests positive, shall be liable to retirement, discharge or relinquishment of commission or withdrawal of cadetship as appropriate under the provisions of Defence Force Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1398">All personnel have the option of having an independent test carried out on the "B sample" of any specimen obtained under the Compulsory Random Drug testing procedures. Where personnel have confirmed positive test results, they are liable to be discharged or retired in accordance with the relevant regulations. In such circumstances personnel are afforded a full opportunity to submit representations in relation to any recommendation that they be discharged or retired as a result of a confirmed positive test result.</p>

            <p eId="para_1470">The Government's recently published White Paper on Irish Aid provides for the establishment of a Volunteer Corps Unit within the Department of Foreign Affairs to harness the strong volunteer spirit, which exists across the country in support of overseas development activities. I am informed by my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern that his Department is to open an Irish Aid Volunteering Centre in Dublin in early 2007.  This centre will provide information, support and advice to those wishing to volunteer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1471">The White Paper on Irish Aid also provides for the creation of Ireland's own specific operational capabilities in responding to humanitarian emergencies: the Rapid Response Initiative (RRI).  The three main components of the initiative are the pre-positioning and transportation of material humanitarian supplies to disaster locations; the creation of a register of highly skilled and experienced individuals for deployment with international agencies at short notice; and an overall enhancement of our support to international humanitarian response agencies and mechanisms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1472">The Department of Foreign Affairs is working closely on this initiative with other Departments including my Department.  In this regard a number of meetings have been held between officials from Department and from the Department of Foreign Affairs over the last year.  These meetings have focused on assistance my Department/Defence Forces may be able to provide in relation to the development of the RRI with particular reference to the first two pillars and considerable progress has been made.</p>
            <p eId="para_1473">In relation specifically to the second element of this initiative — that is, the creation of a register of skilled and experienced individuals ready for rapid deployment — through working closely with my Department and others, the Department of Foreign Affairs believes that the initiative will enable the release of key skilled people to take part in emergency teams deployed to make rapid needs assessments and assist in the coordination of relief. It is hoped that Ireland can help bridge some of the gaps in certain key sectors in order to fill particular gaps in capacity in the international community's humanitarian response.</p>

         the level of resources available to the military archives; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1475">The military authorities advise that at present the staff strength of the Military Archives is three (3), comprising two (2) commissioned officers and one (1) Private.  The military authorities advise me that a strength of five (5), including suitably qualified replacements for two (2) officers who have retired and who previously also worked in the Archives, is sufficient to meet the current demands on the Military Archives. I appreciate the importance of returning to five (5) full-time equivalent staff in the military archives without delay.</p>
            <p eId="para_1476">The requirement for a more suitable home for the Military Archives has been recognised for some time. The primary focus has so far been on the National Museum of Ireland facility at the former Collins Barracks Dublin, long considered as the most appropriate location for the Military Archives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1477">Facilities are required to protect and safeguard the material currently stored and to provide for the deposition of future material, as well as permitting easy public access. An Inter Departmental Committee was established in early 2003 with terms of reference to examine and to advise on the best means of protecting and safeguarding the Military Archives by way of securing their removal from Cathal Brugha Barracks to new premises to be developed at the former Collins Barracks Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_1478">The Inter Departmental Committee focussed on feasibility studies based on a detailed examination of various locations around and within the Collins Barracks site. These studies were carried out up to early 2005 by a firm of architectural consultants engaged through the Office of Public Works.  The consultants identified potential locations within the Collins Barracks site. However, these feasibility studies also raised serious issues around the cost, planning and building/architectural protection considerations involved in meeting the demands of the Military Archives on the Collins Barracks site. The implications of the serious questions raised about the location of the full Military Archives on this site are being examined in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_1479">Particular challenges and difficulties in re-housing the Military Archives at Collins Barracks would be posed by the provision of extensive modern purpose-built facilities within the restrictions of an historic built environment. Consideration of some usage of the Collins Barracks site has not been exhausted. However, I have asked the Interdepartmental Committee to extend its search beyond Collins Barracks and to revert to me with options.  I have also requested that any scope for locating the Military Archives together with or alongside the National Archives continue to be explored in line with that body's own development plans.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
            <p eId="para_1485">At the outset, I wish to inform the Deputy that the allocation of Garda resources is a matter for the Garda Commissioner. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Officer to allocate personnel within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_1486">I have been informed by the Garda authorities that an Operational Order is currently in place to police the situation at the Corrib development site in Rossport, Co. Mayo. I am further informed that the purpose of the Garda action is to enable contractors and their workers to go about their lawful business unhindered and to allow people to demonstrate peacefully without impinging on the rights of others. A total of 114 Gardaí (all ranks) were moved on Temporary Transfer to Belmullet Garda Station on 2 October, 2006, with 45 Gardaí (all ranks) returning to their permanent Stations in the Dublin Metropolitan Region with effect from 5 October, 2006.  Local senior Garda management is continuing to monitor the situation and personnel requirements in the Rossport area are reviewed on an on-going basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1487">I have also been informed that an additional 5 Gardaí were allocated to the Mayorstone Park Garda Station on permanent transfer as policing requirements in the Moyross area of Limerick dictated the need for such permanent transfers.  Garda management state that the Moyross area of Limerick is regularly patrolled by uniform and plain-clothes units, supplemented by the Divisional Units, including the Traffic Corps and Mountain Bike Unit as well as District and Divisional Detective and Drug Units.</p>
            <p eId="para_1488">Garda management further state that during the recent outbreak of serious gun related incidents significant additional resources were deployed in the area, including additional armed patrols from within the Division, funded under Operation Anvil and supported by the Emergency Response Unit. Personnel from neighbouring Garda Divisions were allocated temporarily, to the Limerick Division and an initiative under Operation ‘Assist', utilising the Garda Mounted and Dog Units was also put in place in the Division, in conjunction with local policing operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1489">Garda management further state that additional resources have recently been added to the local Community Policing Unit specifically assigned to the Moyross Estates.  I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the areas referred to by the Deputy will be given the fullest consideration.</p>

On 26 July 2000 he was refused refugee status and did not appeal this decision.  He submitted an application for residency based on parentage of his Irish born child.  This application was refused on 14 December 2005.  His case is currently under consideration and a decision is expected shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1531">I have been informed by the Garda authorities, who are responsible for the detailed allocation of resources, including personnel, that the personnel strength (all ranks) of An Garda Síochána increased to a record 12,762 on Friday, 8 September, 2006, following the attestation of 249 new members. This compares with a total strength of 10,702 (all ranks) as at 30 June, 1997 and represents an increase of 2,060 (or 19%) in the personnel strength of the Force during that period. The Garda Budget now stands at €1.3 billion, a 13% increase on 2005 and an 85% increase since 1997 in real terms.</p>

            <p eId="para_1762">It is the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel to and within Divisions on a priority basis in accordance with the requirements of different areas.  These personnel allocations are determined by a number of factors including demographics, crime trends, administrative functions and other operational policing needs.  Garda management state that such allocations are continually monitored and reviewed along with overall policing arrangements and operational strategy.  This ensures that optimum use is made of Garda resources, and that the best possible service is provided to the public.</p>
            <p eId="para_1763">I should add that the current recruitment drive to increase the strength of the Garda Síochána to 14,000 members, in line with the commitment in the Agreed Programme for Government, is fully on target.  This will lead to a combined strength, of both attested Gardaí and recruits in training, of 14,000 by the end of this year.  The first three groups of newly attested Gardaí under this accelerated recruitment programme came on stream in March, June and September of this year and the fourth such group will become fully attested members of the Force later this year.  Further tranches of approximately 275 newly attested Gardaí will follow every 90 days thereafter until the programme is complete.  The Garda Commissioner will now be drawing up plans on how best to distribute and manage these additional resources, and in this context the needs of the Louth/ Meath Division will be given the fullest consideration.</p>

            <p eId="para_1772">I am pleased to be able to inform the Deputy that the Land Registry has responded successfully to the continued growth in applications arising from a very active property market.  Staffing levels are kept under ongoing review, having regard to overall Government policy on public service numbers, but significant productivity improvements have also been realised, reflecting the Registry's business modernisation programme as well as considerable investment by the Government in the provision of new technology for this service.   In the case of the vast majority of services provided by the Land Registry, no delays are encountered.  Looking to the future, a major programme of further investment is underway which will replace existing paper based maps with a digital mapping system and which will further enhance the organisation's capacity to respond to the considerable demands being made on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_1773">In so far as applications for first registration based upon adverse possession and applications under Section 49 are concerned, it should be noted that these are governed by a detailed and often complex area of land law and the circumstances of each case dictate the nature and the processing time of each individual application.  Such applications may, of necessity, take a long time to process.</p>
            <p eId="para_1774">As the Deputy may also be aware, I have recently signed an order establishing the Property Registration Authority which will come into effect from 4 November.

The new Authority will build on the modernisation programme already underway within the Land Registry, with a view to the further development of an efficient and high quality service for its customers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1802">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that as a general principle of taxation, as far as possible, income from all sources should be subject to taxation.  In line with this principle, social welfare pensions, the single farm payment and, in certain circumstances, REPS are reckonable as income for income tax purposes.  Treating these payments as income for income tax purposes is essentially a matter of equity.</p>
            <p eId="para_1803">Social welfare pensions are taxable under section 19 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which provides that tax under Schedule E shall be charged in respect of "every public office or employment of profit, and in respect of every annuity, pension or stipend payable out of the public revenue of the State".  Social welfare pensions liable to income tax include retirement, old age, widowed, invalidity and blind person's pensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1804">The extent, if any, to which taxation actually arises in a given case essentially depends on the level of income that a recipient has in an income tax year.  If there is no other income besides a social welfare pension, the basic personal credits in force can be expected in most cases to ensure that there is no tax to be paid on the social welfare income itself.  However in cases where an invalidity pension recipient has other taxable income such as single farm payment and REPS, a tax liability may arise.  The level of the tax liability will depend on the person's aggregate taxable income as is the position for other tax payers.</p>

            <p eId="para_1869">There are no statistics available in Ireland either on a national or county basis on the level of diagnosed autism.

            <p eId="para_1870">While some persons with autism, who also have an intellectual disability, are included on the National Intellectual Disability Database, it does not contain information on this group as a whole.  In addition while the database provides information in relation to the level of services being provided and current and future needs, it does not identify persons with specific disabilities such as autism or Down's syndrome. Its principal role is as a planning and monitoring instrument.</p>
            <p eId="para_1871">This issue is now being examined in the context of the overall information requirements set out in Section 13 of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005 which imposes significant requirements on the HSE to keep and maintain detailed records in relation to the Act.  Over the next twelve months as outlined in the Department's Sectoral Plan, published in July 2006, the HSE will be reviewing the existing information management systems within the disability and mental health services, to identify what additional resources and infrastructure would be required to meet the obligations under Section 13 of Part 2 of the Disability Act 2005.  It is intended that the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA), on establishment, will be requested to set standards in relation to the information and data requirements under the Disability Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1872">It would be difficult to attempt to correlate the incidence of autism with local variations in the uptake of MMR.  It is now widely accepted within scientific circles that there is no connection between autism and the MMR vaccine.</p>

            <p eId="para_1880">The provision of telecommunications services, including broadband, is a matter in the first instance for the private sector companies operating in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg), the independent regulator.</p>
            <p eId="para_1881">However, it has been clear for some time that the sector has failed to invest at the level necessary to keep pace with the demand for broadband.  My Department's regional broadband programme is addressing the infrastructure deficit by building high-speed open access broadband networks, in association with the local and regional authorities, in the major towns and cities.  These Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs) will allow the private sector to offer world-class broadband services at competitive costs.  The networks offer towns opportunities to attract inward investment in advanced technology and knowledge based enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_1882">Twenty-seven MANs have been completed under Phase One and are currently being managed by ENet, the Management Services Entity.  In planning the second phase of the MANs programme, a review of the availability of broadband in the regions identified a number of towns with populations greater than 1,500 that were not being offered a broadband option by the private sector.  Phase Two of the MANs Programme includes the towns of Clane, Kilcock, Kildare, Maynooth, Monasterevin, Newbridge, Rathangan, and Sallins in County Kildare.</p>
            <p eId="para_1883">A number of regional towns, including Athy, already had DSL broadband on offer from the service providers, so priority was given to the provision of essential broadband infrastructure in those towns where none existed.  Athy is not part of the current rollout but may be included in further phases subject to the necessary approvals and Exchequer funding being made available.  Kildare County Council has submitted a case for a MAN to be built in Athy and this is being kept under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_1887">The matter of post office closures and conversions is, in the first instance, a matter for the board and management of An Post.</p>
            <p eId="para_1888">I have been informed by the company that a total of sixteen post offices have been closed since January 2006 while the number converted to sub-post offices since that time is two.  I understand that the number of post offices that existed in January 2002 and that are still in existence now, totals 1,378.  In relation to the automation of post offices, I am informed that the number of non-automated post offices in the post office network stands at 381, which equates to 28% of the total number of post offices in the nationwide network.</p>
            <p eId="para_1889">The number of post office closures that have occurred since January 2002 throughout the network is detailed on the table.</p>

         asked the

         the number of schools here which do not have broadband Internet services; the number of primary and post-primary schools which do not have broadband; the percentage of primary and post-primary schools with broadband internet services on a county basis; the breakdown of the provision of broadband for schools in Dublin, Meath, Tipperary and Cork; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#NoelDempsey" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Marine_and_Natural_Resources" eId="spk_418">
            <from>Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources (Mr. N. Dempsey)</from>
            <p eId="para_1945">A joint industry/Government fund of €18 million was established for the Broadband for Schools Programme to resource the provision of high speed broadband connectivity to all primary and post primary schools in the country by end Autumn 2006, at no cost to the schools themselves. The initiative was established to address the resourcing of broadband access to schools in the shared belief that accelerated provision of broadband access to schools is a prerequisite to the establishment of a knowledge based economy and that such a development is socially, economically and commercially desirable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1946">To date 95% of all primary and secondary schools have broadband installed; the aim is to complete the outstanding schools in the coming weeks. Since 2 October, the total number of schools is 3,936, there are 3,759 schools that have had their local connectivity installed and of these 3,751 have had their router capability installed and tested. The number of schools that had confirmed their Acceptable Use Policy status and selected their content filtering option was 3,503. Consequently, 177 of the schools have not had local connectivity installed as yet.</p>
            <p eId="para_1947">I should also mention that a further 72 schools have had broadband access provided under the Hermes and Advanced Deployment programme and therefore have active broadband connections currently independent of the above mentioned National Broadband Network.</p>
            <p eId="para_1948">The percentage of primary and post-primary schools with broadband connectivity by county and the breakdown of the provision of broadband for schools in Dublin, Meath, Tipperary and Cork are set out in the following table for the Deputy's information.</p>
            <p eId="para_1949">This is a crucial strand in the strategy of integrating ICT into teaching and learning and the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources' wider vision of promoting the use of broadband technologies in local communities around the country.</p>

As regards my own area, Shannon Development also met with this group on 9 October and the Industrial Training agency FÁS is meeting with the company on 16 October. Shannon Development will assist the group in whatever way it can and is now awaiting further contact from the group.</p>

            <p eId="para_14882">I propose to take Questions Nos. 118 and 119 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_14883">The number of job losses in 2005 in Donegal, for IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland supported companies, totals 578, the majority of which were in the textile sector.   It should also be noted that 648 jobs were created in IDA and EI supported companies in 2005.  2006 figures are not yet available.</p>
            <p eId="para_14884">A breakdown of sectoral employment for 2005, for Enterprise Ireland and IDA supported companies located in Donegal is set out in the attached tabular statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_14885">The Deputy will also be aware that there have been significant job announcements in Donegal recently.</p>
            <p eId="para_14886">SITA INC (Information Networking Computing) announced on the 31st March 2005 that it plans to expand its software operation in Letterkenny, County Donegal, with the support of IDA Ireland, which will lead to the creation of 123 high quality software development jobs over a three year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_14887">Zeus Industrial Products Inc. announced, on the 22 September 2005, that it intends to set up a European Operations Centre in Letterkenny where it hopes to create 150 jobs over the next three years.</p>
            <p eId="para_14888">In March 2006, Abbott announced its intention to establish a manufacturing facility in Donegal Town which will create 155 jobs while AssetCo announced its intention to create 130 jobs in Lisfannon with the support of Enterprise Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_14889">Retraining of workers previously employed in traditional sectors such as clothing and textiles is a very important element in the strategy to address the relatively difficult employment situation in Donegal. FÁS will continue to play an active and very positive role in providing support to workers who have lost their jobs and require retraining to take up jobs in different sectors. Services offered by FÁS to workers losing their jobs and requiring retraining comprise the following elements. There will be liaison with Senior Management in the Company affected with regard to how the process will be conducted and information sessions for all affected workers if required.  The aim of these sessions is to outline the range of support and services available from FÁS and other public bodies.  FÁS Employment Services staff conduct full registration interviews with all workers.  These interviews help assess suitable career progression options for each redundant worker and identify their training and development needs. FÁS prepares a "Skills Analysis Report" detailing a composite of the skills of the workforce.  This is available to the development organisations such as IDA and  Enterprise Ireland on request. A Skills/Training Aspiration List is also compiled to inform FÁS of the required re-training and upskilling needs of the redundant workers.  This training is delivered by various means, and existing scheduled training programmes are delivered by our three training centres within the region, Letterkenny, Gweedore and Sligo, or in the case of a specialist training requirement, at any FÁS centre throughout the country.  Contracted training and community based training can also be availed of.  In the past, FÁS increased dramatically its range of Contracted Training Courses to meet the retraining needs of redundant workers. Special training needs not catered for by the existing FÁS suite of programmes can be facilitated through its Customised Training Fund, evenings/Saturday courses and e-learning options.  The provision of information, career guidance and advice is an ongoing element of the service to redundant workers.  Redundant workers are given initial and on-going information and support to keep them "in touch with the labour market".  They are advised of the "FÁS Jobs Ireland" database which allows job-seekers to register their CV and source jobs via the internet.  They are also informed of the FÁS Call Centre which provides a job matching facility for job-seekers and they are provided with information on the Cross-Border and Eures websites.</p>
            <p eId="para_14890">Redundant workers who do not succeed through the above interventions will be referred to FÁS once again via the National Employment Action Plan Strategy, on reaching the 6 month unemployment threshold.  They will then be assigned a FÁS officer and become a caseload client.  They will be interacted with on a regular basis to assist their re-entry to the workforce.</p>
            <p eId="para_14891">While most workers being made redundant would have availed of at least some of the services above, some 1,000 workers in Donegal availed of full retraining over the last 10 years.</p>

Subsequently, the participation limit for persons eligible for CE based on a Social Welfare disability linked payment was increased by 1 year.  These measures were introduced in recognition of the fact that older participants and participants with a disability may find it more difficult to progress into the open labour market.</p>

            <p eId="para_14946">The scheme runs for 29 weeks of the year.  Budget 2006 provided for an increase in the rate of fuel allowance of EUR 5.00 from EUR 9.00 to EUR 14.00 (EUR 17.90 in designated smokeless areas).</p>
            <p eId="para_14947">Eligibility to the fuel allowance scheme is subject to inter alia, a means test, which has been eased in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_14948">People who are in receipt of relevant means tested non-contributory payments do not have to undergo a further means test to qualify for a fuel allowance.

            <p eId="para_14949">In the case of contributory pensions which are not means tested, a person may have a combined household income of up to EUR 51 per week over and above the maximum rate of state pension (contributory) or savings/investments of up to EUR 46,000, and still qualify for fuel allowance.</p>

            <p eId="para_14952">A qualified adult allowance (QAA) is payable in respect of a spouse or partner who is wholly or mainly maintained by the claimant.</p>
            <p eId="para_14953">Account is taken of the spouse or partner's income for the purposes of determining entitlement. A spouse or partner's income includes income from capital, including retirement lump sum payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_14954">Where capital is in the joint names of the claimant and spouse or partner, half the capital is assessed against each.</p>
            <p eId="para_14955">Prior to Budget 2006, a qualified adult allowance at the maximum rate was payable where the spouse/partner's income was less than €88.89 per week and tapered reduced rates were payable where income was greater than €88.89, up to €220 per week.  A QAA was not payable where income exceeded €220 per week.  These limits were increased in the Budget to €100 and €250 respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_14956">When these improved arrangements are fully in place, and assuming that the spouse/partner has no other means, a full rate QAA will be payable where the spouse has capital of up to €57,000 while capital between €57,000 and up to €95,000 will give entitlement to a reduced rate of QAA.   This will mean that a pension or redundancy lump sum, lodged in joint names, would have to be in excess of €114,000 before it would affect entitlement to a full rate qualified adult allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_14957">I should also mention that if at any time the amount of capital held by the spouse or partner (either jointly or singly) is reduced, they can request my Department to reassess their entitlement to a QAA payment.</p>

            <p eId="para_14960">Financial contribution schemes are operated by local authorities in order to facilitate older people who wish to move from private accommodation, which may be too large for them, into local authority housing as tenants.  The issue for my Department is how the proceeds of such a sale are treated in the means test for social assistance payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_14961">Social assistance payments are designed to provide financial support for people who do not qualify for one of the contributory pension or benefit schemes. Entitlement to these payments is based on a means test which is intended to ensure that available resources are targeted at those who are most in need. Accordingly, any resources that a claimant and his or her spouse or partner may have are assessed. These resources may include cash income, property, or an asset which could bring in money or provide the claimant with an income.  The value of a person's primary residence is not taken into account in the means test.</p>
            <p eId="para_14962">The sale of residence provisions are designed to facilitate certain persons who are in receipt of a means tested payment from this Department in selling their principal residence for the purpose of: buying or renting alternative accommodation which s/he occupies as his/her only or main residence; or moving into a private nursing home which has been registered under Section 4, Health (Nursing Home) Acts, 1990; moving in with their carer who is in receipt of carer's allowance or carer's benefit in respect of them; or moving to sheltered or special housing in the voluntary, co-operative, statutory or private sectors that is funded under the Capital Assistance Scheme operated by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_14963">Where alternative accommodation is being purchased, the difference between the agreed sale price of the former residence and the agreed purchase price of the replacement residence, subject to a maximum of €190,461, is exempt from the means test.  Where no alternative accommodation is being purchased, the gross proceeds of the sale are defined as the agreed sale price of the residence and are disregarded in the means test also to a maximum of €190,461.</p>
            <p eId="para_14964">These provisions apply to people aged over age 66 years who receive a means tested payment from this Department as well as to people aged under 66 who are in receipt of disability allowance or blind person's pension.  The purpose of these provisions is to facilitate choice for certain people who might previously have been living alone or in unsuitable accommodation.   The disregard of €190,461 will continue to apply to the proceeds of the sale of the residence for the duration of the claim.</p>

            <p eId="para_14966">Family income supplement is designed to provide cash support for employees on low earnings with families.  FIS is paid on a weekly basis over a period of 52 weeks, taking into account a family's net earnings and the number of children under age 18 or aged between 18 and 22 years and in full time education.</p>
            <p eId="para_14967">Subject to a minimum weekly payment of €20, FIS is calculated at 60% of the difference between a person's net family income (i.e. gross pay less tax, PRSI, Health levies, Superannuation), and the income limit applicable to the family size.</p>
            <p eId="para_14968">The FIS thresholds are normally increased in each Budget to take account of the increases in the job-seekers assistance personal payment rate and in the associated increase for a qualified adult.  In Budget 2006, the approach was adjusted to take greater account of family size so that larger families received greater increases.</p>
            <p eId="para_14969">This has resulted in a more equitable arrangement, where the gap has been reduced between the average FIS weekly payment per child in different sized families.</p>

In this context it will greatly assist in the ongoing discussions with the Chinese authorities on the importation of Irish beef.

            <p eId="para_15034">Under the relevant EU Regulations, eligibility for the EU restructuring aid for the sugar industry is confined to three categories: processors, beet growers and certain specialized machinery contractors who worked for the growers. In accordance with the EU Regulations, the Government in July made certain decisions concerning implementation of the restructuring aid, in particular the percentage to be reserved for beet growers and machinery contractors.  These decisions were based on the recommendations of an independent expert, Indecon International Economic Consultants, following a rigorous consultation exercise with interested parties. The independent expert acknowledged that other groups apart from the three eligible categories might be affected directly or indirectly by the closing of the sugar industry, including hauliers and other suppliers of goods and services, but also recognised that they are not eligible for aid under the EU Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_15035">The Government decisions are now the subject of Judicial Review proceedings instituted by Greencore Group plc in the High Court. Under the EU Regulations, the first instalment of the aid would fall to be paid in June 2007. An announcement about the application procedure will be made in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_15041">My Department holds REPS planning agency training courses when there are a sufficient number of applicants to justify holding a course. My Department held 4 REPS planning agency training courses in the past 5 years, 2 in 2001, 1 in 2002 and 1 in 2004. A further 2 courses are scheduled for next week.  Some 51 individuals have been approved as REPS planning agencies in the past five years. Their locations are set out in the table.</p>

            <p eId="para_15081">There are no regulations in place that prevent cattle being exported through the ports referred to or indeed through other locations that have adequate facilities. My Department's function in relation to the transport of livestock by sea is to approve vessels based on statutory requirements regarding the protection of animal welfare. The actual provision of services for the transport of livestock by sea is a matter for the service providers operating on the routes.</p>
            <p eId="para_15082">Any ferry operator intending to transport livestock from the State to another Member State, or to a Third Country, must have the vessel inspected and approved by my Department. Approval for the carriage of livestock on roll on roll off vessels is considered on a case-by-case basis, having regard to the characteristics of the individual vessel, whereas there are specific statutory requirements which apply across the board where dedicated livestock vessels are concerned. My Department works closely with companies that seek approval for the transport of livestock to ensure that the conditions aboard such vessels are consistent with national and E.U. animal welfare requirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_15108">Under the terms of the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Post Leaving Certificate Courses 2006, grants are available to eligible candidates who are entering approved PLC courses for the first time in the 2006/2007 academic year.

However, notwithstanding this condition candidates who already hold a FETAC Level 5 qualification (formerly known as a FETAC (NCVA) Level 2 qualification) and are now pursuing a course that offers progression may be deemed eligible for grant aid.</p>

            <p eId="para_15112">My Department has not issued any guidelines to schools in relation to the location of mobile phone masts. The erection of such masts are subject to normal planning regulations which are administered by the relevant Local Authority. I am aware that the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government issued guidelines on Telecommunications Antennae and Support Structures to Planning Authorities in 1996 and that these guidelines are still in place. In addition, in 2005 the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources issued a report titled "Report on non-ionising radiation from mobile phone handsets and masts". On foot of the recommendations of that report the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources established an inter-departmental committee to examine the health effects, if any, of non-ionising radiation. The work of that committee is currently underway — the committee is expected to report to Government before the end of this year.</p>

            <p eId="para_15114">There has been substantial progress made in the funding of our schools since  2003, the financial year indicated in the OECD Report referred to by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_15115">Spending by my Department on second level education increased by 17% between 2003 and 2005. In 2005, €2.7 billion was spent on second-level education – up from €2.3 billion in 2003 and €1.25 billion in 1997.  These increases have allowed for major progress to be made both in the staffing and in the day-to-day funding of our schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_15116">With regard to staffing, it should be noted that there is now one teacher for every 13 students at second level.</p>
            <p eId="para_15117">Day to day funding for our schools has also increased significantly in recent years. Since the financial year referred to in the OECD report — 2003 — second-level schools have benefited from substantial increases in funding. The standard capitation grant of €266 per pupil in 2003 now stands at €298 per pupil from 1 January last. In addition, the support services grant for secondary schools has been increased from €127 per pupil in 2003 to €159 per pupil from January last. This per capita grant is in addition to a range of equalisation grants of up to some €15,500 per school per annum that were also approved for voluntary secondary schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_15118">These significant increases in the funding and staffing of schools are a clear demonstration of my commitment to prioritise available resources to address the needs of schools.</p>

Projects undertaken by schools without the approval or agreement of the Department will not be funded as, to do so, would reward queue jumping and undermine the openness and transparency of the system, which is the essential point of publishing the School Building Programme.  It also would be impossible to manage the capital budget if there was no central prioritisation and allocation system in place.</p>

            <p eId="para_15368">As the Deputy will be aware, Section 17 of the Grangegorman Development Agency Act 2005 specifies that the residents of the Grangegorman neighbourhood are entitled to nominate one person to be a member of the Agency following an election process to be conducted by the Chairperson. This election has taken place and a resident has been nominated for appointment to the Agency.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryHanafin" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_457">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_15372">The Deputy will be aware that my Department is engaged in the roll-out of broadband internet connectivity to all recognised primary and post-primary schools.  This project is being undertaken in partnership with industry in the context of a Government — IBEC/TIF (Telecommunications and Internet Federation) Agreement to provide local broadband connectivity to schools.  The broadband connectivity is being provided via a Schools National Broadband Network supported by HEAnet, which will provide managed Internet access, email, security controls, content filtering and other services designed to enhance the educational process.  A Broadband Support Service Desk has also been established to assist schools with advice and information relating to the roll-out and ongoing use of their broadband connectivity within the schools network.  The total cost of the project for the three year period will be in the region of €30m.</p>
            <p eId="para_15373">Following a public tendering process, contracts were finalised in 2005 with six Service Providers for the provision of local access connectivity to 3,925 schools and with a further Provider for the installation of a broadband router at school level where appropriate.  The count of the number of schools countenanced under this arrangement has since been amended to take into account the effect of a number of school closures, amalgamations and new opening and stands currently at 3,936.</p>
            <p eId="para_15374">Roll out of the local connectivity and router installation commenced in June 2005.  The installation process has two stages starting with the local broadband connectivity installation (involving DSL, satellite or wireless technology) followed by the installation of a high-speed router and circuit and acceptance testing.  A school then must confirm that it has an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) in place and it must indicate which content filtering option it requires prior to the activation of the school's connectivity via the Schools National Broadband Network.</p>
            <p eId="para_15375">As of 2nd October, 3,759 schools have had their local connectivity installed and of these 3,751 have had their router capability installed and tested.  The number of schools that had confirmed their AUP status and selected their content filtering option was 3,503.  Of the remaining 177 schools, some 23 schools have refused the service offered under the arrangements,  44 installations have been deferred due to school building programmes, 35 schools are in the process of being re-awarded (or awarded in the case of new schools) and a further 75 school installations are being addressed at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_15376">It should be noted that a number of the schools that have not been connected under the Schools Broadband Access Programme will have their own independent broadband connnectivity.</p>
            <p eId="para_15377">I should also mention that a further 72 schools have had broadband access provided under the Hermes and Advanced Deployment programmes and therefore currently have active broadband connections independent of the above mentioned National Broadband Network.  The percentage of primary and post-primary schools with broadband connectivity by county (based on the Schools Broadband Access Programme installations and the Hermes and Advanced Deployment programmes) and the breakdown of the provision of broadband for schools in Dublin, Meath, Tipperary and Cork is illustrated in the table for the Deputy's information.</p>

        <b>Ms C. Murphy</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         the number of students enrolled in Kildare schools for the academic year 2006 to 2007 whose class size is between 28 to 30 students; the number whose class size is between 31 to 33 students; the number whose class size is at or above 34; if her Department has identified the schools where pupil teacher ratios are substantially above the average: the strategies which have been devised for each of these schools in order to counteract this serious problem; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Ms Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_23005">The information requested by the Deputy is provided in the annual census of primary schools.  The reference date for the provision by schools of this information is the 30th September of the school year in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_23006">As the details for the current school year have not been collated as of yet, I am not in a position to provide the information to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_23007">As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary in recent years.  At the beginning of the current school year there are no less than 4000 extra teachers in our primary schools, compared with 2002.  The average class size in our primary schools is 24 and there is now one teacher for 17 pupils at primary level.</p>
            <p eId="para_23008">Children with special needs and those from disadvantaged areas are getting more support than ever before to help them to make the most of their time at school.</p>
            <p eId="para_23009">Indeed, with the thousands of extra primary teachers hired by this Government, recent years have seen the largest expansion in teacher numbers since the expansion of free education.  Over the next two school years even more teachers will be put in place both for the above priority areas of disadvantage and special education and also under a reduction in the mainstream staffing schedule.</p>
            <p eId="para_23010">As you know all primary schools are staffed on a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children.  Of course, schools with only one or two teachers have much lower staffing ratios than that — with two teachers for just 12 pupils in some cases and so on — but the general rule is that there is at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children in the school.  In the 2007/2008 school year, this is being reduced to 27 children per classroom teacher.</p>
            <p eId="para_23011">A further initiative that has been of direct benefit to primary schools has been the change in the criteria for developing schools.  For the current school year the threshold for getting a developing school post was reduced specifically to help schools that are seeing large increases in enrolments each year, as is the case in Kildare.  170 such posts were sanctioned in the 2005/06 school year, compared to 105 in 2004/05.</p>
            <p eId="para_23012">This Government has shown a clear determination to improve the staffing in our schools and we will continue to prioritise this issue going forward.</p>

            <p eId="para_23014">The school to which the Deputy refers commenced operation in September 2002, with provisional recognition from the Department on the basis that it would be providing multi-denominational education in the Clontarf/Marino/Fairview area of Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_23015">It is a condition of recognition that the Patron must provide suitable accommodation in the stated area which must be capable of meeting the growing needs of the school.  Accommodation remains the Patron's responsibility until the Department is in a position to provide permanent accommodation, assuming the school achieves permanent recognition.</p>
            <p eId="para_23016">In this case, the promoters were unable to find suitable accommodation in the area that it had intended to serve.  Instead, it set itself up, as a temporary measure, in a vacated school building in Dublin 9, an area already providing multi-denominational education by two other schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_23017">Four main areas are examined in determining permanent recognition.  These are whether or not:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_23018">1. The school is operating under the Rules for National Schools.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_23019">2.	 The school has determined viability in terms of enrolment.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_23020">3. The school's accommodation is deemed suitable to meet its needs for the short/medium term or until the Department is in a position to provide permanent accommodation.</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_23021">4. The school is meeting a need which is not already being met by existing schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_23022">While the Department accepts that the school in question has satisfied the first two criterion, it is not satisfied that it has met the third and fourth, although the fourth is the overriding issue, given that the area concerned is already served by 2 multi-denominational schools — both of which have permanent recognition and one of which is based in permanent accommodation.  Normally, ahead of making new provision of a similar type in an area, the Department, a matter of policy, seeks to maximise existing provision to reduce the burden on the State of resourcing a proliferation of small schools.  In the context of the extent of multi-denominational provision in the area concerned, it is incumbent on the Department to strategically examine this provision to determine long term requirements and how these should best be addressed.  The Department is carrying out this assessment which will be completed as quickly as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_23023">The school was visited by a school inspector in 2003 and 2005.  As already stated, the sourcing of permanent accommodation does not arise until a school receives permanent recognition.</p>

            <p eId="para_23029">For the purposes of determining grant eligibility under my Department's Maintenance Grants Schemes, all investments must be declared, including deposit accounts, savings certificates, life assurance bonds and other financial instruments where the interest/profit is accumulated and paid out as a lump sum at the end of the investment period.</p>
            <p eId="para_23030">The amount of income to be included in respect of Special Savings Incentive Accounts (SSIAs) as set out in the notes booklet which accompanies the student grant application form, is the government grant earned on the savings in the relevant tax year plus in the case of savings accounts, the gross interest earned in the relevant tax year, and in the case of investment accounts, the investment profit earned in the relevant tax year.  Investment losses sustained in the relevant tax year are deductible.</p>
            <p eId="para_23031">Where income is paid out annually, as happens with a bank deposit account, the amount so paid is required to be included in reckonable income.  Where income is not paid out annually but is "rolled-up" and paid out with the original investment at the end of a defined term, the annual amount required to be included in reckonable income is the "rolled-up" income divided by the number of years in the term of the investment.  This procedure has been in place for the past ten years.</p>
            <p eId="para_23032">Given its similarity with "roll-up" savings products it was deemed appropriate to include, as reckonable income, income from SSIAs on an annual basis.

            <p eId="para_23035">The White Paper on Defence outlines the blue print for a new Reserve Defence Force.  An Implementation Plan has been developed that will ensure the realisation of the White Paper vision and this will be rolled out over the period to end 2009.  The new Reserve will have a clearly defined role, an enhanced relationship with the PDF, better equipment and training and opportunities to serve on overseas peace support missions.</p>
            <p eId="para_23036">The Reserve has already seen significant improvements in terms of clothing, equipment, training and resourcing. It is now organised along similar lines to the PDF and the introduction of the integrated element of the Reserve is currently being addressed.  All of these changes will enhance the capabilities of the Reserve as well as improving interoperability with the PDF.  These factors are significant enablers in facilitating any future participation by Reserve personnel in overseas missions.</p>
            <p eId="para_23037">While there are no immediate plans for participation by members of the Reserve in overseas missions, policies to support the selection of suitably qualified personnel for overseas duties will be developed over the lifetime of the Implementation Plan i.e. over the period to end 2009.  In other countries, service by Reservists on overseas peace support missions is quite common, although as specified in the Plan, any such participation by members of the Reserve is likely to be in specialised areas such as medical, transport, engineering and communications and information services.  This will also be subject to personnel having suitable qualifications, their personal availability and appropriate advance training.</p>
            <p eId="para_23038">Development of policies to support the selection of suitably qualified Reserve personnel for overseas duties will include consideration of the impact of overseas duties on the employment of Reserve personnel.

            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_23041">I propose to take Questions Nos. 169 and 170 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_23042">At the outset, I should explain that the Office of the Paymaster General, Department of Finance, is responsible, upon the receipt from my Department of the pension rate in each particular case, for the payment of pensions to retired employees, including retired civilian employees. Every effort is made to ensure that pension rates for pensioners are updated on a timely basis to take account of any pay increases that might be paid from time to time to serving employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_23043">In general, any pension increases due to retired employees as a result of the application of any national pay awards are paid as soon as possible following the payment of increases to serving employees. However, from time to time, delays may occur if, for whatever reason, the rates of pension payable to individual pensioners have to be revised for reasons other than the application of national pay awards.</p>
            <p eId="para_23044">The Deputy will be aware from my reply to a PQ she tabled on 27 September last that my Department is currently engaged in a review of the rates of pension payable to all the retired civilian employees of my Department. As my Department has in excess of 1,200 civilian pensioners, the Deputy will appreciate the scale of the task involved. I am pleased to inform the Deputy that the rates of pension paid to a majority of the pensioners involved have now been reviewed and the revised rates have been forwarded to the Paymaster-General's Office for payment.  In many cases, the review has resulted in increased levels of pensions for the pensioners concerned. I understand from the Paymaster General's Office, that it is anticipated that any pension increases due to retired civilian employees arising from the pay awards set out in the Sustaining Progress Agreement will be implemented by 1 December 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_23045">The implementation date of the first phase of the pay increases set out in the new Social Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016, is 1 December 2006. The application of the pay increases across the range of employments in the State industrial sector, including civilian employees with the Defence Forces, requires the approval of the relevant Performance Verification Group (PVG) for that sector. The pensions of former civilian employees with the Defence Forces will be adjusted, as appropriate in the normal way, when the PVG has decided that payment of the 1 December 2006 pay increases is warranted.</p>
            <p eId="para_23046">In relation to the Deputy's query regarding the amount paid out in interest by my Department in relation to the late payment of pension increases, I have made enquiries with the Paymaster General's Office (the body responsible for the payment of pensions) concerning this matter. I understand that no interest payments have been made to date.</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_471">
            <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_23179">I had a number of discussions with the Irish Bankers Federation (IBF) in relation to this matter last year, with a view to increasing the level of contribution by the Banks in respect of the costs incurred by the Department in the provision of Cash Escorts.  Following detailed and intensive discussions between officials of the IBF, the member Banks and the Department, a detailed formal agreement was signed on 11 May, 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_23180">This agreement, which is for a 5 year period, provides that the banks will pay the total actual costs incurred by the Defence Forces in the provision of cash escorts.  Costs in respect of each 12 month period to end-December, will be paid the following year on or before the 1st June.  This is to allow for the compilation of returns from the brigades and allocation of costs following the year-end.   The first payment under the new system was paid on 1 June 2006.  I agreed, at the bank's request, to defer the first payment to that date to meet the banks budgeting and accounting timeframe.</p>
            <p eId="para_23181">In return for my agreement to this deferral, a transitional payment of €1 million, payable before the end of 2005, was negotiated as part of the overall agreement.  Therefore in 2005 the banks made their annual payment of €2.86m plus the additional €1m making a total contribution of €3.86m. A figure of €6.03 million was paid in 2006. The amount to be paid in 2007 (costs for 2006) will not be available until early 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_23182">Prior to this initiative it had been the case that an annual contribution of €2.86m was being paid by the banks to my Department in respect of the provision of cash escorts since 1995.  This figure was set by the Department of Finance in the 1995 budget and had not been altered since. The contribution from the Banks was designed to part-cover the total costs to the State of providing cash escorts. At that time, the contribution covered approximately 72% of the total cost arising to the Defence Forces.  Based on annual costings by the Department, the relative level of the contribution had fallen in real terms over the years to the situation where it was only covering 43% of the total costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_23183">The total cost in respect of the provision by the Defence Forces of assistance to the Garda Síochána in protecting movements of cash for the years 2001 to 2005 was as shown in the table.</p>

            <p eId="para_23218">These targeted measures, in particular, assist low income purchasers. They represent a better means of improving the affordability of house purchase and a more effective deployment of resources, than a general first time buyer grant which would over time become absorbed into the house price.

            <p eId="para_23219">There is strong activity at present by first time buyers in the market.  It is estimated that 45% of new house loans in 2005 were taken out by first time buyers.  In addition, the average age of Irish first time buyers in 2005 was 30.  Over half of these purchasers were aged 29 or under. This compares with a corresponding average age in the United Kingdom of 34.</p>
