          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_17">In the inserted section 15(1)(<i>b</i>), to delete “person” and substitute “person,”.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">This section deals with the updating of penalties for possession of firearms with intent to endanger life. The issues we are discussing apply to a number of the earlier updated penalties in relation to other aspects to do with firearms. I am in favour of increasing penalties for possession of firearms with intent to endanger life and otherwise. However, I question whether the proposed penalties should be minimum or mandatory on the basis that, given the exceptional and specific circumstances specified in subsection (5), such penalties can and very often do end up neither minimum nor mandatory.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">I have had an opportunity to study the note the Minister circulated since our last discussion. Amendment No. 11 to the amendment relates to what I will refer to as the get-out clause contained in subsection (5) and proposes that it should not apply where a person has been convicted of a second or subsequent offence under this section. I have listened to the Minister's comments on the need for such a clause. I can envisage a situation where, on conviction for a first offence, a person could make a reasonable case for not being subjected to the mandatory minimum penalty and where a judge would feel such was inappropriate. I wonder what is the record to date in that regard. Under the Drugs Act, it was considered appropriate to apply the clause in only 4% or 5% of cases. As the Minister mentioned, it is now used in approximately 20% of cases. Taking that record into account, we should provide that on conviction for a second offence the get-out clause should not apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">In his circulated notes the Minister refers to the constitutional imperative that judges have discretion to consider not only the offence but also the individual's circumstances. He has stated that the effect of my amendment would be to remove such discretion from the courts in circumstances where a person is found guilty of a second or subsequent offence under the section. He has also said that, given the constitutional requirement that the Judiciary not be tied to carry out an action which is manifestly unjust, he does not consider the amendment appropriate. I would like to put forward the following point for serious consideration. Is there a constitutional imperative to provide for judicial discretion? I do not believe that is the case. We have in place provisions relating to a number of offences to which judicial discretion does not apply, including murder. In a case where a person is convicted of murder, the judge has no choice other than to impose a life sentence. One might say there are many options open to the parole board and Minister at a later stage but the sentence to be handed down in such cases is life imprisonment.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">Under section 49 of the Road Traffic Act, a person convicted of drink driving is subject to a mandatory penalty of disqualification from driving, something which can have very serious consequences. There is no judicial discretion where a person is convicted for driving while over a certain limit. We are not required to legislate for judicial discretion. If there is not a constitutional imperative to legislate for judicial discretion, surely we are not being fair and just to anybody involved in one serious offence. The same applies in regard to a number of other sections. Surely we would be adopting a fair, reasonable and just approach which is constitutionally sound if in regard to the very serious charge of possession of firearms with intent to endanger life we were to provide that there be judicial discretion in the form of a get-out clause where a person is convicted of a first offence but that the Legislature may decide if the offence so warrants that the clause should not be applied in the case of a second offence. That is my case. I will not labour the point further.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">I am not a constitutional expert, although I have studied the Constitution from many angles during the years as a politician, lawyer and the first Chairman of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. Such a provision would be constitutionally sound and send a clear message from the Oireachtas. I, therefore, ask the Minister to give due consideration to amendment No. 11 to the amendment. All of the other amendments in my name to the amendment are of a technical nature and I put them forward for consideration by the Minister and Parliamentary Counsel.</p>

          <p eId="para_24">I would like to deal with a number of related issues. I am sympathetic to the intent encompassed by the amendment as proposed by Deputy O'Keeffe and I am pleased the Minister is addressing it. Subsections (3) and (6) of amendment No. 118 provide that the court, in imposing sentence on a person for an offence under this section, "may, in particular," have regard to certain circumstances. Would a possible way of addressing this matter be to substitute "shall" for "may"? Subsection (6)(<i>a</i>) deals with a person who has a previous conviction for an offence under the Firearms Act. It is important that we provide that it be mandatory for the courts to have regard to certain circumstances. This would go some way towards capturing the point made by Deputy O’Keeffe who put the case more succinctly and seeks to address the matter on two levels by also providing for a significant mandatory penalty clause. I support his amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">An issue we discussed on the last occasion and which I am putting back on the agenda is that rightly instanced by the Minister on that occasion, namely, the existence of a person with a reservoir of important information in uncovering more serious crimes and bringing to book more serious criminals. I would not like us to reach a situation where such an avenue would be entirely closed off and there would be no material benefit to an individual accused of having blown the whistle on another. Whether such a person sings like a canary or watches a spot on the wall, the consequences are the same. We must provide for flexibility to ensure there is leverage for the Garda in cross-examination and ultimately the courts in sentencing.</p>

Having listened to the Minister's comments on amendment No. 11 to the amendment, I am heartened that he is minded to accept it on Report Stage, subject to further consultation with the Attorney General. For this reason, I propose not to move the amendment and instead resubmit it on Report Stage.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_28">On the subject of amendment No. 11 to the amendment, we need to be careful in this regard because Deputy O'Keeffe's proposal to apply mandatory sentences to those who commit second or subsequent offences would apply to persons convicted of a second offence while serving a sentence. We should provide that the second strike rule would apply only if a person is convicted of a further offence following release from prison. For many years in the North those who reoffended after release served the outstanding part of their previous sentence before the sentence for the second offence commenced. While I have not done an analysis to determine the effectiveness of this approach or its implications for the State, other mechanisms are available to ensure the punishment for a second offence is greater than for a first offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">On my amendments to the amendment, the Minister correctly summarised their effect. Amendment No. 6 to the amendment proposes the deletion of subsection (4) of the new section proposed by the Minister in amendment No. 118 and would, if accepted, remove the mandatory minimum sentence provisions. As the Minister indicated, the minimum sentence is not mandatory in all circumstances because a degree of judicial discretion is provided for when deciding whether to impose a minimum sentence.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">I agree the courts and society must take a strong view on drugs and firearms offences, the two areas in which the Minister proposes to introduce mandatory minimum sentences. While I accept his proposal does not eliminate judicial discretion, it severely circumscribes the sentencing powers of the Judiciary. For this reason, I have no problem with increasing the maximum sentences available for these offences. We must, however, exercise care when legislating for changes in sentencing policy. This requires that we first examine whether the introduction of mandatory sentences in other jurisdictions had the desired effect. Members would favour the introduction of mandatory sentences if they were certain such measures would have the desired effect but the evidence from other jurisdictions suggests otherwise. In the United States, in particular, gun crime and the prison population have continuously increased since the introduction of mandatory sentences. This approach did not discourage the possession and use of illegal firearms or reduce the number of deaths caused by firearms.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">How do we address this problem? My preference is that judges, in deciding on these cases, will continue to have discretion to take account of all the circumstances of the case, while also having discretion to impose a maximum sentence, which the Bill increases for some offences. Amendment No. 10 to the amendment would balance the increase in maximum sentences by providing that the judge must take various factors into account, namely, "the circumstances in which the offence occurred including any aggravating and mitigating factors, extent of violent behaviour, character, age, previous criminal record, family circumstances, expressions of remorse, whether alternatives to custody would be a more appropriate sentence or part thereof and the imperative to protect the public from harm".</p>
          <p eId="para_32">Deputies could cite cases in which the offender deserved a second chance. The proposal in subsection (4) of the Minister's amendment would condemn anybody involved in gun crime to a mandatory sentence, with all the implications such a decision would have for the sentenced offender. Having been placed in prison, those who are not members of a gang will join one and probably use drugs if they have not done so previously. Moreover, they will be educated further in the ways of the underworld, particularly if another of the Minister's proposals is accepted, namely, the provision to remove the possibility of pre-release or temporary release for persons serving sentences under this section.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">Most decisions to give prisoners temporary release or commute parts of their sentence are taken following consideration of the prisoner's circumstances. For instance, an offender may have tried to make amends for his or her crimes while in jail or the authorities may wish to encourage him or her to avail of training to ensure a degree of stability in his or her family life on release to prevent families being punished. The prospect of early or temporary release is an incentive to prisoners to behave while in prison, learn from their experiences and benefit themselves and society. The purpose of prison, in addition to punishment, is to try to significantly diminish or eliminate the likelihood of reoffending. Training is offered to prisoners, both inside and outside the prison service to ensure a degree of stability when they emerge from jail. The introduction of mandatory sentences, by removing the possibility of prisoners being given temporary release to attend courses or funerals or become more involved in the life of their children as they grow up, also removes an important incentive.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">Under the Constitution, judges are responsible for the administration of justice, including the determination of punishment. We should refrain from restricting a judge's ability to determine this based on circumstances. As legislators, we set the parameters within which the Judiciary should work. We should not be overly prescriptive. If we go down this road, we could have minimum sentences for every crime, of which I am not in favour. I favour a maximum sentence, allowing the Judiciary to take into account the circumstances of a case and suspend part or all of a sentence. If one is in breach of the terms of the suspension, one should serve the complete sentence, if needs be. This allows the judge discretion.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">Mandatory sentences are popular. In the past, with regard to drugs offences, I called on the Judiciary to implement such sentences. One is seen to be hard on drug barons and mules but while they may be popular, these measures are not effective in most jurisdictions. Perhaps we should have examined their effect in more detail before we reached this stage. There are alternatives which we should consider.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_11" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_36">I am grateful to the Deputies for their observations, running across the spectrum from Deputy Ó Snodaigh to Deputy O'Keeffe. I accept that each view is held in good faith and intellectually respectable.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">It is not sensationalist to state firearms are more readily available than ever before. They are being used in a vicious manner on a scale the people have not seen before, although every firearms death is vicious and in the days of the Troubles firearms were used in an awful way. Most find it hard to grasp the existence of a new class in their twenties who watch violent videos all day, some of which I have seen. Knocking off an opponent is seen in a morally neutral way and there is a voyeuristic, pornographic interest in the casual nature in which characters who get in their way are killed. I do not know if the people concerned spend their days snorting cocaine while watching such videos. The viciousness with which they kill those who are seen as obstacles to their activities is difficult to comprehend. One wonders if the people concerned see themselves as rich magnates living off their ill-gotten gains in sunny climes in their 40s. Do they think beyond next week? Do they consider the moral implications of what they do or is there any moral dimension to their character? No one can sleep easy after engaging in such depraved behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">The public wants us to take a strong stance against the use of firearms. It wants it to be made clear to everyone in the criminal justice process, including gardaí, the Judiciary, politicians, offenders and other members of the public, that if Ireland allows the taking of life to become commonplace, it will be very difficult to undo the damage caused to our social fabric. We live in a republican democracy and there is nothing wrong with Ministers or Members of the Oireachtas publicly stating the substance of public opinion. The Judiciary can disregard what politicians say if they do not agree with it but sentencing policy must take into account public opinion as well as other factors.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">I must steer a line between micro-managing the outcome of criminal cases which is not a function of the Executive or the Legislature and setting a legal framework in which maximum sentences have not appeared to work in the past. When the mandatory minimum sentence for drug offences was introduced, it was imposed in 5% of cases. That this figure has increased to 20% is not a coincidence. The public dissatisfaction, as expressed by public representatives, has a part to play in this. I do not wish to have sentencing policy determined by public clamour, competitive anger or the media. Editors have claimed that they are more in touch with public opinion than public representatives, suggesting the purchase of newspapers gives a mandate to pursue a particular editorial line. I doubt that proposition but in a republican democracy one can state every Member of Dáil Éireann has been elected to exercise a particular function and has a mandate for a particular term of office.</p>
          <p eId="para_40">Given the connection between drugs and firearms, it is reasonable to link the sentencing policy for each crime. It would be strange if mandatory minimum sentences applied to possession of substantial quantities of drugs but no such advice was given to the Judiciary through a sentencing policy laid down in statute in respect of the use of firearms which are so closely connected to the drugs phenomenon in modern society. There is a sort of a symmetry in that regard. Deputy Ó Snodaigh suggested that we examine American data to see whether such policies are effective. However, I do not believe that any state in America takes such a sensitive approach to the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">That is the first matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_43">Even regarding felonies, the "three strikes and you are out" system is crude. Three instances of shoplifting can constitute three felonies, meaning that the perpetrator is put away for life in some penitentiary. We are not engaging in that sort of thing. I say to Deputy Ó Snodaigh that considering American data may not be a very good way to examine the effectiveness of sentencing policies laid down in statute. We are not following the American line by telling a judge that there is no issue if it is a person's third felony offence and that he or she must simply go to jail for life.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">I am obliged to obey and uphold the Constitution. If I thought that there was no constitutional dimension to this, I would further tighten the loophole and, possibly, judges' discretion. However, I must be conscious of the fact that an Article 26 reference on such a provision or a challenge at a later stage is not improbable. I do not wish the entire section, or the entire Bill, to be knocked on the head as a result of excessive zeal that crosses a line on my part. That is why I must carefully heed the Attorney General's advice on each step. Regarding Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment, for example, while expressing personal appetite for its principles, I must urge caution and consult the Attorney General to benefit from his considered view of whether it is a permissible provision and whether its enactment would be safe. I cannot adopt a constitutionally unsafe proposition, even if it involved a 50-50 issue. If the Attorney General counsels not to proceed, I cannot do so. That is how the system works.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">We are taking a step in the right direction. What causes me concern is whether the minimums for which we are providing are too low. It might be argued that they are not exactly dissuasive and cannot have much deterrent effect. In many cases, they may not be regarded as very stern. In these provisions, however, we are trying to bring about change. These are not merely political window-dressing and if those minimum sentences are in place and adhered to, subject to constitutional requirements, the general public, the Judiciary and the criminal justice system will benefit from their enunciation in law.</p>
          <p eId="para_46">I sympathise with the position of judges. They are asked in our system to judge the fate of other citizens on an individual basis. They make life-changing decisions on behalf of others, listen to pleas in mitigation, examine the person whom they are about to jail and their job is clearly difficult. It is not gross interference with their function for the Legislature to clarify what was intended by a criminal justice statute and what it believes should be the norm regarding those convicted of specific offences. It must at least be some consolation to them to ask whether one is wrong and whether it should be two or 12 years. It is at least of some use to them to see that the Legislature has set seven years as the minimum before they examine aggravating circumstances and the question of exceptional circumstances that might justify departing from it in some cases. It is of assistance to a judge to see that in statute form. If I were a judge, I would not regard it as invading my judicial independence but as something that made my job easier by removing doubt as to whether one is conforming with the spirit of the law in imposing a given sentence.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanHowlin" eId="spk_14">
          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_47">I know that we are anxious to move on. I agree with the case articulated by the Minister. I am strongly of the view that we have reached the time when the Legislature must speak loudly in respect of anyone who goes out with a weapon to menace the public in any shape or form, particularly if such a weapon is used in the commission of a criminal act.</p>
          <p eId="para_48">I wish to make two points, the first being that the Minister did not address my suggestion to the effect that if there are constitutional difficulties with the amendment tabled by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, it might be of some help to change the word "may" to "shall" so that the section reads "shall have regard" for previous convictions in sentencing so that we move away from mandatory sentencing in those two subsections. That would go some way towards capturing the principle enunciated by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe.</p>
          <p eId="para_49">My other point is that we must do more than signal in the abstract or, as the Minister said, comfort judges with a difficult job. Among the biggest issues facing us in the criminal justice system is the need to ensure public confidence in judicial action. There is often very good reason for the variation in sentencing that we have seen in some cases but because there is no explanation, public confidence is eroded. To lay down clear guidelines as ballpark figures will restore public confidence in the Judiciary by making clear that the tariff for similar offences should be commensurate. That tariff is laid down by the Oireachtas when it shapes the law and applied by the courts, with the constitutional right that the Judiciary has to make such determinations on a case-by-case basis. There is certainly an argument for consistency that is important in this context.</p>

          <p eId="para_52">It is a horrible title. The killings that occurred last year in particular highlighted that the Drimnagh gang had been running around murdering people for several years. There were also unrelated deaths in Inchicore and several in Ballyfermot. The Minister is right that life is cheap to such people. For some, ten years will not serve as a deterrent; I do not know what would have that effect. For some, the threat of a sentence is similar to being in a film because it makes them big men. They will go to jail and pose there, pursuing their vendettas. The cycle is not broken and although, according to the Minister, Operation Anvil was a success regarding the quantity of weapons recovered, its failure in my area showed that the criminals could not care less. When it was in train, three execution-style killings were carried out by a particular gang and these were responded to by another gang.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">The young people to whom I refer can be on cocaine, heroin or alcohol. Most of the gang members are between the ages of 18 and 30, though there are older people in the background who are stirring matters up. Some of these individuals are well known and have been exposed by the media. However, they are not being caught and they will not be apprehended merely because we are changing the law. A greater level of resources must be provided for the Garda drugs squad because all of this activity is linked to drug dealing. Weapons are being brought in as part of drug shipments. This is demonstrated by the fact that every single shipment the Garda has, thankfully, captured has had weapons associated with it. If we are to tackle the availability of guns, we must focus on drug shipments and determine what more we can do to destroy the drug empires which have been built up. That is also how to tackle minions who run around in bullet-proof vests and who are tooled up to the hilt.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">The attitude of the Garda is sometimes regrettable. An incident occurred in my area involving a parent who had been bringing children to a football match and who complained to the Garda after a man stood in front of his car and waved a gun at it. In that instance, the Garda said the complainant should not worry because the man was coked up and would have forgotten about it in the morning. A month later, the man in question did the same thing. Not only do we need to tell the Judiciary that it must act on such incidents, we must ensure that the Garda has the resources to respond more quickly and effectively to gun crime and the possession of illegal firearms.</p>
          <p eId="para_55">The reason I am speaking at length is that these are the same arguments I will make on mandatory sentencing for drugs related offences. I might as well put the arguments in the open at this point. I am concerned that we will end up throwing away the key for possession of firearms or significant quantities of drugs, though the threshold on the quantity of drugs set out in legislation is low. The prison population will grow and fill the prison the Minister has planned for Thornton Hall. While we should not refrain from convicting people simply because of the size of the prison population, we cannot implement these changes without providing more money for prisons and post-release systems to provide stability and support for ex-prisoners. Without further investment, the likelihood is that those with negative prison experiences will end up on drugs or in gangs, thereby confirming the positions in which they already find themselves. If we are to adopt mandatory sentencing, we must also ensure that training, rehabilitation and support of which prisoners can avail will be provided. If a person does not want to do so, we cannot force him or her to use the services to which I refer. However, a package must be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_56">The commutation of sentences and the system of temporary releases must also be examined. One might be able to provide that the option to commute a sentence or provide temporary release will be unavailable in respect of prisoners who have served less than half their sentences. If, however, they are ruled out completely, there is little incentive for inmates to be good prisoners and avoid membership of gangs or learning the tricks of the trade. The Minister is correct. While it is rare that I would look to the USA for justice policies, I did not have any other examples to hand.</p>

          <p eId="para_70">Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment to the amendment refers to a second or subsequent offence. The Minister's amendment includes an opt-out clause for the Judiciary to ensure that justice is done in individual cases. While it is important that justice is done on a case-by-case basis because no two cases are exactly the same, the point must be made that the Oireachtas, which represents the people, is entitled to send a very strong message to the Judiciary that it considers these offences to be of the most serious type and wishes corresponding punishments to be imposed on those who disobey the law.</p>

          <p eId="para_102">This amendment proposes inserting a new section 15A into the Firearms Act 1925. It provides for the first time an appeals mechanism whereby decisions on the granting of licences and authorisations under the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2006 may be made to the District Court. Under existing law, any person aggrieved by a decision could proceed only by way of judicial review of the decision before the High Court, which has happened on several occasions. The procedure is costly and time-consuming for all parties concerned. It is also inappropriate in most cases for the High Court jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">In consultation with the various shooting organisations, the lack of a proper appeals procedure was raised and I undertook to review the position. Consequently, I propose to provide a statutory right of appeal to the District Court against the decision of a person issuing firearms under firearms legislation. Decisions that can be appealed include, among other things, refusing to grant a renewal of a firearms certificate or revoking a firearms certificate and the appeal must be made within 30 days of the decision of the issuing person.</p>

          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_104">I strongly support the new appeals system. I posed a question on some of the matters covered by this amendment, namely, the issue of ranges and so on. I do not know whether the Minister has had time to consider these since I raised them.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">I also mentioned to the Chairman that because I came late to this debate, I did not have the benefit of being addressed directly by the shooting lobby. That has been rectified in the interim. Several issues were raised by those to whom I spoke who requested me to put them to the Minister, particularly in the context of the regulation of shooting as a sport. This discussion of the appeals mechanism for the refusal of firearms training certificates in the Minister's amendment may be the only opportunity I will have to pose those questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">Did the Minister consider the definition of ranges since I raised the matter at our previous meeting? People are concerned that it is necessary to have a licensed range and the penalty for shooting at an unauthorised range, namely a fine of up to €25,000 and jail for up to seven years, is severe. People legitimately involved in sport shooting want to ensure that they do not inadvertently run foul of this. The Minister said that he would revisit this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_107">Under the new section 4A to the principal Act, newcomers to shooting will be able to train only at shooting ranges. If one is not competent, however, one is not permitted to shoot at such a range. This seems to be a catch 22 situation. How does one become competent if one can shoot only at a range and only if one is competent to do so?</p>
          <p eId="para_108">Provision is made under the new section 4B for the appointment of firearms range inspectors. Such an inspector will be permitted to enter any premises without warrant when he or she suspects that target shooting is taking place. This is regarded as an extraordinarily wide-ranging power to give to any individual who is not obliged to be a member of the Garda Síochána, although the section encompasses gardaí and customs officials. Some would argue that it is a search warrant on the cheap if one wants to enter a premises without a warrant.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">I hope the Minister will forgive me for using the umbrella of this amendment to raise these points.</p>

          <p eId="para_111">I am concerned about subsection (2) of this amendment, which gives the person who has been refused a grant or renewal 30 days to appeal the decision. It does not state within what timeframe the court must hear the appeal. Perhaps it will be heard at the earliest possible opportunity. If so, it may be necessary to insert a phrase to the effect that "on the appeal the court at the earliest possible opportunity may confirm the decision", or whatever.</p>

For example, people cannot be allowed to carry out target practice next to a public road or a golf course where passers-by might be hit by ricochets, etc. I appreciate that a farmer who wants to keep his eye in with his shotgun can put up a tin can somewhere on his property and shoot at it.

          <p eId="para_148">TV licence inspectors operate on the same basis. One is not talking about moving into people's homes. One is talking about going on to land. Unless people have turned the inside of their houses into a range, which I think is unlikely, one is talking about going on to another's land. Practicality suggests that if a member of the inspectorate suspects an unauthorised range, he or she should be able to check it out rather than having to go to the District Court and invoke the powers of a judge to do so. One is not talking about a dwelling of a citizen. It is a question of what is reasonable and practicable. If the local sergeant hears shooting in the local quarry in the early hours of the morning, the idea that he or she should raise the District Court judge from his or her slumbers before going down to see if it is being used as a range is tilting the scales too much against practicality.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_153">In page 25, before section 24, but in Part 4, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_154">"43.—Section 17 of the Principal Act is amended by the insertion of the following subsections after subsection (4):</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_155">"(4A) Notwithstanding subsections (1) to (4) of this section, a licence for importing a firearm, ammunition or prohibited weapon may not be granted unless—</p>

          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_162">(4C) The reason for refusing an application for a licence under this section or for its renewal shall be communicated in writing to the applicant.".".</p>
          <p eId="para_163">Section 17 of the firearms Act provides for restrictions on the import of firearms and ammunition. It provides that no person can import a firearm or ammunition without a licence granted by the Minister. Under the law as it stands a licence to import firearms and ammunition can be granted by the Minister, if he or she thinks fit to do so, to any registered firearms dealer or to any person who holds or could hold a firearms certificate for the firearm and ammunition, if any, in respect of which the licence was sought. There is no specific requirement in law for the Minister when deciding on whether to grant such an importation licence to have regard to such matters as public safety and security or the purpose for which a firearm is to be imported. As a consequence a number of decisions to refuse importation licences have been challenged and are currently before the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_164">Amendment No. 120 inserts a number of new subsections into section 17 to address this issue. Specifically the amendment provides that the Minister shall not grant an importation licence unless the applicant has a good reason for importing it, granting the licence would not prejudice public safety or security or if the firearm is a restricted firearm, either the person is a firearms dealer or holds a firearm certificate for the firearm in question. This new provision will eliminate any uncertainty regarding the law governing importation of firearms. This comes down to the perpetual conundrums as to whether the Minister has too broad a discretion, with unstated constraints on the discretion but falls foul of the court based jurisprudence as regards what is or is not a permissible delegation of legislative functions. At present the Minister has virtually a free hand and, whereas I like having a free hand, the problem is that when I would be brought to court and asked how a particular provision is justifiable, or if the Minister has been given too free a hand by the Legislature, I do not want a challenge of that kind to succeed. There are cases pending before the courts and the remarks I have just made are not to be interpreted as conceding that I think there is anything wrong with what I am doing at the moment. I want to be sure there is no such challenge in the future.</p>

The maximum fines under this section are now being increased from £50 to €5,000 on summary conviction and from £100 to €20,000 on conviction on indictment. The maximum prison sentences are being increased from six months to 12 months on summary conviction and from two years to five years on conviction on indictment.

          <p eId="para_196">This amendment inserts a new section 25A to the principal Act, which provides a legal basis for the introduction of an amnesty during which persons holding illegal firearms may surrender them to the Garda Síochána before new fines and penalties and mandatory minimum sentences which I am also proposing are introduced. During the amnesty period, persons who surrender firearms will not be prosecuted for the simple illegal possession of the weapons. However, surrendered weapons will be, where appropriate, forensically tested and where they are found to have been used in a crime the weapon and forensic evidence will be admissible in any proceedings subsequently brought. It does not wipe the slate clean in respect of any offence that has been committed with the weapon.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">Subsection (1) of the new section provides that the Minister can, by order, declare a period during which guns and other offensive weapons can be handed in at Garda stations. It provides that firearms and offensive weapons may be handed into any Garda station. Subsection (2) provides that any person surrendering a weapon during the amnesty period must give his or her name and address to the Garda Síochána and must be informed by the gardaí that the firearm in question may be forensically tested.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">Subsection (3) provides that no proceedings can be brought against a person for having a firearm without a firearm certificate or being in possession of a flick-knife or other offensive weapon where the act constituting the offence is part of the process of surrender. Subsection (4) provides that the firearms and offensive weapons surrendered may be forensically tested. Subsection (5) provides that where firearms or offensive weapons have been used in the commission of an offence, the firearm or weapon and the forensic evidence gathered may be used in evidence in subsequent proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">Deputy O'Keeffe is proposing 17 amendments to the amendment. Amendments Nos. 1, 2, 4 to 13, inclusive, and 15 to 17, inclusive, to the amendment are drafting amendments which are stylistic. Amendment No. 3 to the amendment proposes to insert the words "... where the Minister has laid the proposal for such a period before the Houses of the Oireachtas and gained approval thereof". In this regard, I direct the Deputy's attention to amendment No. 127 in my name which inserts a new section in the Firearms Act which provides for the laying of orders and regulations before the Houses of the Oireachtas. It provides for each order and regulation to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas as soon as may be after it is made and if a resolution annulling it is passed by either House within 21 days, the order or regulation shall be annulled. Consequently, the Deputy's amendment is not strictly necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">Amendment No. 14 to the amendment proposes an amendment to subsection (4), which subsection provides that any surrendered weapon may be subjected to forensic examination or testing for the purpose of determining whether it is in a safe condition and, more importantly, discovering information on whether it was used in connection with or in the commission of an offence. The Deputy is proposing in addition that it be forensically tested for any purpose deemed necessary or appropriate by a garda not below the rank of superintendent. I am unclear at this stage as to the purpose, other than those already provided for in my amendment, a surrendered weapon might be forensically tested by the Garda. As I have outlined, my amendment allows for the testing of surrendered weapons for the purpose of determining whether they have been used in connection with or in the commission of a crime. Where the weapon has been so used, both it and the forensic evidence gathered may be used in evidence in subsequent proceedings. I am satisfied that my amendment, as it stands, adequately addresses the issue and, subject to what I hear, I think the Deputy's amendment is unnecessary.</p>

The question I must ask myself is whether, if a weapon is surrendered and it is tested and found to have been used in a crime, it is better that it is in the possession of the Garda Síochána than that a garda should say he or she cannot take the weapon because he or she is not satisfied as to the veracity of the name and address of the person surrendering it.

I do not expect the weaponry used in serious crimes around this city to be surrendered. On the definition of "weapon of offence" in section (10)(2) of the Firearms and Offensive Weapons Act 1990, is it broad enough to capture everything that might have become a weapon of offence since? I presume it is a catch-all phrase.</p>

          <p eId="para_210">Like Deputy Howlin and others, I do not know what the major benefits of this will be or how much weaponry will be surrendered. Most of the weapons this will capture will be surrendered to the Garda in any case. It might manage to attract some dangerous weaponry which would be lethal if it fell into the wrong hands or could be used in the commission of a crime. Although this measure provides for a specific period of one month or six months which will be sold as a type of amnesty, we will need to encourage people thereafter, if they come across such weaponry, to continue to surrender it to the Garda. I know of cases where builders renovating houses have come across weapons and left them where they had found them because touching or moving them would have left them open to the possibility of being charged with the offence of being in possession of a weapon. People should telephone the Garda station in advance to inform the Garda that they intend going there to surrender a weapon. This will ensure they will not be charged with an offence under Operation Anvil and end up serving a sentence if, by chance, they are stopped by a garda while on the way to the station. Where the Garda is not satisfied as to the identity of the person surrendering a weapon, the greater good should be taken into account and the weapon taken out of circulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">As a society, we need to examine how we can take out of circulation the weaponry in the hands of criminal gangs. I understand this is not an open amnesty, but we need to incentivise people to surrender weapons to ensure they are taken out of circulation without prejudicing investigations, society or those who have access to weapons. Criminal gangs have access to a huge amount of weaponry and are continuing to build up their arsenals. This can be attested to by the weaponry used by them in recent months, for example, small machine pistols, and the fact that they are being selective in the weapons they are bringing into the country. Such weapons have had a devastating effect — a number of people have been killed in Dublin in the past year. I agree the legislation should contain a clause that would allow for forensic examination of weapons, but people are aware they could be liable to prosecution if it is shown the weapon they are surrendering has been used before.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">I am aware of cases involving young teenagers who found weaponry dumped by criminal gangs and who, rather than handing them over to the Garda Síochána, kept them believing they were involved in a big adventure or big men. While they would not have been responsible for the crimes in which those weapons had been previously used, if they had handed them up, they could have been held liable if they were not able to account for where, when and how they had come across them.</p>
          <p eId="para_213">As a society, we will need at some stage to look at the broader issue of a gun amnesty in terms of whether the greater good would be served if all weaponry was handed up and clause 4 were suspended. I am not suggesting that is what I wish to happen. However, it is an issue we need to debate. During such a debate we could look at how effective gun amnesties have been in other countries. The gun amnesty in Dunblane in Scotland, while effective in terms of the number of knives and old shotguns handed up, did not manage to attract anything substantial in the way of other weaponry. While it had an effect in that weapons were no longer left lying around in small farmhouses or attics, it did not have the effect many believed it would have.</p>

Theoretically, paintball guns are pellet guns, as are potato pellet guns. One has to distinguish between weapons which can cause significant damage and those which cannot.

The section does not permit me to decide a particular provision shall not have effect in certain circumstances. The power is narrow. The section seeks to give effect to the Legislature's intention. It will be narrowly construed as giving the Minister power to make a regulation for the purpose of enabling any of its provisions to have full effect, in addition to the other cases for the making of regulations prescribed or to be prescribed or to be the subject of regulations. It does not apply to anything the Minister thinks up. It allows actions the Minister may wish to take for the purpose of ensuring the Legislature's intentions are met.

We have not yet reached the next amendment, but there are two ways secondary legislation can be brought into effect by regulation, the first being to require positive affirmation and the other to allow something to enter into force unless one annuls it. The lesser category is the one applied. Civil servants love it since it needs someone to spot the issue. On the other hand, if one requires positive affirmation, one must explain the issue.

          <p eId="para_339">Yes. There is an extensive body of jurisprudence. This is not an exact statement, but the general drift of what the courts upheld was that the power to delegate legislation must be within explicit or implicit parameters set by the legislation. Regarding non-Executive powers, one cannot generally delegate very broad discretion that turns the Minister into a mini-Legislature. Otherwise, someone looking at the Act under which he or she functions would not have any idea what would be decided or any clue as to the general policy being followed.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">The interesting aspect is that, as I understand it, the rubric of laying a regulation either before the Houses for their approval in advance or for their negative clearance is not constitutionally necessary. In other words, it is perfectly permissible for this House to enable Ministers to make regulations that need not be tabled for the Houses' approval, either by negative clearance or positive approval. That is a strange aspect. However, as I recollect from my time as Attorney General, the jurisprudence seemed to state that in certain cases, once the delegated power to make regulations is granted, bringing back the proposed legislation to the House is not a necessary constitutional arrangement.</p>

          <p eId="para_352">We have had the discussion, but perhaps I might ask why the predisposition is always to take the easier route when one is making regulations, particularly now that we have a committee shadowing each Department.

          <p eId="para_354">I hope I can say this without offending the Minister, since I genuinely mean it. From my several years' experience as spokesman on justice matters in the last Dáil, it seems there is a tendency, particularly in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, to view this place as a rubber stamp, circulating amendments late. As it does not apply only to the current incumbent, I can only assume it is a departmental rather than a ministerial issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">Through the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission, we are in the process of recruiting additional research staff to the Houses and support staff to the committees. It will take time and will probably be the next Dáil before it is done. On the Select Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, all secondary legislation is sent to a consultant who is employed by the committee. That person does the sifting and produces a very short report for committee members stating what is worth considering. One could do a good job of work that would ensure robust secondary legislation rather than, as often happens now, very narrow primary legislation. I am not making that case in this instance.</p>

One of the biggest complaints in the referendum was that there was a lack of scrutiny of what was coming from the European Union. As a consequence, changes were made. There is now the Sub-committee on European Scrutiny of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, on which I served for a time. Notice is given, the issues are sifted and those issues that merit further consideration are isolated. I hope that in time something similar might apply generally, or that at least notice of regulations might be given to the relevant committee in order that they might be sifted. I agree with the Minister that there is real pressure on everyone's time and hope important issues will be identified for consideration by committees.

One of my ambitions is to create circumstances in which the renewals system could be outsourced, subject to very tight Garda supervision.

A file would be required for each firearm and each renewal application and it would have to be passed from a local Garda sergeant to the district inspector and back again.

          <p eId="para_585">We have already discussed this amendment somewhat. It is a technical amendment to provide for the extension of the definition of a component part of a firearm contained in section 4 (1)(<i>g</i>) to include any part manufactured for use as a component in any of the loading, cocking, discharging, ejection or emission mechanisms of a firearm. It also provides that only air guns with a muzzle velocity of one joule are to be treated as firearms for the purposes of the Firearms Acts 1925 to 2006 — potato guns, paintball guns and the like are not in the frame. It also extends the definition of a firearm to include starting guns and blank firing guns, the latter being relevant in that there is an argument as to whether they are imitation firearms. It covers the issue of whether a starting piston is an imitation firearm. It is probably not in one view.</p>

          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_643">(<i>b</i>) a rifle to a length of less than 50 centimetres, is guilty of an offence.</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_644">(2) It is not an offence under subsection (1) for a registered firearms dealer to shorten the barrel of a shot-gun or rifle to a length of less than 61 or 50 centimetres respectively if the sole purpose of doing so is to replace a defective part of the barrel with a barrel of not less than 61 or 50 centimetres, as the case may be.</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_645">(3) It is an offence for a person to convert into a firearm anything which resembles a firearm but is not capable of discharging a projectile.</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_646">(4) Subject to subsection (5), it is an offence to modify a firearm so as to render its reloading mechanism fully automatic or to increase its calibre, irrespective of whether the firearm, as so modified, is a restricted firearm.</p>

          <p class="indent_4" eId="para_665">(<i>b</i>) whether the public interest in preventing the unlawful possession or use of firearms would be served by the imposition of a lesser sentence.</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_666">(12) Section 27C of the Firearms Act 1964 applies in relation to proceedings for an offence under this section and any minimum term of imprisonment imposed in those proceedings.".".</p>

          <p eId="para_748">This amendment substitutes a new section for section 80 of the Explosives Act 1875 and deals with fireworks. The area of fireworks is slightly fraught because everyone has his or her own theory in this regard. It is similar to the price of drink; people have strong views, one way or another, on the subject. The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform took the courageous and manly step of finding out what the public thought by way of an opinion survey. In general terms, the result should come as no surprise. Other than party poppers and very light fireworks, people are not in favour of them being used other than as part of a fireworks display. They do not like bangers being thrown around at Hallowe'en. A sizeable majority was opposed to the legalisation of bangers. A range of issues is involved, including: people afraid of their dogs being affected; a general quality of life issue; elderly people being scared by them; and children being injured by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">Although strong views were expressed in correspondence to me to the effect that the State has no business taking this kind of action, that in the UK fireworks are a major aspect of their celebration of Guy Fawkes night and that, in Ireland, the position is much the same as regards Hallowe'en, curiously the great majority of people are conservative and want the law to remain roughly as it stands. They also want it to be accommodated in the European Union's regulations and directives in respect of the classification of fireworks and they want decent penalties imposed in respect of those who are caught. While, theoretically, gardaí are meant to stop bangers and rockets being sold on the streets, the penalties are so desultory that it would cost more to issue the District Court summons than could be recovered by way of fines. To some extent, the law has become marooned by the passage of 120 years since this matter was last considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">The new section makes it an offence to ignite a firework, to cause it to be ignited in any place, or to throw, direct or propel an ignited firework at or towards a person or property. For the first time it makes it an offence to possess a firework with the intent to sell or supply it to another without being licensed to do so under the 1875 Act. The experience most of us had — those of us who were schoolboys in Dublin at any rate — of going to the fruit sellers and of materials being produced from the pockets of aprons, etc., will be a thing of the past. Such activities will be illegal from now on.</p>
          <p eId="para_751">The new section 80(7) and (8) will give the Garda the right to search premises and seek illegally held fireworks, which are those held other than under a licence. Penalties will be increased, with a fine of €2,500 or six months' imprisonment, or both, or on conviction of indictment a fine of €10,000 or five years' imprisonment, or both. At present, container loads of fireworks can be moved with only desultory penalties applying.</p>
          <p eId="para_752">Deputy Jim O'Keeffe tabled 26 amendments to my amendment. Amendments Nos. 1 to 10, inclusive, and 12 to 25, inclusive, to my amendment are drafting in nature. His amendment No. 11 to my amendment proposes an amendment to the new section 80(8), which governs search warrants by the District Court. The new section 80(7) provides that a judge of the District Court may provide a search warrant on the oath of a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of sergeant. The new section 80(8) provides that a warrant granted under section 80(7) shall authorise a member of the Garda Síochána:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_753">(<i>a</i>) to enter the place named in the warrant at any time or times within one week of the date of issue of the warrant, on production if so requested of the warrant and if necessary by the use of reasonable force,</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_754">(<i>b</i>) to search it and any persons found at the place, and</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_755">(<i>c</i>) to seize anything found at the place, or anything found in the possession of any person present there at the time of the search that that member reasonably believes to be evidence of, or relating to, the commission of an offence under this section.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment to my amendment would provide that warrants issued under this new section should be provided in accordance with section 5 of the Bill, which provides for search warrants in cases of arrestable offences. Where offences are created by statute, it has become the practice to provide for a power of search in respect of the offence in the relevant statute. In addition, section 10 of the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1997, which is amended by section 5 of the Bill, provides for the issuing by a judge of the District Court of a warrant authorising a garda to search a place for evidence of the commission of certain serious offences that are indictable offences involving death or serious bodily injury to a person, false imprisonment, rape and certain other sexual offences. Provisions allowing for search warrants to be issued by members of the Garda Síochána are also contained in the Criminal Justice (Drug Trafficking) Act and the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">Section 5 extends the offences covered by section 10 to include all arrestable offences under section 2 of the Criminal Law Act 1997. When dealing with that provision we engaged in a lengthy discussion about superintendents issuing warrants. I have undertaken to reconsider elements of that provision. I will also reconsider this section to ensure that it is compatible with the provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">We are inserting a new section into the 1875 Act. Whereas Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's amendment to my amendment would apply a different provision, I wanted to ensure that someone consulting the new section would find the warrant provision rather then being obliged to engage in the complex process of rooting around in a different Act in order to find it. I accept the Deputy's general proposition that what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander and that a similar warrant-giving power should be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">Amendment No. 26 to my amendment provides for a new definition of "place". We have agreed that we will reconsider that issue in a broader context and that will also apply to this section.</p>

I ask the Minister to consider the two amendments he highlighted to determine whether they would improve the Bill. As we can return to them on Report Stage, I will not press them now.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">It is time some sense was brought to bear in respect of the overall issue of fireworks. The law, which dates from 1875, is in total disrepute. It has been more honoured in the breach than in the observance and contains totally derisory penalties. It is appropriate that we should come to a decision on what to do regarding fireworks generally. I take the point that most of the complaints I receive at Hallowe'en come from those who are badly disrupted in their everyday lives by the activities of those dealing with fireworks. Some of the fireworks available seem to be of a poor standard, which is inevitable when they are either sold under the table in Moore Street or brought across the Border.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">I understand that European regulations make provision in respect of three categories. Generally, my feeling is that we have to have a law that is workable and acceptable, and it is mostly acceptable to people that in general fireworks should not be generally available and, when they are, they should be under control. The one area in which I feel that there is a case for relaxation on fireworks is when a community group is genuinely trying to put on a display for a local community, which is carefully organised and in which all due precautions have been taken. I would like to be assured that such groups can get the necessary approvals.</p>

          <from>Mr. Howlin</from>
          <p eId="para_777">I am anxious, as this is an area about which the law has not been clear. We were conditioned by events in the North of the island in the 1970s to see an explosive as a dangerous thing to have around the place, with very good reason. That conditioned us to be very restrictive in how fireworks were used. I come from a county where, at the traditional opening of our annual opera festival, there is a significant fireworks display, conducted by one of the most respected firework operators in the country, Mr. Casey Whelan. He will not mind me mentioning his name; he operates a company across the land. For the 50th anniversary, he worked in conjunction with Group F, the firework company that conducted the fireworks display at the millennium in Paris, around the Eiffel Tower.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">There are a number of events that people like to celebrate with fireworks, and when I look out from my window on New Year's Eve and on a variety of other occasions, I can see fireworks being launched from people's back yards. There should be an ability for communities to organise such events. In Britain, Guy Fawkes night is characterised by numerous injuries, especially to children, because there is an irresponsible abundance of fireworks and people mix alcohol and let off fireworks at street parties, which can be very dangerous.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">I would like the Minister to go through the section. As I see it, it is an offence for someone to let off a firework that is encompassed by this section unless it is licensed. The exclusion is of "a firework imported under licence in accordance with section 40(9) of this Act". I presume that is a reference to section 40(9) of the 1875 Act, which I presume did not deal with importation into Ireland, as we were part of the United Kingdom.</p>

It is the exclusion clause, which says that one is not guilty of an offence if, under subsection 14(<i>b</i>)(i) it is a “low hazard firework” or, under subsection 14(<i>b</i>)(ii), it is “a firework imported under licence in accordance with section 40(9) of this Act”. What conditions are laid down in the 1875 Act under section 40? The Minister said that he was anxious that a responsible community person would be facilitated by the Garda to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">On storage, there used to be a requirement that fireworks were stored either in a military barracks or in a Garda barracks. Is that still the situation with storage?
