          <from>Deputy Mary Lou McDonald<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T14:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1">The report published this morning by the Banking and Payment Federation of Ireland, BPFI, confirms what we already know, which is that the housing policy of the Government is failing abysmally. The BPFI analysis is stark. Since 2010, rents in Ireland have soared by a whopping 82% compared with an EU average of 18% for the same period. This rip-off of Ireland's renters has happened on the watch of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. Crazy rents are robbing tenants of any hope of getting a deposit together to buy their own homes and is trapping them in an extortionate nightmare.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> Today’s report also highlights that housing supply is nowhere near keeping up with population growth. It states our population is growing at three times the rate of housing supply. Since 2011, the State's population has grown by 500,000 but only 130,000 housing units were added in this time. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have been getting it wrong on for more than a decade and they are still getting it wrong now. Serious concerns are also raised regarding the decline in housing commencements throughout the State. In the middle of a housing emergency, the rate of housing construction is falling. Things are bad now but unless the Government brings the urgency and ambition required, things will get a whole lot worse.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> We have repeatedly told the Government that its targets for social and affordable housing are far too low. Its targets are a drop in the ocean and it is not even meeting them. It is not just Sinn Féin saying this; it is housing organisations on the front line of this emergency and officials in the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage who recently stated that the Government has seriously underestimated its housing targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> Sadly, many of our young people now look to a life beyond Ireland. The Central Statistics Office tells us nearly half of renters are considering emigrating because of the crippling cost of living. Many mothers and fathers will spend this Christmas watching their sons and daughters pack their bags for Australia and Canada. Is it any wonder when Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael remain wedded to policies that put cuckoo funds and wealthy investors above young people's need to get a decent start? This is so wrong. We need our young people here at home. We need their talent, energy and ideas. What else can we expect of them when they cannot put a roof over their heads in Ireland?</p>
          <p eId="para_5"> What other option do they really have, when the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, says that we do not have a housing emergency? Deimhníonn tuarascáil an BPFI dáiríreacht na héigeandála tithíochta. Is féidir le hAirí oifigí a mhalartú mas mian leo. Chun difríocht a dhéanamh i ndáiríre, tá athrú polasaithe tithíochta fiúntach ag teastáil go práinneach.</p>
          <p eId="para_6"> Today’s report lays it out plainly. It turns out that, despite the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, lecturing our young people, in fact the grass is greener elsewhere, especially for renters. There has been an 82% rent hike in Ireland versus an average of 18% across the EU. That is some punch in the gut for renters. It is a rip-off on a massive scale and yet the Government does nothing about it. Does the Minister now accept that it is time for the Government to intervene decisively, to put a month’s rent back into renters’ pockets through a refundable tax credit and finally to ban rent increases for three years?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcGrath" as="#Minister_for_Public_Expenditure_and_Reform" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform (Deputy Michael McGrath)<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T14:05:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_7">I thank Deputy McDonald for raising the BPFI report today, which confirms that we face an enormous challenge in relation to housing. The Government has been upfront and honest about the scale of that challenge. That is why we brought forward the Housing for All plan, which is showing significant signs of progress in relation to supply overall, which will reach the highest level for a long number of years. Close to 28,000 homes were built in the 12 months to the end of September. Nearly 21,000 homes were built in the first nine months of the year, which is more than the entirety of the previous year. As the Deputy knows, this year, overall under the Housing for All plan, the target is 24,600 units. We now expect that we will achieve over 26,000 units this year, which will be the highest level of output since 2008. There were more than 16,000 first-time buyers in the last 12 months, which is the highest number since 2007 and represents a third of all home purchases. Construction on over 26,600 homes commenced in the year to October.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> While acknowledging the scale of the challenge we face, it is also only fair and proper that we acknowledge the fact that housing output is increasing significantly. There are headwinds in the private sector. We have been honest about that when it comes to labour shortages, which we are seeking to address through our apprenticeship system and through the employment permit system. There are challenges in relation to construction materials inflation, which we are again seeking to address through the inflation co-operation framework that is in place. There are challenges in relation to our planning system and a new comprehensive planning Bill will be brought into this House shortly. I hope it will meet with support across this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_9"> Many renters aspire to own their own home at some point in time. While not all of them do, many of them do. For those who do, we have introduced a whole range of new initiatives, including the first home scheme, FHS, shared equity scheme. Almost 1,000 applications have now been received and 200 contracts have now been executed. We have extended the help to buy scheme, which has helped 35,000 first-time buyers to get on the property ladder. We are targeting 5,000 new affordable homes through the Land Development Agency, LDA, by 2026. As the Deputy will know, they are engaging with the market in relation to Project Tosaigh and in particular in relation to sites where planning permission is in place but where there are viability challenges at this point in time. We have also empowered local authorities to invest through land purchase in order to bring forward affordable purchase schemes and they are doing that. Do we need more? Of course, we need more. The Government is providing a record amount of resources. For once in our nation's history, funding is not really the constraint. We need the public system to deliver and we need to partner with the private sector to make sure that it maximises output. The Deputy has raised particular issues around renters and we acknowledge that this is the case for new rental agreements. This is what the data represents because existing tenants have protections under the rent pressure zone, RPZ, system where the rent increase is capped at 2%.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> Those renters should also know is what Sinn Féin is planning. Sinn Féin is planning a new tax of €400 on rental properties. It is planning to increase income tax on landlords, many of whom have incomes of over €100,000. It wants to increase income tax on them. For landlords with multiple properties and who may incur significant capital gains tax, Sinn Féin wants to increase capital gains tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">At a time we need to increase the supply of rental accommodation, through what the State is doing directly but also by retaining existing investment in the market and attracting new investment, Sinn Féin's policies would further drive landlords out of the market. The Deputy needs to be honest about that.</p>

          <p eId="para_27">I too will raise BPFI report. We know from the report that rents in Ireland have increased by more than four times the EU average over the past 12 years. Those figures absolutely lay bare the extent of the crisis in this country. Under the Government, the fact is that things are getting worse. Rents, house prices and homelessness are all at record levels and are continuing to exponentially grow. Meanwhile, mortgage approvals have hit their lowest level in the past 17 months. Construction in the three months to September was down a massive 22% compared to the same period last year. This crisis is having disastrous consequences for every aspect of life in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> To give the Minister just one example, we have a teacher recruitment crisis in our schools, in large part because teachers can no longer afford the housing costs in Dublin or other urban areas. The Social Democrats will bring forward a motion on that issue tomorrow to propose solutions I hope the Government will adopt. One of the proposals relates to vacant homes. We have been waiting for a vacant homes tax to be introduced since it was first mooted by Fine Gael in 2016, which is six years ago. A proper vacant homes tax can be the fastest, cheapest and most sustainable means of bringing additional homes into use.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> Regrettably, the vacant homes tax the Government has finally proposed is so low as to be laughable.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">The Government has set the rate at just 0.3% of the value of a property. Does the Minister know that house prices increased by 10.8% in the past year? If the value of a home will increase by more than 10% if it is left vacant, how on earth is a tax of 0.3% an incentive to bring it back into use? Let us take an example of a home that is worth €400,000, which is less than the average price of a Dublin home. Under the Government's plans, the vacant homes tax will be charged at a rate of €1,215 per annum for the next year, but the value of the home will increase by €43,200 over the same period. Sitting on it will still earn people almost €42,000 even after they pay the pathetically low rate of vacant homes tax the Government has introduced. Will the Minister and the Government, for once, take this housing crisis seriously and implement a measure that will make a big difference? He will soon be Minister for Finance for the next two years. I implore him to implement a punitive vacant homes tax. The Social Democrats have proposed a rate of 10% of the value of the home. Will the Minister urgently review the rate of this tax and raise it to a meaningful level?</p>

          <p eId="para_31">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. Making better use of existing stock has to be an important part of the overall solution, given the scale of the housing challenge we face. We know that, with the best will in the world, building new homes takes time, with the various stages that have to be gone through, including planning, procurement, bringing services to land, waterways, water, other infrastructure and so on. We have an issue with the underutilisation of existing stock, including in our towns, villages and cities. If one walks around many of our towns and cities and looks overhead at buildings at night, one does not really see people living there. That sets us apart from many other European cities. We have to find ways to make better use of existing stock. The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has brought forward a range of new proposals, including the Croí Cónaithe special grant of €30,000 for vacant properties, going up to €50,000 if the properties are derelict. He has extended that beyond towns into rural areas and cities too.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> When it comes to the issue of properties that are fully vacant, the vacant homes tax is a significant intervention by Government. That is the first time that such a tax has been imposed. One can argue about the rate or the scope but we utilised the information that has been gathered by the Revenue Commissioners from the returns made in respect of the local property tax to construct a new tax and intervention with a view to ensuring that as many of those properties as possible come back into use and become available in the market where there is such a shortfall.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> When it comes to local authority homes, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has brought 5,000 social homes back into use under the voids programme. Where the State is directly in control of these homes, through our local authorities, we have accelerated the reinstatement of the homes to get them back into use. A further 2,000 are planned for this year, which is particularly important. We have various instruments, and through our local authorities, the Derelict Sites Act 1990 and the derelict sites register, which needs further work because we have to make sure that where properties are derelict, the penalty has to be significant to make sure they are brought back into play. We now have a new tax in respect of vacant homes, which will play a part in encouraging the owners of those properties to make them available. Having said that, there will always be legitimate reasons for some homes being vacant. We have made changes to the fair deal scheme to ensure that properties can be rented out and that the income is not a penalty in respect of the financial assessment for the scheme. We will continue to work on that. I look forward to the debate on the Social Democrats' motion. The Government will consider any constructive measure that the Deputy or anyone else in this House has to increase the supply of housing stock.</p>

          <p eId="para_34">I did not ask the Minister about local authority voids. That is something entirely different. I asked him about the vacant homes tax and the fact that tens of thousands of homes are lying idle at the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_35">They are the most effective way to increase the stock of houses available to our young people, many of whom currently have no choice but to go abroad. Two out of three nurses are planning on emigrating and 61% of our primary schools are understaffed. This is down to the high cost of housing. I asked the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, on what basis he thinks a person who can continue to sit on a vacant property and benefit to the tune of €40,000 next year would be influenced to bring that home into use and make it available as a result of a tax of €1,200. It does not make any sense whatsoever. When I queried the Minister on this all he could say was it is three times the property tax rate.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">Saturday, 17 December is the day the new Taoiseach will be elected. The Cost of Living Coalition has called a demonstration outside the Dáil for that day. It is a very broad group of trade unions, students unions, disability groups, anti-poverty and housing groups and believes we do not need a new Taoiseach but a new Government. If there was not enough evidence of that need, we have had further evidence of it today with the Bank and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, report that shames this Government. It shows we have seen four and a half times the rate of increase in rents when compared with the rest of Europe. This has resulted in average rents in my area of €2,400 and average rents in Dublin of €2,200. These are totally unaffordable for a whole generation of young and working people, who are now being driven out of the country. On top of that, we had the Goodbody report last week that showed commencements of new-build apartments and houses have dropped very significantly in the last few months. I do not know how the Minister can say Housing for All is working. Apartment commencements have dropped by 29% and house commencements by 23%.</p>
          <p eId="para_45"> We got another report today from Citizens Information and the Disability Federation of Ireland showing that people with disabilities, mental health problems and other very ill and vulnerable people are not being given anything like appropriate housing. I raised last week how it is taking about a year for a person in my area to get a medical assessment of housing need. Very sick and vulnerable people are not being housed at all or are being put in utterly inappropriate conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_46"> Against this background, it is beyond belief that at the end of this year, the Government will have underspent the housing budget by €700 million and it claims this is a success for the Housing for All plan. I got some figures from Mel Reynolds, the housing commentator, this week. I will put these to the Minister as questions he might wonder about the answers to. Does he know how many new council houses Dublin City Council built in the first half of this year? Guess.</p>

          <p eId="para_50">Supply is increasing. That is a fact. The Government is focused, collectively, on implementing all strands of Housing for All. New public stock is not just delivered by our local authorities. It is also delivered by approved housing bodies and the LDA. The question is, when it comes to this House making decisions, which might be difficult ones where trade-offs are involved in our planning system, will the Deputy support the new consolidated planning Bill that will be brought before this House with a view to accelerating the delivery of the homes we all want and that he says he wants as well? Will he call on people to stop objecting to developments where appropriate developments are being proposed by local authorities, the LDA or the private sector? The Deputy is shaking his head but these are the relevant facts that really matter when it comes to getting construction sites under way all over the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_51"> Much has been said in the last ten or 15 minutes about the issue of targets, whether we are building enough homes and the extent to which the population has increased significantly. It is worth making the point that the targets in Housing for All were set on the basis of a housing need and demand assessment informed by the ESRI, which was engaged to undertake independent research. Since then the results of the census, at a headline level, have been published by the CSO. It is intended to review the underpinning research and update the tool when the full census data become available from the CSO next year. It should also be said that the preliminary census results for 2022 will show our population at 5.1 million, indicating that the population of Ireland and the consequent overall level of national housing demand is broadly in line with that projected by the ESRI for the same year. For people to say the targets in Housing for All are completely inaccurate and out of date is not backed up by the facts or the results of the census. When we have those full results, we will do a reassessment of what the revised projection should be to ensure the homes are delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_52"> The issue we have to tackle here is ensuring there is sufficient capacity in the system, in our public system and across the private sector, to deliver the homes our people need all over Ireland. The Government is leading on this issue through a range of different initiatives. More public homes are being built than at any point in recent history. We have new affordable housing schemes that are now up and running. We have extended the help to buy scheme and we have brought in the first home shared equity scheme, through which transactions are now getting completed and people are purchasing homes which would not otherwise have been possible without the intervention and direct involvement of the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_53">Planning permissions are not the issue in the housing crisis. We have 80,000 planning permissions granted at the moment. The problem is that those in the private sector has no interest in solving this crisis. Why would it when it can command record house prices and record rents? It has a vested interest in not solving the crisis because if there was lots of cheap accommodation it could not make such big profits. The Minister claims, against that background where the State has to intervene, with catastrophic market failure causing human misery for tens of thousands of people affected by this housing crisis, that public housing is ramping up. I just gave him the facts. In the first six months of 2022, in the teeth of this crisis, the four Dublin local authorities built no new council houses. The Government has failed to spend €700 million that was allocated for housing. What is the Government going to do about that? What is it going to do to ramp up the construction of local authority housing? What is it going to do with that €700 million?

          <p eId="para_57">Yes, we will. Deputy Boyd Barrett should also put the full facts on the record when he talks about the performance of the local authorities in Dublin. The four Dublin local authorities currently have 2,000 homes under construction on various sites and in excess of 3,700 others in the pipeline for delivery at this point in time. Shanganagh is under way. The LDA is now building homes - public housing and affordable cost rental housing - for the first time through the direct involvement of the State.</p>

          <p eId="para_59">The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is also providing €100 million to local authorities to help them clear legacy debt. This will assist in accelerating the delivery of social homes on sites that local authorities own by taking away the debt related to them. He is also putting in place a fund for the Housing Agency to assist it in assembling land banks around the country so that we can accelerate the delivery of public homes all over Ireland.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Canney<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_60">I raise the issue of the residential zoned land tax and its implications for family farms around the country. Farmers are private landowners. They are not builders. They own the land to farm it and try to make a living from it. They do not hoard it as an investment. The fact that farmers are completely unaware that some of their land is being zoned for residential purposes leaves them in a very precarious predicament. In Killarney, of more than 200 acres of land zoned for residential use, only around ten acres are being built on each year. Some farmers will find themselves paying this tax for the next 20 years until the land is used up.</p>
          <p eId="para_61"> The way land is being zoned is through a desktop study being done by the local authorities. They are not looking on the ground or talking to owners to see whether the land will become available. In many small rural towns around the country, farmers are farming right up to the town boundaries and beyond. They are now being caught up in this residential tax, even though they are not hoarding land. Their land has been zoned by the local authority without their knowledge or consent. They are fearful that they will be paying tax from money they are trying to eke out of the land in order to stave off something that is beyond their control.</p>
          <p eId="para_62"> The farming organisations are very concerned about this. More to the point, they have tried to discuss it with different Departments. The Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage tells them it is an issue for the Revenue Commissioners and the Revenue Commissioners tell them that it is a local authority housing issue. At this stage we need clarity from the Minister and we also need to make sure that no matter what happens, a farmer who is making a living from land, be it zoned for residential development or not, is not liable to a residential tax on the land. It is important we do that and provide a derogation so that farmers do not have to pay the tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_63"> In places where local area plans are being done, there is zone 1 and zone 2 zoning. Zone 1 is land which is going to be used first and zone 2 is land that will be used when zone 1 is complete. That never happens yet farmers will find themselves in a position where they are paying this unjust tax. I ask the Government to look at this and make it clear, once and for all, that farmers who can produce a herd number and show they are functional farmers on the land will not be liable for any tax. That must be made abundantly clear to all farmers who at this stage are worried sick about what they may face when this tax is brought in.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Deputy Michael McGrath<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T14:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_64">I thank Deputy Canney for raising this matter. In many ways it speaks to the issue we have been discussing for the past half an hour. Everyone agrees there is a housing crisis and we face a huge challenge to deliver homes all over the country. However, as soon as something is proposed that is an imposition on somebody, in some cases a major imposition, then objections are raised, progress is stalled and barriers are put in the way. That is the fundamental choice we face as a country.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">On this issue, when locally elected members agree on their development plan and decide, having taken advice on board, that a land bank is suitable and appropriate for development and is situated in an area where land is serviced and close to amenities and so on, it is to be expected that the Government will seek to ensure that, wherever possible, that land bank is developed in accordance with the locally adopted county development plan. Having said that, there is of course a mechanism for this tax to be avoided.</p>
          <p eId="para_66"> As the Deputy knows, the mapping process is now at an advanced stage. It involves public notification of draft and supplemental maps with a related national and local communications campaign which is under way. Landowners and interested parties may make submissions to the local authority. Landowners can appeal the decision of the local authority to retain their land on the map to An Bord Pleanála. As a once-off provision during 2022 and 2023, landowners may also request the local authority to rezone their land to remove it from the scope of the tax. It is open to anyone who is directly affected by this tax that comes into being in 2024 to have their land bank removed from the scope of the tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_67"> We cannot have it every way. People cannot have their land zoned and keep the zoning into the future while, at the same time, avoid the tax that is intended to stimulate supply. It goes back to the heart of the issue we have been discussing for the past 30 minutes or so because there has been a long build-up to this measure. As Members know, it was legislated for in the Finance Act 2021. The tax measure will be levied at 3% of the market value of the zoned land. The local authorities have gone through an extensive mapping process at this point. In regard to land in agricultural use specifically, only farming land which is zoned solely or primarily for residential purposes will be in scope. Agricultural land zoned for a mixture of uses, including residential, is not in scope as farming is a trade or profession benefiting from an exemption in the legislation. In that respect and in regard to the provision that is there, a facility is being provided for a proposal to be made for land to be dezoned, thereby completely taking a land bank out of this particular new tax. We believe that this is a fair and proportionate intervention by the State given the scale of the challenge we face to bring newly zoned land to the market whereby homes can be built for our people.</p>

          <p eId="para_68">I feel frustration when somebody raises an issue about a tax such as this which is trying to free up land to have houses built on it. However, I believe this is an imposition on farmers and it should be wiped off the agenda. What Minister is devising this policy? Will that Minister meet farmers’ representatives in order that they can get a clearer understanding of what is going on? I know of land zoned in towns and villages in my constituency and throughout Galway that will never be used, for one reason or another but not because it is being hoarded. Land has been zoned in Tuam where there is no access to the land to build a house on it. That kind of daft zoning is not the fault of the farmer or the landowner because they were never consulted about it. They have no interest in hoarding or making a bundle of money out of it. They are not trying to turn it over to make a pound. Which Minister is responsible for this tax so that the farming bodies can meet and discuss it with him or her?</p>

          <p eId="para_69">I thank Deputy Canney. There is no problem with engagement, which should always take place between stakeholders. Of course farmers have issues with this measure and will be affected by it. This is a tax of the Department of Finance. The Revenue Commissioners are involved. The local authorities have a central role, as has the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, and the relevant Minister is directly involved as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_70"> The draft maps were published by all 31 local authorities on 1 November 2022. Where what the Deputy described as “daft zoning” took place, it should be undone immediately. As the Deputy said, where land is never going to be developed, not for hoarding reasons but for other reasons, such as that it cannot be accessed, there is no point in letting it remain on a county development plan map as zoned land suitable for development. The easiest way out of all that is to dezone that land. That will completely remove it from the scope of the zoned land tax. There will be no issue with engagement in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">I repeat that key point: we cannot have it every way. As I say, we have a huge crisis, we have a challenge and then the first time the Government brings in a new initiative in respect of zoned land to bring it to the market and to get homes built, we have issues which are raised by way of objection.</p>

The Minister for Health has tabled 50 separate amendments but the one amendment we need to see to prescribe in law the absolute obligation for full open disclosure is not there. The legislation means that a discordant, erroneous or incorrect cancer screening will become a notifiable incident but the duty of candour is not there.</p>

          <p eId="para_137">I totally agree with Deputy McDonald on that point. I want to raise another issue on the Order of Business, and that is a motion we are being asked to pass without debate on the comprehensive agreement in the field of air transport. This deal is aimed at growing a market in transnational flights and climate is mentioned once in the briefing document. At a time when emissions are rising and we are facing the biggest climate catastrophe ever, we are being asked to pass without debate a deal which would without doubt increase emissions both nationally and globally. I think it is not just insane but utterly bizarre that this is being put in front of us in the name of the Green Party and we are being asked to pass it without debate. I am not going to do that. I am a Member of the Oireachtas and we have to be accountable to the people who elect us. It is a disgrace that we are being asked to do this.</p>

          <p eId="para_138">I have written to the Business Committee about an issue I raised last week on behalf of the Rural Independent Group. We need a calm and reasoned debate on the influx of immigration into our country. I am not talking about refugees fleeing war. I am talking about the staggering figures that are there from places like Algeria. Fewer than 100 people from that country applied in 2021 and a staggering 1,318 have applied in the first ten months of this year. We need to look at this. We are not living in an echo chamber in here. The whole country is talking about this and is worried about it. We need to have a proper, reasonable, fair and respectful debate about it. We need it. Christmas is coming, as we know, and we need this debate, not to let it fester and drag on.</p>

          <p eId="para_141">There is a life-and-death catastrophe unfolding in the hospitals, especially in my own region at the moment. Eleven ambulances were stuck outside of Drogheda hospital last Saturday because there was not a bed, a chair or a trolley available for them. Seventeen consultants in Drogheda hospital wrote a letter to the Minister stating that it is a threat to the life and health of patients in the region if the Government proceeds with the closure of the accident and emergency unit in Navan. It is an incredible situation that we have an accident and emergency unit about to be closed in part from this Monday and, at the same time, we cannot get access to the other accident and emergency units in the region. There was no availability of ambulances in Cavan and Monaghan last Saturday night because those ambulances were tied up. We need a proper debate about the crisis in accident and emergency units across the State before these decisions are made.</p>

          <p eId="para_142">I too want to raise the patient safety Bill. We have waited over six months for Government amendments. They were circulated and we received them on Friday morning. There are 42 pages of amendments from the Minister. There has been no briefing and no pre-legislative scrutiny, and the deadline was on Monday morning for amendments to those amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_143">That is an entirely unreasonable way of dealing with very important business. The Minister and the Government need to rethink this. It is not possible to deal with that level of serious amendments without any kind of briefing from the Minister or his Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_144">It is important to clarify the position with regard to the Patient Safety (Notifiable Patient Safety Incidents) Bill 2019 and the key issue of open disclosure, which has been raised here. We should not confuse clinical audits with patient-requested reviews. They are different. They are explained clearly in the report that was published by the expert review group. A new patient-requested review process has been developed for screening, following the guidelines from the expert group, and designed in conjunction with patients, including the 221+ group. I wish to put on record that it will be mandatory to disclose the results of these reviews to women.</p>

          <p eId="para_158"> On the issue raised by Deputy Tóibín, it is important again to put on the record, while recognising the real clinical concerns raised by the HSE, that the Minister for Health has made it clear that several important issues, including additional capacity in other hospitals impacted and the continued ability of people in the Navan area to access emergency and urgent care, need to be fully addressed before any proposed transition by the HSE. We must look at and learn from our experience in reconfiguring other hospitals. The Minister is also opposed to a full ambulance bypass protocol.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">I have just listened to a weather expert on radio advising households as temperatures are expected to drop below freezing for what he called "a prolonged period." He suggested those unable to access the fuel allowance, which is the majority of workers and families, can access an additional needs payment. If only it was that simple. This is, of course, an important support in cases of emergency or an urgent situation. I am aware of applications that are still taking between ten and 12 weeks to be processed. Households cannot wait this length of time. Given the crisis that households are in and now as the temperatures are set to go below freezing, will the Government reinstate the community welfare officers, CWOs, who are best placed, back in the community? The quickest way for people to get financial support is through local community welfare officers back on the ground where they can have walk-in appointments, which are no longer available.</p>

          <p eId="para_292">I thank the Deputy. I appreciate that the cold weather, which has arrived and will get worse, is a real concern for many households. We want people to be comfortable in their homes. I will take up the specific issue she has raised about the timeframe that some applications for additional needs payments are taking and her suggestion regarding CWOs. I ask people who are in need to engage with the Department and, indeed, with their utility companies, but, above all else, to stay warm and comfortable in the days ahead.</p>

          <p eId="para_293">The impact of the changes the Minister for Health will make to Navan emergency department, ED, or Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda from next Monday will mean that "patients may die". These are not my words. These are only some of the words of 17 hospital consultants of my own local hospital, Our Lady of Lourdes, in Drogheda, expressed in what was an alarming letter to the Minister last week. The Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, has heard this all before. The Minister for Health has heard this all before. This Government has simply failed to act.</p>
          <p eId="para_294"> I want to give one example of what happened at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital last Saturday. Eleven ambulances were parked up at the hospital last Saturday night treating sick patients in the back because no trolleys were available in the ED and no beds in the hospital. This is completely unacceptable. Staff were at their wits' end. There are no new beds and a deficit of 16 unfilled non-consultant hospital doctor posts.</p>
          <p eId="para_295"> No extra resources are to be provided to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital to accommodate this change but the hospital is expected to receive many more sick and unwell patients from the Meath area over the next period from next Monday as a result of the Government's plan. The Government needs to change course. The Government needs to consider that proposal and the impact it will have on staff and patients who need to be accommodated in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital.</p>

          <p eId="para_296">I thank the Deputy. The Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, has spoken to some colleagues on this issue and has made it clear that, contrary some reports, the ED in Navan is not closing this month. Of course, a concern the Deputy has is the knock-on consequences for Drogheda and the ambulance bypass protocol. The only change, as I understand it, is in a very exceptional and specific circumstance where in the opinion of the paramedic in the ambulance, some discretion is being provided on certain narrow grounds the Minister and the HSE will clarify. Those wider changes are not happening.</p>

          <p eId="para_297">Our public services across the board are under massive strain because those we ask to work in them cannot afford to live in our cities and urban areas. One consequence of that where it is most pronounced is in our schools. We have a staffing crisis in our schools for a variety of reasons but predominantly because our teachers, in particular, younger teachers, cannot afford to live in our cities. That is having a massive knock-on effect on students, particular those, for example, with special education needs where teachers trained in special education are being reallocated into other classes. What will the Minister do to ensure that students in our schools who have additional education needs will get a fair education? That is not happening at present because of an absence of teachers to fill those posts.</p>

          <p eId="para_298">I thank Deputy Gannon. The Minister, Deputy Foley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, are very much aware of this issue. They have already taken a number of steps, including on a temporary basis for the current school year that job-sharing teachers may be employed to work in a substitute capacity during the period they are rostered off. The limits on substitute work applying to teachers on career break has also been temporarily suspended. The Teaching Council made regulations allowing for the registration of third year and fourth year undergraduate student teachers under a new registration route, route 5 for student teachers. The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has agreed to a waiver of pension abatement for retired teachers returning to teach for up to 50 days in each of the three calendar years up to 2023. The Department has put in place a scheme to allow post-primary teachers to teach in their subject area over the usual limit of 22 hours per week up to a maximum of 20 additional hours per term. There are a number of other measures and more will be taken if necessary.</p>

          <p eId="para_299">The European Commission has called for a different approach to breast cancer detection. A key recommendation is to extend breast cancer screening to include women between the ages of 45 and 74. In Ireland the screening process for women is between the ages of 50 and 69. A total of 23% of all women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer are between the ages of 20 and 50. Will the Minister confirm that the Government will consider the recommendation of the European Commission to lower the screening age for breast cancer?</p>

          <p eId="para_301">Last week we had the visit of President von der Leyen. She gave an inspirational speech in which she highlighted the importance of Ireland's voice in Europe. She said that when Ireland speaks Europe listens. Last week the CEO of Ryanair came before the transport committee and outlined that if implemented the open skies European policy would deliver an emissions dividend of 20% to the European aviation sector and would achieve a 90% reduction in flight delays. To do this what is required is a cohesive and integrated air traffic control system throughout Europe. This is not being delivered because of vested interests primarily in France and Germany. Will the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications and the Department of Transport take a lead and let Ireland's voice be heard in Europe on delivering the open skies policy? We have heard a lot about reducing the herd number in Ireland. It would be viable for the Department to chase a 20% reduction in aviation emissions.</p>

          <p eId="para_303">Christmas can be hell for parents whose children are in State care. In the Gallery the Minister will see mothers and grandparents who have not seen their children in years. Tusla has blocked reunification every step of the way. Last week Jacinta Swan from Clarecare told the committee on children that parents describe the experience of having a child taken into care as something similar to a death in the family. The Chair of the committee, Deputy Funchion, told the meeting she has not seen a reunification of family and child in her time in Leinster House since 2009. In September 2019 the Taoiseach, who is the Minister's constituency colleague, questioned the Minister with responsibility for children on an extensive report of the Alliance of Birth Mothers Campaigning for Justice on what Tusla is doing to them. All requests from the alliance to meet the Taoiseach have been rebutted. He has refused to meet it. Will the Minister ask the Taoiseach to meet them before he leaves office. Do we have to wait for another generation for the State to acknowledge the damage being done by the State, by Tusla, the Garda Síochána and other agencies? Will the Taoiseach meet the alliance?</p>

I think the interests of the child are paramount. What we should be working towards is that there is reunification, particularly at Christmas when people deserve to spend time with their families, but on the proviso that what is paramount first and foremost is what is in the interests of the child. We have to respect the work that Tusla does. It is operationally independent. What we should work towards is that there is reunification and that parents get to spend time with their children at Christmas. I will ask the Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, to engage with the group the Deputy has referred to.</p>

          <p eId="para_305">Due to the delay in processing applications for the defective concrete blocks grant scheme homeowners have been told by Revenue they are not eligible for the exemption from local property tax because their applications have not yet been processed. Homeowners were assured they would be exempt from local property tax if their home was affected by mica. It is through no fault of their own that the processing of applications has come to a standstill. Homeowners have been left in limbo and are expected to pay tax on homes that are crumbling around them. This is unacceptable and unfair. Affected homeowners are paying enough for the mistakes of others and they should not be expected to pay any more. Will the Minister refund the local property tax to mica homeowners once their applications are processed? Will he also consider including and extending the local property tax exemption when bringing forward legislation on a redress scheme for building defects?</p>

As Deputy Devlin knows discussions have been under way for quite some time between the HSE and the Department of Health with the relevant bodies, namely, the IMO and the Irish Hospital Consultants Association. I have been briefed as to the current state of play. The Cabinet committee has also discussed the matter. Discussions are now at a very advanced stage. We hope there will be a successful outcome because we want to move ahead with the new contract that gives primacy to the treatment of public patients in our public hospitals.</p>

          <p eId="para_309">Wholesale electricity prices fell sharply last month by 52%. The temporary business energy support scheme is great. It gives businesses up to €10,000 in supports where their electricity costs increase by 50% and they get 40% back. These wholesale electricity price reductions are not being passed on to the end consumer. We are facing into a very cold spell and a severe winter when people will be using more electricity. Has the Government had an opportunity to engage with the regulator to examine the constructs of the contracts with the energy providers to see whether we can pass on the reduction? There was a 52% reduction in wholesale electricity prices last month and 27% the previous month. We must see a reduction for the end consumer particularly as we face this winter period.</p>

          <p eId="para_310">I thank Deputy O'Donnell who has raised a question in which many consumers throughout the country will be interested on feeding through reduced wholesale gas prices to the domestic electricity and gas prices charged to households and businesses in Ireland. As the Deputy knows, pricing is a matter for the companies themselves. He can be assured the Minister, Deputy Ryan, the Department and the CRU are in ongoing engagement on this issue and with the companies themselves, while recognising the fact that setting the prices is a commercial matter for the companies themselves. In many cases we are dealing with futures contracts that have been entered into.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">In some cases, the high wholesale prices were locked in for a period. It might, therefore, take a while for the reduced prices to come through at consumer level but we all want to see that happen as quickly as possible. </p>

          <p eId="para_312">I recently met with residents who are living near Dublin Airport. They tell me that Dublin Airport is in breach of its planning permission and that residents who have never before been under the flight path are now experiencing noisy, low-flying planes daily. In the run-up to the building of the new runway, clear sites were identified that would be in the flight path and there was engagement with those residents. There is now a new cohort of families who are experiencing this noisy nightmare every day. We warned Fianna Fáil at the time that there would be issues if they pushed ahead in supporting the Fine Gael plan to have the noise regulated by a division of Fingal County Council and this has come to pass.</p>
          <p eId="para_313"> The Minister for Transport, Deputy Éamon Ryan, has received a lot of correspondence on this. The issues have been outlined to him and he knows what is happening. Will the Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, ask the Minister for Transport to urgently engage with the Dublin Airport Authority to ensure that the airport sticks to the terms of its planning permission?</p>

          <p eId="para_315">I want the Minister to picture this chaos. Last Saturday night, which was a normal Saturday night, 11 ambulances were forced to queue outside Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda. There was not a single bed or trolley available in the emergency department. Some ambulance crews had to keep patients in the ambulance for up to five hours. They could not respond to any other 999 calls. There was not a single ambulance crew available for the entire region. This was no fault of the ambulance crew. It was normal Saturday night when these chaotic and frightening scenes took place.</p>
          <p eId="para_316"> Next Monday, the Government will bulldoze ahead with the plan to divert ambulances from Our Lady’s Hospital, Navan, to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda. The consultant body in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda has said that it will be unsafe, that patient safety will be compromised and that patients may die. That is from the medical professionals. Will the Minister listen to the medical professionals or will he listen to the HSE, which is prepared to bulldoze with this-----</p>

          <p eId="para_319">My understanding is that the change that will come into effect on 12 December is that the patients who are acutely ill will no longer be brought to Navan by ambulance. Instead, they will be taken to the nearest appropriate hospital, depending on their condition. That is different from the full ambulance bypass protocol that had been proposed. The Minister has engaged on this, and it is only in certain narrow circumstances. I suggest that the Deputy engages with the Minister and the HSE on that important operational issue. However, it is the wholesale bypass that was proposed.</p>

The average time for this to happen in Ireland is 541 days. Orphan drug approval in Denmark takes 249 days whereas in Ireland it takes 870 days. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, is doing a good job in assessing the medication, but it appears that we are not able to assess them or send them on to the next step for approval under the drugs refund scheme in a timely manner. Will serious consideration be given to reviewing the process that is currently in place? The health committee produced a report back in 2018 but it has not been acted on.

          <p eId="para_324">I would like to ask about the proposed section 21(3) of the sale of the alcohol Bill 2022, which deals with the issues that are facing publicans in this country around the value of their licences. I am hearing repeatedly from publicans in my own area, particularly those I met recently in Mitchelstown in north Cork, about the huge concerns within the Vintners Federation of Ireland and within this trade about the future value of their licences. Unfortunately, the proposed changes will have huge impacts on family publicans and the Government needs to look at this issue to see if there is a fairer way of protecting the value of licences. As it currently stands, if one wants to buy a licence, one has to be extinguished as a consequence. The deregulation will impact this and could cost family-run pubs this country hundreds of thousands of euros. There has been a significant decline in valuations over the past 15 years and it is something we must protect for rural Ireland.</p>

Currently, the council has 74 houses that are not in the programme for repair because they require an estimated €2.7 million to do the repairs and to bring them back into use. It was reported in November that the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage has an underspend of €500 million.

This is an amazing situation. On two occasions this year, the HSE has issued press statements saying that it will do things and saying that it has had the authority of the Minister when it did not. The Minister has had to wrap the HSE on the knuckles and stop what it is doing. It is out of control. My worry, as the chair the Save Navan Hospital campaign, is that the space for some bypass of the emergency department will be extended and abused by the HSE. Is it not time that the executive was brought to book? Is it not time that the management of the HSE, who are disrespecting the authority of the Minister are sacked?</p>

It could well be the case that the HSE is finding it difficult to get the staff through an agency or directly-employed HSE staff. However, we will follow up on that case. A note has been taken on it.

From 12 December, the existing ambulance bypass protocols in place for Navan will be updated to address urgent patient safety matters for patients who are critically or seriously unwell, or likely to deteriorate. Contrary to some reports, the emergency department in Navan will not close this month. From 12 December, patients who are acutely ill will no longer be brought to Navan by ambulance. Instead, they will be taken to the nearest appropriate hospital, depending on their condition. This is an important patient safety measure and will help minimise delays in providing life-saving treatment to acutely ill patients. However, it is not the wider ambulance bypass protocol that had been suggested.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Deputy James Browne)<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T15:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_346">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_347"> I am pleased to have the opportunity to present the Gambling Regulation Bill to the House. I know there is significant support to progressing this landmark legislation and I look forward to hearing Members' contributions. Today is a true milestone for this long-awaited Bill. This is important and necessary legislation and reform designed to meet the challenges of gambling responsibly in 21st-century Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_348"> The advent of the Internet has wrought considerable and rapid changes to gambling activity, with more ease of access to gambling than we could ever have thought possible. Everyone, including children, can now carry a mobile casino on the phone in their back pockets. It is, therefore, vital for all concerned, both the individuals who partake in gambling and the companies which provide such activities and services, to have a robust regulatory framework with public safety as a cornerstone. The Bill takes a responsible approach to balancing the freedom to gamble with the safeguards to protect people from falling prey to addiction. It provides a clear framework for operators and consumers. Importantly, it is intended to help to protect children and prevent harm to people vulnerable to problem gambling.</p>
          <p eId="para_349"> The primary objective of the Bill is to present the framework for a robust regulatory and licensing regime for the gambling sector in Ireland. It provides for the establishment and statutory functions of a body to be known as údarás rialála cearrbhachais na hÉireann, the gambling regulatory authority of Ireland. The Bill aims to ensure gambling is conducted in a fair and open way for companies to make decisions with certainty. It will require safeguards to address problem gambling, including protecting children and addressing gambling advertising, and prevent gambling from being a source or support to crime. I am hopeful, with the support of both Houses, this Bill will be signed into law and enter into force by mid-2023, with the intention of establishing the authority later next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_350"> As part of the Government's commitment to establish a gambling regulator, in September this year, Ms Anne Marie Caulfield was appointed CEO-designate of the authority. Ms Caulfield is working closely with my Department to identify staffing and resourcing needs and to develop procedures for how the authority will function once it is operational. Ms Caulfield's ongoing preparatory work, in parallel with the passage of the Gambling Regulation Bill, will ensure the authority will be ready to hit the ground running once it is formally established. A phased commencement will be necessary in light of the scale and complexity of the transitional and operational arrangements for a new licensing and regulatory regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_351"> I am conscious that many people have strong views on the issue of gambling and Deputies will appreciate that there is a balance of interests and considerations in this legislation. The size of the gambling industry in Ireland is more than €6 billion annually, with an impact economically and for employment. Furthermore, gambling activity is an important fundraising activity for many of our charitable and local community organisations. l know many people occasionally gamble as a form of entertainment and for most people, it is nothing more than that. However, I am deeply cognisant of the fact that it has been shown that some of our population, in common with populations globally, are involved in gambling to a problematic degree. The side-effects bring poverty, worry and crime, as well as damage to families and personal relationships. The Health Research Board, HRB, in its report published earlier this year, has pointed to key trends in gambling prevalence in Ireland. The gambling industry is large, complex and technologically advanced. Furthermore, the necessity to counter illicit activities such as money laundering and terrorism must be paramount.</p>
          <p eId="para_352"> Given these factors, it is vital to establish an appropriately empowered regulatory body. This Bill seeks to provide safeguards to ensure a balance of appropriate regulation of operators and to protect against those who are vulnerable to problem gambling. It is important to highlight that the strategic approach of this Bill is that key regulatory controls are devolved to the most effective layer of authority. This level of subsidiarity will ensure an effective and empowered statutory body with ministerial, Government and Oireachtas oversight to an appropriate and proportionate degree. This will empower the authority to operate with agility with regard to licensing and regulation. This is critical in light of the scale, complexity and rapidity of developments in the gambling industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_353"> As Members will know, the general scheme of the Gambling Regulation Bill was approved by the Government on 15 October 2021. Pre-legislative scrutiny was undertaken by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice which issued its report in May 2022.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">I have considered each of the recommendations made by that committee in the development of this Bill and while we may not get to address each point today, I look forward to ongoing engagement as we progress the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_355"> At this point, I wish to bring the following issues to the Dáil's attention. Regulation of the national lottery will not come under the remit of this Bill at this time. It is provided for in the National Lottery Act 2013 and has its own regulator. Part 9 of the Electoral Reform Act 2022, where it provides for lottery fundraising by political parties, will remain unaffected by the Bill. Excise matters are outside the remit of the Bill. The Bill will require notification to the European Commission under the technical standards directive as it provides for the power of the authority to impose legal obligations regarding technical standards in relation to gambling products and gambling-related services.</p>
          <p eId="para_356"> I will now outline the main provisions of the Bill. Part 1 is about preliminary and general matters. It contains standard provisions dealing with the Short Title and key definitions. It is important to note that further provision is required to ensure appropriate transitional arrangements are made for persons licensed under current arrangements. Work on this is under way and will be brought forward in Government amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> Part 2 provides for the establishment, statutory functions and funding of the authority. It will be operationally independent but subject to appropriate oversight. There will be seven members of the authority, including its chairperson. The Bill provides for the key role of the authority's chief executive in the day-to-day management of the organisation. In line with the recommendation arising from pre-legislative scrutiny, the Bill provides for the establishment and operation of a national gambling exclusion register to allow persons to register with the authority to exclude themselves from gambling online with licensees. The Bill provides for the establishment of a social impact fund. It will be financed by mandatory contributions, calculated annually on each licensee's turnover. However, such contributions will not be levied on charitable or philanthropic licensees. Its purposes are to finance research and related initiatives to address compulsive and excessive gambling, support awareness-raising and educational measures and support problem gambling treatment activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_358"> Part 3 sets out criteria for ineligibility to become a member of a relevant office, along with provisions on disqualification and removal. It sets out standard provisions regarding non-disclosure of confidential information and provides for an offence of providing false or misleading information. It provides for the restriction of rights and obligations under the data protection regulation and an amendment to the Freedom of Information Act 2014.</p>
          <p eId="para_359"> Part 4 provides for a number of prohibitions and creates related offences. A person who provides a gambling activity without a licence shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable on conviction to imprisonment and-or a fine at the discretion of the courts. The authority will be empowered to apply for various court orders such as to block Internet service provision of a prohibited gambling activity and to block financial payments to unlicensed providers. A court may also order that a gambling licence held by the licensee in question be suspended or revoked.</p>
          <p eId="para_360"> Part 5 deals with licensing of gambling activities. The Bill provides for the authority to manage a modern, streamlined system of licensing gambling activities in the State to replace the outdated and fragmented regime currently in place. As the Bill progresses, the Government will seek to ensure that the proposed licensing framework is as comprehensive as possible for the authority to fulfil its mandate. Part 5 provides for new betting licences to replace the existing bookmakers' licences and totalisator licences and a new gaming licence to replace gaming permits and licences. The authority may specify the types of games and activities that may be provided under a gaming licence. In addition, this Part also provides for a register of licensees to be maintained by the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_361"> The Bill provides for a new lottery licence to replace lottery permits and licences currently provided under the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956 to cover, for example, activities such as lotteries, raffles and bingo. The Bill provides for a new type of licence that permits gaming, betting and lottery activities for fundraising for charitable or philanthropic purposes, such as local sports clubs and good causes. There is also provision for a new type of licence to allow for once-off lotteries of prizes of up to €360,000 in value for both commercial and charitable or philanthropic purposes. Persons who sell or supply gambling products, or who provide supporting or related services, will be licensed. The maximum stake and prize limits, broadly in line with current limits provided for in the 1956 Act, for each of the activities permitted under a licence are set out in Schedule 3 to the Bill. These amounts may be varied by the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_362"> Part 5 also provides for two exemptions from holding a gambling licence, for charitable or philanthropic purposes where the value of the total prizes does not exceed €2,000 or for marketing purposes where the value of the total prizes does not exceed €5,000. To further the protection of children, Part 5 also provides that in considering an application for a licence, when determining the suitability of a premises from which to provide gambling, the authority must consider the proximity of the premises to schools and if gambling is offered elsewhere in the area. The authority is obliged to consult the relevant local authority and the authority's assessment of a premises will not supersede the role of a local authority in determining planning permission.</p>
          <p eId="para_363"> This Part also empowers the authority to set standards for gambling machines and software, related services such as their maintenance and upgrade and the certification of certain types of gambling equipment by the authority. The Bill provides for the establishment and maintenance, by certain licensees, of segregated customer accounts. This is an important safeguard for the public, built in to ensure appropriate governance and accounting in respect of funds.</p>
          <p eId="para_364"> Part 6 deals with obligations on licensees and other persons. This Part includes critical safeguard provisions about the protection of children, advertising of gambling, inducements and promotions, payment methods and the protection of participants in gambling. The Bill contains fundamental provisions to protect children from gambling, including the prohibition on allowing a child to gamble, prohibition on allowing a child to be on a premises, protections in connection with remote gambling, and prohibition of employing children in gambling activity. Part 6 provides for a prohibition of advertising that appeals, or is intended to appeal, to children. The Bill does not provide for an outright ban on gambling advertising or sponsorship.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> Any advertising that promotes excessive or compulsive gambling, or seeks to misrepresent any perceived social or financial benefits of gambling, shall be prohibited. To address the proliferation of gambling advertising on social media, it is intended that persons may only receive gambling advertising where they opt in to receiving it on an on-demand or media sharing platform or in the case of social media, only where a person subscribes to such services and platforms and gives consent to receiving such advertising. Importantly, the Bill provides for a watershed prohibiting the broadcast of gambling advertising on television and radio between the hours of 5.30 a.m. and 9 p.m. The Bill also provides for a wide-ranging power to allow the authority to prescribe the times, places and events where gambling advertising can be broadcast, displayed or published, and to specify the frequency, duration and number of advertisements.</p>
          <p eId="para_366"> Part 6 includes several measures to address sponsorship and the supply of branded clothing and merchandise by gambling licensees. This Part provides for a new offence where a licensee offers any form of inducement to a person to encourage the person to gamble or to continue to gamble. This includes the offer of hospitality or VIP treatment, free bets or favourable treatment or better odds to entice a person to gamble. Also of note, this Part provides that following consultation with the authority, regulations may be made to limit or prohibit the offer of promotions by licensees that directly or indirectly encourage the public at large to gamble.</p>
          <p eId="para_367"> Part 6 also includes a number of measures to protect people while gambling, including a ban on the use of credit cards or the offer of credit facilities. There is to be a prohibition on facilities to withdraw cash at certain licensee's premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_368"> Part 7 deals with complaints. This Part sets out the procedures for a complaint to be made to the authority and the actions the authority can take in relation to an alleged contravention by a licensee of a relevant obligation.</p>
          <p eId="para_369"> Part 8 deals with compliance with and enforcement of obligations of licensees. This Part provides for key elements of the authority's regulatory regime, namely, its statutory powers in respect of compliance and enforcement. Where non-compliance is identified, and in determining what course of action to take, the authority will consider a range of factors, including the nature and gravity of the failure to comply. The authority will appoint authorised officers whom the authority may direct to undertake investigations. Following consideration of an authorised officer's final report on an investigation, the authority may take a number of courses of action, including referring the report to an adjudication officer for independent consideration. Adjudication officers will have extensive powers, including being empowered to hold oral hearings, call and question witnesses and request submissions or information from relevant parties. Where an adjudication officer decides that a licensee is, or has been, in contravention of a relevant obligation, one or more administrative sanctions may be imposed, subject to the exercise of a right of appeal by the licensee or confirmation by court on application by the authority. These sanctions are a financial penalty, suspension of a gambling licence, revocation of a gambling licence or imposition of a condition on a gambling licence. The amount of a financial penalty imposed as an administrative sanction shall not exceed €20 million or, if greater, 10% of the turnover of the licensee in the financial year.</p>
          <p eId="para_370">This Part also provides for the authority to apply to the court for emergency orders in respect of licensees where the authority considers there is an urgent need to act in order to protect the public from the serious consequences of an ongoing contravention of a relevant obligation by a licensee or to protect relevant funds in a segregated customer account.</p>
          <p eId="para_371"> Part 9 provides for a range of appeals to be made by licensees in respect of decisions made by the authority. Appeals may be made, as provided, to an appeals panel or to the Circuit Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_372"> Ireland has been waiting a long time for this legislative reform. It would be remiss of me not to note the contribution of my predecessor, Deputy David Stanton, and his efforts to advance this matter and the development of this Bill. I am also grateful to my officials, the Attorney General and his team, and the many others who contributed to this Bill. It is a detailed Bill and covers many complex issues in a flexible, forward-thinking and principled manner. It has the potential to bring about considerable benefit and clarity for operators, consumers and the wider public. I commend it to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ThomasGould" eId="spk_125">
          <from>Deputy Thomas Gould<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T15:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_373">I begin by acknowledging this Bill is a huge step forward. It has taken 14 years to get here. It is unfortunate that, once again, we have complex legislation being pushed through ahead of Christmas. I hope the Government will give us time to debate, analyse and strengthen this legislation because we recognise it is badly needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_374"> We must recognise the men and women across the island of Ireland who highlighted the harm caused by gambling. We are here because these men and women refused to allow this harm to continue. There are potentially 55,000 people in this State engaged in harmful gambling behaviour, according to the latest Health Research Board data. Each of these people has a family, friends, colleagues and a community who are also affected. The number of young people engaged in gambling who are at risk of harm is one in five. That is a shocking statistic and it highlights just how far we must go to tackle it. I hope this Bill, coupled with proper resources for addiction and recovery sector, can see us start to reduce the harm caused by gambling in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_375"> There are a few important sections of the Bill I wish to address before outlining areas where we want to see change and where it is needed. The establishment of the gambling regulatory authority is momentous. I note the new CEO took up her position recently. I hope she is doing well and I wish her all the best in her role. We hope she will do great work. The ability of the authority to respond to national and international trends will be a huge asset and one I hope she will utilise.</p>
          <p eId="para_376"> Online gambling is, as the Minister of State mentioned, a space that is constantly shifting, evolving and changing. We need to see a proactive, responsive regulator that can move with the times. The establishment of the social impact fund will finally see gambling addiction services resourced properly. As the HSE currently provides no funding for services specific to gambling addiction-specific, the fund will be of huge benefit. I hope we see the full roll-out of education programmes in schools and sports clubs to educate young people and their role models. We recently saw the issue with an industry-funded organisation educating young people on the dangers of alcohol. We face the same risk with the Gambling Awareness Trust and we must nip this in the bud now. We need education provided completely free of any interference by the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_377"> I will highlight a number of the changes we want to see. Sections 28 and 29 deal with the authority's annual report and the three-year strategy. I would like to see this strengthened to include deliverable actions. We saw this with the national drugs strategy and while there was a lot of disappointment at the failure to deliver, the actions allowed for transparency and monitoring of the objectives. That is good and positive in that we can see what the objectives are and whether they are being delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_378"> Chapter 4 establishes the social impact fund. This, as I have said, is a step forward but I would like to see more done on the regulator's ability to recognise that some gambling offerings are inherently more risky than others and that some companies engage in more harmful behaviour than others. New Zealand has a provision in its legislation to recognise this in its social impact fund and this is reflected in the contributions paid by those companies. We should be looking internationally at where things are done best and trying to replicate them in our legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_379"> I welcome that my provision to ban credit cards is reflected in section 157. However, I caution that when working with the Office of the Parliamentary Legal Adviser on this legislation, a loophole was found that needs to be closed. It relates to the use of online media such as Revolut to gamble with a credit card. I ask the Minister of State to consider including this provision because we all want the Bill to be as strong as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_380"> I have a number of concerns about the establishment of the board. I am sure the House is aware that the housing committee is currently dealing with serious concerns about another State board. We must ensure we create an authority here that is watertight, transparent and fair. I appreciate the need for industry representatives to be on the authority but we should give statutory responsibility to the Minister to ensure this representation does not outweigh the voice of experts, academics, service providers and those with lived experience who put harm reduction at the core of their work. We must not see an authority run by the industry and we must ensure and take all necessary steps to protect against that.</p>
          <p eId="para_381"> A number of appointment criteria are outlined in section 15(4). Lived experience is not included and this is an oversight. Sinn Féin's all-island recovery charter recognises the right of those in recovery to participate in change-making and decision-making. Their voices need to be heard. They are the people who have the lived experience and, with it, the knowledge we need and which the authority needs to use. I ask the Minister of State to include the expertise sought for the authority and consider lived experience in gambling addiction. This gives us an opportunity to ensure all policies of the authority are reflective of the reality on the ground.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> We must do everything we can to impact the board and make it as open and transparent as possible. We must see a proactive, responsive board that can work with all stakeholders to properly regulate this industry because for too long gambling and gambling-related harm have been hidden behind closed doors. I hope the debate on this legislation today and in future will act as a catalyst for the conversation in our schools, sports clubs and even bookmakers. That conversation on how we reduce harm and recognise harmful behaviours is long overdue. Parents must have this conversation with their children and families across the board need to have an open and frank discussion about it. Unlike many other addictions, there are no physical signs of gambling addiction but, just as with others, it can destroy lives and rip families apart. The impact of gambling on families is often overlooked.</p>
          <p eId="para_383">The regulatory authority, when established, would ensure a portion of the social fund would go towards family supports. Watching a loved one spiral into addiction, often damaging the finances and emotions of those around them, is traumatising. Trauma breeds addiction and we need to try to address this. A Sinn Féin Government would make sure these conversations are happening. We would start them in every corner of society in the hope that people who are struggling in the dark right now could come out and walk tall with regard to their problems. They need to get help. I hope this authority and the work we are going to do will help to provide that. I hope the Minister of State has listened to some of the points I have made today and will consider these changes. We are looking forward to working constructively with the Government on this because we believe the only way to protect those 55,000 people in this State and their families is by having a strong gambling regulator and a strong Bill that provides the support necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_384"> On Monday, a gentleman came into my clinic who told me how he had lost his family, his partner, his two children and his extended family and was homeless. This man is working. He has a good job but he is in the throes of addiction. That is why it is so important that we get this legislation right.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaDaly" eId="spk_126">
          <from>Deputy Pa Daly<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_385">I will start with a procedural point. This Bill was announced as being approved by the Cabinet on 15 November, yet it took a full two weeks for a copy to materialise. We had pre-legislative scrutiny on detailed heads of the Bill but as we all know, the final version of a Bill can be much different. It would be better if the Government only announced Bills as being ready for approval when a full version can accompany that announcement. It would give staff time to prepare to consult stakeholders and so on. We would also be better able to field queries from constituents, as outlined by Deputy Gould, when legislation is announced. I appreciate that there is usually not a long delay but if the Government is to generate publicity off the back of a Bill, the actual wording being available is a reasonable expectation.</p>
          <p eId="para_386"> An overhaul of the regulation of gambling in this State is long overdue. According to the Health Research Board, HRB, an estimated 12,000 adults in Ireland are problem gamblers and a further 125,000 are considered to be at-risk gamblers. In addition, the study showed that more than one in ten men who have gambled in the last year are either at-risk or problem gamblers. This figure increases to one in five in younger cohorts. Finally, the HRB states that at-risk and problem gambling appears to be more strongly associated with poorer socioeconomic status and living in deprived areas. The risks are devastating, as we know. As elected Deputies, I am sure we are all aware of local constituents who have suffered greatly as a result of gambling, whether that is because of debt or sometimes taking their own lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_387"> No one is denying anyone the right to have the odd flutter on occasion. A legal and properly regulated gambling industry is important to stave off the involvement of organised crime. However, the key is regulation. The expansion of online gambling and the constant innovation of products in the sector means the State is in a race to protect the vulnerable. The regulation of online gambling, including the banning of bets at certain times, or at least the identification of patterns of betting that indicate someone is at risk, is important. The draft heads of Bill placed a number of obligations on providers in relation to this and I notice these are now absent from the Bill. The gambling exclusion register is a positive development but by the time someone has made an application, their losses could be significant. Anecdotally, we have heard of a lot of people losing money in the early hours of the morning when they are coming home and have alcohol taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_388"> It is not acceptable that the online operators can utilise the great amount of information they have on customers, through algorithms and so on, to infinitely expand their business without being compelled to use that information to prevent great losses being racked up, especially for those who have finite resources. That information also puts the online sector at an inherent advantage compared to the traditional retail bookmaker. A levy that reflects that would level the playing field. The work of my colleague Deputy Gould in this area, including his Private Members' Bill to ban credit card betting, should be commended. People who work in the industry have suggested that a tax levied on online deposits might also have some effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_389"> Public awareness and gambling addiction treatment should also be discussed alongside the Bill. The social fund is a welcome addition here but there needs to be a sea change alongside it. The treatment of gambling addiction is frequently linked to mental health. While the link is undoubtedly strong, gambling addiction is a specific issue too. We are beginning to get a handle on how to treat those with other addictions. Research into gambling addiction specifically should be the result of it. Again, this is something the Bill covers. A specific public awareness campaign free of industry influence would be important. Being "gambling aware" does little to help those with addiction. They could not be more aware of it if they tried. Supporting them in getting away from gambling is what we need to do. Supports and campaigns must be free of industry influence. The social impact fund will hopefully be a useful firewall for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> I note that football now dominates bets placed here. Nearly all Premier League teams are dominated by the industry and betting companies. The funding to sports needs to reflect this as the social dividend from the elite levels of the game, supported by the industry, does not trickle down to the grassroots. For many local sports clubs, lotteries, bingo and even World Cup draws can be incredible fundraisers when run by clubs and leagues. We have received a few representations from bingo halls recently about their unique status. That is a subject to which we will return on Committee Stage. Regulatory costs must be borne by those most able to bear them, and smaller clubs and associations must not be completely discouraged from solid fundraising opportunities. The credit union sector, for example, has been regulated heavily, and understandably so, but we need to be mindful that regulations can have unintended consequences that we cannot foresee.</p>
          <p eId="para_391"> Other improvements over pre-legislative scrutiny include the removal of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's ability to reclaim surpluses from the social impact fund. The provisions around age verification look to have been improved also, as there is a current issue with some sites where gambling can proceed before age verification is complete. This is wrong. The less ambiguity there is within legislation, the better. There are a number of other issues within the Bill but we intend to cover those on Committee Stage.</p>

          <from>Deputy Aodhán Ó Ríordáin<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T16:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_392">I wish to give credit to the Minister of State and the work he has done here. He gave a commitment that this legislation would be brought before the House and he has been true to his word. Often in politics, people in his position do not get any praise whatsoever so I will say that much. It can be difficult to wade through all the different responsibilities, find the time to engage with all the stakeholders, produce a piece of legislation and bring it before the Oireachtas. I give credit to the Minister of State for what he has done. With the safe passage of this Bill and with the amendments we hope to bring forward, we will hopefully repair and enhance lives. The Minister of State has been articulating this for quite some time and it is quite clear that in the Bill we are recognising, after many years, the need for strict regulation in this sphere. I congratulate the Minister of State on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_393"> I also pay tribute to my own colleagues. Senator Mark Wall has spoken about gambling possibly more than any other issue since he came into the Oireachtas. He has been speaking on it regularly, he has published his own legislation around it and he has been engaging with stakeholders. I pay tribute to him and to Deputy Howlin, who took part in the pre-legislative scrutiny element of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> It is remarkable, when observing the history of this area of legislation, just how powerful is the gambling lobby. There used to be a levy of 20% on bets placed in Ireland. I do not know how many other industries have successfully lobbied their way from a levy of 20% down to what was 1% and is now 2%.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">It is also remarkable that the wider lobby of interest groups has managed to ensure the levy on gambling goes exclusively to a fund which is disproportionately spent on prize money people bet to get their hands on. It is bizarre on one level that the levy funds an industry that encourages people to bet. The levy has not heretofore benefited anyone with a gambling addiction. It has not benefited any entity that might provide a different route for young people to stay away from gambling. It does not do anything in the health or education spheres. Every cent of the levy on gambling goes to the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund. Some 80% of that is for the horse racing industry, of which the vast bulk goes to prize money. Approximately €45 million of tax-free prize money was presented by the taxpayer to the horse racing industry last year on the backs of bets placed on everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> When I say this to people in meetings, they are always perplexed by it. They ask how it happened. It is not only horse racing or greyhound racing bets that accumulate these moneys. Any bet on anything does. All the levies from bets on politics, football or the weather go straight into the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund. Therefore I suggest to the Minister of State that we should perhaps go back and consider raising the levy to where it was previously. While 20% sounds like a lot, 2% is certainly not enough and what we would accrue from an increased levy should benefit pursuits other than those that have such a culture of betting around them. You cannot hear of a horse racing in a race without hearing the price of a bet on that horse. You cannot hear about a greyhound meet without betting being referenced. It is almost unique in the sporting sphere in that when we hear about these sporting occasions, betting on them is front and centre of the commentary. It is a little perplexing how the gambling levy and that industry are completely intertwined.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> As has been said, it is hard to watch any kind of sporting event in the current context without being bombarded with gambling advertising. It is true of television, radio and online. There was a time, when I was younger, when there was some kind of social control on betting. Bets had to be placed in a bookie's office which were only open between certain hours. There was a realisation that people had to physically go to the bookie's office so they had to regulate themselves as to how often they were there, who saw them there, the sense people had of them, how they carried themselves and if they were seen to be in the bookie's office too often. People's families would know if they were in the bookie's office a lot. They had a sense of how a person was spending money or engaging in gambling so they could keep an eye on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> I sound like a very old person making these comments, but the advent of the Internet changed all that. It could now be done online. People no longer had to go to the bookie's office so that social control was more limited. With the advent of the smartphone in the past 15 years or so, that has completely gone out the window. People do not have to worry about social control involved in the physical trip to the bookie's office. No one has to know in any way how, when or how much a person is betting, unless someone has a sense of what is in that person's bank account. People can bet at any hour of the day or night. They can find a way of doing it even if they are children. We are told every hour of the day and night that we should do it. If people have an interest in sport, they are encouraged to bet by the advertisements on the front of the shirts and by entities that sponsor coverage on different broadcasters. It is a swamp that people almost need incredible discipline not to engage in, if they have a phone and are interested in sport in particular.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> A huge amount of what is in this Bill is welcome, including the regulatory authority and the banning of gambling advertising between certain hours. We will be putting down amendments. Second Stage speeches are a general reflection of the state of play. On the gambling advertising restrictions, we must simply go further. I know the Minister of State has listened to various interest groups and is trying to strike a balance. That is fair enough, but to suggest that at 9 o'clock the influence of gambling advertising will be lessened because of who is watching television, listening to the radio or in the online sphere is not realistic. As has been said, if people who have a gambling habit in their life use their phone during their trip home from the pub, they will probably be more influenced by gambling advertising at that hour of the night than they might be at 1 o'clock in the day. We must have the same view of gambling advertising as we once had of cigarette and alcohol advertising. We have to kill it dead. We must move away from the cultural acceptance of a level of gambling noise. Members will be aware of the clever advertising that is done by various bookmakers and gambling companies. It is clever and can be engaging. It can be witty, funny or deliberately offensive, but as the Oireachtas, we must stand up more strongly and say this equates to alcohol and cigarettes because the damage being done is absolutely incalculable. If this is in a person's life, it takes over everything.</p>
          <p eId="para_400"> The Labour Party facilitated a conversation with Oisín McConville, who said that what young people are now going through which is different from what he went through. The secrecy that surrounds it and the methodologies used are dangerous. I do not accept the bona fides of any of these multi-billion euro companies because their job is to screw people out of their money. As Deputy Daly quite rightly stated about BeGambleAware, it is a pathetic nod to something the companies do not really want to happen at all. As a collective political body, we must put the person at the front and centre of what we are trying to do and put protections in place for the person, for the person's family and for children who will be influenced by this. The world is very different from what it was like when I was a child, when the bookie's office was a place we might go once a year to place a bet on the Grand National. Now it is all around us, on our phones every hour of day and night. It is destroying families and it will only get worse. I get the sense from this area that we are at the beginning of an epidemic, if we are not already there. It is so silent.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> We will be putting down amendments to strengthen the Bill. The Minister of State is to be congratulated. He flagged this for a long time. He has brought it before the Oireachtas and, in fairness, he has delivered. That is in his favour and needs to be said on the record. It is strong legislation. We feel it could be stronger. The levy on gambling needs to be increased and should fund more than the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund because the ring-fenced nature of that funding deserves massive scrutiny and overhaul. Other sporting entities and pursuits need to be considered. When it comes to the advertising piece, I know the Minister of State has tried to strike a balance, but we need an absolute ban on gambling advertising and sponsorship. They should be treated as dangerous, in the same way as cigarette advertising. If we had that mentality, we might achieve something. I do not agree with this idea that we can open the gates at 9 p.m. because we know, with the money these people have, they will flood our television screens and our radio waves from 9 p.m. onwards. No advertisement other than gambling advertisements will be heard because that is the nature of what they do. </p>
          <p eId="para_402">With those thoughts myself, Senator Mark Wall and other members of the Labour Party are determined to work with the Minister of State to make this more robust. We certainly have a good start because of the Minister of State's work. We will continue to work with him.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#AlanFarrell" eId="spk_128">
          <from>Deputy Alan Farrell<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_403">I welcome the introduction of the Bill and commend the Minister of State and the Department for the work they have done. It is an important step in curbing the issue of problem gambling and will allow for greater regulation of the gambling market. It is not a new phenomenon unfortunately. It has become a ubiquitous part of sport in Ireland, whether it is horse racing or field sports such as rugby, GAA or others. Even general elections are not exempt from the gambling advertisers: the Minister of State should consider passing an amendment to ensure that those who win on such bets should pass a portion of it on to the candidate on whom they won. I can think of a couple of people who have won significant sums on me over the years and never so much as bought me a pint. They shall remain nameless for the purposes of this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> For many people gambling is an infrequent affair. Many enjoy a punt on various events throughout the year. However, there was always a significant group of people who were vulnerable to developing an addiction to gambling. This is compounded by the advent of smart phones and gambling apps. Anyone can bet in almost any sort of sporting event in the world from the comfort of their own home with the press of a button. That allows some people to gamble far more than they should and far more than should be deemed responsible. Sadly it allows for some to gamble their way into financial ruin affecting their livelihoods and those of their families. The pace at which these scenarios can be reached is breath-taking. Moreover, it also affects young people, many of whom fall victim to gambling addiction at an early age. That can have a long-lasting effect on their lives. Therefore, this Bill is not only necessary but overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> In regard to the point mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Ó Ríordáin, on the sponsorship of events and championships, I cannot help but agree with him. This is something on which I and other members of the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in the 31st Dáil did a good deal of work in regard to public hearings on the matter. It would be remiss of me not to mention its chairman and current Deputy, David Stanton, who did significant work on this matter. We are at the point where it should not just be children’s sponsorship opportunities that are removed from the possibility of being sponsored by a gambling organisation. It should be removed outright. As Deputy Ó Ríordáin said, and I concur with him, this is as damaging to lives and livelihoods and tobacco and alcohol are. If we are going to remove those two other products from the opportunity to sponsor such events then I believe we should do so outright. I agree with him in that regard. I accept, acknowledge and support the establishment of the Independent Gambling Regulatory Authority as a significant step that will help us bring far more transparency and oversight to the gambling market. The Bill will also allow for the development of a fund to assist those with gambling problems and related matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> However, we should also pay attention to limiting factors that we can implement in order to intervene before someone develops a gambling problem in the first place. Specifically I am speaking with regard to advertising watersheds, restricting online advertising and the location of gambling premises to maintain a distance from young populations such as schools, and to provide prohibition on children working in such environments. I am therefore pleased that this Bill will progress these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> I also welcome the inclusion of the prohibition on the use of credit cards for the purposes of gambling. This is an important inclusion that can limit the ability of vulnerable persons to run up large gambling-related debts. I also wish to draw attention to in-app games, many of which exist in gambling apps. I include the National Lottery app in this particular remark, which I recognise and believe is not included in this Bill. These games frequently require an entry fee to play at varying levels. They also use colourful graphics and a number of sound effects. We all know from whistleblowers in the social media sphere that these are often methods used to get people to return to these particular apps. I believe that more clarity and regulation can be brought to these digital games, which can see people invest significant sums of money in a short amount of time. We must also be aware that there are those who have multiple gambling accounts across different gambling platforms. There is a need for greater co-ordination and co-operation with gambling providers in order to limit the risk to consumers. I recognise this Bill will not solve every aspect of problem gambling. However, with the timely delivery of various sections of this Bill, sufficient resourcing and the implementation of intervention processes as well as educational campaigns across all levels of society about the dangers of problem gambling, we can see the beginning of a real reduction in problem gambling.</p>
          <p eId="para_408"> I commend the Minister of State for his work on the Bill as well as the previous Oireachtas committees which have worked on this area. I have already mentioned my colleague, Deputy Stanton. The Bill will make the gambling sector fairer and more transparent and provide for more regulation. I look forward to its passage into law.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> I impress upon the Minister of State that if the opportunity arises, notwithstanding the significant work that he, the Department and others have done to bring this Bill together, that serious consideration be once and for all brought to bear, legislatively, with regard to the sponsorship of large-scale sporting events and that these insidious and often extremely damaging organisations that are perfectly entitled to sell a product but do not necessarily have to do so in such an “in your face” manner. A study carried out on the premier league in the UK recently found something in the order of 14 television advertisements for betting companies during half time of a popular derby game. That shows how insidious it has become.</p>

        <speech by="#RuairiOmurchu" eId="spk_129">
          <from>Deputy Ruairí Ó Murchú<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T16:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_410">There will be much agreement that this is a good first step. There was an element of waiting decades for this legislation but at this point we need, as mad as it may seem, not to rush it. We need to ensure we cover as many of the loopholes as possible. Many of us know people who suffered from gambling addiction, whether anecdotally, from the work we do in our constituencies or from those we know. I have heard it said many times that you can only drink so much, you can only put so much in your arm or up your nose but when it comes to gambling there are no holds barred. That is not to under-estimate or underplay the impact we have when we deal with those other addictions. However, given the free access people have in regard to gambling, unlike previously when people had to, as Deputy Ó Ríordáin said, regulate themselves to make it down to a particular place to make a punt, unfortunately because of smart phones to which we all have access, you are literally a step away from impoverishing yourself. The Health Research Board, HRB, report talked about 90,000 low-risk gamblers, whatever that means, 35,000 moderate-risk gamblers and 12,000 problem gamblers. We all welcome the moves in regard to the watershed in regard to advertising but a wider conversation is needed in regard to the entanglement of sports, gambling and advertising, and advertising within advertising. Trying to deal with the online sphere is incredibly difficult. Certain tools are now available to us because we are talking about the algorithms that some of the betting companies use to improve their own odds to get the best bang for their buck from some of their punters.End of Take</p>
          <p eId="para_411">We need to be able to reset that game from the point of view of the algorithms being used, as they are in certain jurisdictions, and from the point of view of showing up problem gambling as soon as possible in order that it can be locked down. I understand that it is difficult to have a regulatory framework that can deal with this but that is the world we are in. It is what we are up against and it is what we need to deal with. We all know that from a very young age, children are being conditioned in regard to gambling. Again, we know of the games within games and we know about Roblox and casinos, and all the rest of it. It is way beyond reprehensible. As I said, there has been a huge impact on many lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> We need to make sure we can catch as much as is necessary before the finalised Bill goes through. I hope the Minister is open to what the Opposition is saying and, in particular, to the amendments that will come from this side of the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GaryGannon" eId="spk_130">
          <from>Deputy Gary Gannon<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T16:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_413">I would first like to note that this Bill was published on Friday afternoon. It is simply not acceptable that we would effectively get two working days to look over a Bill of this importance. It is an unfortunate example of how rushed the Government legislative process is coming up to Christmas. I hope that Committee Stage will be taken in the new year so it can be given proper scrutiny. The Minister of State might confirm that when he responds.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> The Bill is largely welcome. It is a big step forward in how the State regulates the gambling industry, which has been patchwork at best for decades. Problem gambling destroys lives, families and communities. To date, we have largely let the gambling industry run rampant throughout the country, with the few restrictions that are currently in place on its operation often being blatantly ignored, unenforced and easily worked around. A ban on casinos, for example, led to private members-only clubs being established, which are effectively casinos with an entrance fee. There are currently 36 in operation around the country, with the highest concentration in Dublin city centre, which is no coincidence. Under section 20 of the Betting Act, there is a ban on bookies displaying a list of the terms or odds for a bet on a particular match. Anyone can easily walk past their nearest bookie to discover how well that law is enforced.</p>
          <p eId="para_415"> The establishment of an independent gambling regulatory authority is welcome and sorely needed. However, gardaí need to play their part in enforcing all of these new regulations because they have not been enforcing those in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> Advertising for gambling is fired at us from every direction all day, every day. It is so commonplace that the rate of ads we see is not apparent until we start looking out for it. Those ads, whether they are the happy, cheery national lottery ads of people installing water slides in their flats or the barrage of Paddy Power ads running up to Cheltenham, all encourage addiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> The impact gambling addiction has on people’s lives is immense: the emptying of someone’s entire bank account or that of their partner and family members, scales of debt that people have no hope of paying off within their lifetime, social isolation, deteriorating physical and mental health, and a suicide risk that is 15 times higher than the average. Gambling addiction, like all other forms of addiction, has been long neglected by our health system. The HSE does not have any specific gambling addiction services. In the UK, the NHS rolled out gambling treatment centres in 2019, and while it is early days, it seems to have been a success story that we should look to emulate. It would be a good target destination for funds collected under the social fund in the Bill. We also need to look at the possibility of debt write-offs for problem gamblers as part of a treatment plan for gambling addiction. These debts hang over people’s heads for years, and the stress and anxiety they cause only reduces the chance of recovery and increases the risk of suicide. I want to know if the Minister has looked into the feasibility of such a proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> We have little data on the rate of problem gambling in Ireland and no regular national survey on gambling behaviour, which is the norm in many other countries. The latest available data suggests that about 31,000 people in Ireland would be considered to have gambling problems. The introduction of an exclusion list for online gambling will be a lifeline for many people who are stuck in the cycle of addiction. However, I do not see the sense in this list being restricted to online gambling. Surely this list could easily be integrated into the software used by bookmakers to log bets?</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> An <i>Irish Times</i> article from last summer reported that Irish gamblers lost approximately €1.36 billion in 2020, which is an average of €300 per person. We have the fourth highest rate of gambling in the EU and we are the 14th highest internationally in average gambling losses. Even more worrying are the statistics on gambling among teenagers. On every metric, 15- and 16-year-olds in Ireland gamble more than teens in the rest of Europe. Some 61% of 15- and 16-year-olds in Ireland had gambled on sports or animals, compared to the EU average of 45%, and 37% had used slot machines, compared to the EU average of 21%. A massive problem is brewing. Teenagers generally will have the disposable income available to them to have major impacts on their finances, and they are learning behaviours that will follow them into adulthood.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> If we are serious about heading off that crisis, we need to seriously tackle advertising, sponsorship, and gambling in video games. The advances the Bill makes in cracking down on betting advertising are genuinely welcome. Having a 9 p.m. watershed for TV and radio ads, no gambling ads on children’s jerseys, no sponsorship for sports teams and venues that cater to children are all great initiatives. Why does the Bill stop there? It feels as if the Government is stopping right at the final hurdle in regulating advertising and sponsorship. There is no doubt a watershed is useful in keeping gambling ads away from children, but it is useless for any child old enough to stay up after 9 p.m. The children who are gambling are the ones we most need to protect.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> Why should we allow TV and radio ads at all? For example, Belgium recently introduced a blanket ban on gambling ads. Has the Government considered this? If not, why is a similar ban not being considered? There is also the point that young people watch increasingly less live TV, meaning that the advertising we really need to be concerned with is that on social media. Social media advertising is much more dangerous in terms of problem gambling behaviour because those social media ads are cynically and purposefully targeted at people whom these companies know are hooked on gambling, or whom they think they can get hooked on gambling. This area needs to be heavily regulated domestically, and the proposed gambling regulatory authority needs to be active on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_422"> The wording of the ban on sponsorship and advertising in sports clubs, organisations, teams and premises that have children as members or cater towards children seems to work out as a near-blanket ban for most sports clubs and venues in the country. Will the Minister of State confirm that or outline how that section will play out in practice, considering most clubs have adult and young people’s team sports? I assume a small number of sports teams and grounds around the country cater exclusively to adults. Even Croke Park and the Aviva Stadium will have children playing matches during half time at senior games. Again, I have to wonder why the Government is choosing to stop there. Why not just have an outright ban on advertising and sponsorship for all sports and premises if it has basically the same effect?</p>
          <p eId="para_423"> The same logic applies to the ban on gambling ads on children’s jerseys. I reiterate that teenagers need to be particularly protected from developing the habit of gambling, and they are not protected at all under the Bill. Most older teenagers will be wearing adult jerseys with gambling ads before they are legally allowed to place a bet. Children who idolise sports stars have posters on their walls of their favourite players wearing a jersey with a gambling ad on it. Why allow them to advertise on jerseys at all? What about a young person on an underage team being asked to step up and play for the senior team? I hope this is not a lacuna that will have an effect on sports clubs themselves. Has a financial assessment been conducted of how sports clubs would fare without that sponsorship? Belgium recently introduced a law to phase out all gambling sponsorships for sports by 2024.</p>
          <p eId="para_424"> Gambling has been completely normalised for children and they link watching sport and gambling as being one and the same. There is quite a bit of research suggesting that if someone has a few early successes, they are much more likely to develop an addiction. We have to be careful about the exposure that children and young people have to gambling behaviour early on.</p>
          <p eId="para_425"> A comprehensive EU study in 2020 concluded that children and young people were learning gambling behaviour from games that sell loot boxes. A similar UK study found consistent associations between the features of buying loot boxes and problem gambling. This is covered in the Bill at all but the Minister of State might cover it in his reply. There seems to be some reluctance from Europe to regulate this area because it will not accept loot boxes as a form of gambling as the rewards are not tangible. The reality is that third party sites do exist where people trade and buy the prizes for money. It should not matter in any case. Regardless of whether a rare outfit or weapon in some game has a real world value, people put a value on it, and they spend money to purchase the loot boxes even if they cannot cash them out through the game itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">The pattern of, in essence, placing a bet for the chance of receiving a reward, with no transparency in respect of the odds of success, is clearly the same pattern as gambling, but with far less regulation than standard betting. We cannot wait around for the gaming industry or Europe to regulate this for us. I ask the Government to seriously consider bringing this under the remit of the regulator.</p>

          <p eId="para_427">I thank and congratulate the Minister of State on this far-reaching Bill. Significant work has gone into it. He has managed to go much further in the Bill than we on the justice committee expected when we did our work in this area. I congratulate him on the Bill, which I know has the opportunity to develop further through the various legislative Stages. In particular, I congratulate him on the provisions in Chapter 3 in respect of notifications, the obligation not to offer inducements, the obligation not to permit children to participate and the sponsorship provisions. Similarly, I congratulate him on Chapters 4 and 5. It goes very far.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> I agree with Deputy Gannon regarding how the Bill could go further in respect of sponsorship and advertising. The Bill contains provisions relating to children up to the age of 18 but the Minister of State and I discussed recently at the justice committee in the context of young people generally how the brain develops up to the age of 25. I know he is considering measures in the context of young people up to the age of 25 in the area of youth justice, for example. Persons up to that age may still be considerably under the influence of suggestive material. Of course, this is difficult because the line between being a child and being an adult has to be drawn somewhere, but research shows that many people, particularly young men, can remain vulnerable up to that age. That point has been highlighted by those working in gambling addiction; I have not based my observations solely on my knowledge of the situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> I wish to highlight a couple of points from the committee recommendations. As the Minister of State will be aware, we on the committee had an extensive engagement with representatives of the gambling industry. In many ways, it was a disappointing engagement. We proactively asked questions in respect of self-exclusion and the management of companies in tracking people they believed may have difficulties, or who had identified as having difficulties. Many of the responses we got focused on the UK operation rather than the Irish one. That was insufficient for our purposes. Some of the companies came back and provided better information but, as Vice Chair of the justice committee, I was struck by how ill-prepared the companies were for that line of questioning, given it is the point of the Bill, and how defensive they were in respect of it. One certainly did not get the sense that it was an issue they were proactively managing or that they were eager to explain to us all the safety measures they had taken. </p>
          <p eId="para_430"> The Regulator of the National Lottery recently came before the Committee of Public Accounts. The matter came up in that context at the committee two weeks ago. We were told the national lottery had erred in a related way. Some 48 people who had self-excluded from using national lottery products, which are just gambling products, of course, were subsequently contacted by the national lottery. The regulator imposed no sanction on the national lottery other than noting the matter in its annual report. It considers that to be a sanction but I do not. We on the committee followed up with questions relating to the number of people who had self-excluded from the national lottery. It appears there were 1,500 exclusions relating solely to national lottery products in 2020 and 1,300 in 2021. I raise that, first, to highlight the Irish context and, second, to show that the national lottery is very much a gambling product as well. Having had that engagement with the national lottery regulator, I was struck by the scale of advertising in which the national lottery and other companies engage, particular during "The Late Late Toy Show". Deputy Gannon also made reference to advertising. I suspect the Minister of State was busy with this or other Bills while "The Late Late Toy Show" was on, but I watched it and I was struck by how it seemed that during every ad break, there was an ad depicting two people passing over a national lottery ticket as a Christmas present. That was one of the first times that the scale of advertising became clear to me having had that recent engagement. The advertising was just related to the national lottery itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> The Minister of State will forgive me for not knowing the technical phrase but there is a betting product whereby one can bet on the outcome of the national lottery. Irrespective of my criticism of the national lottery, no good can come from such a product. At least the national lottery has the good causes provision and transfers funds in that regard. I highlight that to the Minister of State. There is some value in the national lottery version but it is being utterly undermined by that betting product.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> Another relevant piece relating to the advertising spend is that there is a provision for unspent or unawarded prizes in the context of the national lottery. The licence provides that such prizes should be redistributed to other prize funds, and may also be used for advertising. We on the Committee of Public Accounts, however, found that the inverse was true, in that 98% of that funding, totalling approximately €122 million, had been used for additional advertising, while a small amount was used for additional prizes. It occurred to me that we do not have visibility of the advertising spend in various forms of media. What is the actual advertising spend on a lottery product, by the national lottery or otherwise, with RTÉ, for example? What is the advertising spend with a particular group of newspapers or on local radio or wherever else? What capacity is there for mischief in that regard in the reporting of anything to do with those products or companies? Those data may be available to the Minister of State but, if not, that would be interesting research to conduct.</p>
          <p eId="para_433"> On the issue of whether advertising can be banned more broadly, the committee was told that if gambling advertisements were banned, that would result in the closure of more retail betting shops. We were told that almost 50% of the network of betting shops had closed in recent times and that the banning of gambling advertisements would push customers towards other avenues of gambling, such as unlicensed operators. I have no sympathy whatsoever for that argument. It is important to put that on record. We heard similar arguments in respect of smoking bans and other things - how the sky would fall down if these various things were done by the State. Of course, the State can do these things, and go further. Indeed, the Minister of State has gone further in the Bill. I wish to highlight, however, that he should have no fear in continuing to press ahead with the prohibition or regulation of advertising in every context. He should have no fear that the shops will have to close.</p>

          <p eId="para_434">I acknowledge the work of the Minister of State on the Bill. I congratulate him on bringing it to this Stage and fulfilling a commitment he made. I also thank my colleague, an Teachta Gould, and his team for all their work on this issue. Sinn Féin is happy to support the progress of the Bill to Committee Stage. We support the efforts in respect of the regulation of gambling. If anything, it is long overdue, as the Minister of State will acknowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> I have maintained for some time that problem gambling is a serious issue, which particularly impacts on young men. I spent four years raising the issue when I was Sinn Féin spokesperson on health in the previous Dáil. I am not anti-gambling as such, although I fail to see its relevance. I suppose it has some relevance for some people. I assure the House that any observations I have or suggestions I make are solely in the interests of protecting people with problem gambling habits, as well as their family and friends. It is often the case that behind a person who is suffering from and dealing with problem gambling habits there are family, friends and people who can be very damaged by the impact of those habits.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> Research published by H2 Gambling Capital has continuously recorded Ireland as having among the highest gambling losses not only in the EU, but the entire world. That is a shocking statistic. It is estimated that Irish gamblers lost €1.36 billion, or approximately €300 per adult, in 2020. When one considers that many people do not participate in gambling, there are people out there losing money they can barely afford to lose, and many others who are suffering from problem gambling. With the advent of online gambling, the problem has been exacerbated. It was always obvious that, without regulation, vulnerable people were going to suffer.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> Thankfully, many sporting organisations have seen fit to sever ties with gambling companies. I applaud the sporting organisations that have done so because it is difficult to get sponsorship and keep a club going. Fair play to those who say "No" to this type of money and "No" to endorsing gambling and gambling companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">These organisations know this because they have seen at first-hand the damage the gambling industry has done to their members. It is essentially a take, take, take industry. Little, if any, money comes back to the games, particularly grass-roots games, from an industry that profits from sport.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> While I welcome the Bill, it is another case of the Government following the public. The industry should have been regulated a long time ago but it took public testimonies from those who have suffered due to problem gambling. I say "Fair play" to those people for doing it because that is not easy. We have seen documentaries featuring sports stars who have been crushed under the weight of a problem habit, and families and lives that have been torn apart. It is safe for the Government to regulate now that the public are demanding it but it should have taken the lead on this years ago.</p>

          <p eId="para_440">I welcome this legislation. It is long overdue. It is a lengthy Bill at more than 95 pages. I tried to read it but was limited in what I could take in. It is welcome that the Government is regulating an industry that has been largely out of control. Gambling is a big business and big business is gambling. It is worth an enormous amount, not only in Ireland but around the world, and is highly profitable. The problem that most people have with gambling is its insidious nature. We cannot watch any sport, particularly football at present, without seeing advertising relating to gambling. It is everywhere. The advertisements that come with gambling are pervasive and glamorous. To enjoy sporting activity, you have to have a bet on it. That is insidious in how people try to enjoy a sporting event that should be enjoyed. Online betting and gambling companies, however, have made it that people who do not have a stake in sport cannot enjoy it. That is the nature of online gambling.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> Some people will have problematic use of gambling, especially online gambling, because everybody has a mobile phone. It is so easy to make a bet. People do not have to go to a traditional betting shop. They do not have to do that anymore and need never go there again. They can bet a lot of money via apps on their phones. These have become prolific, to say the least. They are everywhere and people can bet on everything. Most people do not win. The real winners are gambling companies. As I said, it is profitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> There are certain weaknesses in the Bill around advertising. There should be blanket ban on gambling companies advertising their industry. I have a major problem regarding how gambling is perceived, portrayed and conducted. There is nothing natural about gambling. People gamble and do not have a problem with it, but there has been very problematic use by those who could have a tendency towards that. There is also a socioeconomic factor to this. We find that people with problematic use come from a poorer socioeconomic background. That is where there are problems with losing one's wages, literally in seconds. That is also associated with gambling. </p>
          <p eId="para_443"> It is welcome that there is finally something to put a stop to the current circus around gambling. Everybody will agree that there are huge issues with its proliferation and the way it is perceived. That is the issue we have to take in. Gambling companies have hijacked many sports. They put a significant amount into sport, for example, football clubs in England. In the second division there, half the clubs have advertising sponsorship related to online gambling. It is everywhere. As I said, it has to be reined in. There has to be regulation, including around how it is advertised and perceived and so forth.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> I welcome the Bill. As I said, there are certain weaknesses around advertising. The national lottery is another issue that needs to be addressed. The national lottery is gambling. Over time, particularly over the past five years, it has used a lot of advertising for purposes it was not set up for. If we look carefully at how the national lottery advertises itself, it has become more of a gambling entity rather than what it was set up to be. There was a weekly draw and people perceived that money went into the national lottery for good causes. That is largely not the case anymore. A lot of the surplus money from the national lottery is put into advertising to sell more products and gambling. It is all-pervasive. There needs to be regulation and it is to be hoped that this Bill, even though there are limits to it, can put a stop to this insidious behaviour that goes on in our society.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOCallaghan" eId="spk_134">
          <from>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T16:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_445">I commend the Minister of State on managing to get this complex and complicated legislation onto the floor of the Dáil. He will recall that in opposition between the years 2016 and 2020, on numerous occasions, Fianna Fáil put forward proposals seeking reform of the legislation governing gambling. Regrettably, we did so without success, notwithstanding the fact we brought legislation before the House in 2018. The Minister of State, the Minister of State at the Department of Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media, Deputy Chambers, the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Rabbitte, and myself were to the forefront in trying to ensure the law in Ireland could be brought up to date. What primarily motivated us was the fact that we had met many of those people who had suffered from gambling addictions and whose lives had been destroyed as a result of finding themselves in a situation with gambling whereby they had either stolen or borrowed money to support their dangerous habit. It is a significant achievement that the legislation has come before the House. In fairness, I suspect the reason there was a delay in legislation coming prior to this is there may not have been the political urgency behind it and also because the legislation before us is unquestionably complex. It takes time to draft that.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> Section 9 deals with an area that has been significantly in need of reform for a long period. If we consider the legislation that is being repealed, some of the only legislation regulating gambling in Ireland dates from 1929, the Totalisator Act, and the Betting Act 1931. We will also repeal the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956. In fact, in the previous Dáil, the only relevant legislation that was amended during that Government's term was the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> There are a number of interesting, innovative and effective provisions in the Bill. One I particularly welcome is the reference to the national gambling exclusion register, which is provided for in section 44. That will ensure that certain people, whom we designate and want to protect, will be excluded from being involved in gambling activity. These are people who themselves recognise that they have a problem with gambling. They know that one way to ensure they can try to deal and cope with that problem is by putting themselves out of the gambling process. They can now do that statutorily as a result of this exclusion register provided for in the Bill. More importantly, it provides that if a gambling provider does not comply with that exclusion, and allows somebody who has voluntarily excluded themselves to gamble, that provider will commit a criminal offence. I particularly welcome that provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_448"> The other aspect of protecting and helping people who suffer from problem gambling is to do further research into it and provide them with supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">This is why it is so useful that we have in section 49 the creation of a social impact fund, which will be used to carry out further research into gambling and the damage it can inflict on individuals' lives. I hope to see the money from that fund being used to make people aware that, when it comes to gambling, the house always wins. That the bookies always win is not appreciated enough by people who have a gambling addiction or people who engage in gambling on a small-time basis. I have no difficulty with people engaging in gambling, for example, putting a bet on a horse and losing, but it would be beneficial to people if there was research to make them aware that the odds were always stacked against them and the house always won.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> It is worthwhile noting that a significant amount of money is being made from gambling. The reason there is so much advertising is that it is a profitable business. Since there is a great amount of money being generated by the industry, it is only right that the industry pay for a social impact fund. I hope that the industry will consent to this, but even if it does not, it does not matter because we have decided as the lawmakers that we are going to do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> Sections 83 to 87 set out the variety of licences that can be issued under the Bill. This recognises the fact that gambling has changed in recent years. Be it a gaming, gambling, betting, lottery, charitable or philanthropic licence that one wants, each comes with different requirements and they should all be recognised as different types of gambling licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> Part 6 deals with the obligations on those who are involved in the gambling industry. As the Minister of State knows, one of the methods by which the gambling industry attracts people who have addictive personalities or already have gambling addictions is advertising. I welcome that, in section 141, it is expressly stated that advertising on television or radio will be prohibited between 5.30 a.m. and 9 p.m. It might be worth the Minister of State's while just banning advertising completely. Since we are discussing permitting advertising on television and radio from 9 p.m. through the early hours of the morning, we need to recognise that the gambling industry could target many vulnerable people at those times.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> Under section 142, the industry will not be allowed to advertise on clothing that is worn by or targeted towards children. Another Deputy spoke about how English soccer betting companies were involved in a great deal of advertising. In the Premiership, betting companies sponsoring clubs seems to be universal. This section means that jerseys that are sold in Ireland cannot be sold to children if they promote betting companies on their fronts.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> Regarding section 150 on sponsorships, I welcome that we are going to try to protect children where sport or events are being sponsored. We must ensure that we do not create a generation of people who believe that gambling is a form of normality.</p>

          <from>Deputy Johnny Mythen<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T17:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_455">Gambling addiction is devastating many families, usually behind closed doors. What is a fun activity for some is a devastating, soul-destroying addiction for others. All the while, companies make colossal profits off this unbreakable cycle, particularly when there is a downturn in the economy. <i>The Irish Times</i> reported that Irish gamblers lost €1.36 billion in 2020, amounting to approximately €300 per adult on average, making the Irish the fourth highest gamblers in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> While the Bill is welcome, it is long overdue, considering that the previous gambling legislation dates from 1956 and 2013. The Bill's main provision is the establishment of the gambling regulatory authority of Ireland. This is welcome and will bring the protection of children and the general public to the fore. Statistics show us that, over consecutive years, the gambling industry has grown extensively and shifted more towards online activity, particularly since the pandemic. It is becoming easier to access. Simply put, someone's phone has become his or her 24-hour bookie. Therefore, it is important for us to recognise and deal with the trending of online gambling and its promotion on social media sites.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> I am unclear about the Bill's provisions, particularly under section 138, on the advertising of gambling online. This section seems to ban online gambling adverts unless the person has consented to such an advert, but if a person taps the "Like" or "Follow" button, does this count as a consensual contract to allow gambling ads to come flooding through his or her phone? Will the Minister of State elaborate on this point? Another issue is that gambling companies might not directly advertise online but will still maintain a social media presence through other content, such as memes, sports articles and videos. This is something we need to monitor and respond to. I raised this issue during the recent debates on the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill and tried to amend that Bill to ensure that the new media commission would be statutorily obliged to work with the gambling regulator, and <i>vice versa</i>, to deal with it. The amendment was not accepted, but I hope that both of the relevant Ministers listen to the premise of the argument. These two arms of the State need to work together to deal with the complexities of social media and gambling in order to protect our most vulnerable from the smarts, resources and manoeuvring of multinational gambling corporations and their ability to use legal muscle to circumvent legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> Gambling addiction is a road that leads to financial and mental health ruin. It is something that corporate greed profits off, and that is wrong. Robust legislative protections must be in place to counter this. I welcome the Bill. Our gambling legislation is long overdue an overhaul and needs to be brought into the modern era. We are taking a step in the right direction, but I hope that the online gambling section can be made clearer and be scrutinised more on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> I thank the Minister of State for introducing this progressive Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_461">This topic is relevant to my constituency of Louth and east Meath, as Louth, which is the smallest county in Ireland, has the highest concentration of betting shops <i>per capita</i>. Therefore, I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important Bill and I will support its progress on Second Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> A report by the HRB highlights that approximately 90,000 adults are low-risk gamblers, 35,000 are moderate-risk gamblers and 12,000 adults are problem gamblers whose gambling has negative consequences and entails a possible loss of control. According to the report, there are associated links between problem gambling, social deprivation and substance use disorders, which highlights the bidirectional negative influence of socioeconomic deprivation on an individual's life.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> The main purpose of the Bill is to provide significant legislative and regulatory reform to ensure that gambling is conducted in a fair and open way, protect children, provide safeguards to address problem gambling, including in terms of gambling advertising, and prevent gambling from being a source of or support to crime. It is among the most significant Bills to be brought before the Houses in respect of the gambling industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> The impact of gambling on many families and individuals has inflicted pain over the decades, especially given the nature of social media presence and online accessibility, which allows people to be targeted individually and often exploits their weaknesses. Last week, a constituent came to my clinic in Dundalk who had a gambling problem and, as a result, was living on the streets. Despite the homelessness section in Louth County Council helping him, he has a substance abuse problem and a gambling addiction and is not receiving the help he needs with rehabilitation. His is just one story. I speak with homeless people with addictions in my clinic weekly. They often become homeless as a result of numerous addictions, such as gambling, drink and drugs. Saying that the number of people addicted to gambling lies somewhere between 0.5% and just over 1% is massaging the figures. If we examined the proportion of regular gamblers who became addicted, we would find the proportion to be higher. That is where we should focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> It is a known fact that sports and betting have become deeply intertwined in recent years. This has been driven by major television coverage, advertising and social media exposure whereby young people have been seduced by the glamour and excitement of sports and betting. This recreational exposure, which often leads to addiction, has led to vulnerable youths being drawn into the world of easy money. Given the way betting shops operate, it is not possible to control or monitor underage behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> I will raise a number of matters specifically related to Parts 2, 4 and 6. Regarding Part 2, I support and absolutely welcome the provision for the establishment of the gambling regulatory authority of Ireland, the establishment of the national gambling exclusion register and the management of a social impact fund. These initiatives will reduce and eliminate compulsive and excessive gambling. This is a positive step. Additionally, the social impact fund will support problem gambling treatment activities and create awareness and educational campaigns around the dangers and consequences of gambling. However, it may be considered that provisions should be made for the proposed authority to consult regularly and effectively with the sector, particularly on the formation, governance and ongoing operations of any social impact fund introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> The gambling regulatory authority will operate as an independent regulator under the guidance of the Department of Justice. It is intended that the authority will regulate gambling, gaming and lottery services by commercial and non-commercial providers of such services, including advertising, in order to achieve a high degree of compliance with the gambling regulatory legislation. While the national lottery will not come under the remit of the gambling authority at this time, as its legal basis and its regulation will remain as provided for in the National Lottery Act 2013, the effectiveness and cost efficiency of potentially having two separate regulatory frameworks for the gambling sector are questionable.</p>
          <p eId="para_468"> The provisions in Part 6 will, in this digital age, address the proliferation of gambling advertisements on social media. This section contains fundamental provisions to protect children from gambling, including a prohibition on allowing a child to gamble and a prohibition on employing children in gambling activity. The section also encapsulates the advertising of gambling, the offer of promotions and payment method restrictions, such as a ban on the use of credit cards as a means of payment for gambling. The use of electronic methods of payment funded by credit cards and the offer of credit facilities to players offers protection to problem gamblers. I welcome these measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> It must be acknowledged that an outright ban on gambling advertising or sponsorship is not provided for. However, a provision within this section addresses the proliferation of gambling advertising on social media whereby such advertising that appeals or is intended to appeal to children shall be prohibited by default. Importantly, this section provides wide-ranging powers allowing the authority to prescribe where, when and the form in which advertising may be broadcast, published or displayed; the times gambling advertising can appear on television, radio, on-demand audiovisual media services and video-sharing platform services each day; the frequency and volume of gambling advertising; and a prohibition on the use of material that would appeal to children in gambling-related advertisements. These are welcome measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> I now turn to some of the provisions in Part 4, which provide for a number of prohibitions and offences. Centrally, section 65 prohibits a person from providing a gambling activity without a licence subject to certain exceptions. The overall policy intention is to encourage compliance rather than to enforce penalties for non-compliance. Where penalties are appropriate, Parts 4 and 8 provide the authority with robust powers in respect of a wide array of sanctions, from relatively mild to potentially severe, to address persons operating without a licence or without an appropriate licence. Yet, it must also be considered that legislation in this area will need to be compatible with EU law. Specifically, it seems likely that considerable work will be necessary to mitigate and manage any legal risks that could arise in relation to non-compliance and the disqualification or banning of a convicted licensee.</p>
          <p eId="para_471"> Gambling is a long-standing feature of Irish culture and a popular form of entertainment, but it has been clear for some time that a modern, sustainable and sector-wide regulatory regime, with a single oversight body, is required in this country. With the development of digital betting and gaming services, we need a strong regulator to ensure all gambling companies in Ireland work to reduce harm to customers for whom gambling becomes a problem. The fundamental difference between retail and online gambling is that we have much greater access to data on people's behaviours in respect of online gambling. With this model, it is possible to make predictions, make an impact and protect vulnerable people.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> The establishment of a well resourced, evidence-led gambling regulatory authority is an extremely positive development. It gives Ireland the opportunity to be an example of regulatory excellence and we welcome this. The legislative challenge is to strike the right balance between allowing the vast majority who enjoy gambling safely to do so, while protecting those who are vulnerable to experiencing harm from their gambling. Today, however, we must ensure we have a proper framework governing the industry and that the legislation is robust, yet compliant with EU law.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> Progress on these reforms, while overdue, is in the best interest not only of the tens of thousands of Irish consumers who safely participate in and enjoy gaming, gambling and lottery activities each week but also, importantly, of the smaller numbers of customers at risk of problem gambling, in addition to the wider public and the sector itself. In this regard, I welcome and support the advancement of this Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_474">I welcome the publication of this Bill, which is long overdue and urgently required. Our existing laws on gambling are hopelessly outdated and have created a situation where a significant cohort of our citizens are exposed to serious risk and hardship as a consequence of uncontrolled online gambling. It is said that a society can be judged by the way it treats its weakest and most vulnerable citizens. In that cohort, I include people who suffer a gambling addiction and whose lives are blighted by chasing losses and hoping for wins. Gambling addiction touches more than the addict caught in its grasp, however. It impacts widely on families, partners, children, the workplace and community groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_475"> Sadly, the State has been dragging its feet on introducing this new legislation and the limited enforcement of the existing limited legislation on gambling has done little to protect people who struggle with gambling addiction. Instead, it has allowed a vulnerable section of our society to fall prey to the increasing reach of highly sophisticated gambling companies. The rapid growth in online gambling, through the Internet and apps, means all of us have access to highly addictive games and formats at our fingertips. These online formats are run by highly sophisticated companies which are on top of their game in the operation and manipulation of players to bring them more and more into highly addictive gambling. For instance, a player might go on a website to place bets on a race, a match or even lottery numbers and then be enticed by free bets into taking a punt on a casino game, slots, a virtual race or the like.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> In 2017, the Department of Justice estimated that the market for gambling in Ireland was upwards of €8 billion per annum. Most of that estimate was based on betting receipts, which were estimated, on the basis of betting tax receipts, at €5.22 billion, with the national lottery contributing an extra €800 million. No figures are provided by the Department, however, for revenues for online gaming. Some have estimated this could match the betting revenues. The figures from the UK provide a frightening backdrop to our discussion. According to a report by the House of Lords, 60% of the gambling industry's profits in the UK come from 5% of its customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_477"> It is amazing the types of things that can be gambled on. As bookmakers seek to increase their profits, the number of betting markets available during sporting events is increasing all the time. For example, during the England versus Senegal soccer game on Sunday night, I took a look at one of the prominent bookmaker's websites. I could back the result, the exact score, how many goals there would be in total, which players would score, which players would provide an assist, whether both teams would score, the number of shots a certain player would have on target, if any player would have a shot on target in both halves, the number of corner kicks in the game, the number of yellow or red cards, which players would be shown a yellow or red card, which players would foul and how many fouls they would give away. These types of markets are designed to keep as many customers as possible engaged and actively gambling all the way through the game.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> In addition to this sports betting, we also see many different markets where bets can be placed, such as on politics or other non-sporting competitions. In four of the last five years, British punters have lost more than €14 billion annually in online casino games, sporting betting and other forms of gambling. It has been estimated that gambling addiction is responsible for more than 8% of all suicides in the UK. The most notable shift in the UK, which I have no doubt is mirrored here, is that remote gambling is now the dominant form of gambling there. Based on figures from the UK's Gambling Commission, it is not unreasonable to assume that online casinos here in Ireland account for close to €3 billion annually, if not more.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">The pace at which the legislation is processed, the level of resources allocated to its implementation and, critically, the extent to which we enforce the existing gambling legislation will tell us much about how seriously the Government and all of us will take this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> I welcome the establishment of the gambling regulatory authority and the appointment recently of the CEO-designate, Ms Anne Marie Caulfield. I wish Ms Caulfield well in her role. She and her new team will have their work cut out for them. I hope the new entity will be properly resourced and funded.</p>
          <p eId="para_481"> The new regulatory authority will have responsibility for regulating global gambling companies with years of experience in managing regulations and regulators across a range of jurisdictions. Ms Caulfield will need to have her wits about her when dealing with these companies and will need access to the highest level of international expertise to ensure the regulatory structure here can be effective and challenging for the gambling industry. I do not mean any disrespect to the new authority but it needs to be clear that these gambling entities will know at first-hand how to play the regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_482"> Over the past two years, I have become acutely aware of the impact of online gaming, in particular, on individuals who have been sucked into a spiral of addiction with entities that are expert at extracting money from them. I sought to get clarity from the Government as to the licensed status of these entities to see if there was any way control could be exercised over them. The practices that have been employed - free bets, free games and email marketing to people whose profile of play is concerning - are disgusting. I have no doubt the statistic showing that 60% of profits in the UK come from 5% of players applies here also. These companies know who to target and how to get them.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> When I inquired about the powers to regulate e-gaming companies in Ireland, I was advised in a reply to a parliamentary question to the Minister for Finance that there is no provision for the licensing of e-gaming or online gaming in Ireland. In other words, the provision of online gaming, whether through online casinos, slot machines, virtual horse races, etc., is entirely illegal and in breach of our gaming and lotteries legislation. The current law in this area is the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956. The Act, while outdated, is clear on what it covers and does not cover. Any gaming that is not permitted under the 1956 Act is defined in section 4(2) of the Act as unlawful gaming. If the Act of 1956 does not include the provision of games and lotteries by remote means, as both the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, contend, then that gaming is unlawful under the 1956 Act and any person promoting or assisting in promoting or providing facilities of any kind of gaming is liable to criminal prosecution under section 44 of the Act. It would be helpful to hear a reply from the Minister of State on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> Let us be clear about what I am alleging so that no one is muddled. I am not contending that gambling or e-gambling is illegal. The contention is that e-gaming is illegal in Ireland under our current laws. Online gambling, involving online casinos and online fixed-odds betting terminals, FOBTs, is not licensed or licensable in Ireland, yet FOBTs are being offered to Irish consumers on a host of online sites, some of which are operated by entities that hold betting or remote betting licences which only authorise them to engage in gambling rather than gaming. Equally, the fact that the Government is taking tax from the illegal offerings from remote betting companies and the Department of Justice appears to be offering certificates of fitness to these companies so that they can obtain a betting licence while clearly and manifestly breaking Irish law by offering illegal e-gaming services to Irish punters does not appear to have registered as an issue but it is one of great significance. Imagine the uproar, as I have said previously on the floor of the House, if it was discovered that Revenue was collecting VAT on sales from heroin, cocaine or prostitution, yet in the criminal law the position is no different.</p>
          <p eId="para_485"> It is also important to recognise that there are, of course, people who get enjoyment out of placing wagers on events and backing their opinion in a sensible and disciplined way. Gambling legislation must continue to make it possible for people to enjoy a sensible wager but must also be designed in such a way as to provide as much protection to problem gamblers in the State as we reasonably can.</p>
          <p eId="para_486"> Like my colleagues before me, I will table amendments to the Bill, which I hope will be a priority. Given the impact of unrestricted gambling activity on vulnerable citizens and their families, it is imperative that the existing law is enforced by the entities currently charged and funded with that responsibility.</p>

          <p eId="para_487">I welcome the Gambling Regulation Bill which will establish the gambling regulatory authority of Ireland. The regulator will have the authority to implement regulations regarding gambling, while also being able to levy fees on gambling companies that breach the new rules. This is a positive step forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> I campaigned for this alongside my party colleagues for a number of years outside Government and I am thrilled to see it now happening. Laws surrounding gambling in this country have not been updated, by and large, for over 70 years. The online space has changed how gambling companies operate. This can have a detrimental effect on those who are vulnerable to gambling. These new laws will ensure there are appropriate safeguards and measures put in place to protect people from gambling in terms of banning inducements and gambling on credit cards.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"> Many people across Ireland gamble safely within their means and enjoy it, but there are people who become problem gamblers and this can have a heavy impact on them and their families. This legislation will put in place consumer protection measures in order to reduce gambling.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> I want to highlight an important impact of gambling. Where people get involved in gambling and it leads to the loss of their home or job, it is difficult to start again or pick themselves up again. While there are supports available, one issue that has come up recently is accessing a mortgage or loan. Some people have made amends and put that life behind them. To see them refused a chance - blacklisted - is heart-breaking. We need to address this issue to enable such people to participate again in a healthy society. The issue has arisen in my clinics. Only recently, a young lady who started gambling very young went and got the supports she needed, and her family were supportive. She cleared her debts and got a good job. She is now in a position to get a mortgage but she cannot get a mortgage or a loan because she is blacklisted. We must always be mindful of people who have now turned a corner. We do not them to be blacklisted through no fault of their own but probably due to regulations. We need to ensure they get the support they need. I ask the Minister of State to consider this issue because it needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_491"> I note that the Gambling Regulation Bill paves the way for the establishment of a gambling regulator focused on public safety and well-being. The reason I say that is that his is about well-being. There is much more to be done on this. I welcome the Bill and ask that the issue I raise be addressed.</p>
        </speech>

          <p eId="para_492">I welcome the extraordinary hard work that has been done by the Department of Justice and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne. I have worked and engaged with the Minister of State on a number of issues related to this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> Many of the points made about the importance of this legislation in the short time I have been here are valid. I was particularly struck by a point made by Deputy Verona Murphy on the issue of problem gamblers and that 60% of gambling revenue comes from 5% of those people who engage in online gambling and gambling in general. That is an extraordinary and concerning figure which shows we need ongoing engagement with major gambling firms to see what can be done to reduce the level of problem gambling in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> I come from a unique perspective, having grown up in a family involved in horse racing. I am passionate about ensuring independent bookmakers, the small on-track bookies we see at race meetings, are allowed to compete with bigger players in the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">One facet of the Bill and reform with regard to winnings is that if people win more than €2,000 on a long-shot bet on a horse or a small wager on high odds, there is a need for complex information to be provided on the source of income, funds and addresses. I find it a little peculiar when it comes to the impact it will have on small and independent bookmakers. When it comes to resources and having to deal with this information, they are not the same as Paddy Power, Ladbrokes, BoyleSports, Bet365 and other major operators. There is a need for us to differentiate in the debate between the major conglomerates and companies and the small on-site bookmakers. We all know who they are. There are many of them dotted throughout the country in Ireland and the UK. It is important there is differentiation in the debate. People who go into a bookmaking shop and bet €1 or €2 on four numbers that might come up in tomorrow's lottery could win a significant pot of money that is more than the declaration requirements. We need to bear this in mind. When somebody is lucky and has a big win, there will be a regulatory impact with these potential reforms.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> Problem gamblers need effective protection from gambling companies and this is extremely worrying. We need to do a lot more work on this. I hope the legislation will advance our protections for people in this position. Like other Deputies in the House, I have seen the devastation that problem gambling causes for families in Ireland. Sadly, much like alcohol, drugs and other addictive goods or services, they can wreak havoc on people's lives. As legislators we must do what we can to help people in these situations.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> What has really marked a shift in the past 20 years, and I have lived through this shift since being a small child to where we are today, is that mobile phone devices have unlocked gambling 24-7 for people throughout the country once they have a debit card or credit card. I am delighted to see the reforms in the Bill with regard to credit card gambling. This is the reality. It is not a case of sitting into a car and going to the local bookie's shop or going to a race meeting or the dog track for a day out and a day's sport. Access to gambling is now with people 24-7. This is the modern and new reality and it is one that, unfortunately, is hugely problematic for people who are vulnerable in this regard.</p>

          <p eId="para_498">Many people enjoy the activity of gambling and do so responsibly but for some people and their families, gambling can become a very serious problem. Recent research by the Gambling Awareness Trust in conjunction with Maynooth University places the number of people in the South who engage in problem gambling at approximately 55,000. There is a need for greater action to help those at risk as when it comes to avoiding, and responding to, problem gambling only voluntary codes of practice exist. These were created by various sectors of the industry itself. I am, therefore, happy to support the passage of the Gambling Regulation Bill to Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> Gambling laws in the State have not kept pace with the technological developments in the gambling industry. All while we have the highest online gambling losses <i>per capita</i> in the world and the third highest <i>per capita</i> losses overall. A regulatory authority for the industry is badly needed and is, frankly, well overdue. Any regulator must have the teeth and resources to properly undertake its functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> In the current system of self-regulation the Gambling Awareness Trust, which was established and funded by the gambling industry, distributes funding to various services and research initiatives of its choosing. While this, in fairness to the industry, is welcome in the face of prolonged Government inaction with regard to problem gambling, it is neither an efficient nor viable long-term solution. There is no proper funding for awareness campaigns nor supports or treatment for problem gamblers. I hope this is envisaged as part of the social impact fund contained in the Bill. This funding must be free from the industry's influence. There is also a need for a dedicated gambling prevalence survey along the lines of what is in the North, where we can compare the issue of problem gambling throughout the island and the effectiveness of the responses put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_501"> I will take this opportunity to commend my party colleague and Sinn Féin spokesperson on addiction Deputy Gould, who recently initiated a Bill to ban the use credit cards for online gambling. Online gamblers are able to use credit cards, their own or someone else's, to continue to feed their habit when other funds have run out. Deputy Gould's Bill would be an additional and important tool in restricting the accessibility of gambling to problem gamblers and reduce their ability to rack up enormous debts. I encourage the Government to ensure the passage of the Bill is not held up. I am happy to support the Bill before us and move it to Committee Stage when we can ensure the regulator that comes into being has the tools and resources to help individuals and families affected by problem gambling.</p>

          <p eId="para_502">The Gambling Regulation Bill, if enacted, will create significant changes in how gambling is regulated. In particular it will bring about some changes that are badly needed. It will establish a gambling regulatory authority of Ireland to ensure gambling is conducted in a fair and transparent manner. When I see regulators and regulatory authorities, I have questions. We have many of them in many areas. They have brass plates on the walls and fancy offices but they do very little regulation. This is what I fear is what happens. They are like a flu the way they expanding. They are mushrooming.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> The regulatory authority will mandate safeguards to counter problem gambling and ensure the protection of children. Most importantly, it will establish powers to regulate gambling advertising and provide the authority with enforcement powers in addition to licensing activities. The authority will also be given wide-ranging powers of enforcement. Tá súil agam gur sin an effect a bheidh aige but will it happen? These powers include the power to apply to the court for an audit to prevent or block access to remote or online services, and the power to carry out tests and audits on problem gambling services in an undisclosed manner. This is what we need. We need people who have the power to arrive and check on spec. One of its most significant powers will be the power to impose administrative financial sanctions. The amount of money being discussed with regard to sanctions is staggering. There will be sanctions of up to €20 million or 10% of turnover in the High Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> The Bill passed pre-legislative scrutiny which is good. The grim reality in Ireland is that problem gambling is growing every year and the situation that is growing with young people is a great pity. Is mór an trua é. They have mobile phones when they are very young. We all know of many cases of perfectly responsible people in responsible jobs and businesses, such as managers of post offices and other places, who have fallen victim to this and ended up in misery for themselves, their families and their workplace. It has to be tackled. We are slow to come to the tackling.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> All of the advertising from the big companies that comes on is bamboozling. I am here to represent the small one-man, two-man, man-and-wife or man-and-son local and small independent bookmakers. They go out every day to earn an honest day's pay. They know their clients. They know when something is wrong. They can confide with their clients and perhaps tell them they were unfortunate and they might need to have a look at themselves. They are in every town. I know many of them in Tipperary who work at the Clonmel track and race courses all over the county and ar fud na tíre.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> Unfortunately the available data point to problem gambling growing here every year. According to the counselling group Extern Problem Gambling, the number of new visitors to its website has increased tenfold in the past six years. The political system has to be ahead of this. We are way behind and we have to catch up. This can follow people not only home but into their bedrooms, offices, back gardens and bars or restaurants when they go for a meal. We have to be able to deal with it. We have to have an organisation that has the power and staff that will work outside hours, break down the barriers and borders and do this.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">They must have the support of An Garda Síochána and indeed of the community at large. We cannot allow big gambling houses to circumvent this legislation. As I said at the start of my contribution, we cannot have a regulator that has a brass plate on the wall and a fine, big office, but has little staff to monitor. We need staff who have expertise in this area. We can say that every division of An Garda Síochána must have a unit for this, that and the other, but this unit needs tax resources. If this regulation is passed, it will need to be implemented rigorously. I hope it will pass and I do not see any reason it would not. It has gone through pre-legislative scrutiny. I want to see, as I do in the case of all legislation, an impact analysis and an assessment within the first 12 to 15 months. That should deal with how this is bedding in, and look at whether it is having the desired effect and is protecting our young people especially.</p>

          <p eId="para_508">Research is telling us that 61% of 16-year-olds in Ireland have placed a bet. The Oireachtas justice committee's report on gambling has warned that 3,400 young people under the age of 18 have a problem with gambling. We all know how dangerous gambling is. We can see how, with the touch of a button, people can now gamble 24-7.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> I am a big supporter of the horse industry and the greyhound industry. If you go for a day out to horse racing or a night out to greyhound racing, you will go to the bookies who are there on the day or you will have a bet on your night out. That is responsible betting. However, being around betting 24-7 as advertisements are pushed out makes people think it is normal to have betting. I have major problems with that. I am for any legislation that will help members of the younger generation and the older generation who have a problem. </p>
          <p eId="para_510"> We brought the Impaired Farm Credit Bill 2022 before this House last week, but it was voted down by the Government. In some of the situations we were looking at, farms were under threat due to gambling. The family home cannot be protected in such circumstances because the Government voted against the Bill. We do not know the circumstances of anybody's family. There could be alcoholism or gambling addictions and those affected require help. The people who are trying to help them also need help. We tried to do this last week when we brought the Impaired Farm Credit Bill before the Dáil, but the Government voted it down. That would have been another protection for people who have a gambling addiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> The biggest thing we need to do is to educate younger people on the limits of what they can bet, and show them that they will not be looked down on if they do not have a bet. I see many people who bet responsibly but a minority of people have an issue with betting and cannot stop. It is a disease and we have to try to help people by putting things in place. This will help the generations and let them know how they can bet responsibly. </p>
          <p eId="para_512"> Some advertisements are being put up around schools. Some online advertisements are trending on phones non-stop. We are talking about gambling today and I guarantee the Minister of State that in the next three or four feeds on our phones, something to do with gambling will show up to make sure that we look this content on our phones. We should tackle that. As I have said, if you want to go for a day out and have a few flutters, that is normal. However, we have to protect the people who are gambling 24-7 from their homes. They can use a credit card and put themselves into serious debt. They think they can bet their way out of it. I will give 100% backing to every Bill that is tabled in this area to protect those people. Every household in Ireland has been hit with some form of gambling or alcoholism within the family. We want to give protections to people. The Gambling Regulation Bill is a chance for Ireland to bring its outdated laws into the 21st century. </p>
          <p eId="para_513"> Gambling companies know that the game is up. The experts are facing down the odds once and for all. Let us turn the odds not against the ordinary bookies who are at race meetings, etc., but against the social media giants that take advantage of people 24-7 with repetitive flashes to go betting. Let us target them and make sure the regulation is there for the next generation and for the generations that are here at the moment. We must protect them, their families, their futures and the livelihoods of others. I will support any Bill that will protect families and the futures of the people to come.</p>

          <from>Deputy Danny Healy-Rae<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T17:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_514">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak about this Bill. Like all of us who have been elected to this House, we know that gambling addiction causes problems that lead to the breakup of marriages, homes and relationships and clean out businesses and farms. It is like everything; if you do it in moderation, it is fine. As with a few drinks or any substance, a little bit in moderation is fine. When it takes over, becomes an addiction and becomes compulsive, gambling can be a serious problem in many households. It has left many wives short of money at the end of the week to provide food and to look after the children in the family unit. It leaves them short of many different things. It puts their homes and their houses in jeopardy and it can end up at a point where they lose their homes. It is very sad when people who have done well and worked so hard for many years to acquire or build a home, a business or a farm see it go under the hammer because of their addiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> I am very worried about online gambling. This Bill includes the provision of betting licences, gaming licences and lottery licences, which are for in-person gambling activities and for gambling activities offered by remote means. That is the part of it I am worried about. I do not know how that can be controlled, but it should be controlled. It is ridiculous to think that people can bet away until a late hour at night, maybe after they have had a few drinks. If they were working during the day, they may not have the time to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> I welcome the section of the Bill that continues to provide for exemptions from the requirement to hold a gambling licence for certain small-stake lotteries, such as those that help charities. Many GAA clubs run a weekly lotto. When I was in Gneeveguilla last night, I saw a group from the committee running off its lotto. They put work into that to provide funding for the necessary activities in their great club. That has been replicated right around Kerry in all the small clubs which do not get the necessary funding. It is the only way. They work hard at it and an awful lot of work goes into it. It is just €2 to buy a ticket. They collect a lot of money, and more power to them. We must allow that to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> In the time I have left, I will say that on the ground the grim reality in Ireland is that problem gambling is growing every year. How do we tackle that? A body such as the HSE should have enough funding available to help people who have developed a gambling addiction to be treated. It should talk to them, try to come around to them and do whatever is necessary. A health research report into problem gambling in Ireland has highlighted the lack of specific services for gambling addiction being provided by the HSE. </p>
          <p eId="para_518">These data show the need for dedicated treatment provision for those with gambling problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> Unfortunately, this legislation does nothing to address the chronic lack of addiction support services. In addition, education is needed and awareness must be raised on a national scale, especially with teenagers in our schools, to counter the proliferation and normalisation of gambling here. The report found the most common type of gambling was buying a lottery ticket. I do not think that buying a lottery ticket is a problem. It is like everything in that it is fine if it is done in moderation but if it is done on a continuous basis, it is not fine.</p>

          <p eId="para_520">I start by remembering the words of Michael O'Connor from Muckross in Killarney, a late friend of mine who only died in recent times in the year of his 108th birthday. I would meet him very regularly. He was driving his car until he was 104, living on his own and taking care of himself. He was a great man. His philosophy in life was that everything is fine in moderation, whether it is alcohol or any of the other things a person wants to do in life. Everything is fine in moderation.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> Let it be quite clear there is nothing in the world wrong with gambling. There is nothing in the world wrong with the people who own, run or have gainful employment in bookie shops or the people who leave their place of work of an evening and go to have a little bet in a bookie house, or to have a drink and put a bet of a little bit of money at the same time. There is nothing in the world wrong with it, if they remember Michael O'Connor and do it in moderation. That is the moral not just of this but of everything else.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> That is why I welcome the legislation. I consider it the Government's answer to try to help ensure people who are not exercising moderation are protected and helped and their families are secured and to protect them from themselves if they are not able to exercise moderation. We also have to be very careful not to demonise this industry. I call it an industry because I thank and compliment the great people where I come from in County Kerry such as the company that runs the Killarney Races and our racing festivals. The festivals are on in May, June, July, August and into September. It is the same in Listowel and we have the Glenbeigh Races. I thank all of the people who work at them. The gambling element is very important. It is only a flutter. It might be a person putting on what they can afford. That could be a few pence or euro, or it could be multiples of that if they are able to. However, a person should only be gambling and betting what they can afford to lose because there is no such thing as a bookie on a bicycle. The bookie wins far more often than not. The new advent when it comes to gambling, unfortunately, is people betting online. They are sitting at home or maybe in other places and going on their phones. They have a credit card and their phones which is a very dangerous combination.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> Very good friends of mine, Timmy and Cathy O'Leary, from Cahir ran a bookies shop in Kenmare for decades. Of course, they were able to exercise prudence with their customers and ensure they were for the protection of their customers. Yes, they had their own people who used to come to have a flutter with them but they ran what I would call a respectable bookie office. These were real bookies. They were people who would encourage a person not to put on a bet if they thought they were a little bit under the weather or not in form for betting. They would be out for their customers' best interest in a very genuine way because they did not want people to part with money foolishly.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> Unfortunately, the phone is no Timmy O'Leary. It is a different device which has no monitor or filter. The credit card will back up what the person is willing to place which could be a bet on two horses out in Kentucky in the United States of America at 3.30 a.m. when a he or she might be a little bit intoxicated and might be betting what he or she had in wages or money into the house that week. Of course, we have to be protective of that and try to ensure we protect people from themselves while, at the same time, not demonising the industry because it is the same as the publicans. The finest people we had in Ireland were the people who sold drink in public houses because they did so in moderation. They minded their customers and were careful of them. The closure of pubs and what I call the downturn in that way of life means there are no more measures. People are drinking at home and it is not measured in the way it was measured by the publicans. It is the same thing with the bookie office. If individuals know their customers, it is much better than the phone. I am certainly not a fan of online betting and ways it can be regulated or monitored with all the protections put in place to mind people is very important.</p>

          <p eId="para_525">I welcome the progression of this legislation through to Second Stage. It is great to see it coming along before the end of this term. I take a moment to commend the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, for his determination and diligence in stewarding this Bill to the stage of publication and Second Stage. I know he has made it his priority since he took up office and I salute him on that. As Chair of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice, I was very happy to work with him on it. We have engaged and published a report with a number of recommendations which I will speak on in a moment. It is a good example of the legislative process working well. We have gone full cycle, done due diligence and the Bill has been improved as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> With regard to the Bill and the whole are of gambling, several speakers have mentioned the issue of online gambling and phone gambling. I think it was the Minister of State who said we all have a casino in our pocket now should we wish to check in to it. It is yet another example of technology outstripping legislation and how it has vastly outstripped legislative change and policy making. This is brought to life by the fact that even though legislation was enacted in 2019, which is only three years ago, even that legislation is massively out of date. If one looks at the definition of online lotteries, gaming and activity, it is very unclear and uncertain as to what exactly are the legislative provisions. That remains the case for legislation only passed three years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> It is very important we dot and progress legislation and bring it up to date. Many of the operators who engage in the Irish jurisdiction are headquartered or operate from jurisdictions abroad. I may be doing them a disservice but I think some of the smaller EU states often play host to gambling companies because they are licensed and legislated to provide the services from there. That means they are effectively passporting into Ireland or providing services here while being, to some extent, outside the reach of our own domestic laws which, of course, is never a great idea. This is overdue and, indeed, very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> The spectrum of gambling activities, as has been mentioned by a few speakers already, is very broad and includes GAA clubs. I heard Deputy Healy-Rae talk about his local GAA club. I have often sat at a draw in Sallins or Clane GAA club or other GAA clubs and watched them pick balls from a tombola. I have never actually won the draw but I have often tried. I know that it goes from small local community organisations right through to the other end of the spectrum of multimillion and probably billion euro enterprises that operate at significant scale across many jurisdictions. It is about trying to get a one-size-fits-all approach to those. Trying to get a staggered approach that captures all of them is very challenging and difficult. </p>
          <p eId="para_529"> I have to agree with other speakers who made the distinction between those large offline and online providers and the ordinary rural or urban local bookmaker. I do not necessarily agree with a comment made by one of the speakers that one never sees a poor bookmaker. They are not all minted or made of money. I know some of them lay the bets off to other exchanges but they can go bust very quickly as well, especially the smaller individuals. It can be a difficult and quite stressful life. I am talking about the small, family-run businesses that at one time, certainly, were on the street of every local village and town. I know many enjoy a game of chance, whether it is a bet on a horse race or a sporting event.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">There are many people, particularly older gentlemen, who will bet 50 cent or €1 at a time and have great enjoyment from an afternoon at the bookmaker in which they spend no more than €3. The engagement, chat and chance to socialise is as much part of the experience as the bet itself. I have seen that happen. It is important that be recognised as a social or enjoyable activity. It can also go wrong. I have, sadly, seen situations where people who were normal, decent, hardworking, upstanding individuals had a secret vice that was unknown to others at the time and became apparent. Some of those cases have ended in tragedy, including careers being derailed, families being upended, houses being repossessed and people ending up in custody. There are draconian consequences but sometimes they only emerge at the far end of an engagement, when this might have been going on in the background, unknown to anyone observing the person.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> I will briefly revisit the committee engagement. I mentioned how technology has far outstripped the pace of legislative change relating to social media, technology and data industries. One figure that stood out was when a company revealed that it has up to 200 different data points on every individual who uses its services. When people place a bet online, the company has a sophisticated matrix that can be used to pinpoint information from the obvious matters such as what day a person is paid on to less obvious ones such as people's interests, cultural likes and what movies they like to watch. It is a variety of data that the company can use to target advertisements at people on the day they are paid, in a format they might like, in a manner, such as through comedy, which the company knows will work best to attract the attention of that individual and entice that person to place a bet.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> A scandal such as the one with Cambridge Analytica is waiting to happen. We have seen this happen in politics and we are on the cusp of it happening with gambling. Perhaps it is already happening daily online on everybody's phone and we are oblivious to it. I welcome the provisions. There are significant moves to curb online and social media advertising in the Bill. I understand that somebody has to proactively select to follow a particular betting company to receive its promotion, otherwise they will not appear in that person's feed. That is progressive and welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_533"> I mentioned what the Minister of State has done. I know he has taken on board many points made at the committee, especially watershed advertising. I thank him for that. It is an example of the process being done well.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> On a miscellaneous note, bingo has been raised with me as something that is perhaps not covered by the Bill. There may be a lacuna. Pre-Covid, many constituents boarded buses and went to bingo all around the country. I am not sure where that stands. Is there a grey area in this Bill? I am not sure. Perhaps the Minister of State could respond about that at the end of the debate. I thank the Minister of State for his diligence and determination in driving this Bill forward. I was glad to have the opportunity to engage through the committee process. It is good legislation and I commend it to the House.</p>

          <from>Deputy Chris Andrews<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_535">Legislation to regulate gambling is long overdue and is very welcome. It is to the credit of the Minister of State and Government that it is being introduced now. Successive Governments fail to act on it every year. It is welcome and commendable that the legislation is in the Dáil now. I commend the Minister of State. As a society, we often fail to address and to see gambling for the cancer that it is for many people. We often view gambling as harmless fun, including accumulators and bets when people go to the races. It is a social thing, but it is dangerous for many people. In sport, betting companies are often viewed as vital sponsorship for clubs. The GAA has led by example with its socially responsible approach to gambling. In 2018, the GAA voted for an outright ban on gambling sponsorship. Since then, it has developed awareness campaigns about gambling aimed at its members and players. Within the FAI, more and more League of Ireland clubs refuse to take gambling companies as sponsors. I know that the club in Drogheda has turned down gambling companies. This is welcome. The days of jersey sponsorship by betting companies should be in the past. I welcome the legislation to finally bring about a ban on these sponsorships in sport.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> The Gambling Awareness Trust indicates that approximately 55,000 people in the State have serious gambling disorders. We have the highest online gambling losses <i>per capita</i> in the world. As was shown before, we cannot depend on the industry to regulate itself. It just will not happen. That is the brutal reality. As the previous speaker said, technology outstrips legislation and leaves it ineffective. The Government must lead with strong, robust legislation, with the power to regulate advertising, gambling websites and applications. There should be a complete ban on advertising. While the watershed is a step forward, it does not go far enough. We need to ensure there is a complete ban because the advertising some of the companies do is brilliant. It sucks people in and is a huge source of attraction to gambling for people. It is a hook and a gateway to gambling. There should be a complete ban on that type of advertising.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas Pringle<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T18:00:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_537">I thank the Minister of State for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this important legislation. Despite the fact that this legislation is important and lengthy, the Government has decided, yet again, to publish it at the last minute. The general scheme was published more than a year ago and the Joint Committee on Justice, which I am a member of, launched its pre-legislative scrutiny report in May. The Government has no excuse for only publishing the final Bill, which is 170 pages long, in the past few days. I highlight that when legislation is published late, it not only affects Opposition scrutiny, but also scrutiny from outside organisations. We are missing important input from NGOs into how the legislation will affect those it is aimed at. Maybe that is what it is all about, unfortunately.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> We are in the jaws of Christmas again. With the legislation being published now, I hope it will not be rushed through the House and finished before the end of next week, but it probably will be because that is what the Government is doing. The Minister of State is nodding to indicate that it will not be. Hopefully, that is the case. It is important to do justice to the legislation and for the Minister of State to do justice to himself and to allow Members to have an input into the legislation. Unfortunately, we have seen that the two weeks in the Christmas period and in July have been the peak time for legislation to come before the House and to be rushed through. I hope that is not the case and that time will be given for this legislation to be considered. It is significant, important legislation. It needs to be scrutinised.</p>
          <p eId="para_539"> I welcome the establishment of an independent gambling regulatory authority. The regulatory framework covering gambling activities is outdated and needs significant reform. The interdepartmental working group on future licensing and regulation of gambling rightly outlined that the existing framework is insufficient. It does not provide a regulated approach to all gambling activities and it does not adequately protect vulnerable persons such as minors.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> The 2019 results of the European school survey project on alcohol and other drugs are concerning, since Irish respondents aged 15 and 16 reported higher rates of gambling, slot machine use, sports and animal betting, and participation in lotteries than their counterparts in 34 European states. Those are worrying results. The survey results suggest that existing safeguards are insufficient as minors are still finding ways to bet on sporting events.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> The existing regulatory framework does not adequately address its application to online gambling, which has increased significantly in recent years and is one of the most harmful forms of gambling. A 2015 qualitative study conducted in Ireland found that of all gambling forms, the online environment was perceived by family and friends of recovering gamblers as being a gateway to hidden gambling that could involve multiple credit cards and gambling accounts. Smartphones are particularly convenient. They provide an opportunity to engage in gambling in any setting and can be used to hide excessive gambling. I could have sat here gambling while listening to the debate. Mobile phones and online gambling mean that gambling can be done anywhere at any time. That is worrying and difficult to manage. This legislation has a difficult task in policing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">Online gambling can be especially prevalent in rural areas such as in my constituency in County Donegal where there is limited access to bookmakers. Years ago, people would come to the bookies on a Saturday and it would be a day out. There was some form of regulation and control of that but now with online gambling there is no regulation. Nobody needs to live anywhere near a bookies to engage in unlimited gambling. That is a problem that must be carefully examined and addressed. There is limited regulation of the licensing of remote betting operators for online gambling services. For online gaming services there is no licensing pathway available and no regulatory oversight of that sector either. I welcome that the Bill will address this significant gap and that it provides for safeguards and protections on problem gambling and for the protection of children to ensure public safety and well-being, and consumer protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> I welcome also the establishment of the social impact fund for the purposes of financing research and information, education and awareness-raising measures and appropriately supporting problem gambling treatment activities by relevant health professionals. Research in this area has been lacking and it is important we are aware of the extent of the problem by funding the appropriate research, as well as adequately funding awareness campaigns in order that people fully understand the detrimental effects of gambling. Most importantly, it is essential those experiencing these effects are given the help they need as well. I am glad that following the justice committee's pre-legislative scrutiny, section 141 provides for a watershed prohibiting the broadcast of gambling advertising on television and radio between the hours of 5:30 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. In addition, section 139 prohibits advertising that portrays gambling as attractive to children, advertising that condones children participating in gambling and advertising that encourages or seeks to exhort a child to gamble.</p>
          <p eId="para_544"> I also welcome that section 157 provides for an explicit ban on the use of credit cards as a means of payment for gambling and that the legislation goes further and also prohibits the use of electronic payment methods funded by credit cards and the offer of credit card facilities to players as well. However, I am disappointed a provision to allow background checks to be carried out on applicants when they register for an online gambling website to ascertain whether he or she has any financial vulnerabilities and that a provision for operators to be liable where they know gamblers are making losses beyond their means have not been included. That is necessary because the only way gambling companies will behave responsibly is if they are penalised for ignoring the law or putting vulnerable people in a situation they cannot get out of.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> I am also concerned section 44, which addresses a national gambling exclusion register, only allows people to self-exclude from operators they already hold an account with. That seems pointless and should be extended going forward. I am not exactly sure how that would be done but it should be done and must be looked at. If someone already has an account with a company and he or she is a problem gamble,r that is not the problem. If I am a problem gambler and a gambling company stops me from doing something, I will just open an account with somebody else. That is the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> People pay a high price when it comes to gambling. It was reported Irish gamblers lost approximately €1.36 billion in 2020. This amounts to approximately €300 per adult and makes the Irish the fourth-highest gamblers in the EU. In 2017, <i>The Economist </i>indicated Ireland ranked third worldwide in 2016 for average gambling losses per adult resident. That shows we have a major problem around gambling and gambling control. If €300 is gambled per adult then my €300 is divided around everybody else and that is true for many other people and, therefore, a lot of people are losing an awful lot of money. That is why, unfortunately, we have gambling companies set up here. Some of the biggest companies in the world are based here and some are from here too.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> I welcome the introduction of this Bill. It is needed because we must control this. I welcome a new regulatory framework to address the many issues I have detailed. We must do more as well and that should be teased out and looked at during the progress of the legislation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joe Carey<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T18:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_548">I welcome the Bill. It has been a long time in drafting. I commend the Minister of State and his officials on their work on the Bill. I also give due credit to the Minister of State's predecessor, Deputy Stanton, for his work.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> This sector has seen many dramatic changes since the Betting Act 1931 and the Gaming and Lotteries Act 1956. Most people would consider the greatest such change has been the introduction of online betting and gambling with the use of the mobile phone. Nearly all the betting and gambling carried out in those earlier times were cash transactions. Few people had an account or were able to conduct business over the phone. Times have changed and there is very much a need for this legislation to bring our gambling regulation into the 21st century. Gambling can take many forms, including the traditional bet on a dog or greyhound. There is a range of sports betting on everything from golf to tennis to elections and politics. Those normally have a human or performance feat, and then we have another world involving cards, lucky numbers or machine-generated numbers or symbols.</p>
          <p eId="para_550"> The main provision of the Bill is to set up a gambling regulatory authority that will provide a proper and effective licensing system to provide a safe regulation of gambling activities in Ireland. The Bill introduces safeguards to address problem gambling. The main concern of the Bill is those who are prepared to lose more than they have, often through addiction or economic pressure, by ensuring gambling is conducted in a fair and open way by requiring safeguards to address problem gambling and restricting gambling advertising. Other concerns addressed include preventing children being induced through advertising and promotion and other methods into the gambling world.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> While gambling activity is enjoyed safety and responsibly by the vast majority of people in Ireland, we are all aware of the ill-effects of problem gambling for individuals, their families and society as a whole. This is why the creation of a social impact fund, as provided for in the legislation, is good for society. I understand this fund will finance research and information to support public education and awareness-raising measures related to problem gambling and to support problem treatment activities by suitably-qualified health professionals.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> Another concern I hope is addressed in the Bill is to prevent gambling being a source of funds for or support to crime and money laundering. The Joint Committee on Justice held extensive meetings as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny of this Bill, with many of the stakeholders and interest groups, before issuing a comprehensive report that included 16 major recommendations on provisions to be included. I wish to know whether all these recommendations have been included to examine the feasibility of the pre-legislative scrutiny process. These recommendations included the possibility of blocking gambling operators that are not licensed in the State, further restrictions on gambling advertising, the possible prohibition of gambling and gaming with credit cards, more advanced verification checks on a customer's age, the siting of multiple gambling outlets in predominantly disadvantaged communities be discouraged and gambling operators being made liable to dependants and creditors of gamblers where they know or ought to know the gambler is making losses beyond their means.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> There was also an issue there around decoupling sports and gambling advertising. It is a tricky area, especially if we look at horse racing. Last weekend, there was good horse racing meeting in Fairyhouse with three grade 1 races. The main sponsor there was a betting company. I do not know how we are going to break the link between a company supporting that particular racecard. It was on RTÉ 1 television. I encourage the Minister of State to look at that in a practical way.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">I also thank the Joint Committee on Justice for its considered work on this Bill. I understand the new regulatory authority will be ready to start next year, once this Bill has been passed. I commend this Bill to the House and thank the Minister of State for his dedicated work in bringing it before the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_555">We in Sinn Féin welcome the Bill and will support its passage to Committee Stage, where we will table amendments to its deficiencies. It is a comprehensive Bill dealing with the regulation of gambling. It is an important step but it must be accompanied by funding for addiction services, awareness campaigns and supports that are free of industry influence. In April this year, several Government Deputies and Senators attended a corporate hospitality event at Punchestown Racecourse, at which the Irish Bookmakers Association paid for three tables. At the same time, the legislation was being prepared. The Government needs to clean up its act and move away from the cosy relationship it has with vested interests.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> We in Sinn Féin support regulation and acknowledge its importance to prevent the involvement of organised crime. The Bill provides for the new gambling regulatory and makes other welcome changes in the law around gambling. Gambling addiction damages the lives of far too many people across Ireland every day. Thus far, successive Governments have failed in their duty to protect people who experience gambling addiction and failed to support those who seek help. Current legislation is decades out of date and has failed to keep pace with the online world. As a result, our young people in particular are exposed to predatory forms of online advertising and gambling, which should be regulated. Those in recovery and our young people are suffering because of a lack of action. They are bombarded with gambling advertising on social media during sports matches and while watching television. I was shocked to learn that young people can sign up to online gambling without any age verification for up to 72 hours. It is no wonder we have some of the highest problem gambling rates among 15- to 16-year-olds in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> Modernisation of the law on gambling is long overdue. It must be made fit for purpose to tackle problem gambling. The issue of gambling addiction must get the attention it deserves. I truly hope this Bill fares better than the first gambling control Bill, the general scheme of which was published in 2013 and has been gathering dust ever since. There are approximately 55,000 people in this State engaging in gambling in a harmful way and there are countless others indirectly impacted. Gambling harm has a catastrophic effect on individual families and communities. In recognising this, we must finally regulate the sector in a way that protects those vulnerable people. The fact that a CEO for the commission has been hired is a good sign of intent. I wish Ms Caulfield the very best in her role.</p>

          <from>Deputy Mark Ward<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T18:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_558">Problem gambling is a big issue in Ireland and in my community. When I was growing up, my area was an area of disadvantage. It did not have any community infrastructure whatsoever. One of the first things that went into it was a pub and the next thing was a bookies, which squeezed the life and the money out of my community. These things need to be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> I have worked in addiction services across Dublin over the years. In my time, I have worked closely with problematic gamblers. A person who is addicted to drugs or alcohol can only consume so much of it before they pass out but a gambler can keep gambling if they have the means to keep gambling or the ability to obtain the means to keep gambling. Many families have been destroyed financially and emotionally by problematic gambling. There is many a person in prison because of crimes committed to secure the means to keep gambling.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> In my time, I have found that compulsive gamblers have an uncontrollable urge to keep gambling despite the toll it takes on their lives. Science has proven that gambling can stimulate the brain's reward system much like drugs or alcohol can, leading to addiction. If someone has a problem with compulsive gambling, they may continually chase bets that lead to losses, use up savings and create debt. They may hide their behaviour and even turn to theft or fraud to support their addiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> Online gambling companies have also used this science. A near win can stimulate the same reaction in the brain as a win can. Big gambling companies have designed their online betting systems to stimulate the brain by using this "near miss" science. It effectively keeps people gambling longer. In the Twenty-six Counties, we have highest online gambling losses in the world per head and the third highest gambling losses overall per head. This is a serious problem. There is no proper funding for treatment for problem gamblers, which I hope will be addressed by the social impact fund provided for in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> I commend the work carried out by volunteer organisations such as Gamblers Anonymous in helping their peers, and for the vital work they do by going into our prisons and talking to people who are incarcerated just because of their gambling addiction. Community organisations like the ones I used to work in need funding and supports. My colleague, Deputy Thomas Gould, has introduced a Bill to ban online gambling using a credit card and has developed a 26-county gambling strategy, which includes a strong regulator. While we welcome this Bill, it must be accompanied by funding for addiction services, awareness campaigns and supports that are free from industry influence. We support a regulated trade and acknowledge its importance in preventing the involvement of organised crime. At the same time, that regulation must be robust.</p>
          <p eId="para_563"> This year, the Government funded Horse Racing Ireland to the tune of €71 million, a large proportion of which could be used as prize money for horse racing. Most of this prize money is shared among a select few of the top horse trainers and owners. It beggars belief that this money is not used for vital community facilities. In my area, we are lucky to have the Clondalkin Equine Club. It is a centre of excellence for children to practise proper urban horsemanship. Last year, the club nearly folded because of a lack of funding. Only last-minute private funding kept it afloat this year. I attended the club’s AGM only last week, where we were told the club could be in the same position again this year. Of the €71 million the Government gives HRI, this club would only require €130,000 to keep it operating at its full potential. The Government funding HRI receives must be reviewed so the money can also go to the community, and not just in prize money. I ask the Minister of State to clarify if the social impact fund provided for in this Bill will be open for community groups like the Clondalkin Equine Club to avail of.</p>

          <p eId="para_564">I welcome any Bill that attempts to address the damaging effects of gambling. There are too many families suffering because of the effect gambling has had on a family member, and by extension, the family itself. A lot of work is carried out under the radar in communities across the country. A centre in County Tipperary recently secured funding to help those with gambling addiction, namely, the Spafield Family Resource Centre in Cashel, where a launch took place a couple of months ago. The services will also be accessible in the Millennium Family Resource Centre in Thurles and the Silver Arch Family Resource Centre in Nenagh.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> We have to be aware of how we are constantly bombarded with gambling advertising. Whether we want to admit it, those advertisements target the weak spots in a person who may be prone to addiction to gambling. It has to be admitted that addiction is involved here. While addiction may have connections with mental health issues, it must also be recognised as requiring specialised support in itself. The social impact fund provided for in the Bill must address the overall shortfall in proper funding of treatment for problem gamblers. The nature of addiction is that it re-emerges given the opportunity and can be hard to resist. We must have adequate funding available for addiction services. Otherwise, people will face constant battles against gambling addictions throughout their lives.</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> That brings me to the prevalence of gambling advertising and access to gambling. The truth of it is that if I want to gamble, all I have to do is pick up my phone. If I have particular apps downloaded then all I need do is tap and the process of bleeding me dry will begin. That is how it can be for many people. Attention should be given to how so many of these apps are designed. It is becoming a known fact that considerable effort is put into the design of these apps, in terms of both the visuals and the interface, to make them more attractive to the user, which also makes it easier to fall down that rabbit hole. This needs addressing. It needs examination, understanding and regulation because it is a sign of an effective technique. I will be interested to see how the gambling regulator addresses this. The technical design of these applications is having an impact that may not be obvious but I understand it is effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">On the issue of the ease with which people can access gambling opportunities, I note that in addition to the rest of his work on gambling, my colleague, Deputy Gould, has moved a Bill to ban online gambling using a credit card.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> I have listened to much of this discussion and it is clear there is a depth of common feeling that cannot be ignored. I hope the Minister of State will take on board the views expressed today because expressing those views and acting on them, where appropriate, is the reason we are all here. Gambling companies cannot think they have done enough by washing their campaigns through the use of public awareness messages. Far more needs to be done. The companies need to shoulder more responsibility and the regulator needs to have the powers and ability to make sure of that. We also need to see more gambling awareness programmes that are free of the industry. Otherwise it will always seem as though there is a potential price to pay for proactive messaging.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> I support this Bill but I want to see it funded in a way that tackles the causes of the problem, assists people with addiction and protects them from the gambling promotion that is virtually everywhere we look. The Minister of State will have heard Deputy Michael Healy-Rae spoke about Timmy in the local shop 20 years ago. That is all fine because Timmy or Mary knew when a person was in trouble. However, every one of us can now access gambling 24 hours per day using our phones. This is having a detrimental effect on families. I urge the Government to support Deputy Gould's Bill, even if it only cut off that end of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> We are coming up to Christmas. As addicts will tell us, it is not even about the winning but just about the thrill of having a bet on. We need to protect families who are caught in that kind of situation. It is so simple. As has been said, these companies spend millions and millions to get the last cent out of someone's pocket. They have no morals or anything else. They do not care about any family or how it will go into Christmas or the new year. We need to tackle them. Tommy and Mary in the betting shop years ago had some bit of understanding of who was in their locality but the big multinationals are in every corner of the world. It is not even about betting to win any more. People can bet on losing a game or, as Deputy Ward said, they can decide to change their bet halfway through a game. The companies need to be tackled as soon as possible.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice (Deputy James Browne)<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T18:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_571">I thank the Deputies and convey to the House my appreciation for its assistance in facilitating the progression of the Gambling Regulation Bill 2022 to this very important Second Stage. I thank everyone for their contributions and support for this important step as we embark on the significant work ahead of us over the coming Stages. Today's debate has afforded us all an opportunity to consider the legislation and matters that require further consideration or reflection as the Bill progresses. It was important to get Second Stage done before Christmas in order that we have time to reflect over Christmas on the contributions from the various Deputies and NGOs that a view on the legislation. The Bill will not go further than Second Stage before Christmas so Deputies will have time to consider the legislation. This is a hugely important and large Bill and we want to ensure we get it right. We will, therefore, take into consideration all of the proposals from Deputies.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> There is very much a consensus in the House on the detrimental effects of gambling addiction and what it does to families. As many Deputies pointed out, it has hidden aspects. If someone has an alcohol or drug addiction, the family can see the person's descent and can try to intervene at an early stage. Very often when someone has a gambling addiction the first the family and loved ones know about it is when the sheriff or Garda is at the door or, God forbid, something even worse has happened. Many people who have lived exemplary lives go off and do stupid things to feed this very serious addiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> The common and important themes to emerge were around the areas of advertising and sponsorship and the impact they have on young people and all age groups. The general call on us was to see if we can go even further. We have sought to strike a balance between limiting sponsorship and advertising insofar as possible without going as far as a full ban. There are concerns that such a ban would lack balance and could have unintended consequences, including perhaps driving gambling underground. I agree with Deputy Gould that the board will have to reflect and have the input of lived experience and cannot consist only of corporate representatives. When we are drafting the terms of reference for the board and inviting people to apply to join it, we will provide that this will be done through the Public Appointments System and the board will have to include a broad range of representation.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> A number of Deputies called for an extension of the social impact fund beyond the areas currently set, namely, research, treatment, awareness and education. Deputy Ward mentioned the Clondalkin Equine Club in that regard. We will certainly consider that possibility but we do not want to risk the social impact fund becoming too diluted. Its primary aim is to tackle gambling addiction but we can certainly consider the various aspects raised. The issues around lack of data and research in this country are very clear and we also need further treatment and education. The levy we put in place to fund the social impact fund will help to tackle some of the serious issues out there.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> Ireland has waited a very long time for this legislation and efforts have been made several times in recent decades to bring forward a new system of regulation for gambling activities and gambling-related services in this country, but to no avail. It is important that we finally have a Bill with real momentum behind it. I recognise that in every contribution today Deputies sought to get the best Bill we can enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> The primary objective of the Bill is to present a framework for a robust regulatory and licensing regime for the gambling sector in Ireland. It provides for the establishment and statutory functions of a body to be known as údarás rialála cearrbhachais na hÉireann or the gambling regulatory authority of Ireland. The authority will be responsible for licensing and regulating gambling to include betting, gaming, certain lotteries; the sale or supply of products or services related to gambling; the imposition of obligations on licensees and other persons, including obligations relating to advertising, promotion and sponsorship for the purposes of safeguarding persons participating in gambling; monitoring and enforcing compliance with obligations imposed on licensees; the prohibition of children participating in gambling or being employed in the gambling industry; the establishment of a national gambling exclusion register; the establishment of a social impact fund; and the funding of the authority by the means of the imposition of a charge on licensees.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> As mentioned earlier, I am hopeful that with the support of both Houses, this Bill will be signed into law and enter into force by mid-2023, with the intention of establishing the authority later next year. The Bill addresses legislative requirements to bring about a comprehensive and necessary form of regulatory and licensing regime for gambling. The co-operation of the House's is much appreciated and I look forward to working with my colleagues over the coming months.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_594">calls on the Government to establish a redress scheme for all homes impacted by Celtic Tiger era building defects as a matter of urgency; and </p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_595">agrees that the redress scheme:</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_596">— should consider expanding the terms of reference of the Pyrite Resolution Board to ensure the scheme opens in early 2023, with amending legislation where required;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_597">— should operate as an end-to-end scheme, similar to the current Pyrite Resolution Board, rather than a grant scheme;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_598">— should prioritise those developments with the greatest level of fire safety and structural risk;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_599">— should provide interim funding for emergency works and short-term measures, such as fire wardens in advance of a full redress;</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_600">— should be retrospective for those forced to pay for remediation of defects in advance of the opening of the scheme; and</p>
          <p class="indent_3" eId="para_601">— must also include social landlords, including local authorities and Approved Housing Bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">I welcome the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to the House. I also welcome to the Public Gallery residents, owners and tenants who live in defective buildings in a number of developments across Dublin city, in Parkwest, Hunters Wood, the Metropolitan apartments and Hyde Square on the South Circular Road. I commend the very good work, in some cases over many years, of the Apartment Owners Network of the Construction Defects Alliance and the more recently established Not Our Fault 100% redress campaign.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">In fact, it was the good work of the Construction Defects Alliance, supported by many of us in the Opposition, that ensured that the manifestos of the political parties, including the Minister's party, in the previous general election and, subsequently, the programme for Government included a commitment to examine the need for a redress scheme and, more generally, to strengthen building control so that the kinds of scandals seen during the Celtic tiger period never happen again. The Minister knows from the report, Safe as Houses?, produced during his time on the then Joint Committee for Housing, Planning and Local Government and Heritage and from other reports he has commissioned that the cause of building defects is twofold. It is shoddy practice within the industry, which was widespread over many years during the Celtic tiger era, but also the light-touch self-regulation introduced by both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil in the 1980s and 1990s, which allowed that shoddy behaviour to take place. The consequence, as the Minister’s independent working group report on defective building shows, is that as many as 100,000 homes could be affected by serious fire safety issues, water ingress, cladding, car parking and other structural defects. I acknowledge the work of the working group. The report is very helpful. I also note the Minister has said he will be bringing a memorandum from his cross-departmental working group of civil servants to Cabinet before the end of the year. I will welcome seeing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_604"> I stress to the Minister that when I talk to homeowners, as I am sure he also does, there is an enormous frustration that two and a half years into this Government, we still do not have a scheme. We have the promise of a scheme, the details and timeline of which we still do not know. For families, particularly families with children, living in fire safety defective buildings or buildings with other structural defects, the wait is simply too long. It is hard to understand why it has taken so long.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> The reason we tabled this motion tonight is to stress in the strongest possible terms that homeowners in many thousands of developments throughout the country, in Belmayne, Beacon South Quarter, Brú na Sionna in County Clare and in the Minister's constituency, many of whom are in the Gallery, need a scheme now. As I have said before, I am concerned that even if the Minister brings a memo to Cabinet before Christmas announcing the broad outline of how he intends to proceed and it takes as long to get it from announcement to opening as the enhanced defective block scheme for the counties affected by pyrite, mica and pyrrhotite is taking, it could be a year or more before a scheme for these homeowners and tenants even opens, let alone before they get any redress. The Minister announced the enhanced defective block scheme a year ago last week and the legislation passed through the Oireachtas over the summer. The regulations are still not complete, however, and we do not expect them to be ready until next year. The local authorities will then have to set up the scheme. There is no significant additional budgetary provision for this year compared with last year. In fact, I have just come from a meeting of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage at which the National Standards Authority of Ireland, NSAI, told us that its review of the statutory instrument underpinning that scheme will not have been completed until 2024. If the same approach is taken for the redress scheme for homeowners with Celtic Tiger era defects, it will be simply too long. For this reason, we need a different approach. </p>
          <p eId="para_606"> I responded to the Minister’s invitation to set out my party's views this week. My strong view is that we need a scheme similar to the pyrite remediation scheme. It needs to be 100% redress end to end. Given the complexities of owners' management companies, OMCs, and the varied ownerships of units in multi-development schemes, the only way for such a scheme to work is for it to be led by an OMC making a request to a State agency for inspections and agreement of works, and for all of the works to be contracted out by that State agency. How the State then deals with issues such as institutional landlords or landlords who own more than one property can be dealt with. However, for owners whose defective apartment is their principal private dwelling, tenancies that are social tenancies and landlords with a single property, there needs to be up-front 100% redress provided through such a Stage agency. I know the Minister does not agree with the suggestion I made before but that may be because he does not fully understand it. While I accept there will be a need for underpinning legislation for a new scheme, the Minister could take the pyrite remediation board, which has an office, staff and expertise, and expand its remit, on an initial non-statutory basis, bring forward the legislation in parallel. That would allow the body to deal with the scheme as it rolls out. It would also allow it to deal with the issue of the provision of emergency funding either to deal with emergency fire safety works that are required now and cannot wait for a scheme or for interim measures. The Minister knows what they are; the Construction Defects Alliance and others have told him. They include additional fire alarms, sprinkler systems and, in some cases, fire wardens. </p>
          <p eId="para_607"> I stress that this scheme must be retrospective. There are people who have paid thousands of euro and in some cases tens of thousands of euro under duress from insurance companies raising premiums or threatening to withdraw them or on the advice of the fire safety authorities. Those people cannot be left behind. They must be included in any scheme and an element of retrospection is required. We know, for example, that landlords who carry out capital works on properties to improve them can write down the cost in their future tax liability. That approach provides a mechanism to give these homeowners 100% redress. </p>
          <p eId="para_608"> I will raise two other issues with the Minister. The first is the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and receivers acting on its behalf. One of the many aspects of this scandal is the appalling way in which NAMA and the receivers engage with OMCs and residents when dealing with defective buildings. Carrickmines Green is one. Brú na Sionna is another. I know NAMA is independent but the Minister for Finance needs to make it clear that the agency needs to take a different approach and work with OMCs and owners to address these issues, not against them.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> I urge the Minister to examine the need for a levy on the profits of large companies. Cairn Homes is one of the most profitable companies in the State. Its director was the director of a company that was responsible for Belmayne. It is unconscionable that Cairn Homes is in receipt of significant state aid in planning permissions and making huge profits, none of which are levied to go towards remediating properties, for example, in Belmayne. I am sure the Minister agrees. I ask him to please give us good news today and work with the Opposition. He should tell us when we are going to get a scheme and give the families in the Gallery today and homeowners like them real redress in 2023.</p>

          <p eId="para_610">As the Minister knows, I live in the epicentre of the defective block crisis in County Donegal. I live in Buncrana on the Inishowen Peninsula. People's lives have been utterly destroyed. Hardly anybody my age who has built or bought a home or was living in a council home has not been devastated by the crisis. No matter where people live in Ireland, whether in Dublin and north Leinster in regard to the pyrite scheme, in communities in this city and throughout Ireland that have been affected by defects or a lack of oversight of the building industry and self-certification, self-regulation, no regulation or light-touch regulation, or in the west where there are victims of defective concrete blocks, although as many as 13 or 14 counties could be affected, the State must deliver 100% redress because these people have done nothing wrong. In good faith, these people engaged in the social contract, whereby you get an education or training, get a job, work hard and build a home, you put your trust in the professionals that your home will be tip-top, you pay your mortgage for however many years and you have a home when you are older. That contract was torn up. Deputy Ó Broin and I spent three hours today at a meeting of the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage discussing the issue of quarries and the lack of regulation. My message to the people in the Gallery is that no matter where they are from in Ireland, if they are victims of the utter failure of this State to regulate and hold these people to account, then they need 100% redress. It is as simple as that. That is natural justice. Everybody, no matter where they live, deserves that.</p>

          <p eId="para_611">Over the last few days, we have been warned about the severe weather conditions in the days ahead. Temperatures as low as -7°C have been mentioned. We are told not to be afraid to turn on the heating, that the Government will help. Now imagine living in a home affected by pyrite or mica in County Mayo or County Donegal with gaping gaps in the walls.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">There is wind and frost coming through where the window frames have detached from the blocks, and they have been looking at this for the last ten winters. Across the State, homeowners and tenants impacted by building defects have to endure another winter. Hundreds of families across Mayo have their lives torn apart by pyrite and the sad thing is that it was totally avoidable. They were the victims of light or no regulation and this was not their fault, so why are we asking them to bear the responsibility for the injustice of pyrite and of defects and for the failure of Government to regulate to protect them? It is as simple as that. Now, there is the failure of Government to recognise the need for 100% redress to replace the homes they paid for.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> This is the problem. We met in Westport about ten days ago with all of the homeowners who have been impacted there. They were given the mortgages by Mayo County Council for homes built by a housing body, so it was oversight by all of the Government bodies. What is happening is that many of them cannot afford to get this work done because it is not 100% and they cannot turn 70%, 80% or 90% into 100%. We have to look at the people we are excluding from the scheme. With regard to the foundations, this conversation has to stop and the foundations have to be included in the repairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_614"> I also want the Minister to talk to the banks. We talked to the banks in the last week about the cap of €500,000 being lifted. I have a letter here from the bank to a homeowner who is impacted by pyrite and who desperately needs some funding to be able to access the scheme. The bank is basically saying no, that there is nothing for the homeowner, there is no equity in the house and it does want to know. There are so many things that need to be fixed in this scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_615">Over many years, many couples have scraped and sacrificed and saved the money they needed to buy their dream home. However, a few years into living in their new home, it has turned into a nightmare because they find their home is not safe to live in. Of course, they cannot sell as they cannot afford the cost of making things right. As has been said, they had no hand, act or part in causing the defects. The people who caused the defects are long gone and the Government wants the residents to pick up the tab for the Government’s light and no-touch regulation. This is what happened in Poolbeg Quay, where the residents had their dream homes turned into a nightmare. The Government needs to step up to the plate and make things right. It needs to commit to a 100% redress scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_616">Today, I have again been speaking to residents from The Oaks in County Westmeath and I commend their perseverance, doggedness and determination to see this through. In 2010, the 32 homes had their insurance cancelled due to identified fire and construction defects. A recent minor but problematic flood damaged walls, floors and furniture and none of it was insured. I am told that The Oaks was inspected by the local authority and two notices were served on the developer, followed by a court case in 2010. The judge ruled that the matter was too serious for the District Court. The local authority said it would take six weeks to prepare a case and requested the case be struck out, and it was, but the situation remained. The residents thought that, following a fire in the development in early 2021, the local authority would finally act definitively, but that was not to be and the situation remains still.</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> The residents of The Oaks have been extremely proactive in attempting to resolve this issue but they have effectively been stonewalled. They do not have a wishlist of outlandish requirements. They want their homes to be safe, to be compliant, to be insurable and to be saleable. As one resident said to me this afternoon:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_618">I am a mother of three, one of whom is autistic. We bought a one-bedroom apartment in 2007. In 2009 we received news about the fire safety issues. We have been renting and paying a mortgage since 2009. We have moved at least ten times. With the rising cost of living, we may have no other option but to move back into that deathtrap. This is a noose around our neck that keeps on tightening.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">That light-touch regulation introduced by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil, and widespread shoddy practice by the building industry during the Celtic tiger, led to these building defects. This Government and previous Governments have failed to deal with that legacy and the practices they facilitated, yet it is residents like those in The Oaks and those in the Visitors Gallery this evening who are left to face the full impact of the failures of others. That is shameful.</p>

          <p eId="para_620">We are talking about the possibility of upwards of 100,000 homes with building defects. Some of my colleagues have already spoken about the human impact and we have to think of that. I am sure the people in the Visitors Gallery can tell the Minister particular stories. It has already been said in the House how people did absolutely nothing wrong. They went out and bought homes, they thought they were doing the right thing, they got their mortgages and they did everything correctly and then, because of the sins of others, they were left in a shameful situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_621"> We know a huge number of people have already been put under considerable pressure in regard to delivering their own solutions because it has been forced on them in regard to fire regulations or insurance. That is why we need a proper scheme and Deputy Ó Broin has done a considerable amount of work in this regard. We know the Safe as Houses? report is, to a degree, accepted by the Government and that there needs to be a redress scheme, and we know the working group was set up in 2021. What we really need to see is delivery because, in fairness, these people have waited far too long. We could have had this debate at any time in the last number of years and we would still be saying the same thing. It is far too long.</p>
          <p eId="para_622"> It happened because of the sins of others. As has been said by almost everyone who spoke, and I imagine it will be repeated almost <i>ad nauseam</i>, the fact is there was little or no regulation. The only place that we can leave that responsibility is with the Government. We need to ensure that we deliver for these people who have done absolutely nothing wrong. What is the alternative? The alternative at one stage, as proposed by the Government in 2016 – I accept it was not the current Minister’s Government - was that these people were personally responsible for this. I commend a significant amount of work done by politicians, but also by residents and by the Construction Defects Alliance, who pushed back in that regard, so we are at least having the correct conversation. The correct conversation is a scheme based on the pyrite resolution scheme and it needs to have 100% redress from end to end.</p>
          <p eId="para_623"> Deputy Mac Lochlainn and others spoke in regard to the difficulties that exist concerning the defective blocks scheme. That is a case where the Government almost went the journey that was necessary but failed at the final hurdle. We need to ensure that does not happen again. We know that speed is of the essence. Once again, we are in this Chamber and we are talking about failures. We can talk in very general terms about failures but they are not very general terms for the people in the Visitors Gallery, who have been impacted and who are living on a day-by-day basis with houses and homes that are not safe or fit for purpose due to, I repeat, mistakes that others made and that were not their responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> Let us be clear because we have all said it many times before: what people expect of a Government is that it is there to have their back and to ensure that the correct regulations are in play. We need to ensure we can deliver for people so they are safe in the sense that they can go out and buy houses and that all of the necessary due diligence and regulation has been done, and if there are people who have failed to comply with the necessary rules, they are brought to task. Not only do we need this resolution scheme in place, we also need to make sure we root out problems and ensure we have the necessary regulation so this never happens again. It is beyond time. We need to deliver now for these people.</p>

          <from>Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Darragh O'Brien)<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T18:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_625">First, I welcome the residents who are here this evening for this important debate and, indeed, the representatives of the Construction Defects Alliance and the Apartment Owners Network. I welcome the opportunity to debate this. It is important and I am not opposing the motion. There are elements within it that I do not agree with, specifically around the area of the pyrite resolution board, which Deputy Ó Broin and I debated last week.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">We need bespoke legislation to underpin this scheme. We cannot fit a square peg in a round hole. The scheme will be with us for many years, unfortunately. Obviously, I will be seeking the co-operation and support of Members opposite when we bring forward that legislation but it is also about what we do in the interim.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> To take it back a step, thousands of residents in Dublin Fingal, the area I represent, have been affected by issues such as this - by construction defects or fire defects. I have worked and campaigned on this since the first day I came into the Dáil back in 2007. When Fianna Fáil was in opposition and I was its spokesperson on housing, I called for a scheme to be put in place and for us to work together to help residents not just to put their homes back together, but to put their lives back together. That is why, in the programme for Government negotiations, we sought and received a firm and clear commitment that this nettle of construction defects will be grasped and dealt with once and for all.</p>
          <p eId="para_628"> We established the working group, which I commend on its work. There is an element of the motion that is probably about political point-scoring but that is fine; I understand it from the position of the Opposition. No one sat on their hands on this issue. We established the working group, made up of residents and other stakeholders, and it did really important work. It set its own terms of reference. Given the importance of its work, I did not pressure it into finishing the report sooner or speeding it up. Some 28,000 homes participated in the survey. For the first time, we have a proper handle on the type of defects, their scale and scope, and the breakdown within that. That was a very important piece of work. I received in the report in July, read it and looked at the recommendations in detail, and then brought it to the Cabinet on 27 September. The report found what many of us present know to be the case - that fire defects are the most prevalent of the defects. It is estimated that between 40% and 70% of the properties are affected by fire defects. Water ingress affected between 20% and 50%, while structural defects, though still very important, affected somewhat fewer, at between 5% and 25%. We now have a handle on the average cost, although some residents are being presented with bills well in excess of that amount. The average cost is approximately €25,000 per unit, which means a potential cost to the Exchequer of between €1.5 billion and €2.5 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> I am acutely aware that many residents have already remediated their homes. Approximately 12% to 14% of the properties have been fixed and made safe and approximately 34% of other affected properties are either in the process of being fixed or are planning for that to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> There are many elements within this and we need the scheme that is set up to be robust. I have engaged the Housing Agency, which I see playing a central role in the establishment of a scheme. It is already working on the implementation of the recommendations that have been presented. I wish to inform residents, their representatives and the Deputies who are present - this is important - that I intend to bring a further memorandum, setting out the recommendations I will make in that regard, to the Government in advance of the recess. I assure the residents that the Government will help. We will help them to get their homes and lives back together, but we need a robust scheme and it will take a bit of time to bring the legislation forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_631"> In the meantime, however, as we discussed in the House last week, there will be interim measures we can take, subject to approval, and we should take them. The hundreds, if not thousands, of people right across the country whom I have met in respect of construction defects deserve that response and help from the Government, and they will get it. I assure them of that. </p>
          <p eId="para_632"> There are other elements within this. It is not just a question of how we structure the scheme; it is about how it will be rolled out and how we categorise the different defects within it, such as in the case of the different apartment blocks and estates that are affected. We will do so using the principle of remediating the worst first. We will then have to deal with the issue of certification. We will need to ensure that when work is done, it is properly certified so that homes can be insured and brought back to their value and, should a homeowner so wish, be resold.</p>
          <p eId="para_633"> We then have to consider the scope of the scheme. Should it just cover principal private residences? I do not believe so. We should employ the same approach we took with the defective concrete block scheme, under which applicants were permitted to apply to the scheme in respect of an additional property registered with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB. I am acutely aware that many social homes, such as homes owned by approved housing bodies, also need to be remediated.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> As regards the scale of this issue, there are probably up to 100,000 homes that will need to be remediated to varying degrees. The idea that we should just rush forward with some type of sticking plaster approach to this is not one I share. We have to do this in a deliberate and structured fashion that will be robust. This scheme will probably be in place for approximately ten years. That is my estimation of how long it will take to bring these homes and apartments back to where they ought to have been when the residents bought them. The residents have found themselves in this situation through no fault of their own. I agree with the Deputies in that regard. As housing Minister, I have engaged regularly with residents on an individual basis as well as with the Construction Defects Alliance directly and the Apartment Owner Network as recently as this evening. They have been very important to this process and ensuring we move it onwards, get an understanding of the issues and, most important, work towards the implementation of the recommendations. Those recommendations will be subject to Cabinet approval. I assure all present that I want that work to be concluded before the end of the year. The second part of this relates to measures we can implement in the short term, in advance of the legislation passing. The pyrite remediation legislation will not work in this instance. We need separate legislation and regulation. I believe there are measures we can take in a very short space of time, however, particularly in the area of fire defects. There are two other stakeholders or parts of the sector that also need to be part of the solution. Yes, one of those is the banks, and we have engaged with them. The second is the insurance sector. The excess levels on insurance policies held by residents of some apartment blocks are now set so high that it nearly deems those apartments uninsured. I have engaged directly with Insurance Ireland. We have had a positive engagement there. We need to consider apartment blocks that have already been remediated and what the change in insurance status has been from pre-remediation to post-remediation.</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> The issue of retrospection has to be considered. It will form part of the memorandum I will bring to the Government. It is a complex issue. We need to make sure works that have been done were carried out by qualified people and certified appropriately. I assure those who have taken the time to come here this evening to listen to this debate that I, as Minister, am absolutely committed to bringing this scheme forward, getting Cabinet approval for it, moving on interim measures that can assist people now, and then moving forward with the legislation to put the scheme on a solid basis from which we can move on.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> I will make two final points. I wish to briefly address the issues in respect of defective blocks, which do not form part of the motion but are as important. I will be meeting Donegal County Council again tomorrow. I will be meeting representatives of the Mica Action Group tomorrow. We are seeing more people access the scheme, and that is to be welcomed. The scheme is moving forward. I brought the scheme forward and it was passed by this Dáil. The Government is committed to helping in that space as well. How we structure it and how we start it will be so important. There will be measures we can take forward on an interim basis. It will require redress for residents. There is no question about that. I will continue to make good on the commitment we put into the programme for Government - to grasp this nettle once and for all, make people's homes safe and allow them to get back on with their lives. I campaigned for that in opposition and I am now in a position to do something about it as housing Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">I respectfully ask for the co-operation of all Members of the Opposition to make sure we can bring forward that legislation as expeditiously as possible. That is important I welcome the opportunity to debate this matter. I will certainly update colleagues in the Dáil post my bringing that memo to Cabinet at the end of this month.</p>

          <p eId="para_643">I welcome, as have others, the owners and residents in the Gallery and those who are watching from home, some from my constituency of Dublin South-Central, including residents of The Crescent in Park West, Metropolitan Apartments, the Tramyard and many other apartment blocks and housing complexes. People, not just from my constituency but throughout the country, are facing demands of tens of thousands of euro to carry out even initial repairs to make safe the homes they thought were their own and were secure and fire safe when they purchased them. That is without the €40,000 and €50,000 that will follow as a demand. The demand in The Crescent is €67,000 per home. Nobody I know among those who own those properties has that to foot up. We are in a housing and cost-of-living crisis and yet that is the demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_644"> We know who caused the problem. We know that developers and builders took shortcuts and risked the lives of people who are now in those homes. We need an immediate announcement from the Government. I welcome what the Minister said but we need the scheme to offer 100% redress and to be retrospective. That would allow the management companies, residents and owners take immediate steps to make their apartments safe and to draw down money, if they can. If the Government announces that, those people can probably go to the banks. The Minister said he talked to the banks. One of the solutions needs to be that they can draw down money from the banks, once the Government has indicated the scheme will offer 100% redress and will be retrospective.</p>
          <p eId="para_645"> If we are to wait months or years, we are asking those people to stay in properties that are not safe. The State is asking that. The Government has an opportunity to take immediate action. We are asking residents to sleep in their beds, while worrying and continuing to stress about the building around them. We need to take further steps a lot more quickly than the Minister indicated. Even though progress has been made, we need that scheme to be made retrospective immediately.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Crowe<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T19:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_646">The Minister said he understood the problem. The next step is to try to resolve it. He said it cannot be done in a rushed fashion and he mentioned that it might take up to ten years. I do not think anyone I have talked to, and there are a number of affected residents in my constituency, including in Ballycullen, Citywest and Rathfarnham, can wait that long. They are terrified, afraid and extremely angry because there is common agreement that homeowners are not responsible for defects that are due to light-touch building control.</p>
          <p eId="para_647"> The really galling thing is that developers can walk away, liquidate their company, reinvent themselves and start trading across the road. There is something sick in a society that allows that. There is something wrong with corporate Ireland if that is the way we will allow things to continue to go on. That is what is happening at present. Many of these developers made significant sums of money during the Celtic tiger. Many of them liquidated themselves and, as I said, have reinvented themselves under the names of their sons or daughters, or even just changed the name or initial of their companies to reinvent themselves. The challenge for the owners is they are then left with that property.</p>
          <p eId="para_648"> Let us talk about the owners. Some of them downsized and moved to apartments believing that now that their mortgage was cleared they would be able to retire and get on with their lives. They are now faced with this huge worry. We need to do more to support them. It is not acceptable that developers can walk away. It is about 100% redress. It is about coming up with a scheme that works. It has to be fast and deliver for ordinary people. The common message we can all agree on is that we need to come up with ideas and we need ideas soon.</p>

        <speech by="#DessieEllis" eId="spk_168">
          <from>Deputy Dessie Ellis<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T19:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_649">Tens of thousands of homeowners throughout the country are faced with the prospect of having to find large sums of money to pay for essential remediation works on homes and apartments that have a range of structural defects, including fire safety issues, with either poorly installed or no fire stopping with fire resistant materials in openings or joints between walls and floors, water ingress leading to leaky roofs and water running down the inside of windows leading to mould and dampness in rooms. Campaign groups have estimated that as many as 100,000 homeowners living in homes constructed between 1991 and 2013 are affected by a range of defects that will require urgent repair and refurbishment. It is also estimated that up to 90,000 residences are affected by fire safety defects. In this time of economic uncertainty and a cost-of-living crisis, who would be able readily to find the huge sums being demanded to fix problems not of residents' making?</p>
          <p eId="para_650"> In my constituency of Dublin North-West, some newly built homes constructed as part of the Ballymun regeneration project in Owensilla, Silloge and parts of the Carton area, suffered damage caused by the defective building material pyrite. A total of 274 houses and apartments in these developments were found to be defective and most of these have been remediated by Dublin City Council. In some cases, the State's regulatory regime allowed errant behaviour by developers who built poor-quality residences. This proved costly to both the State and the council, which had to shoulder the cost to correct these defects.</p>
          <p eId="para_651"> We are in a housing emergency but 58 apartments in the Prospect Hill complex in Finglas have been lying idle for more than 15 years. Construction began in 2004 on council-owned land. The builders entered into an agreement with Dublin City Council to supply it with 150 affordable homes and 35 senior citizen apartments. Those builders went into receivership in 2012. In 2014, repairs and refurbishment were to be carried out by Clúid, which was to begin allocating the apartments to families. These apartments are still lying idle and were later found to be non-compliant with fire safety standards. In recent years, they have been transferred to Dublin City Council. Area E, the Dublin City Council area in which they are located, has a huge housing waiting list and a homeless problem. It is beyond belief that these apartments continue to be vacant.</p>

          <from>Deputy Martin Browne<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T19:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_652">I welcome all the homeowners who are in the Gallery. I also recognise them for the pressure they have exerted over the years to get us to this point. As this motion suggests, there is some way to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">We must ensure that the right path is taken so that homeowners are compensated fully and as swiftly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_654"> Under 20% of Tipperary's total number of apartment duplexes constructed between 1991 and 2016 were represented in the report of the Working Group to Examine Defects in Housing. This is a significant number. As the organisations involved would agree, the full extent of the problem is not known, so it would be remiss of me not to speak on this motion in the interests of my constituents.</p>
          <p eId="para_655"> Sinn Féin believes that the homeowners and tenants are not responsible for these defects. The Safe as Houses? report argued that the light-touch regulation introduced by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and the shoddy practices in the industry during the Celtic tiger led to common defects. Those affected should not be picking up the bill just to make their homes safe. Thankfully, the Construction Defects Alliance has not let up in its campaign. With the support of us and others, it has forced the current Government to move away from the position of the Fine Gael minority Government that tried to put the burden on the homeowners and tenants. After two and a half years, though, the current Government has provided no clarity on a redress scheme. If one is introduced on the same basis as the enhanced defective concrete blocks scheme, homeowners may not be able to access it and receive funding for remediation until 2024 at the earliest. Never mind a sticking plaster solution; just introduce a scheme for which these families do not need to wait another two years. This is why we are calling on the Government to establish a redress scheme urgently for all impacted homes, to expand the terms of reference of the Pyrite Resolution Board, to ensure the scheme opens in 2023 and to provide interim funding for emergency works in the meantime. The scheme must be retrospective for those forced to pay for the remediation of defects and prioritise those developments with the greatest levels of fire safety and structural risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_656"> People who have put their lives' investments into these properties should not be asked to bear the burden of poor building controls and regulation by previous Governments led by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.</p>

          <p eId="para_657">I thank Sinn Féin for tabling this important motion. I welcome those in the Public Gallery who are directly affected by this issue. I can only imagine what they are thinking listening to this debate. Possibly, it is that they have heard all of this before.</p>
          <p eId="para_658"> It is difficult to think of another national scandal that displays the worst of what Ireland is and has been. Moneyed developers maximised their profits, often by lobbying for the political system to bow to them. In many instances, they constructed fire traps. They let people buy these at exorbitant prices and, as has been rightly said, they then liquidated, reimagined, renamed and re-established themselves and never had to take responsibility for what they did.</p>
          <p eId="para_659"> A number of aspects strike those of us who deal with families in this situation. The first is the fear they are living with constantly. They go to bed looking at the ceilings and walls around them that they are mentally at war with because they believe that where they live could kill them. There is a sense of guilt that they are raising their families in apartments that could kill them. The worst part is that they cannot even talk about it because they are worried about the reputational damage the apartment block or area would suffer. They want to be careful in their language in case the media reports on these death traps, leading to the investments they have made and the mortgages they have been paying effectively becoming worthless. It is a devastating set of circumstances. This national scandal has cost lives. I remember a man called Fiachra Daly. At the height of the Priory Hall scandal, he took his own life because of the pressure that he and his family were under.</p>
          <p eId="para_660"> Whenever the history of this situation is written, it will rank as one of the major national scandals in terms of how badly Ireland and politics in this country worked and how much power these developers had to change the political, planning and regulatory systems to get what they wanted and build what they wanted to whatever standard they wanted in order to maximise their profits. As soon as anything came back to their door, they just changed who they were to avoid taking responsibility and kept going. It is remarkable. When you sit down with these families and ask who they can take a case against, it turns out that they cannot because the cowboys who built the homes that could kill them do not exist anymore. The families cannot talk about it because they are worried that the reputational damage will hurt their investments and they hope that some work can be done to repair their properties before they ever have to discuss the situation. It is a vice grip on people's bodies, minds and families.</p>
          <p eId="para_661"> The families in the Public Gallery, those I am dealing with and thousands more are dependent on - I was going to say the Minister, but he is correct - us. They do not want to hear a political squabble, point scoring and us one-upping one another. We are probably at a better stage now in terms of getting somewhere towards resolving the situation than we were in recent years. I do not want people who are listening to this debate in the Public Gallery to go home angry and just angry. They need to go home from this debate feeling that they might get somewhere. When they heard "ten years", I am sure it broke their hearts a little.</p>

          <p eId="para_663">I accept that, but we have to be careful. When we speak about timelines, we need to be sure that we can bring people on board and they can have a level of hope.</p>
          <p eId="para_664"> I agree with other Deputies who stated that we must discuss absolute redress and consider the situation retrospectively over the past 30 years or so. We must also ensure as a collective that this scandal never happens again. In the current discourse, it appears that a political representative cannot have an opinion on any planned apartment complex in any part of the country, but it is only fair and reasonable that the political system work to be as critical and strongly observant of what developers do today as ever.</p>
          <p eId="para_665"> I wish to focus on the solutions. We want to work with the Minister in a timely manner and to ensure that funding is available to fix not just these homes, but these lives. We want to ensure that parents who are concerned about their children growing up in entities that could seriously harm them can have the prospect in a short time of resting their heads on their pillows and not worrying. This issue is soul destroying and life defining. Imagine reaching 60, 65 or 70 years of age, looking back on your life and realising that, for 20 years or more of it, you were terrified going to bed every night and waking up every morning and you paid thousands of euro because you did nothing more than make the mistake of trusting someone who sold you a home that they had undergone the process to ensure it worked.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">The families have heard all this rhetoric before. We want a system that works, that is timely and that is funded. We do not want anyone to have to put their hands in their pockets. We want justice from those entities that did this in the first place. We want to ensure this never ever happens again. It is a national scandal and on the same level as any other national scandal we have ever dealt with in these Houses. It must be treated as such and we must all work with the Minister to get answers and justice for the families present and for any other families affected by this issue. I refer as well to those families who do not even realise they have been affected. In the case of my constituency, I do not even feel as if I can list off the apartment blocks and residents groups I have been dealing with. On one level, I am not sure if they would thank me. This is the level of fear we are dealing with. I hope the Minister appreciates this point. We all have a responsibility to get this right and to get it right soon.</p>

          <from>Deputy Cian O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T19:30:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_667">I join with others in welcoming everyone in the Gallery and everyone watching these proceedings. I wish to make several points, the first following on from where Deputy Ó Ríordáin finished in respect of ensuring this never happens again. This afternoon, we had representatives from the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office, NBCMSO, the National Standards Authority of Ireland and the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage before the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage to discuss the issue of quarries and defective materials. Two points arose from that discussion that should not be the case if all of us are 100% committed to ensuring this never happened again.</p>
          <p eId="para_668"> First, we could not get a clear answer from the Department regarding how many people work in building control in local authorities. I, and other Deputies, have tabled written questions to the Minister on this issue. The question of how many people are working to ensure something like this never happens again is important. How many people are working in inspecting new developments and buildings is something the Minister and the Department should be interested in, have oversight of and be concerned about. Yet the response we got was that the Department does not keep this kind of information. If we are all committed to this type of monitoring, the very least we should have is oversight of this at national level. We should have full information in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_669"> The second issue of note stemming from the committee meeting relates to the resources available for building control and the NBCMSO, which is doing excellent work. In as much as the representatives of any public agency will ever say this, because they are under pressure not to, but as much as it could be said, given they do that job really well and they are highly committed, it was clear that this is a small team that could be resourced better. When we think of the devastation and stress caused to individuals and families and the billions of euro in costs incurred because of this issue, it is inexplicable that the NBCMSO, which does important work, would be under-resourced. This must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_670"> Turning to accountability for developers, which other Deputies have mentioned, one thing could be done now if the Government were serious about this issue. Some of the developers involved made great profits from selling homes, marketing them and an entire lifestyle to go with them, and then shut down those companies once this difficulty arose. They then set up new companies and are making large profits again. Cairn Holmes was referred to earlier. Its operating profits this year are predicted to run to €200 million. The company's revenue increased by 84% in the first six months of this year. This to give an example of just one large developer. One thing that could be done now to ensure people can no longer hide behind company law is to amend it in the context of residential construction and ensure that directors are accountable for what companies do. Winding up companies should not be a get out of jail free card for them. This would bring some accountability to the system. Another action would be to ensure that developers must have latent defects insurance to operate and build. I tabled amendments to this effect to legislation passed by the Government in the past year. Unfortunately, the Government did not support my proposed amendments. If, however, latent defects insurance was required, that would mean that anyone building shoddy homes simply would not be able to get insurance. This would remove them from the system and provide some support for residents caught in this type of situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_671"> There has been some good discussion concerning the timeframes in this regard. There is great urgency with this process. People's lives are on hold. It is difficult for them to deal with this situation, and all the stress it produces and, at the same time, progress all the other aspects of their lives. There is, therefore, an urgency in this regard. No one is asking for a rushed job here. We want this done properly, but as quickly as possible. There is agreement that this should be done on a statutory basis and that legislation should be put in place. I have not heard anyone argue otherwise. This should, though, be done as fast as we can. These mistakes came from rushed building and a sticking plaster attitude to construction. There is no reason to fail have a robust and quick response to this issue that is also well worked out. Many of these issues arose ten and more years ago. It has been almost three years since the last election. To expect measures to be in place is not expecting too much in terms of urgency regarding dealing with this issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_672"> Regarding what needs to happen, some excellent proposals have been put forward by the Construction Defects Alliance and the Apartment Owners' Network. One concerned remediation and the urgent need for it. Another was that inclusion is important in the context of retrospective measures. Anyone who has carried out expensive works should be included in the scheme. It would be blatantly unfair otherwise. It is also important to think about that issue in terms of apartment complexes and how they are run by volunteer directors serving on owners' management companies, OMCs. Many of these have major difficulties in collecting management fees and running those companies. Putting this extra burden on them will be a heavy weight to bear. The remediation scheme must recognise the reality these people are experiencing, namely, that some of these OMCs have difficulty collecting management fees. If the scheme, therefore, excludes some of the homes and owners, this will make it unworkable for some of the OMCs. Regarding the Minister's comments concerning how far it will be extended, there is a need for upfront funding for apartment blocks. For any of the multi-unit owners, then, trying to find a way of clawing this back through the taxation system would be the way forward. Partial funding for most will just not work. It would mean this situation will drag for many more years and put the volunteers running the OMCs under even more pressure. As the Minister will be aware, in some places, because of all the stress stemming from the impact of that issue, the directors have resigned. This leaves an OMC in a weaker position. New directors may come in with less experience and all the resulting issues that then creates. There is a strong case that this scheme should be run like the Pyrite Resolution Board. This is a good model. We should learn from its experience and expertise accrued. It would also be more cost-effective if this process was one where the repairs were overseen by the Pyrite Resolution Board, or its successor, rather than putting all this responsibility on the OMCs.</p>
          <p eId="para_673"> The Minister said that he is going to bring interim measures forward. When will that happen, given that they will be interim? In the context of the timelines in this regard, when is the legislation going to come through? When is the scheme going to be up and running?</p>
          <p eId="para_674">The least that people in this situation deserve is concrete information on that from the Minister in terms of their lives being on hold.</p>
          <p eId="para_675"> Let us reflect on our housing system. People pay some of the highest prices in Europe for homes. Developers make huge profits. The regulation system has been incredibly weak. Even now, especially given what we heard this afternoon, everything is not being done to ensure that we do not have a repeat of this. There have been improvements in regulation, but are we doing our best in terms of regulation? Do we have independent inspections in place? We do not have a national building control agency, which is needed. We do not have the requirement for latent defects insurance. We do not have those changes in company law to hold directors of construction companies that do this to account so that they cannot hide behind closing down a company. There are immediate things that should be done now to rectify that.</p>

          <p eId="para_676">I wish to share time with Deputy Boyd Barrett.</p>
          <p eId="para_677"> I welcome everybody into the Gallery. It is not our Gallery; it is theirs. It is always good to see the public come in to the Parliament because it has that dynamic of putting manners on lots of people in here. They are very welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_678"> I thank Sinn Féin for tabling the motion prior to the end of the year because it is hugely important that we discuss this. I doubt it will be our last discussion on the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> On the previous occasion we had a discussion on this, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, was sitting where the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is and he replied to Deputy Paul Murphy, who has been working closely with representatives of the Not Our Fault campaign who are in the Gallery, that no matter what the Government does, it will not be good enough for People Before Profit, and that we will not accept anything. We and the campaigners will accept 100% redress. That is what they will accept and People Before Profit will be happy when they see that delivered. Tonight, the Minister should at least give a commitment to the people in the Gallery that they will be treated no differently from the other groups that have been failed by the State - the mica groups and the pyrite groups - which had to campaign to get justice.</p>
          <p eId="para_680"> It is about the State's failure. I will not take lectures from other Deputies about point scoring. It is important to talk about the truth of what happened here. The "RTÉ Investigates" programme did a lot to bring it out. When we talk about estates failure, it is not an oversight. It is not a lapse, a blunder or somebody forgetting to look at something. It was a deliberate policy of both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to treat builders and developers with kid gloves, allow them to self-regulate and, therefore, put these people into this position. Those parties do not stop there. They have rezoned lands for them and they have more or less married the developer and the building industry in a way that is shocking and unbelievable. We must move away from that legacy. The Minister's commitment tonight to these people that he will give them 100% redress, he will work out a formula, it will be legislated for, etc., would be a fantastic Christmas gift or Christmas payback to people who deserve it. It is no exaggeration to say that the housing crisis and the defective apartment crisis both have their roots in the same problem, that is, the closeness of the political establishment to the developer-led and builder-led model, and we should start by recognising 100% redress is what is needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_681"> I want to address some other issues around the report itself. We welcome most elements of the report, particularly regarding the scale of the revelations as to the number of homes involved. However, it is quite clear to anyone who watched the "RTÉ Investigates" special that the builders and developers knew exactly how to build apartments. It was in their plans and those plans were signed off by local authorities and professionals. They did not build them in the way they were meant to build them, not because of complexities of buildings but because it was cheaper and they could make more profits by taking shortcuts. To suggest otherwise is misleading and an attempt to obscure who is responsible and why they are responsible.</p>
          <p eId="para_682"> The infuriating omission from the report is the refusal and the discouragement of any attempt to seek out who is responsible for the massive number of defective apartments. The report only states that many developments were done by special purpose vehicles or that developers-builders may have gone out of business. This is speculative and not based on any attempt by the report and its authors to find out who was behind the defective apartments and whether many of them are still operating. There are people in the Gallery to whom I have spoken who face a €65,000 plus bill to remediate their homes that are dangerous to live in and they can look out their window across a field from the apartment and see the developer who built their home building another complex today. They know who it is. It would not take rocket science on the part of the State to find out exactly who it is and to go after them. They have not disappeared into the ether. They have not been teleported to another dimension. They are still very much involved in the trade and working in the industry. Most importantly, they knowingly put the lives of 100,000 people, or a big chunk of them, at risk by not living up to the standards, particularly around fire protection. Cutting costs to maximise profits was what they were all about.</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> It might be worth our while looking across the water to what happened in Britain post Grenfell where a tax was placed on the profits of the residential development industry. We need to look at a long-term tax on the industry's profits that is designed in a way that they cannot pass on the cost and that there is no escaping from it. In the meantime, it behoves the Minister to say that the State will own up to its failures and give the reassurance and the 100% redress required by these people because of the culture that exists. We have a culture that led us this week to Liberty Lane where 27 young students lived in danger because a builder thought it was okay to break the law and create a defective apartment block for them that he was charging €500 to €700 a month for, and that was totally illegal. All those students face eviction on Friday because it is not safe to live in those apartments. The fire officer is extraordinarily worried about them. The builder has walked away with approximately €16,000 a month of their money. I believe they are owed that money back. The State needs to do much more to recreate a culture where builders and developers are held accountable and where there are consequences for them when they put lives and livelihoods at risk.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T19:40:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_684">I have little to add to what Deputy Smith said on the substantive issue except to encourage those in the Construction Defects Alliance, the Apartment Owners' Network and all those campaigning on this issue to keep up their battle. It is because they have campaigned that they are forcing this discussion in this House and that they will force the Government to give them the 100% redress they want and deserve, and accountability for those profit-hungry cowboys who were let off the leash by successive Governments. The fact that the Government let these people off the leash who were willing to leave the homeowners with the trauma of unsafe buildings and huge financial costs means the Government owes them. The Minister needs to give that commitment tonight. He needs to engage every step of the way with the people in the Gallery and the other groups to ensure at an absolute minimum they get the 100% redress that the mica campaigners and the pyrite campaigners fought for, and accountability for the rogues and cowboys who did this.</p>
          <p eId="para_685"> In the brief time I have available, I will address another group and pose a series of questions which the Minister probably does not have the answer to. Information has been brought to me to the effect that the Housing Agency is now suspending payments and further leases to Home For Life, the private entity that was set up in 2007 and approved to do mortgage to rent for people with mortgages in distress, on the basis that it has not done repairs to defects in buildings. Hundreds of people had their homes bought by Home for Life and Home for Life is getting paid rent by local authorities. Those people are, therefore, now local authority tenants.</p>
          <p eId="para_686">As I understand it this is because defects were not being remedied and repairs were not being done. It poses the question as to whether hundreds of people in Home for Life are living in unsafe buildings. We need to find this out quickly. Did the local authorities that did the arrangements for Home for Life do the surveys they were supposed to do? They were supposed to inspect those houses within 90 days to make sure the repairs had been done. Certainly in the cases I have come across this did not happen. Are hundreds of people living in unsafe places? Were the local authorities at fault for not doing proper surveys? What was Home for Life doing? Essentially it had cornered the market for mortgage to rent but was not willing to put in the money to remedy structural defects and other problems that may render the houses unsafe.</p>
          <p eId="para_687"> What will now happen if Home for Life is in trouble? The Minister needs to come back to me on this. I do not expect answers tonight. If the company is in trouble, what will happen to the 480 people approved for mortgage to rent to prevent the repossession of their homes and the more than 700 people in Home for Life who may have defects or problems that need to be remedied? The State has to remedy these defects and protect these people if Home for Life has let them down and if council and statutory regulations were not adequate to protect them.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Canney<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T19:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_688">I welcome the opportunity to contribute again on this particular problem that has developed over a good few years. There are people in the Gallery who are on the front line and affected by the problems and the defects that have arisen. It will cost the State an awful lot of money to put this right but that is what it has to do. We have to make sure that everybody is taken care of and that the people who have defective houses and apartments are put right. I get emails, as I am sure does everyone else, from people who own apartments that have been found to be defective. They are looking at bills of €80,000 or €90,000 to put them right. They cannot afford this and it is not right. We need to bite the bullet on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_689"> I would like to concentrate on the regulations in place. I come from a construction background and I believe we have plenty of regulations. We have plenty of people who can write a certificate. We have plenty of people who get well paid for all of that. What we do not have is proper building control. We all speak about building controls as if they are happening but they are not. Local authorities are not resourced to carry out building controls in the way they should. The construction of houses and apartments has become complicated, with far more services going into the buildings. There is a greater chance that people will miss out on sealing all of barriers required for fireproofing and certification. This needs significant and independent building control. If we are serious about not repeating these mistakes, we need to make sure we fund our local authorities properly so they can carry out inspections. There should not be just one or two building officers in each local authority. That is tokenism and will not work. There needs to be enforcement. It needs to be seen to be there and felt to be there so that people will not even contemplate taking a shortcut in construction.</p>
          <p eId="para_690"> Another issue that continues to gall me is structural guarantee insurance bonds. Banks require people who are buying houses and apartments to have this in place. There are structural guarantee schemes whereby people pay €500 or €600 for an insurance policy that is not worth the paper it is written on. However, the banking system and the local authority home loans system continue to insist on having these structural guarantee schemes in place. The householder has to pay €600 or €700 for the joy of getting a piece of paper that is flushed down the toilet the minute something happens or goes wrong. There is no one there to carry out work on the structural defects. It is terrible that this continues to be how we deal with matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_691"> We have another issue that has never been discussed much here, although I have raised it on several occasions. A large number of private housing schemes in this country are serviced by wastewater treatment plants built by the contractors and developers. The same wastewater treatment plants are in limbo because Irish Water is refusing to take them in charge. Local authorities are also refusing to have anything to do with them. The residents are left with the maintenance and all that goes wrong with this type of equipment. They have to fix it. Earlier his evening I spoke to residents who are having a meeting tonight about their estate and what they will do. They are faced with a problem whereby money needs to be spent on sewage treatment and they do not have it. They pay the local property tax and all the other taxes they should pay. They paid stamp duty when they bought the properties, yet Irish Water, the local authorities and the Government are refusing to recognise that there is an environmental time bomb in this regard. The people living on these estates do not have the resources to manage these treatment plants. Once and for all we have to grasp this nettle to make sure everybody in the country is given a fair hand and a fair house to live in.</p>

          <from>Deputy Peter Fitzpatrick<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T19:50:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_692">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue. A working group report that examined defects in housing found that a lack of fire safety material, structural defects and water ingress are likely to affect up to 80% of apartments and duplexes built between 1991 and 2013 in the Celtic tiger era, which equates to between 62,500 and 100,000 homes. This percentage is shocking.</p>
          <p eId="para_693"> People save for years to purchase a property. Fire safety defects are among the most significant issues, specifically in apartment blocks. It is common that solicitors or lenders insist on a survey prior to purchase, whereby an inspection is carried out of the unit being purchased but not communal areas. However, in one case fire defects that were subsequently highlighted are costing owners in an apartment block up to €70,000 to repair on top of paying €2,450 per annum in management fees. This is in a building that received a fire certificate two years before the build. The problem is that fire certificates were approved and granted to developers based on submitted plans. No further inspection or follow up was carried out to ensure compliance with the plans. Defective construction work is in breach of building contracts but it is common for developers to claim liquidation, set up a new company and build down the road from the defective buildings. That is not right.</p>
          <p eId="para_694"> The homeowners are not responsible for these defects. Light-touch building control regulation by the Government and shoddy practice in the construction industry were the cause of these defects, yet the homeowners are being made to pay for these errors and the crooked developers are getting away with it scot-free. There should be no statute of limitations for developers who are no longer deemed liable. They are working the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_695"> It is only right and just that tenants are seeking to recoup the cost of remedial works in the form of 100% redress. The report of the working group to examine defects in housing outlines options for the creation and financing of a redress scheme for those affected, with the cost of remediating these defects estimated to be as high as €2.5 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_696"> A redress scheme for all homes impacted by Celtic tiger-era building defects needs to be set up as a matter of urgency. There is growing frustration among homeowners and tenants due to the delay in bringing forward an appropriate redress scheme. Homeowners may be unable to access such a scheme and receive funding for remediation until 2024 at the earliest due to the slow pace in bringing forward legislation and regulations and the lack of any provision for such a scheme in budget 2023. That is not good enough. I agree that current legislation on such schemes, including measures such as the Pyrite Resolution Board, could be amended to advance redress more rapidly. Additionally, in the interim, funding for emergency works and short-term measures should be made available in advance of a full redress.</p>
          <p eId="para_697"> An additional point that should be prioritised is that the scheme should be retrospective for those forced to pay for remediation of defects in advance of the opening of a redress scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">These are people’s lives we are talking about. What if, God forbid, something similar to Grenfell happens? This situation is breaching their rights to life and their rights to adequate housing. Let us stop playing a political game of football. Why do we continue to gloss over problems rather than getting to their route cause? Yes, there have been more thorough inspections implemented within the construction industry, but more needs to be done in terms of building control regulations. We also must ensure that latent defect insurance policies apply to cover homeowners against defects that cannot be perceived on purchase.</p>
          <p eId="para_699"> Would it not be beneficial to invest in a new building control scheme that would be independent and that would ensure that building regulations were met? With the housing crisis rising, we need to ensure that any new builds are compliant and are safe. We need a timeframe for redress for affected homeowners and we need this now.</p>
          <p eId="para_700"> A home is not just a home. A home is a meeting place for family and friends. Many of these people have children who cannot even take their friends around to their house. Many families have suffered over the last number of years. I know myself one wants a home to be home. Consider the amount of time that families spend away from their families when they are working, doing overtime and trying to get as much money as they can to pay their mortgage. These people have paid mortgages. They have paid their loans and they have done everything by the book. As I said earlier, the developers have walked away scot-free. I know that the Minister has given the commitment that he will rectify this, but it needs to be rectified now. How can you go home and talk to a child who is going to bed when the child looks up to the ceiling and is afraid that it will fall on top of them when they see cracks in the walls? I am talking about this as if this is my house. I guarantee the Minister of State that if it were his house he would not accept it either. This has to be done and it has to be sorted out. I hope that the Minister of State is going to chase these developers. Personally, I know of builders who have moved down the road, and although their building sites went into liquidation they still have their big, fancy cars, houses and everything else. The only people who have been affected are the honest, individual people who went away, who got a mortgage and who did a bit over time. I plead with the Minister of State to do it now, straight away.</p>

          <p eId="para_704">I am glad for the opportunity, first to welcome all the people here in the Gallery who have been affected by the light-touch regulations provided for by previous Governments. We see it here in Dublin, in Donegal, in Mayo and in different counties. When we talk about Donegal, we must remember that in Donegal houses are falling down around the people. We remember Bridie Gallagher in the 1960s and 1970s who sang about the homes in Donegal, even in my father's pub. Donegal people, and everyone, depend on their homes and they look forward to going home in the evening. It is sad when their homes, apartments or whatever are falling down around them. It is terrible and it is because of light-touch regulations.</p>
          <p eId="para_705"> To get back to the issue of Donegal, the same quarries in Donegal supplied counties such as Derry. It was the same material from the same quarries, but they took proper materials because there is no problem in the Six Counties, as has been highlighted today. Yet, we have problems here all over the country because of light-touch regulations made by previous Governments.</p>
          <p eId="para_706"> The current Government will have to ensure that people get redress and that they will get their homes in order because a person’s home is their castle. That is the one thing that they work for. They pay mortgages in the first place and they are paying it for the greater part of their working lives. They surely do not need to have problems as they move on in years and then have their apartments and their homes falling down around them.</p>
          <p eId="para_707"> I must speak about Kerry and the home relocation scheme that was in place to help people who were being flooded. I will mention one place in particular, Glenflesk. Because the river there had not been cleared out for years, homes became flooded and damaged. A home relocation scheme was put in place to help these people to buy other homes and to get out of the place. Sadly, at that time, the compensation they received was clearly not adequate to purchase the same quality of house away from the flood area. In recent times that river has been cleaned out and it has made a massive difference to the flooding situation. However, people’s homes were already damaged because of the stern refusal by the local authority, which would not agree to clearing out the river in the first place. Now their homes are damaged. While the river is clear now, those people who were on the relocation scheme were offered from €200,000 to €220,000. That is clearly not enough, given how costs have soared in recent times. They are not able to buy a house in another place because of the exorbitant costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_708"> There are also places like Birchill in Aghadoe and Aghadoe village, where people paid a lot of money for houses, but the treatment plant, or the treatment plans, were not adequate. These people paid adequately for the homes they bought at that time. In recent years, the Government allocated funds to address the treatment plants but that is not sufficient now, given the rising costs. I am appealing to this Government, and to the Minister of State, Deputy Peter Burke. Birchill and Aghadoe village are waiting for a proper treatment plant, as well as to be connected to the public sewer. The Government is not providing adequate funding to do to that. I am appealing to the Minister to take that on board and to ensure that the people of Glenflesk, Aghadoe and Birchill get proper compensation and that they are seen after.</p>

          <p eId="para_709">At the beginning, I would like to thank sincerely Deputy Ó Broin and the Sinn Féin Party for tabling another excellent motion before Dáil Éireann, because it is only right to acknowledge the seriousness of the crisis that people are facing.</p>
          <p eId="para_710"> The first time this issue came to the fore in a big, public way was through the mica scandal, which started out in Donegal. I was so impressed with the nice people who came down to the Convention Centre Dublin, where we were then, and where they had been protesting during the Covid-19 times. Those people and families highlighted what they were facing. One issue that struck me at the time was that some people were doubly affected. There was a couple that might have been married and if one of the partners had a house before getting married and the other partner had a house, they actually had two properties that were falling down around them. It was a horrible situation. Meeting the children who were living in homes like that really brought home what can happen if people have a defective house.</p>
          <p eId="para_711"> The report by the working group, which was established by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, to look at the defects issue, has found that problems such as a lack of fire safety material, structural defects and water ingress are present in up to 80% of apartments and duplexes built between 1991 and 2013. This equates to between 62,500 and 100,000 units. That is frightening. We know that apartments, houses or anything that is built correctly is great, but there is nothing in the world worse than an apartment that is built badly.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Someone in an apartment is in a box in the middle of a big box and if the whole lot is bad, my God, there is nothing worse. The price apartments cost during the boom and the Celtic tiger was frightening. A young girl from my home county of Kerry, which I am here to represent, came to Dublin, worked tremendously hard and bought an apartment here. Unfortunately, it is one of the affected apartments. Apartment owners were told at a recent housing meeting they had to put in the order of €60,000 into a fund. That is frightening money on top of already paying a mortgage. The young person in question is working and just trying to survive and keep her own. She was doing very well to come to Dublin and buy a place. It was a great thing for a young person to do but she got caught. The State has to look at cases such as that.</p>
          <p eId="para_713"> However we manage it, we have to put our shoulders to the wheel for those people. We have to stand shoulder to shoulder with them. We have to give them redress and be of assistance. It is only right and proper. They are taxpayers and workers. Look at what they contributed in VAT through the cost of the purchase of their properties. It is very important to assist them. That is why tonight is so important and why it is so important that people listen to this debate and take on board what Sinn Féin is seeking, which we will support. I ask the Government to rise out like it never did before and say it will stand shoulder to shoulder to face this problem, not just in Donegal but throughout the rest of the country where we have defective homes. People have invested their hearts, souls, lives, work, family and effort. Everything they have goes into their accommodation, whether it is a house, an apartment or other accommodation. It is where they wish to live and raise their families and there is nothing worse or more horrible than being in a defective place.</p>
          <p eId="para_714"> We have all seen it ourselves back over the years. If a wall is damp or bad, it is like a plague that will not go away. It will not go away or disappear. It has to be put right from the outside in. It cannot be camouflaged or painted over and one cannot let on it is not there. It is unhealthy for people and not good for them. We have old housing stock and we understand why that might be bad but we expect a new property to be good. Someone who is after paying through the nose for a property and is paying money for it every month but is married to a bank that has no sympathy, understanding or empathy will want that property to be right and good.</p>

          <p eId="para_715">It is very apparent as to who the winners and losers of the Celtic tiger are. We are sadly reminded of it over and over again through issues such as building defects. Sadly, the public is still paying the cost today, more than a decade later. It will continue to do so long into the future under a Fianna Fáil-Fine Gael Government. There has been continuous fall-out from the reckless boom during the Celtic tiger years. Unsurprisingly, the public did not get a cut of the astronomical profits made by developers, investors and bankers but it is, of course, expected to pay for the debt, mistakes and greed because that is the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael way. They privatise the profits and socialise the losses.</p>
          <p eId="para_716"> For a Government that is so critical of the left, it is funny how socialism really works for it when it comes to debt and facilitating the greed of those cutting corners and causing unsafe living conditions for so many in this country. The report of the working group to examine defects on housing is a devastating read but, unfortunately, not a shocking one. It reports that up to 100,000 homes could be affected by building defects and that the cost of remediating these defects could be as high as €2.5 billion. There is nowhere in the country that has not been affected by building defects. My constituents in Donegal have been waiting for years for legislation to address deleterious materials in the concrete blocks that are causing their houses to fall down.</p>
          <p eId="para_717"> The Government made sure to rush the legislation through the Oireachtas before the summer break, allowing little time for scrutiny. As the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, claimed, the legislation had to be passed urgently in order that the enhanced scheme could open for applications as soon as possible. I have a word of warning for people in the apartments. The people affected by mica were told they were getting 100% redress. It is far from 100%. Six months later, there is still no sign of a scheme being implemented. Homeowners are stuck in limbo and their applications will not even be processed until the new year. It will be a long time after that before the affected homeowners see any benefit from this scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_718"> It has now been revealed that fire safety defects have been uncovered on the Phoenix Park Racecourse development in Dublin, the largest development in the State. What will happen with that? Homeowners and tenants are not to blame for building defects. This Government, with its light-touch regulations, is to blame but the homeowners will have to carry the cost.</p>

          <p eId="para_719">I thank Deputy Ó Broin for bringing this important Private Members' motion to the Dáil. I welcome all the groups in the Public Gallery. I will refer to an email from a constituent who lives in the Tramyard apartments in Inchicore. As an apartment owner, she has been asked to pay an initial €7,000 for essential fire safety remedial works by the end of November, which was only a few days ago. She states the full cost of the necessary remedial works will be €25,000 over a four- or five-year period. What a burden to put on her shoulders when she had no part to play in it. That is just one example of the situation faced by the tens of thousands of people who live in the estimated 100,000 apartments affected by defects such as fire safety issues, structural defects and water ingress.</p>
          <p eId="para_720"> This is one of the many national scandals to emerge from the Celtic tiger era of light-touch regulation or, indeed, non-implementation of whatever regulations existed, corner-cutting and whatever could be got away with to maximise profits. The people who did not party have already footed the bill for the bank bailout and will be faced with the bills for the pyrite scandals and this particular bill for construction defects of between €1.5 billion and €2.5 billion and possibly much more.</p>
          <p eId="para_721"> The responsibility for this situation lies with the Fianna Fáil, Progressive Democrats, Fine Gael and Green Party Governments of the period, which failed in their responsibility to provide proper regulation, oversight and inspection of the building of these apartments and duplexes. Responsibility also lies with the construction industry for corner-cutting and shoddy work practices. It should be made to accept responsibility, as recommended by the Construction Defects Alliance, by paying a 2% tax on profits for at least ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_722"> The Government must respond urgently to a situation whereby up to 100,000 inhabited apartments and duplexes are potential fire hazards. We do not want to have a Grenfell Tower scenario in this country. We need the immediate implementation of interim measures, namely, State funding to upgrade fire and smoke alarms and sensors in bedrooms, funding for fire wardens to help with evacuations, especially during night-time, and funding of emergency grants for urgent remediation works pending the establishment of a remediation support scheme. With regard to any such remediation support scheme, all necessary work should be fully funded up-front by the State, with cost recovery measures imposed on the construction industry. Those who have had to pay towards remediation works should be fully compensated. Owners' management companies must be given hands-on State support by a body such as the Pyrite Resolution Board. This requires legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_723"> While this is a complex and costly issue, the people living with this problem, who are in no way responsible for it, must not be left waiting for two, five or ten years for a scheme to address it. These scandals should never be allowed to happen again. Complete reliance on the private sector to provide affordable and safe housing has been a disastrous failure. The State must step up and play the key role in providing homes, including via a State construction company.</p>

          <p eId="para_724">I thank Sinn Féin and Deputy Ó Broin in particular because I understand he was the special rapporteur when the housing report was produced in 2017. I will start on a positive note because it is difficult to remain positive with what we are facing with regard to the cost, negligence and failure of successive Governments. I welcome the Government's commitment to having interim reports, bringing a memo in advance of the recess next week and providing retrospective redress. I welcome all of that.</p>
          <p eId="para_725"> I heard a Labour Party colleague talk about our not wanting a political squabble. It is extremely important not to reduce this debate to a squabble and instead to look at how this happened. I welcome the people in the Gallery and throughout Ireland who are listening and waiting to see. We need urgent 100% retrospective redress.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">We need it as quickly as possible. Let us put this in perspective and not in the context of a political squabble. Successive Governments have tolerated poor regulation, a failure to monitor and a failure to resource local authorities and they have given a thumbs-up to developers. I worry that we are doing exactly the same thing all over again and that we have learned nothing. I will quote from a presentation by a solicitor on that report, which was in 2017. It is now five years after that report and a year and a bit after the working report was published. I thank both groups for their work. The solicitor said, "Irish law is stacked against home owners who discover defects." She continued to say, "Irish law is unclear in a number of important respects with regard to remedies for building defects." She is a specialist construction lawyer who made her time available to the committee. At this meeting in 2017, she pointed out, "These problems are not new. The Law Reform Commission described them in 1977 and again in 1982 in a report that included the defective premises Bill." She later elaborated and pointed out that the Bill was never passed. She referred to the Law Reform Commission report of 1982, stating:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_727">It was made in response to the suggestion made at the time that increased protection for consumers would increase the cost of houses. The Commission stated, "Economies achieved at the expense of defective building work were not in the interests of purchasers or lessees of houses."</p>
          <p eId="para_728">That report was in 1982. We are now looking at a report from a working group. After its year of work, it has told us that there is no single cause of defects but that they arise due to a variety of reasons. My father worked all his life and ended up as a small builder. He was an absolute perfectionist. It makes me ill to read this part of the report, which states, "They tend to arise due to a variety of design, product, inspection, supervision and workmanship issues, occurring either in isolation or in various combinations." We find out from both reports that there has been an utter failure to inspect and regulate.</p>
          <p eId="para_729"> I will go back to what a Deputy from the Social Democrats said and ask what we have learned and where we are now. Can any Minister or Minister of State tell us what the Government has learned about inspection? What is the rate of inspection in each local authority? How many people are needed to ensure that this never happens again? I have heard nothing and we will spend up to €2 billion, rightly, to pay the property owners and people who have been affected in up to 100,000 apartments and duplexes, for a period from 1991 to 2013. It is now 2022. The Government is clapping itself on the back about a memo being brought to Government before Christmas. Look at that period. I have no idea if things have improved. From what I have read, they have not. I am extremely worried. I will repeat that we are once again giving the thumbs-up to developers.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage (Deputy Peter Burke)<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T20:20:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_730">I welcome all the groups to the Gallery. On behalf of my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, I thank Deputies who have contributed to the debate. We can all agree that many homeowners and residents of apartments and duplexes have found themselves in a difficult, stressful position when defects arise in their buildings through no fault of their own. As the Minister stated on a number of occasions in this House, the Government is determined to grasp this nettle. We are committed to providing support to affected homeowners.</p>
          <p eId="para_731"> Given the personal impact of these problems on the homeowners involved, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, would like to reach a broad political consensus on these vital issues. In this regard, he has written to Opposition leaders to request their specific written input on options laid out in the report and any additional steps which they believe should be undertaken to meet this challenge. The Minister thanks those who have responded to date and encourages those who have yet to do so to submit their proposals for consideration as soon as possible. The Minister would like to see practical details included in these proposals and has requested, in particular, relevant detail on administration, implementation and costings to accompany the proposals. I acknowledge the calls for homeowners and residents who need support at the earliest opportunity.</p>
          <p eId="para_732"> I assure the House that the Government is committed to addressing this issue as a priority. The Government's commitment is demonstrated by the fact that one of the first actions of the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, was to establish the working group to examine defects in housing. This was an important initial step, as it was the first time that we could establish the scale of the issue. I am grateful to all members of this working group for the considerable work they undertook in a relatively short time. We can all agree that the scale of the issue is quite substantial, in that the number of apartments and duplexes constructed between 1991 and 2013 which are affected by fire safety, structural safety or water ingress defects is likely to be between 50% and 80%. This equates to between 62,500 and 100,000 apartments and duplexes which were built in this period. Given that the average cost to remediate defects is likely to be approximately €25,000 per apartment, that translates into a potential overall cost for remediation of between €1.56 billion and €2.5 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_733"> It is no small task to determine how best to put in place support for affected homeowners in a fair and measured way. To this end, the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, has put a number of measures in place to progress the matter. On 27 September, he brought a memo to the Government to inform it of the content of the report and the next steps that he will take. He has committed to reverting to the Government by the end of the year with specific proposals. Second, an interdepartmental and agency group has been established to consider the recommendations contained in the working group's report and to elaborate on the options for potential sources of financial support and the potential channels for deployment contained in the report. This interdepartmental group and agency has been asked to revert with proposed delivery mechanisms for the deployment of funding and to develop an options paper which will assist the Minister in developing proposals to present to the Government before the end of the year.</p>
          <p eId="para_734"> Third, an advisory group has been established to develop a code of practice in the context of the fire safety legislation to provide guidance to building professionals, local authority building controls services and local authority fire services. Fourth, the Department is engaging with the Housing Agency about the provision of advice on the implementation of the recommendations of the working group's report. In parallel, the Minister has corresponded with homeowner representative groups and is committed to keeping them updated on progress. The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, held his most recent meeting with the Construction Defects Alliance and Apartment Owners Network earlier today. To ensure that he hears from as broad a range of affected homeowners as possible, the Minister is planning to host a webinar next Monday evening between 7 p.m. and 8 p.m. to facilitate an exchange of views.</p>
          <p eId="para_735"> In light of the insurance issues that have been brought to the Minister's attention, he met Insurance Ireland to discuss the issue of defects and to advise on the steps he is planning to take. As is evident from the detail I have just outlined to the House, a considerable amount of work has been undertaken. This reflects the urgency that the Government believes is necessary to address this issue for affected homeowners. This is in the context of the finding of the working group that there is no single cause of defects. The working group concluded that defects tend to arise for a variety of design, product, inspection, supervision and workmanship issues, occurring either in isolation or various combinations. However, as recognised by the working group in its report, given that the overall potential scale and estimated cost of fixing the problem is so considerable, it would take many years to address all affected buildings. Therefore, resources and works will need to be prioritised. In this regard, it would not be appropriate for those in charge of affected buildings to delay the undertaking of any remediation works that are considered necessary for safety. Given the scale of the apartments potentially affected, the defects working group advised on the importance of planning, prioritising and adequately resourcing any programme to address defects. I know the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, will bring specific proposals to the Cabinet, followed by new legislation, interim measures and administrative processes to respond to the report of the working group and to examine defects in housing as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_736">I begin by welcoming the people in the Gallery. I also welcome the publication of the report of the working group to examine defects in housing. It is obvious that much work has gone into its 260 pages.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">The report estimates that up to 100,000 homes could be affected by building defects with a potential cost of remediation as high as €2.5 billion. There are many examples of building defects around the country and the obvious ones are mica and pyrite. We in Sinn Féin support 100% redress for the individuals and families affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_738"> There are many homeowners who feel the effect of the light-touch regulation hangover from the Celtic tiger. Residents in Oak Grove, Derrinturn have had to endure collapsing canopies, serious cracks and other defects in their homes. In March 2015 a fire ripped through a terrace of six homes in Millfield Manor in Newbridge, County Kildare. The timber frame construction used in the building was supposed to provide an hour-long firebreak between each home. The 90-house development was built by Barrack Construction between 2006 and 2009 and the blaze burned all six homes to the ground in less than half an hour. It was a miracle nobody was killed. The affected families were left with nothing except the clothes on their backs. A report was commissioned and only became public through a freedom of information request by an Teachta Ó Broin. Residents have described the report as a whitewash as it identified the risk was moderate. The cost of remediation from the remaining homes is estimated at €35,000 per home and this is money the residents do not have. The director of Barrack Homes, Paddy Byrne, filed for bankruptcy in Britain with debts of €100 million. The bankruptcy was extended from one year to ten years after it transpired Mr. Byrne had sought to conceal funds by transferring €500,000 to his ex-wife and another €500,000 to his niece. In 2012 Mr. Byrne formed a new company called Victoria Homes with his sister listed as director. By 2019 Victoria Homes was involved in 24 separate developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_739"> For too long there has been a cosy relationship with developers and no consequences for wrongdoers. This needs to stop. Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. We need action. We need 100% redress. We need consequences or things will never change. If the Government is not willing to change the consequences, it is time it left office.</p>

          <p eId="para_740">I welcome the people in the Public Gallery who are affected by building defects. They and homeowners across the State who are similarly impacted have been badly let down by successive Governments. Our proposal calls for support to finance a scheme for homes that require emergency works, with priority for those with the greatest fire risk and structural defects. I heard what the Minister of State said in that regard. Poor regulation and light-touch regulation by successive Governments have left tens of thousands of families and couples in a housing emergency and the State with a multi-billion euro bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_741"> Riverside is a flat complex in Portarlington built during the Celtic tiger period. It was scandalous. The water came straight through the walls. I witnessed it. People had mortgages for homes they could not even inhabit. That is a legacy of the Fianna Fáil, Progressive Democrats and Green Party Governments of the 1990s and 2000s. Up to 2014, a developer could self-certify a house or home was up to standard, only for homeowners to discover it was not. The so-called HomeBond scheme was not worth the paper it was written on or the money people paid for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_742"> In 2014, when we were trying to clean up the mess left by the Celtic tiger and the recession that followed it, I, as the Sinn Féin spokesperson on local government and planning, raised this issue with the then Minister, Phil Hogan. I told him there were flaws in the legislation he was pushing through the Dáil at that time. That legislation failed to deal effectively with the issue of self-certification. The changes that were made simply directed that the certifier would be hired by the developer, which left a clear conflict of interest. I pointed this out to Phil Hogan, who was sitting where the Minister of State is. I am pointing it out to the Minister of State eight years later.</p>
          <p eId="para_743"> The second aspect is that, as observed by the all-party housing committee in 2017, there remains totally inadequate insurance cover for homeowners. This must be addressed. When he was a Member of the Seanad the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, pointed out that certain insurance companies had washed their hands of it and walked away. Thousands of families still have not received any redress there. We need a truly independent certification process with certifiers employed directly by the local authorities, which is what happens in other jurisdictions. The all-party report set out clearly in 2017 that "To completely break the self-certification element that remains with S.I.9 Design Certifiers and Assigned Certifiers should be employed directly by local authorities ...". We need to deal with this. We must deal with this problem once and for all. There are already two generations of people here looking for redress. We do not want another generation to be doing the same in 20 years' time. We need to fix it now and work together on it.</p>

          <p eId="para_744">I welcome the people in the Gallery. I understand it is not easy for them to sit here this evening and hear their homes, lives and futures debated in this way. It is important we are having this debate but it cannot be easy for them to have to listen to this. They are all very welcome, as is everyone who is watching. I commend the work of the representative groups from the Construction Defects Alliance and others. I also commend the work of my colleague, an Teachta Ó Broin.</p>
          <p eId="para_745"> For many years Sinn Féin has been campaigning for a redress scheme for homeowners and tenants impacted by Celtic tiger-era defects. There are tens of thousands of workers, families, renters and homeowners affected by this. The report by the Department working group found that fire safety, water ingress and structural issues are present in 80% of apartments built between 1991 and 2013. I acknowledge the work put into this report. The scale of the problem is a direct result of Government policy and light-touch regulation. Six different Governments sat during this period. They encompassed Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Democratic Left, the Progressive Democrats, the Green Party and a host of Independents. All those politicians might reflect on their role in this scandal. It was not an accident that defective houses and apartments were built; it is what happens when an industry is allowed to self-regulate with the approval of the political system. This did not happen in a vacuum but with the approval of the political system. This light-touch regulation resulted in widespread shoddy practices by industry during the Celtic tiger years and led to serious building defects across the State. Homeowners and tenants impacted by building defects have been badly let down.</p>
          <p eId="para_746"> The scars of Government failure are to be seen across the length and breadth of my constituency, Dublin Fingal. I am not going to name the individual estates because the residents know who they are and they are already suffering enough without having their address tramped through the Dáil as well. Those impacted need to be supported. The Government has been dragging its heels on this for far too long. Homeowners and tenants are not to blame for building defects; it is not their fault. Despite this they have been left in limbo. They need certainty and reassurance. They need to be listened to and treated with respect. Our motion demands 100% redress for those impacted by building defects. It seeks to ensure any scheme to support the people affected is fair by providing interim funding for emergency works and short-term measures, such as fire wardens, in advance of full redress. It also prioritises those at greatest fire safety and structural risk and ensures the scheme includes social landlords, including local authorities and approved housing bodies. Crucially, it would ensure the scheme is an end-to-end one, rather than a grant scheme and calls on the Government to consider expanding the terms of reference to ensure it can open in early 2023. It would ensure the scheme is retrospective for those forced to pay for remediation of defects in advance of the opening of the scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_747"> These measures would make a considerable difference to the people affected and ensure the scheme is fit for purpose. I am calling on all Deputies from all parties to back this motion to stand up for homeowners and tenants affected by building defects. It is not good enough for the Government to say it will not oppose this. It must support the motion. The people impacted by this are not to blame and it is long overdue that they be treated fairly. It is not enough for Deputies, especially those from the Government side, to pay lip service to supporting people impacted by these scandals. They must do the right thing and stand up when it really counts.</p>
          <p eId="para_748"> I particularly urge my constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, to stand with the people in Fingal who are affected by building defects and support this motion rather than simply not opposing it. I have spoken to many people from the constituency who are impacted by this. They have done nothing wrong. Many have put themselves into significant debt to make their homes safe or else they lie awake at night worried about how they are going to repair their unsafe homes and find money they have not got just to sleep safely in their beds at night. They are the victims of the failure of the State to regulate. They bought their homes in good faith and were let down by a failure of Government regulation. They have done nothing wrong and deserve our support. They must be allowed to put this behind them and get on with their lives in safe and secure homes.</p>

It has been a matter of some public debate recently with the comments of the Tánaiste so I am interested in hearing the Minister's position.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice (Deputy Heather Humphreys)<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T20:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_751">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. An Garda Síochána is a community police service with strong links to the communities it serves, built on a culture of policing by consent.  Over the last century, from the turbulent years of the Civil War and through the devastating years of the Troubles, the Garda has remained a largely unarmed police service.  The resolve and vision set out by the first Garda Commissioner, Michael Staines, that An Garda Síochána would succeed "not by force of arms or numbers, but on their moral authority as servants of the people" is as true today as it was 100 years ago.  That An Garda Síochána has remained unarmed is a tribute to the organisation and to the Irish people.  A deep connection to community and a commitment to service is embedded in the culture of An Garda Síochána and is something the organisation is rightly proud of.  The Commissioner is committed to ensuring the organisation continues to evolve to remain representative of all the diverse communities it serves.</p>
            <p eId="para_752">  That said, it is undoubtedly the case that gardaí operate in often dangerous environments and it is important that they have the equipment they need to do their jobs safely, not to mention effectively.  Units such as the emergency response unit and the armed response units are central to the Garda response to serious crime and are trained and equipped accordingly. I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that the health and safety of gardaí is of paramount and ongoing importance to him. It is clearly imperative that Garda members are issued with appropriate equipment for their duties. To ensure this, there is a constant review by Garda authorities of all operational and protective equipment, including the use of tasers and other incapacitants.</p>

            <p eId="para_753">I am glad to see the Minister opposing, in effect, the position being argued by the Tánaiste. I want to make some points about tasers because this is part of the debate now. The Garda Representative Association, GRA, has supported arming gardaí with tasers. That would be a step in the wrong direction. In the United States, more than 1,000 people have been killed by police, the bulk of them since 2000, through the use of tasers. Some 90% of those victims were unarmed. This applies particularly to vulnerable groups, such as children, pregnant people, elderly people and people who would be particularly thin. It is possible to recognise all of those things but you cannot identify people who have a history of heart disease or seizures or who have pacemakers and so on. What is the Minister's position on the question of tasers in particular?</p>

            <p eId="para_754">The Deputy referred to the Tánaiste. What he said, very clearly, when answering a direct question, was that it was a matter for the Garda Commissioner, which it is. He said he would consider any request from the Garda Commissioner. I believe the strength of the Garda Síochána has been through policing by consent. It is an unarmed police force. We have heard many times in this centenary year that the Garda ethos is based not on force of arms but on the relationship with the community. Of course we all want to keep our streets safe. We want to provide the Garda with the resources to do that but crime is changing all the time and we have to embrace new technology and ensure our gardaí have the most up-to-date technology they need to fight crime. That includes the roll-out of body cameras for members of An Garda Síochána. This Government is committed to providing the Garda with the resources it needs to tackle crime.</p>

I want to use my remaining time to ask about the killing of George Nkencho by gardaí two years ago now. George's family were given to understand by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, that every attempt would be made to complete that investigation within a year of the killing, which would have been December of last year. The investigation has dragged on and on. I understand that it has now concluded and that the findings have been submitted for extended peer and legal review. I also understand that when that is complete, the report will go to the three commissioners to evaluate and decide the next steps. Where is that process at the moment? When will the peer and legal review be complete? When will the findings go to the three commissioners? What kind of timescale are we looking at for the release of this report and proposals?</p>

I am advised by GSOC that it has deployed significant resources to the investigation and that the investigation is at an advanced stage. I understand that a draft report, pursuant to section 101 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, has been prepared and is currently subject to internal and external peer review, as well as legal review.</p>

            <p eId="para_759">Will the Minister provide an update on any plans the Department has to remedy the crisis in garda retention? There has been a significant issue with garda recruitment and retention for some time but it is getting increasingly worse. I am concerned that if this continues, we will be left with a significant shortage of gardaí, particularly in Dublin where numbers have reduced by 18% since 2009. My colleague Deputy Martin Kenny recently discussed the issue with the Garda Commissioner. Does the Minister have any plans to remedy the situation?</p>

            <from>Deputy Heather Humphreys<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T20:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_760">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. As Minister, I am committed to delivering the necessary resources to bring the number of Garda members to 15,000 and beyond. There is no evidence of an issue in relation to retention of Garda members. Of the 14,211 sworn members, only around 100 in total will resign this year. That is just 0.7% of the total Garda members. Since 2015, the budget for An Garda Síochána has increased by approximately €672 million, or 46%.  This has allowed for sustained and ongoing recruitment. This includes an increase of almost 12% in Garda members throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_761">In addition, since 2015, more than 870 Garda members have been freed up from back-office duties to front-line policing because of civilianisation. The Government's commitment to ensuring An Garda Síochána has the resources it needs is underscored by the unprecedented €2.14 billion allocated in budget 2023, which will allow for up to 1,000 new gardaí to be recruited next year, as well as 400 Garda staff. The recruitment campaign for An Garda Síochána in 2022 saw 11,000 people expressing an interest in joining the service. This will provide us with a clear pipeline of recruits. The number of attestations this year so far is 369, which means almost 500 will have completed or begun their training in 2022. I recognise that policing is difficult and challenging work and I know the Commissioner is also conscious of this. A number of programmes have been introduced to support members and I hope these can continue to be expanded in future years.</p>
            <p eId="para_762"> We are all immensely grateful to our gardaí for their outstanding dedication and commitment to serving the public and for the important role they play in our society.</p>

            <p eId="para_763">I agree it is challenging work and many of the newer recruits look forward to that. However, we see that large numbers of the resignations are coming from those who were recruited since 2015. It was usual for six to eight recruits to leave per year but we are now in a situation where that number of gardaí are resigning every few months. Increasingly, gardaí tell me the job does not meet their expectations. They find there are layers of bureaucracy. For example, if they are involved in investigating a minor case, they have to scan their notebook, input to the PULSE system and then input to the investigation management system. This is even required for cases such as material damage in a road traffic accident. That is before we ever get to the matter of the cut in gratuities, wages and terms and conditions in a tough job.</p>

            <p eId="para_764">The number of people retiring is very small when it is taken in the context of overall Garda numbers. In 2018, there were 0.5% retirements, and in 2022, the number is 0.7%. When we take account of the overall Garda numbers, the number of retirements is relatively small. We continue to provide resources. As the Deputy will be aware, resource management, including succession planning, is a matter for the Commissioner. The Government has provided the funding to allow for sustained recruitment and is committed to ensuring An Garda Síochána has the resources it needs. I am advised that 149 Garda members are eligible for compulsory retirement in 2023 and up to an additional 695 members will be eligible for voluntary retirement. This means a total of 844 Garda members will be eligible to retire in 2023. However, only a portion of those eligible will take up the opportunity in the year in question, and Garda management has indicated it plans for tranches of approximately 200 trainees to enter the college every 11 weeks throughout 2023.</p>

            <p eId="para_765">That is an interesting statistic the Minister has given. On a rough sketch of the numbers an increase from 0.5 % to 0.7% means an additional 280 gardaí retiring if the overall number is 14,000. Figures available from An Garda Síochána state that approximately 400 to 450 retire yearly and the number of new recruits is simply not covering the number of gardaí retiring. Furthermore, we have a significant issue in retention. While six to eight gardaí used to leave per year, those numbers are leaving every few months. In particular, a number seem to be leaving the Dublin region and others are resisting a transfer to the area. I recently heard of four newly recruited gardaí in Wicklow leaving around the same time. Gardaí who resign cite a number of reasons but top of the pile are a lack of work-life balance, expectations not matching the reality, and an increase year on year in the level of bureaucracy and paperwork they have to undertake.</p>

            <p eId="para_766">In 2022, there were 101 resignations out of a total Garda force of 14,211. Those are the actual figures. The Deputy mentioned the Dublin metropolitan region. In 2015 there were 590 gardaí in Dublin north central. There are 655 gardaí there in 2022. In Dublin metropolitan area south central in 2015 there were 627 gardaí and on 30 September 2022 there were 692 gardaí. That shows significant increases and we must remember the Garda College in Templemore was closed during the economic crisis and for almost two years during the Covid-19 pandemic. Unfortunately, we were not able to train as many gardaí at that stage but we are working hard to get those numbers back up again.</p>

            <p eId="para_770">I thank the Deputy for raising the question. The Parole Board was established as a statutory body under the Parole Act 2019 on 31 July 2021, replacing the former interim parole board which had been in place since 2001. Under the Act, victims now have a right to engage in the parole process.  Victim engagement is an important element of the work, and the board is currently engaging with 291 victims in relation to 105 applications for parole. I understand no victim details are available in some cases and, in others, the victims do not wish to participate in the process, which is very much their right.</p>
            <p eId="para_771"> When a victim chooses to register with the Parole Board, the staff of the board work with them to facilitate their submission. I understand the board’s written materials were developed in conjunction with the National Adult Literacy Agency, NALA, and are written in plain English. Where at all possible, the Parole Board facilitates a victim making a submission at a time and place that suits them and in a format that suits them. The Parole Board public information campaign to inform and engage with victims, My Voice Counts, was launched on Wednesday, 23 November 2022 on radio, print and digital platforms. The campaign will seek to inform the public, and especially victims of serious crime, about the Parole Board, its work and the rights of victims within the new parole process. Both victims and parole applicants have access to legal representation under the Act, and the Parole Board has established a legal aid scheme and formed a panel to provide this legal assistance. I am informed that 221 people serving prison sentences who are eligible to apply for parole have applied to date. The Parole Board wrote to all applicants outlining the process and informing them of their proposed review date earlier this year. Representatives of the board have also held information sessions for life-sentenced prisoners in all the relevant prisons and will do so on a rolling basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_772"> The board, which comprises 13 members, held its first meeting in September 2021 and has met at least monthly thereafter, with the exception of August 2022.  Decisions on 11 parole applications have been made this year to date, and the board expects to review at least ten cases per month in 2023.</p>

            <p eId="para_773">One of the objectives in the programme for Government was the establishment of the independent Parole Board, and I welcome the steps that were taken recently. I note that according to Radio Kerry the chairperson is a Kerrywoman. The process will now give a statutory right for the voice of victims of crime to be heard. This was desperately needed and is welcome. We cannot underestimate the power and strength it gives to a victim of crime to have an input into the future of someone who has changed, and sometimes destroyed, their lives. It is important for the voices of victims to be heard, respected and understood in this regard. It is my understanding that, since it recently became operational, new reports have been made available detailing the wait facing offenders due to come before the courts about their parole hearings, but the ultimate focus here is that the wait is also facing victims, and that is concerning.</p>

            <p eId="para_774">I acknowledge there is a backlog of cases at the moment. The transition phase from the interim parole board processes will take at least two years to work through.</p>
            <p eId="para_775">The board increased its number of meetings this year with a view to increasing the number of applications being considered. It will do so even further in 2023. However, the number of cases reviewed still remains lower than anticipated. There are a number of causes for this, primarily victim engagement. Engagement with victims has proven to be a lengthier process than first anticipated but it is extremely important to get this right. This is the most significant challenge and contributed to the delays in the original timelines. Other reasons for delay include the length of time taken to receive reports as well as board capacity. The Parole Board wrote to all applicants outlining the process and informing them of the proposed review date earlier this year. For those who had anticipated being reviewed before now an update has issued informing them of the delay and the reason for it. However, as the Deputy rightly points out, with the backlog it is the victims we are most centrally concerned about.</p>

            <p eId="para_776">Given the acknowledged delays that are taking place, will the Minister of State consider providing extra resources in order to clear the backlog and address the meetings and speed things up? As the Minister of State said, they will meet more regularly to help clear any difficulties because the ultimate focus is that the wait facing the victim could have further impacts on a person's mental health while they await a parole hearing where they intend to open up to the board about the effect that the crime had on them. That is difficulty to quantify in reality. Will any extra action be taken by the Department in order to combat the delays? Is it about human resources, financial resources, or both? What steps can the Minister of State take?</p>

            <p eId="para_777">These delays were unanticipated. However, having realised the delays, we have already taken pro-active steps to clear the backlog. The board is now fully operational and is hearing cases. Furthermore, it has developed a structured plan which will see a significant increase in meetings and applications considered right throughout 2023. To support this work a 23% increase of funding has been allocated to the board for 2023. I am confident that this will assist the board. We are working through the applications on hand with as little further delay as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_780">I thank Deputy Fitzpatrick for raising this issue. The Government is committed to ensuring that An Garda Síochána has the resources it needs, as shown by the unprecedented allocation provided in budget 2023 of €2.14 billion. This level of funding will support the planned recruitment of up to 1,000 new Garda members and 400 new Garda staff. It is clear that we have a strong pipeline of recruits coming through who wish to become members of An Garda Síochána.  There was a high level of interest in the recent Garda recruitment campaign and the recruitment process is continuing to identify candidates to enter the Garda College over the coming period. More specifically, 92 successful candidates entered the Garda College on 28 November 2022.  This is the first group to enter from this competition.  Hundreds more are at various stages of the selection and clearance process and due to enter the college over the course of 2023.  In particular further intakes of 200 trainees are scheduled at 11-week intervals over the course of next year beginning in quarter 1 of 2022.  I encourage all candidates on the panel to ensure they are ready to engage in the final process and in a position to take up their offers when received. Notwithstanding the continued popularity of An Garda Síochána as a career it is of course a challenging role and I am assured by the Garda Commissioner that a number of important services and supports have very properly been put in place in recent years. These include increasing well-being supports such as the employee assistance service which is available to all Garda members, staff, retired members, trainees and probationers, and their families. There is also a 24-7, 365-day telephone helpline and counselling service, a well-being hub, peer supports and a chaplaincy service. While these and other Garda human resources or personnel issues are matters for the Garda Commissioner, in which I have no role, the Garda authorities have of course my full support in ensuring that gardaí have the resources, supports and technology to perform their difficult role in the community.</p>

            <p eId="para_781">The Minister said that 92 recruits started in Templemore on 28 November 2022. I believe that two recruits have already dropped out. I question the reason for the drop-outs. I also asked about pay, conditions, pensions, paperwork and rosters and I got no reply whatsoever. I believe there is a problem with recruits. Are standards being dropped in order to reach targets? Are people being called back for second interviews after failing the initial interview?</p>

            <p eId="para_782">The 92 recruits started. Possibly some of them may have dropped out. Sometimes when you start a job it might not take you too long to realise that it might not be the job for you. We know of many people who started in other careers. I remember when I started in the bank many moons ago, we used to start the training course in tranches of six and maybe after the first few days one or two could have dropped off and said that it was not for them. We have to accept that some people in good faith take up the jobs but decide that this is not what they wanted. Sometimes they might get a better offer. We are in a very competitive labour market. As Members know, unemployment is at its lowest level ever. There are more people working in this country than ever before. It is competitive but we as a Government are focused on continuing to recruit more gardaí through Templemore. There will be 200 every 11 weeks throughout 2023. There is a strong pipeline of recruits and the Government has set a target of 15,000 gardaí and 4,000 Garda staff for a total workforce of 19,000 people.</p>

It is a very simple question. I ask the Minister for the third time, are any issues relating to pay, conditions, pension, paperwork, roster issues and antisocial hours impacting recruitment? The Minister said earlier that she does not think there is a problem with recruitment but when I talk to people on the ground there seems to be a problem. I believe that people are being called back for a second interview after failing the initial interview. I would appreciate if the Minister would stick to the questions I asked.</p>

            <p eId="para_784">I think perhaps if they fail on the fitness side of things they get an opportunity to do the test again. As to whether they are called back for a second interview, I will have to check that information out because I do not have it to hand. This starts off with a pass process. The Garda Síochána and the Garda Commissioner then deal with the processing of the applications. I can find the specific answer for the Deputy and I will get a written answer. I will say that recruitment is a multistage process and those selected are capable of becoming efficient and effective Garda members. The candidates who applied for the 2022 recruitment competition are beginning to come through that process and into training. This will continue into 2023. I will also say that gardaí remain one of the highest-paid groups of public servants. It is not an easy job. It is a difficult job. I will also reiterate the fact that this Government is committed to supporting the gardaí in every way we can. The budget for An Garda Síochána for 2023 is an unprecedented. More than €2.1 billion has been allocated to An Garda Síochána’s budget for 2023.</p>

            <p eId="para_788">I thank the Deputy for raising the question. This is a difficult situation for our Afghan community and their loved ones. I take this opportunity to assure them that we are processing applications under the Afghan admission programme as quickly as possible. It should be noted that the Afghan admission programme is not the only avenue for Afghan nationals to come to Ireland. Since the beginning of August 2021 up to 28 November last, a total of 142 visas had been approved for Afghan nationals to join family members and 104 family reunification applications had also been approved. A significant number of Afghan people have also been allocated places under the Irish refugee protection programme, which comes within the remit of the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. My Department provides the visas to facilitate their travel to Ireland. Almost 600 visa waiver letters have been issued to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_789"> The Afghan admission programme is an additional avenue open to the relatively small number of Afghan nationals living here to allow them to bring close family members here to live with them. The Department has received 528 applications to the Afghan admission programme. I am happy to state that approvals have started to issue. As of Friday, 25 November, the Department had issued approvals for 22 people under the programme. No refusal letters have issued to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_790"> To ensure that as many people as possible can avail of this important programme, my Department has been liaising with representatives of the Afghan community and with applicants directly to ensure we have everything we need to progress their applications. Where applicants are missing important information, such as proof of identity and familial relationships, my Department is contacting people directly to try to gather the required documents. The process of contacting proposers is under way, with over 95% of sponsors contacted to date. The requested information has begun to be received. I would also like to assure the Afghan community that the applications continue to be assessed in a pragmatic and humanitarian manner with a view to issuing more decisions soon.</p>

            <p eId="para_791">I thank the Minister of State for the background, but I already have the background. I am specifically asking about this scheme because it was in addition to the other schemes that were already in existence. The uptake relating to those schemes was extremely low. This specific scheme was introduced after the Taliban takeover in August 2021. I have 40 seconds to speak. I am not going to go into what has been done in Afghanistan by the Taliban in respect of women and children, the lack of education and violence and killings. This scheme was a specific response by our country to say that we will take in up to 500, but we have not taken in a single person. Between 22 November and 25 November, we finally approved 22 applications. Have any of the people to whom they relate arrived in Ireland? Am I wrong to say that not a single person or family has arrived in Ireland under this scheme that will be a year old on 16 December, despite our commitment to do something in response to what happened in Afghanistan?</p>

            <p eId="para_792">By my maths, 846 Afghans have been approved through the other schemes and, as I said, where they can be used, they are being used to help Afghans. In the context of this particular scheme, there have been 528 applications and 22 applications have been approved. There has been a challenge in terms of the information being provided within those various applications, which has proven to be challenging. Our Department is working actively with the Afghan community and with each and every one of those applicants. In circumstances where important and relevant documentation is missing, we are trying to get it in order that applications can be processed as quickly as possible. As already stated, it is not the only way in which Afghans can come to Ireland and some 846 have come through the other processes. We are working through these as quickly as possible. However, we need the relevant documentation to be able to do the relevant checks relating to the scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_793">Let us look at the 846. They have been approved under the other schemes, but the Minister of State has no information on whether they arrived in Ireland. Obviously, we thought another scheme was necessary in response to what happened in August 2021. Given our horror at what was happening in the streets, cities and towns of Afghanistan, and the fact that things were going backwards for women and children, we brought in a new scheme. A year later, absolutely nobody has been brought in under that scheme. Suddenly, within three days, we have progress and there have been 22 approvals. However, it is still the case that nothing has happened on the ground. We have welcomed what the Government has done with regard to refugees from Ukraine, but we cannot make distinctions in terms of the way we are doing it. The Ombudsman has issued a report today on how we treat children from different countries. This is one opportunity to show that we are making it work. Can the Minister of State please explain why there has been such a delay?</p>

            <p eId="para_794">On the applications, there has been a challenge in terms of the information that has been provided. We have to examine the information that is provided, and that is part of any process of issuing visas or any type of programme for admission to the country. We do not bring any people to the country under the scheme; we simply issue permissions for people to come here. As already stated, the Department is not simply standing back. It is working proactively with the Afghan community in respect of each of those applications to see how we can get the information required. The State has a process it has to go through before it can issue permissions to people to allow them to come into the country. The integrity of the systems in that regard has to be maintained.</p>

            <p eId="para_801">The circumstances surrounding the death of George Nkencho are extremely troubling, to say the least. George cannot be brought back, but the family want to know what the circumstances were that led to his death and that it will not happen to another family. That is the most important thing. The family want truth and justice. They want somebody to tell them this could have been prevented if something else had happened on that day. Whatever the GSOC recommendations, a public inquiry is needed in respect of George Nkencho's death. Anything less is an injustice to that family.</p>

Two years is an unacceptable period to wait for an assessment of this matter to be made. I fully understand the gravity of the situation and, indeed, of the report that is to be published. My understanding from Deputy Gino Kenny, however, is that a timeline of one year was outlined. Are the Minister or her Department aware of the communication GSOC has had with the family in the course of this process that has led them to approach Members of this House to bring the matter to the floor of the Dáil? It is not an ideal course to take. I completely understand why the Deputy has done so, however, and I commend him on doing it.

            <p eId="para_803">The shooting of George Nkencho is being fully investigated by GSOC. I hope the Deputies appreciate that I cannot comment on the GSOC investigation because it is independent in the exercise of its functions. GSOC has the power to prosecute following its investigations if it deems that necessary. That is not the case for a public inquiry. This is detailed work that GSOC is doing. It is important that we allow it to continue its work. As I stated, it is at the final stage. I agree it is important that it is moved on. It is not easy for the family, and it is particularly difficult at this time of year and coming up to the two-year anniversary. As I stated, it is at an advanced stage. A draft has been prepared and is currently subject to the internal and external peer review as well as a legal review. The process is nearing an end.</p>

            <p eId="para_805">I congratulate the Minister on her appointment as Minister for Justice. I wish her well for what may be a limited amount of time in that role, although it may be longer.</p>
            <p eId="para_806"> My question relates to the third iteration of the Government's plan in respect of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence and, specifically, the supports and service provision therein. What are the views of the Minister in respect of how it is going?</p>

            <p eId="para_807">I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, and for his kind comments. I wish the Minister, Deputy McEntee, well. She has just started her maternity leave. I hope all will go well with the birth of her second child.</p>
            <p eId="para_808"> Tackling domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is a priority for me and the Government. This includes focusing on prevention and providing victim-centred supports and services. It is opportune to highlight this work now, as my Department, and many others, are engaged in actively supporting the United Nations 16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence. As the Deputy will be aware, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, recently published the third national strategy to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. The goal is clear: zero tolerance in Irish society for any form of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_809"> Under budget 2023, an extra €9 million, a 22% increase, was secured.  This includes increased funding of almost €7 million for organisations funded by Tusla to address acute service demands in existing services throughout the country, and for investment in new services as outlined in the strategy. The funding also strengthens the nationwide supports and will help to maintain the momentum in implementing the ambitious goals set out in the national strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_810"> In total, Tusla has been allocated €37 million for funding domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services. Separate from this, my Department has allocated €6.09 million for measures to tackle domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, including through awareness-raising campaigns and funding for perpetrator programmes. My Department has also allocated an additional €5.8 million in funding to promote and assist the development of specific support services for victims of crime, including victims of domestic and sexual crime, within the criminal justice system.</p>
            <p eId="para_811"> Taken together with the ambitious plans for the development of refuge accommodation through the life of the strategy, I am confident the substantially increased investment in this critical area will make a real and lasting impact on the experience of victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.</p>

            <p eId="para_812">I thank the Minister for her reply. At this time last year, the Ceann Comhairle agreed to the illumination of Leinster House to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women as part of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence. That UN programme, in which Ireland participates, is commendable. There is a significant amount of work to be done. While I fully appreciate the sums the Minister stated have been allocated in various budgets across Departments and agencies, one of the things to come to light in the past 12 months has been the lack of refuge facilities on a county basis. How is that roll-out going across the various Departments? I have a related question on the number of gardaí across the country who are appropriately trained to deal with victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Do we now have a number of gardaí in each Garda division across the State that is appropriate to the level of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence being reported?</p>

            <p eId="para_813">A women's refuge for Carlow was deemed a priority in the Tusla emergency accommodation review in February 2022. An interdepartmental group was being assembled to consider what template was to be used for domestic violence services nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_814">We need an interagency approach to planning and delivery of accommodation for victims of domestic violence. What is the status of this group at present? What are we doing to provide a women's refuge for Carlow? I thank the Minister for stating that the funding is there. A commitment has been given but we need to get it done through all of us working together We need to get this refuge as soon as possible. Safe Ireland's report will be out shortly. That will also be part of the wraparound supports, which is most welcome.</p>

            <p eId="para_815">Plans are in place for refuge places. These locations have been chosen on the basis of required proximity to a refuge as well as a need for refuge spaces per head of population in densely populated areas. They represent areas where there is the most significant under-provision and are a starting point to increasing refuge spaces comprehensively in every county throughout the country. We have committed to the delivery of 24 refuge places, which is currently under way in Wexford, Dundalk and Navan, by 2024. We will deliver 98 refuge units in priority locations by 2025.</p>
            <p eId="para_816"> On north County Dublin, it is my intention that every person who needs a refuge space will have access to one. That is the Government's intention. As a start, the strategy commits to doubling the number of refuge places to 280. This will be the fastest ever expansion of refuge spaces. We will also work to deliver additional safe houses and step-down accommodation. The review of accommodation services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence undertaken by Tusla identifies priority locations where there is a particular urgency.</p>
            <p eId="para_817"> On Deputy Murnane O'Connor's question, part of the work being undertaken is to assess the readiness of locations to proceed with the construction of refuges having regard to local capacity, availability and suitable sites. My Department will engage with groups, including those in Carlow and in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, because we have no refuge there either. Making additional spaces available as soon as possible is a priority for me and this Government. Carlow, Cavan and Monaghan are on the list of priority locations.</p>

            <p eId="para_818">I thank the Minister for her comprehensive response. I will have to put in a parliamentary question to get all of that in writing. I am not sure the Minister addressed my point about Garda training. It is important, not just for NGOs but victims, to know that An Garda Síochána has the appropriate resources and training available to it on a divisional basis throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_819">There are special units in every single division. Having spoken to some gardaí recently, they said the number of people coming forward to these specialised units dealing with domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is increasing. We are breaking down that stigma for some people who may be worried about coming forward and may be afraid. They are now going to specially trained people in this field. I know that gardaí have been specially trained to deal with victims because there is no doubt it is an awful place for people to find themselves. I was pleased to hear that the number of people coming forward is increasing all the time. It is important that these facilities are here and this support is available to them at a very vulnerable time for them. I thank the Deputy for raising this matter.</p>

            <p eId="para_822">I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue regarding the Government's strategy on step-down accommodation in cases where a person leaves a domestic violence refuge.</p>
            <p eId="para_823"> In June, the Government launched zero tolerance, the third national strategy on domestic, sexual and gender-based violence. Under this five-year ambitious programme of reform, we want to achieve a society that does not accept domestic, sexual and gender-based violence or the attitudes that underpin it. It is a whole-of-Government and whole-of-society plan of action. This Government is committed to implementing in full the 144 detailed actions in the implementation plan for this year and next. The strategy sets out the Government’s objective that everyone who needs a refuge space will get one, and the overall number of spaces will double over the lifetime of the strategy. By 2024, we expect to have delivered 24 refuge units in Wexford, Dundalk and Navan. An interdepartmental group is developing and progressing agreed processes and approaches to ensure we have the highest standard of refuge accommodation delivered in the most efficient way.</p>
            <p eId="para_824"> In addition, safe homes, another form of emergency domestic violence accommodation, are an important part of that response. Safe homes are usually provided as a separate unit of accommodation, for example, a flat or a house at a community or local level. It generally suits those at low to medium-risk of serious harm. We expect to increase the number of safe homes available by 15 this year. Insofar as the question of step-down facilities is concerned, the new domestic, sexual and gender-based violence agency, working with Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, will review the pathways into this type of non-emergency accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_825"> The Deputy may also be aware that a protocol established during the pandemic by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, which removed the means test requirement for victims of domestic violence for a three-month period, has now been made permanent. This ensures ease of access for victims of domestic violence to rent supplements.  In addition, under the third national strategy, we have committed to examining other options for victims of domestic violence, such as addressing barriers to remaining in the home, if that is their preferred option.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#VioletAnneWynne" eId="spk_238">
            <from>Deputy Violet-Anne Wynne<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T21:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_826">I thank the Minister. The third national strategy he referenced commits to quite a few actions. In particular, I note and welcome that he intends to form a policy on how to keep the survivor in the family home but with their abuser removed, as opposed to the current situation where, in so many unfortunate cases, survivors have no choice but to return to the arms of their abuser after their time in a refuge is up. This is because, among other reasons, our barring order system is grossly inadequate and, in many sad cases, there is absolutely no step-down accommodation available. In addition, their abuser has isolated them from everyone in their life so they have nowhere else to go.</p>
            <p eId="para_827"> According to Women's Aid, since 1996, 242 women have died violently, 57% of whom were killed by a current or former partner. Some 150 of these women died in their own homes and 18 children died alongside their mothers. Some 61% of the women who died violently in the past 26 years were murdered in their own homes. Will the Government acknowledge the correlation between that fact and the lack of step-down and wraparound supports that it provides? Will it do better? </p>

            <from>Deputy James Browne<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T21:30:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_828">I certainly hear the Deputy. I assure her that the Minister, Deputy McEntee, is determined to deliver as many refuge spaces as possible as quickly as possible. I agree with the Deputy that steps have to be taken to ensure that survivors can return to their homes without the presence of their abusers, who should be removed. We need to work more on ensuring that is the situation.</p>
            <p eId="para_829"> One of the overarching goals of the strategy is to ensure that everyone who needs a refuge space will get one. As I said, we will double the number of refuge spaces over the lifetime of the strategy, bringing them to 280. The Tusla review of accommodation services for victims of domestic, sexual and gender-based violence identified that priority locations for between 50 and 60 new refuge places are needed. Further analysis undertaken identified 12 locations nationwide where the delivery of 98 family refuge spaces would have the most impact if prioritised. In the initial phase of this work, we expect to deliver the 24 places in Wexford, Dundalk and Navan by 2024. The delivery of additional safe homes is also a key part of that response and is expected to increase over the duration.</p>

            <p eId="para_830">I thank the Minister for his response. I will mention Clare Haven Services which has provided 30 years of invaluable service to women and families throughout the county, region and the country at large.</p>
            <p eId="para_831">Through its educational arm and in collaboration with Technological University of the Shannon, Haven Horizons has put together a level 6 accredited course in domestic abuse and coercive control. Its work and contribution are invaluable and I thank it for those.</p>
            <p eId="para_832"> I am sorry to say that, for every family that Clare Haven accepted into refuge over the past three months, it unfortunately had to turn away two. These heart-breaking bottlenecks point towards the need for service-based organisations and wraparound supports to be directly involved in ramping up the provision of long-term accommodation for survivors of domestic violence. These people need beds, but they first need dignity.</p>
            <p eId="para_833"> Refuges across Ireland are like accident and emergency departments. They are not just overcrowded and underfunded by the Government but also are lacking in supply through no fault of their own. The third national strategy is admirable, as is the rent supplement the Minister of State mentioned, but without supply, these measures are futile.</p>
            <p eId="para_834"> I commend the Minister, Deputy McEntee, on her work and wish her well on her maternity leave.</p>

            <p eId="para_835">Domestic violence support services and places of refuge must be easily accessible but no phone lines or offices provide help on weekends or after hours. When a person needs a refuge, there are no wraparound services. I am referring to local authorities and Women's Aid. There need to be emergency numbers, but there are none. There is nowhere to send women fleeing violence after initial support from the refuge. We need to provide proper facilities for women, who need to feel like they are starting again. They do not just need hostel beds, but assistance in finding jobs, affordable childcare and other types of practical help with wraparound services. Are we considering using approved housing bodies, AHBs, to provide housing support where women are in need? Must we consider legislating? There is so much more we can do in this crisis. The Government is committed to this area, but we need to do more.</p>

            <p eId="para_836">I thank the Deputies for their contributions. What the Government is doing, led by the Minister, Deputy McEntee, will deliver. It has put in place the correct structures to deliver additional refuge accommodation, including the development of the new statutory agency. We will accelerate the number of additional spaces that can be delivered each year. Already, work is being undertaken to implement the strategy and preparations for it have been made, including a significant increase in funding under budget 2023.</p>
            <p eId="para_837"> The State has not done enough to date in terms of providing refuges, but what the Minister, Deputy McEntee, and the Department of Justice have put in place using a whole-of-government approach is a strategy that will deliver spaces. The strategy is backed by an implementation plan that is measurable and will be measured as we go along.</p>
            <p eId="para_838"> I visited the Aoibhneas refuge in Coolock last week. I heard harrowing stories and about the number of people it had to turn away. I was with the Ministers, Deputies McEntee and Darragh O'Brien, at the sod turning on the new property in Wexford. A great deal remains to be done but I believe the Minister's implementation plan will be effective.</p>

            <p eId="para_841">I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter. The courthouse on Church Street has stood unused for a number of years. The building is a monument of historical significance in terms of the War of Independence and the Civil War. Deputy Michael Moynihan has been raising this matter for some time to try to make the building available for public use.</p>
            <p eId="para_842"> Under the provisions of the Courts Service Act 1998, management of the courts, including the provision of accommodation for court sittings, is the responsibility of the Courts Service, which is independent in the exercise of its functions. However, to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have made inquiries and the Courts Service has provided the following update on this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_843"> Kanturk courthouse is owned by the Courts Service but closed as a venue in 2010. To this end, the Courts Service would welcome an approach from the Office of Public Works, OPW, or local authorities that would see the building being put back into public use or community use. In the past, the Courts Service has worked closely with local authorities to ensure that disused courthouses, which are often of significant local importance, have been repurposed for community use. The Courts Service would favour the same happening with Kanturk courthouse.</p>

It could then be forwarded to the committee that has been formed to restore the courthouse. It is important that we have the deeds or registration of title, whichever is the case, and I would appreciate it if we could get that documentation from the Courts Service.</p>

I will undertake to contact the Courts Service to see whether it can do that work and ensure that the property's title is correctly identified as being under the Courts Service in order that steps can be taken in respect of the building's future use.</p>
            <p eId="para_847"> Regarding the preservation of the documents within the buildings, historical documents should be preserved. I will raise this matter with the relevant bodies.</p>

            <p eId="para_848">The bridewell is adjacent to the courthouse. I commend the Courts Service, in particular Ms Ruth Penney, who was more than helpful in trying to preserve the bridewell last year. The building was porous with water flowing down it and some remedial work was done. There is graffiti in the old bridewell, which served as a jail for 200 years after the courthouse was built in the 1820s, but much of the graffiti dates from the War of Independence and the Civil War. That graffiti is significant and it would be a shame to see it being lost due to neglect of the building. The building is in the public realm and should be preserved. If it were in private ownership, there would be a duty on its owner to preserve it.</p>

            <p eId="para_852">This question relates to a disgraceful and disgraced formula invented by a gentleman in the United States some years ago that is now used in the family law courts as a means of resolving and readjusting the minds of parents and children in the event of a divorce or separation.</p>

            <p eId="para_853">I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this issue, which he feels strongly about. As he is aware, the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions and the conduct of any court case is a matter entirely for the presiding judge.</p>
            <p eId="para_854"> On 16 November, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, published the first national family justice strategy and secured Government approval for the Family Courts Bill 2022, which was published on 1 December.</p>
            <p eId="para_855">These are the mechanisms by which it is intended to reform how our family justice system operates to make it more supportive and protective when there are vulnerable parties, particularly in cases where there is a history of domestic violence. It will also make it more efficient and user-friendly and significantly less adversarial. The aim is to develop a system that puts the family at the centre of its work and that protects vulnerable parties throughout proceedings.</p>
            <p eId="para_856"> To support the legislative changes proposed in the Family Courts Bill 2022, the Minister, Deputy McEntee, established a family justice oversight group to develop the first national strategy. The work of the group was informed by a wide-ranging consultation process which heard from the voices of those most impacted by their experience of the system.  The strategy has nine goals and more than 50 actions, with the aim of establishing a strong foundation for a future system which is more child and family-centred, which supports and protects, and which is more streamlined and user-friendly.</p>
            <p eId="para_857"> As the Deputy may be aware, under the Government’s new zero tolerance domestic sexual and gender-based violence strategy, the child is recognised as a victim or survivor of domestic violence in their own right for the first time.  This will be an important link across to the family justice strategy, the first goal of which is supporting children and which includes as a priority an action to examine the role of expert reports in the family law process and make recommendations regarding their future application and function. This action will consider the commissioning and availability of these reports.</p>

            <p eId="para_858">I thank the Minister for that detailed reply. I also acknowledge the work of the Minister, Deputy McEntee, in this area as well. There is a problem, however, and it is urgent. I refer to what to do about the children and their mothers, or fathers, who have been before the courts in the context of some cases where gardaí were ordered by the courts to go into classrooms, take the children out and place them in the hands of the person from whom they were previously taken. It is, to say the least, a contradiction. It is dangerous. The unfortunate part is the use of section 47, which is drawn from Dr. Richard Gardner's proposals in the United States. These have been discredited. To my mind, they are disgraceful in the sense that children, and their mothers in particular, have been left crying in the court. In some cases, the mother was placed in a cell while the matter was being discussed.</p>

            <p eId="para_859">The case the Deputy referred to is a difficult one. These are difficult situations. We wish to see the child being put at the centre of proceedings. It is important that the needs of the child are considered. Situations, such as those mentioned by the Deputy, where children are taken out of school do not sound like a good situation for any child to be placed in.</p>
            <p eId="para_860"> I have asked my officials to prioritise this action in respect of the family justice strategy, which is to support children and includes as a priority an action to examine the role of expert reports in the family law process and make recommendations regarding their future application and function. The action will consider the commissioning and the availability of these reports, including their contents and future use. I have asked my officials to prioritise this undertaking. The Deputy has raised this issue with me. As I said, this work will be led in early 2023 by the Department of Justice, working closely with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. It is envisaged that the recommendations arising from the examination will enable the system to clearly hear the voice of children to ensure they are supported in their own right and that their safety, security and best interests are paramount and that they are not allowed to be used as pawns in what can be difficult and acrimonious situations.</p>

            <p eId="para_861">The sad and tragic fact in these types of situations is that not only are the children treated as pawns, but they are also treated in the way that previous generations treated children in concentration camps. Their minds are taken to be reformed and reoriented in such a way that they will see a disadvantage as being an advantage, and <i>vice versa</i>. This leads to a situation of confusion, obviously, and terrible trauma insofar as the mothers are concerned. Some mothers have been forcibly separated from their children for up to three and four years to prove a point. In the case of vindictiveness, these kinds of things will happen. Worst of all, however, the section 47 reports are not being questioned. There is no allowance for cross-questioning of them. This must stop as a matter of urgency.</p>

            <p eId="para_862">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. This was the first topic I spoke on in the Dáil. I refer to the importance of having assessors trained in coercive control and other coercive behaviours regarding section 47 reports. I also said they should have the capacity to understand manipulation, where it exists. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice has just considered these points and broader questions concerning enforcement of custody and access. I refer in particular to the insidious use of our State's court structure to further coercive or manipulating behaviour of another parent, of either gender, and the difficult nature of protecting children in these circumstances. Some steps in this regard have been taken, which are welcome, but these developments need to go much further in the new family law system to protect against the use of coercive and manipulative behaviours throughout the family court structure.</p>

She consulted with several groups and is committed to dealing with this issue. The Department of Justice has also arranged for a separate strand of independent research into parental alienation to be carried out last year. I am pleased to say that a final report has been received by my Department and it is now being reviewed. It is expected that the research and the public consultation will create a deeper understanding of the issue and inform the Department's consideration of policy and law in this area. Work is ongoing to integrate these strands of work and I expect a report outlining the outcome of the research and the consultation process, and any resulting recommendations that arise from it, in due course. The Deputies, though, are correct. We must do something about this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_866">I am sure Deputies will join me in condemning, in the strongest possible way, any attacks on members of An Garda Síochána and other front-line services. We are all immensely grateful to all gardaí for their outstanding dedication and commitment to serving the public.  Communities up and down the country have paid warm tributes to gardaí throughout this centenary year.  Attacks on the Garda cause injury, not only to the victims, but to communities as a whole.  An attack on a member of An Garda Síochána is an attack on the safety of us all. It is imperative that front-line workers are protected in carrying out their work and that the law reflects and responds to the situations in which they find themselves.</p>
            <p eId="para_867"> The unprecedented €2.14 billion allocated to An Garda Síochána under budget 2023 demonstrates the Government’s commitment to ensuring that the Garda has the resources needed to carry out its vital service. This includes the provision of €3 million for preparatory work to support the introduction of body-worn cameras, along with €6 million for new ballistic vests to protect front-line gardaí.</p>
            <p eId="para_868">The Deputy may be aware the Government published the Garda Síochána (Recording Devices) Bill 2022 on 4 August last, which will provide a legal basis for the deployment and use of body-worn cameras by An Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_869"> The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland stated in its report that policing organisations around the world have found that such devices can help improve front-line capability with the accurate recording of incidents, expedite analysis, enhance situational awareness and sometimes protect police from harm. While deployment of these devices, including related timelines, will be an operational matter for the Garda Commissioner once the legislation has been enacted, I hope that they will be brought into operation as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_870">The problem is there is no specific timeframe. There is no prioritisation of these. I believe they were supposed to be implemented in the next two years. The Garda members have asked me when gardaí can expect to wear these cameras. I am sure the Minister is fully of the benefits to gardaí of wearing these cameras.</p>
            <p eId="para_871"> No training has been provided or scheduled. As the Minister will be aware, in recent years in my constituency of County Louth we have had the murder of Detective Garda Adrian Donohoe and also the tragic killing of Garda Tony Golden. In fairness, when a garda leaves his or her home, the family are hoping the garda will return safe and sound. This resource will be of major benefit to these gardaí. Will the Minister please answer the questions?</p>

            <p eId="para_872">I thank the Deputy. I answered the question, but I will answer it again.</p>
            <p eId="para_873"> Any attacks on members of An Garda Síochána and other front-line services are strongly condemned. The Garda Síochána (Recording Devices) Bill 2022 was published on 4 August last. It will provide a legal basis for the deployment and use of body-worn cameras by An Garda Síochána.</p>
            <p eId="para_874"> The Commission on the Future of Policing in Ireland recommended the introduction of body-warn cameras. Policing organisations around the world have found such devices can help improve front-line capability with the accurate recording of incidents, expedite analysis, enhance situational awareness and sometimes protect police from harm. The Bill needs to be enacted before the body cameras will be deployed. The report has been prepared to go to Government and it will be going in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_875"> I agree with the Deputy that these body cameras, or bodycams, are essential. It is essential the Garda Síochána is equipped with the most up-to-date technology to help gardaí do their job more effectively.</p>

            <p eId="para_876">Recent comments by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Varadkar, suggest more gardaí may be armed. That sounded a warning, especially for family members. Gardaí do not wear guns. If an intruder was coming to meet them, as it were, and all of a sudden a garda has a gun, it would change the whole situation. Will the Minister give us an update on the comments made by the Tánaiste?</p>
            <p eId="para_877"> We keep mentioning resources. I agree with the Minister that the body cameras will be a fantastic plus. I only hope the Bill can be passed as soon as possible. As I said to the Minister, the resources are so important. In other countries, they are wearing these camcorders and the results are beneficial to the protection and safety of their police. I would appreciate it if we could push the Bill as fast as we can.</p>
            <p eId="para_878"> There are families listening to this debate. On the comments the Tánaiste made, will the Minister give us an update on whether gardaí will be armed in the near future?</p>

            <p eId="para_879">We will be bringing forward the Bill and I hope the Deputy will support us when we are bringing it through the Houses of the Oireachtas. I am sure the Deputy will.</p>
            <p eId="para_880"> The Deputy mentioned the Tánaiste. The Tánaiste was answering a direct question, and he answered it. He stated this was a matter for the Garda Commissioner, which it is. What the Tánaiste said was that if the Garda Commissioner requested additional supports or whatever, he would be happy to look at it if the Garda Commissioner looked for more armed gardaí. We have an effective armed response unit. They do excellent work.</p>
            <p eId="para_881"> The strength of An Garda Síochána has also been through policing by consent as an unarmed police force. As we have heard on many occasions in this centenary year, the Garda ethos is based not on force of arms but on its relationship with the community. I believe that ethos has served us well but I also believe we need to keep our streets safe. The Deputy mentioned bodycams. It is important, as I stated earlier, that gardaí are equipped with the right and most up-to-date equipment in terms of new technology to make sure they do their job.</p>

            <p eId="para_885">My Department is committed to protecting all communities, especially those most affected by crime, to implementing policies designed to prevent our young people from falling into crime and, where they do, to providing them with a pathway to a better future free from crime.</p>
            <p eId="para_886"> It is important to say Ireland is, for the most part, a very safe place to live. According to the Garda Síochána public attitudes survey results published last week, less than 20% of those surveyed perceived crime in their local area as being a serious problem, and public trust in An Garda Síochána remains extremely high at 91%. While this level of support is unprecedented internationally, there is no room for complacency. There are clearly communities that are disadvantaged and where decent law-abiding residents are subjected to levels of crime that are not typical of the overall national situation. Those communities, whether it is in Darndale, Drogheda or Cherry Orchard, to mention a few, deserve our support and are getting it.</p>
            <p eId="para_887"> To support youth justice services and to ensure delivery of key objectives in the youth justice strategy, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, secured an additional allocation of €6.7 million in budget 2022 and a further €2.5 million in 2023. This funding allows for expansion of services offered to young people by the youth diversion projects, which are funded by my Department. Three innovative pilot community safety schemes have also been trialled in Dublin's north inner city, Waterford and Longford. These pilot schemes are to run for 24 months with a view to then rolling them out nationwide. In addition, the community safety innovation fund was established in April 2021 to reinvest money seized from the proceeds of crime into community safety projects. A total of €2 million was awarded in funding across 22 projects, and a further €3 million in funding has been already been secured under budget 2023.</p>

            <p eId="para_889"> Justice Plan 2022 commits to working to break the link between gangs and the children they seek to recruit, and we will continue to roll out the evidence-based community intervention programme "Greentown", which seeks to break the link between children who are engaged or at risk of engaging with a criminal gang. Additionally, in line with the commitment in the programme for Government and the youth justice strategy, my Department has this month launched a public consultation on appropriate diversion processes for young adults aged 18 to 24 who come into contact with the criminal justice system. It is well recognised internationally that more considered responses by justice systems for this age group may produce better results.</p>
            <p eId="para_890"> My Department is progressing the criminal justice (exploitation of children in the commission of offences) Bill, which aims to deal with those criminal elements who exploit children to advance their criminal activities. This Bill will criminalise adults who induce or groom children into committing offences, and I hope to bring it to Government for publication later this month.</p>

            <p eId="para_893"> A range of commitments are set out in the programme for Government and the Justice Plan 2022.

In line with a programme for Government commitment, the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, established the expert forum on antisocial behaviour. The forum will consider the effectiveness of existing legislation and propose new ways forward, including new powers for An Garda Síochána and additional interventions to support parenting of offenders. We keep all of these matters under review.</p>

            <p eId="para_897">Last Saturday there were chaotic scenes at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda, which is one of Ireland's busiest hospitals. A total of 11 ambulances were parked outside the emergency department and could not leave because there were no beds or trolleys for the patients inside. At the same time the HSE wants to divert more ambulances from Navan to Drogheda. Some paramedics were left waiting for five hours before their patients had a place at the hospital. It is understood there was extreme overcrowding and every bed and trolley in the hospital was taken up. The ambulance crews treated patients in the ambulances while others were brought inside on the ambulance trolleys. None of the ambulances could leave and respond to other emergency calls until they had their trolleys back. According to a newspaper report:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_898">One furious paramedic said:I have never seen anything like it in my life, absolute total chaos. Eleven ambulances at one stage were lined up outside the A&amp;E at the Lourdes hospital and none of us could go anywhere. There were no beds and no trolleys. The place was full. We minded our patients as best we could in the back of our vehicles until we could get them inside. The whole thing was complete madness.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">Why in the name of God are we still talking about diverting people from Navan to Drogheda?</p>

            <p eId="para_900">This is an outrageous situation and simply cannot go ahead. I am disappointed the Minister, Deputy Donnelly is not here and that is no disrespect to the Minister of State. This is an issue that has been on his desk for many months. The reality is that he simply does not have a plan for Drogheda. The Minister of State has seen, heard about and read about the letter from the 16 hospital consultants in Drogheda. No additional resources whatsoever are being made available for Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda to accommodate the changes the Minister seems to want to steamroll through next Monday. This is simply unacceptable. Drogheda has had enough problems over recent years. It needs additional resources anyway outside of the fact this decision will be steamrolled on Monday. This needs to be addressed now and it simply cannot go ahead.</p>

            <p eId="para_901">There is a recognised risk associated with a small number of patients attending at Navan hospital. It will probably come as no surprise that the HSE's plan is to make matters worse. In June, 17 consultants at Drogheda wrote to the Minister to state that transferring risk from one hospital's accident and emergency department to another will lead to poorer clinical outcomes for patients. They obviously have no trust in the HSE. They noted the divergence of acute stroke patients from Navan to Drogheda two years ago was done without clinical engagement or adequate resourcing. Despite this warning, six months later it looks like the HSE is intent on pursuing this agenda. It makes absolutely no sense. It will put patients' lives at risk.</p>

            <p eId="para_902">Huge resources have been given to the hospital. Since 2015 the number of beds has gone from 357 to 478. A total of €60 million has been spent. It is wrong is to say the hospital is under-resourced. It is not. Nobody is applying for the jobs that are being advertised. This is the difficulty. We need to examine the management in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital and Our Lady's Hospital Navan. Can a new synergy be found in terms of corporate governance and medical governance to allow patients to be kept in Navan and dealt with by the experts with a higher level of knowledge who are in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital? This is the way forward. It will keep patients in Navan and make sure they are properly looked after. It would also relieve the pressure on Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, which is obviously significant this time of the year.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Mary Butler)<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T22:10:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_903">I thank Deputies Nash, Guirke, O'Rourke and O'Dowd for raising the matter of the ambulance bypass protocols at Navan hospital's emergency department and for providing me with the opportunity to update the House on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Donnelly.</p>
            <p eId="para_904"> There are a number of ambulance bypass protocols in place throughout the country at this time and they are important to ensure patients receive the right care in the appropriate hospital, depending on their clinical needs. Our Lady's Hospital Navan provides a range of inpatient and outpatient general medical, elective surgical and orthopaedic services, with a 24-hour emergency department service to which patients may self-present or be brought by ambulance. The emergency department at Our Lady's Hospital Navan has an ambulance bypass protocol in place for patients who have suffered a stroke, heart attack or major trauma and also those in need of paediatric and obstetric care.</p>
            <p eId="para_905"> From the week commencing 12 December the HSE is enhancing this ambulance bypass protocol to include patients who are critically or seriously unwell, or likely to deteriorate. Following the update, this cohort of patients will bypass the emergency department at Our Lady's Hospital Navan and be brought to the closest appropriate hospital for their needs. The decision to convey a patient to, or bypass, the emergency department at Our Lady's Hospital Navan will be made by the attending National Ambulance Service teams. The National Ambulance Service teams will assess patients, treat them as appropriate, and transport them to the nearest appropriate hospital depending on their clinical condition. This change is expected to affect only a small number of patients. However, this small cohort of patients, who are critically and seriously unwell, require appropriate treatment urgently. This update to the current ambulance bypass protocols will ensure that these patients receive the most appropriate care as quickly as possible in the most appropriate hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_906"> Following this update to the ambulance bypass protocols, ambulances will continue to bring patients outside of the critically and seriously unwell categories to the emergency department at Our Lady's Hospital Navan. The National Ambulance Service has put an additional 24-7 emergency ambulance and an additional intermediate care vehicle on the ground in Navan to support this change. This updated ambulance bypass protocol at Our Lady's Hospital Navan is important to ensure patients receive the right care, in the right place, at the right time.</p>
            <p eId="para_907"> I confirm that no decision regarding the HSE's proposal for the transition of the emergency department at Our Lady's Hospital Navan has been agreed by the Minister for Health. This matter remains under consideration. The Minister for Health and the Government are clear that several important issues would need to be fully addressed before any proposed transition by the HSE could be considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_908"> I have listened intently to what all four Deputies had to say. I was in Navan last week with regard to the new early intervention psychosis unit and the Cara suite which will support people with outpatient mental health needs on a 24-7 basis. I have heard about the 11 ambulances that were queued at the weekend in the other hospital. I have taken on board what Deputy O'Dowd said about management and synergies. I will certainly pass all of his thoughts and reflections to the Minister.</p>

I have been seeking a meeting with senior representatives for months about the impending changes that the Minister for Health is considering. I have been stonewalled consistently. I do not believe that a plan in place. The Minister of State referred to several important issues that need to be fully addressed before any transition might occur. There was a significant transition signed off on by the Minister that will come into effect on Monday. It is a significant transition that will affect patient care and that will result in the transfer of risk from Navan to Drogheda. If the Minister of State does not want to listen to me, she should please listen to the consultants. It has been said that six extra patients a day will be affected-----</p>

            <p eId="para_913">Our Lady Of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, does not have the capacity to take any additional patients, regardless how small the number might be. That is a statement of fact, and it has been confirmed by the 17 consultants. The Minister of State indicated that no decision has been made, as though that is a badge of honour. The Minister has had the report since 8 October. There needs to be a plan in place to resource the region and to ensure that there is safe acute and emergency care for people. That involves investing in Our Lady's Hospital, Navan. It is incredibly frustrating that the Government stands in the face of that very clear solution.</p>

            <p eId="para_914">I welcome the Minister of State’s comments on the updated ambulance bypass protocols. I do not doubt the credibility or the integrity of that decision, nor do I doubt that it will include patients who are critically or seriously unwell or whose condition is likely to deteriorate. This is not a matter of closing the accident and emergency department in Navan. It is a case of moving seriously ill patients to the appropriate place. I welcome that. I also welcome the Minister of State's comment to the effect that the Minister has not made a final decision on that matter. I further welcome the fact that the Minister is prepared to give consideration to ideas that I and other people have put forward about a new synergy in the management of both hospitals. This can leave both hospitals safe and can ensure that patients will be able to get the best care nearest where they currently reside.</p>

            <p eId="para_916">I thank the Deputies for their contributions on this matter. I know how important it is. I also know that the Minister shares a concern to ensure that patients in Navan, County Meath in general, the north east and any other part of the country can access urgent services when they need them. As I mentioned earlier, there is currently an ambulance bypass protocol in place for Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, in respect of paediatric patients, obstetrics patients, major trauma patients, heart attack patients and stroke care patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_917"> From the week commencing 12 December, the ambulance bypass protocol will be updated to include patients who are critically or seriously unwell or who are likely to deteriorate. This bypass is expected to affect a small cohort of patients who will be brought to the closest appropriate hospital for their needs. This is not a full ambulance bypass. Ambulances will continue to bring patients outside of the critically and seriously unwell categories to the emergency department at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan. This update is important to ensure that patients receive the right care in the right place at the right time.</p>
            <p eId="para_918"> I reiterate that no decision regarding the HSE’s proposal for the transition of the emergency department at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan, has been agreed by the Minister for Health. This matter remains under consideration.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Lowry<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T22:20:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_919">It has taken the heart-breaking case of a seven-year-old boy to bring the need for paediatric palliative care in the south-east region into focus. Last week, I raised the circumstances surrounding the wish of this little boy to return home, as well as his family's efforts to bring him home from hospital to receive end-of-life care. His parents wanted their little man to be in the familiar surroundings of his home, to be with his two brothers and to have precious time surrounded by those he loves and with those who love and cherish him.</p>
            <p eId="para_920"> Last January, in response to parliamentary question from Deputy Cullinane, HSE south east community healthcare officials wrote “there are a range of services available to support children with palliative care needs ... in the HSE SE region”. The fact is that when this family reached out to avail of that proposed service, they were told that it is not available to them. The reason they were given is that these services are not in place in the area in which they live. They were told that such a vital service has not been available in south Tipperary since 2017. In that same response to which I refer, HSE south east outlined in impressive terms what a paediatric palliative care service provides. The letter refers to primary and social care that is tailored to meet the specific needs of each child. It also refers to a model of care for children having been developed to support children with life-limiting conditions in their own homes. It emphasised that the South/South West Hospital Group and the south east community healthcare group had supported the recruitment of staff to fill additional posts, including a paediatrician with an interest in palliative care, and an expanded outreach nursing service.</p>
            <p eId="para_921"> Can the Minister of State explain where this service was when it was needed? No family should be forced to publicly plead for palliative care for their child. I would like to know why this happened. I want an honest and straightforward explanation. More important is what the family needs at this time, namely, a solid guarantee that what happened to it will never happen to any other family. Glorified descriptions of what a paediatric palliative care service should provide is cold comfort to families who cannot get that care for their children when it is needed. This is care that a seriously ill child needs and is entitled to receive, regardless of their Eircode postcode.</p>
            <p eId="para_922"> This courageous little lad is now at home and is receiving the medical and supportive care that he requires. My contention and that of the family is that no parent should have to fight the system to obtain end-of-life care for their child. This little lad received the best possible medical, and eventually palliative, care during his lengthy stays at Children's Health Ireland in Crumlin and in the paediatric ward of Tipperary University Hospital. It is only now, at the most crucial point on his journey, that the system has failed him. Why was a palliative care service not available to this child in the area in which he lives? What is the current situation with paediatric palliative services across the south east, including in south Tipperary? Can the Minister of State say with certainty that every family who is in need of such a service will have it available to them in the future?</p>

            <p eId="para_923">I want to thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. I want to thank him for the work he did to advocate for that family. As the Deputy said, his parents wanted to bring their little man home. If the Deputy had not raised the issue here, that might not have happened. That little man is at home tonight with the comfort of his parents and his two brothers, I am thankful that it is happening. Why did this happen? I cannot tell the Deputy that, but it should not have happened. At this most difficult time in their lives, nobody should have to be fighting for that care.</p>
            <p eId="para_924"> If one speaks to any older person about where they want to age, they will say that they want to age well at home. It is no different for a younger person. I was aware that the Deputy had raised this matter last week and I have followed it. I come from the same area as Deputy Lowry, more or less. Waterford and Tipperary are covered by community health organisation 5.</p>
            <p eId="para_925"> Across 2021 and 2022, funding has been allocated for the recruitment of 12 and a half additional whole-time equivalents to enhance the provision of children's palliative care services across acute and community settings. These include additional posts for six and a half clinical nurse co-ordinators for children with life-limiting conditions, four consultant paediatricians with a special interest in palliative medicine, one paediatrician in palliative medicine and one clinical nurse specialist. These posts will support the provision of specialist palliative care to children as close to home as possible. That is the point, namely, it must be as close to home as possible. In addition, since 2021, €1.5 million in annual funding has been provided to support the services provided by the LauraLynn children's hospice. including in-patient symptom control, respite, end-of-life and bereavement care.</p>
            <p eId="para_926">More recently, through budget 2023, an allocation of €3.7 million will be provided for new measures in palliative care. The new measures will enhance the provision of adult and children's specialist palliative care services throughout the country and will include funding to support bereavement services for parents and families who have experienced the death of a child, as well as increased funding for LauraLynn children's hospice.</p>
            <p eId="para_927"> The specialist palliative care team for children is based in Children's Health Ireland in Crumlin and works in close liaison with medical teams providing care to children in need of palliative care throughout the country. With regard to children's palliative care provision in the south Tipperary and south-east area, which the Deputy specifically mentioned, there are two clinical nurse co-ordinators for children with life-limiting conditions in the south east who support the provision of safe care in the home. When children are at end of life, they and their families deserve the best possible care and it is vital that such care is available when needed either in their home or in a hospital setting. The family needs to have the choice and decide as to whether it is the hospital or home setting, working with their consultant. Primary care services in south-east community healthcare, in conjunction with south-south-west hospital group, work to ensure a care plan based on patient need is in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_928"> A sustainable, long-term solution for the provision of paediatric palliative care services in the south east is under development and the south-east community healthcare organisation is actively working with Children's Health Ireland to progress the required supports in line with the model of care for children with life-limiting conditions. The Department and the HSE will continue to progress developments for children's palliative care services in Ireland, working towards the highest possible quality of end-of-life care and support for children with life-limiting illnesses throughout the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_929">The most important line, from our perspective in the south east and south Tipperary, in the Minister of State's response is, "a sustainable, long-term solution for the provision of paediatric palliative care services in the south east is under development". Will the Minister of State explain what that means? What is the timescale involved? When can we expect to have a wide-ranging full palliative care service available to the people of south Tipperary? We were told in 2020 it had progressed and now we find ourselves, at the end of the year 2022, still talking about developing the services. Will the Minister of State, please, put a timeline on it?</p>
            <p eId="para_930"> I will put on the record that this family's ordeal brought forth the best in people while also highlighting, as the Minister of State admits, the glaring gaps in what is a vital service provision. My concern and that of the family involved here is that the trauma inflicted on this family can never be allowed to happen to another family. It can and will happen if the services are not put in place. If we, as elected representatives of the people, cannot ensure the needs of terminally ill children are fully provided for, none of us deserves to sit in this House. It requires urgent attention. I know the Minister of State empathises with the problem and I ask her to make sure these services are brought on stream as quickly as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_931">Palliative care is a core component of healthcare provision in Ireland. We have to make sure it is available to every child and adult when they need it, whether it is at home or in hospital. We do not think often enough about it until we hear the story of a young child whose parents were heartbroken because they did not have the opportunity to bring their little man home. The Deputy said he was told in 2020 the service had progressed. The specialist palliative care team in Children's Health Ireland works in close liaison with medical teams providing care to children throughout the country. In the south east of the country, two clinical nurse co-ordinators for children with life-limiting conditions support the provision of safe care for children in the home. A care plan is put in place once the referral is received from pediatric community palliative care.</p>
            <p eId="para_932"> The HSE is working to develop a robust long-term solution for the provision of pediatric palliative care services in the south east and to progress the required supports. No timeframe is provided here but I will give the Deputy my guarantee that I will keep on top of this. It does not matter whether it is the south east, the north west or anywhere else, any child who is at end of life and for whom the parents and consultant agree he or she can come home for his or her last days of life should be able to get the support needed. It is hard to believe we are even having the conversation. I give the Deputy a commitment to keep on top of it. I thank him for raising this very important topic.</p>

            <p eId="para_933">I will discuss the very important issue of the urgent need for extra special needs assistant, SNA, allocation for Scoil Eoin in Innishannon, which is a village to the east of Bandon, between Bandon and Cork. It is a terrific national school which 306 students attend. It has a fantastic principal and staff. There is a great team. I visited in November and received a royal welcome from the staff and kids. It was fantastic. I went to visit the special classes and I spoke to the SNAs and the teachers who taught me a bit of sign language. It was fantastic to communicate with these incredible students but they desperately need extra SNA allocations. There are two special classes in Scoil Eoin. One is a junior class attended by four students which has one teacher and one SNA. The other is a class for moderate intellectual disabilities of six students with one teacher and 1.6 SNAs.</p>
            <p eId="para_934"> It is important to describe the difficulty the teachers and SNAs are experiencing with the lack of extra SNA provision. The four students in the junior class have high needs. They cannot feed themselves. They are not toilet trained and cannot use the toilets independently. Thus, one has situations where, between one teacher and one SNA, the SNA has to bring one of the children to the toilet or feed one of them and the teacher is left to manage the class. The considerable difficulty is that it then becomes a management role rather than one of teaching them the moderate curriculum which is what the teacher wants to do and should be doing. That is a clear example of why exactly the school needs extra SNA provision. It is similar in a second class where there are six students. There is one teacher and 1.6 SNAs. It leads to a situation in which, for the vast majority of the time, the teacher and the SNA are caring for the students' needs rather than what they really should be doing which, in the case of the teacher, is teaching the moderate curriculum.</p>
            <p eId="para_935"> As recently as today, I have engaged with the National Council for Special Education, NCSE. I am very happy with the response it gave in that it assured me it would give the issue in Scoil Eoin its immediate attention but this needs to move fast because the mental and physical health of the teachers and staff is suffering. There are incidents of slapping and choking. The situation is quite serious and needs to move fast. The special educational needs organiser, SENO, was due to visit in October. Unfortunately, the school has had to reapply for a SNA assessment which is just gone in as recently as 25 November.</p>
            <p eId="para_936"> The reason I bring this up is that the situation is serious. Scoil Eoin is a terrific school of 306 kids but those incredible children in its moderate intellectual disability classes need to start engaging with teaching instead of what is happening at present, that is, a kind of management issue. I know the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, is not here today but I urge the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, to convey the urgency of the situation. An urgent SENO visit on site is needed to experience what I saw and experienced when I visited in November.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality (Deputy James Browne)<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T22:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_937">I thank Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan for raising this important issue as it gives me an opportunity, on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, to outline the current position regarding the SNA allocation at Scoil Eoin National School in Innishannon, County Cork. I stress that enabling students with additional needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs is an ongoing priority for this Government. In 2022, the Department of the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, will spend over €2.3 billion, or over 25% of the Department's budget, on providing a wide range of schemes and supports for children with special educational needs. In 2023, this spend will be substantially increased by over 10%, meaning that the Department of Education will spend over €2.6 billion on special education. This level of educational funding and support is unprecedented and represents more than 27% of the Department's total allocation for 2023. This includes funding for new special classes, new special school places, additional special education teachers and special needs assistants.</p>
            <p eId="para_938"> The NCSE has responsibility for planning and co-ordinating school supports for children with special educational needs, including the allocation of SNAs and reviews, and the school should liaise with the NCSE directly in the event that additional supports are required. The Department of Education does not have a role in making individual school determinations. The special needs assistant scheme is designed to provide schools with additional adult support staff who can assist children with special educational needs who also have additional and significant care needs. Such support is provided to facilitate the attendance of those pupils at school and to minimise disruption to class or teaching time for the pupils concerned or for their peers and with a view to developing their independent living skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_939"> SNAs are not allocated to individual children but to schools as a school-based resource. The deployment of SNAs within schools is a matter for the individual principal or board of management of the school. SNAs should be deployed by the school in a manner which best meets the care support requirements of the children enrolled in the school for whom SNA support has been allocated. It is a matter for schools to allocate support as required and on the basis of individual need, which allows schools flexibility in how the SNA support is utilised.</p>
            <p eId="para_940"> The NCSE confirmed that the school has an allocation of SNA support to provide support for children with primary care needs. The school got an increase in its special class allocation of SNA support this year of 0.83 to bring it to 2.66 and there was no change to its mainstream allocation of 3.83. The following arrangements for the allocation of SNA support in respect of students in mainstream classes for 2022-23 will apply. The SNA allocations for mainstream classes in schools on 31 May 2022 will be maintained. This will provide greater certainty for schools. There will be a process for schools to engage with the NCSE if they consider their SNA allocation is in excess of the required care needs. Schools should contact their local NCSE special education needs organiser to commence the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_941"> The exceptional review process undertaken by the NCSE will remain in place throughout the 2022-23 school year, where schools can seek a review of their SNA allocations, which will result in one of the following outcomes whereby no change in the level of care need, an increase in the level of care need or a decrease in the level of care need may be identified in the school. It is expected that schools will review and reprioritise the deployment of SNAs within mainstream settings and allocate resources to ensure those with the greatest level of need receive the greatest level of support.</p>

            <p eId="para_942">I thank the Minister of State for the response. I appreciate that the Minister has no role in determining the extra SNA allocation for a school. That is not what I am looking for. I am not looking for the Minister to make a determination but for an instruction or some communication with the NCSE to expedite the visit of the SENO. That is all I am looking for. The SENO needs to be on-site and to visit the school to see what I saw first-hand. As I said earlier, I have engaged with the NCSE as recently as today and I am happy that it will give this its urgent attention. This needs to happen quickly. SNAs and teachers love their jobs. Teachers want to teach and to be given an opportunity to engage with the moderate curriculum which they are given to teach, but they do not have the opportunity to do that because of the reasons outlined in my first contribution. When an SNA is dealing with an individual child, the teacher then becomes a de facto SNA. The teacher should be teaching. That is what we need to get back to and focus on. It all comes down to individual needs. I appreciate the unprecedented level of funding the Minister of State outlined at the start. The funding and resources that we are providing are extraordinary but we need to see them make a difference on the ground. The key point is that we need to cater for students' individual needs.</p>

I assure the House that the Department of Education is committed to ensuring that all children can access an education suitable to their needs. I reassure the Deputy that the Department of Education will continue to support the NCSE and schools through the provision of the necessary funding and capital investment to ensure all children are successful in accessing the education supports they need. I hear the Deputy's specific request about the need for a visit of a SENO on-site as soon as possible. I will certainly raise that matter with the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jennifer Carroll MacNeill<recordedTime time="2022-12-06T22:40:00+00:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_944">On 19 January this year, this House stood collectively behind the community of Tullamore and the family of Ashling Murphy following her untimely and violent death at the hands of a man in plain sight of onlookers. The good, decent people of Ireland stood, as we stood inside this House, in every town in Ireland in solidarity, in a massive public demonstration against violence against women. Violence by men against women was a theme universally condemned in this House. The Taoiseach and Tánaiste alike said we would do everything possible to prevent a crime of that kind from ever happening again. However, the reality is that violence against women of one kind or another is an all-too everyday occurrence. There is a spectrum of violence, from harassment to sexual assault, physical and emotional violence, to femicide. This remains grounded in a culture where women still make changes to their lives that do not need to be considered by men in the same way. These include changes to exercise plans, commuting plans, fear of the stranger, fear in their own community and fear in their own home.</p>
            <p eId="para_945"> In January this year, I took the opportunity to read into the record of the Dáil the names of the other women who we know lost their lives at the hands of a man over the past 27 years. I said then and will say now that it does not matter where women live or what they do, since, by their simple existence, women's lives are at risk from men who they know and do not know in a way that is just not replicated for men. It is an everyday problem which requires an all-of-society, everyday response by us, the Minister of State, Deputy Christopher O'Sullivan and Deputy Alan Farrell, who has been an ally on this and stood with me on so many evenings to raise this important issue again and again.</p>
            <p eId="para_946"> Throughout this year, I have sought to try to keep this issue alive, not just in January, but throughout the year, by being consistent in recognising it and naming in this House all of the women who we know died at the hands of men over the past 27 years, as identified by Women's Aid. I have sought to give them equivalent recognition, insofar as we can, to the recognition that this House gave to Ashling Murphy and her family in January of this calendar year, though it seems so long ago at this point. Many of those women were migrants. Many were of different ages, colours and communities, but all of them died violently and needlessly. For the final time, I draw the House's attention to those women who died in the last two months, November and December, over the past 27 years.</p>
            <p eId="para_947"> The 17 women who died in November in that period are Kitty Fitzgerald, Regina O'Connor, Fabiole Camara De Campos, Carmel Breen, Mary Cully, Mary Kelehan, Ciara Ní Chathmhaoil, Noeleen Brennan, Alicia Brough, Sarah Hines, Dearbhla Keating, Baiba Saulite, Yvonne O'Shea, Marie Dillon, Susan Dunne, Marguerite O'Dwyer and Eileen Costello O'Shaughnessy.</p>
            <p eId="para_948"> The 25 women who died in December in that time are Marilyn Rynn, Sophie Toscan du Plantier, Belinda Pereira, Geraldine Diver, Siobhán Hynes, Sheila Lynch, Jean Reilly, Jennifer Wilkinson, Sandra Collins, Susan Prakash, Sr. Philomena Lyons, Lisa Bell, Christine Quinn, Ann Flynn, Colleen Mulder, Sylvia Roche Kelly, Celine Cawley, Rebecca Hoban, Sharon Whelan, Sara Staunton, Angelique Belling, Valerie Greaney, Rose Hanrahan, Nadine Lott and Zeinat Bashabsheh.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">This year, 2022, has itself been a year of significant violence against women. There has been significant progress from the Department of Justice, but despite our efforts in January to call it out in the way this House so collectively did, it has still been a very difficult year for women suffering at the hands of men, largely, and there is still much yet to be done. That is why I have raised the issue of funding in particular with the Minister of State.</p>

            <p eId="para_950">I thank Deputy Carroll MacNeill for raising this important matter of funding for domestic, sexual and gender-based violence, DSGBV, services. As the she is aware, Zero Tolerance, the new national strategy to combat domestic, sexual and gender-based violence was launched earlier this year. It is an ambitious five-year programme of reform and a whole-of-society plan of action. Implementation of the strategy is a whole-of-government priority that is backed up by a substantial funding commitment under budget 2023. An extra €9 million for 2023, which is a 22% increase, and record funding for combating domestic, sexual and gender-based violence was secured. This extra €9 million includes increased funding of €6.8 million for organisations funded by Tusla, and this is being made available through a targeted funding call.</p>
            <p eId="para_951"> The Government has been clear it is our intention that every person who needs a refuge space will have access to one and that victims have access to supports when and where they need them. This extra €6.8 million will be used to maintain existing services, address existing acute demand, and for the enhancement and development of new services. Approximately €1.1 million for safe accommodation will be focused on the priority locations identified under the third national strategy. Under the funding call there is an emphasis on supporting projects to address geographic need for those with additional vulnerabilities or complex needs and for supports for young people who have experienced sexual violence.</p>
            <p eId="para_952"> There is €2.3 million available to domestic violence services to address acute sustainability and service demand pressures, support organisations to provide greater coverage in rural areas and for children's support services. There is €900,000 available for sexual violence services to meet the needs of younger people and address geographical gaps in provision. This brings the total allocated to Tusla up to €37 million for funding DSGBV services.</p>
            <p eId="para_953"> Separate to the funding of DSGBV services, the Department of Justice has allocated €6.09 million for other measures to tackle DSGBV, including through awareness-raising campaigns and funding for perpetrator programmes, which are targeted intervention programmes to hold perpetrators to account and which work to prevent future reoffending. The Department of Justice has also allocated a further €5.8 million to promote and assist the development of specific support services for victims of crime within the criminal justice system, and this includes victims of domestic and sexual crime. These services provide important information and support, such as emotional support, court accompaniment, accompaniment to Garda interviews or sexual assault treatment units, and referral to other services.</p>

            <p eId="para_954">I thank the Minister of State for his response, but on 8 March, which is International Women’s Day, there were 744 women available for sex purchase on Internet sites in this State. Somewhere between 15% and 100% of those were trafficked migrants. There remains no refuge in Dún Laoghaire. We have a massive cultural problem with this issue. It is a systemic historical cultural problem but it remains a cultural problem. Most of the women I have mentioned were killed by men they knew, men they lived with, men they were in an intimate relationship with or with whom they had had a child.</p>
            <p eId="para_955"> I thank the Minister of State for being here and doing this. It is not the first time he has acknowledged this with me and I am grateful. I am not completely sure, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, what the value of this is here at 11 p.m. on a Tuesday, with yourself, myself, the Minister of State, Deputies Alan Farrell and Christopher O’Sullivan, along with Oireachtas staff, but there is some value over the year in doing this. My team and I certainly learned so much more about the various women, including who they were, their age, how they died, the circumstances and something of their family, where possible. It has not always been easy and I thank in particular my staff who helped with research but, more importantly, conscientiously marked the anniversaries, and there were sometimes multiple anniversaries on a given day, on my social media and allowed it to be tracked in that way. I hope we have not upset any family in doing so but it was an effort to try have these women's deaths marked beyond this House and into the community. Sometimes though, when I look at the reactions in the emails and the comments, I feel it perhaps does have significance to try to create remembrance beyond the pain of the family, which is obviously unquestioned, out in the wider community. This the same community that stood up against violence in January 2022 and will do again, I hope, in January 2023 and, indeed, every year thereafter until this scourge is no more.</p>

            <p eId="para_956">I again thank the Deputy for raising a very important matter. She has been consistent in raising this important and serious issue since she became a Member of Dáil Éireann, and I am very conscious of that. I am confident combating domestic, sexual and gender-based violence is a priority that is not going to drop off the agenda, and I have no doubt the Deputy will ensure focus on it is maintained. That commitment is evident in a number of areas, including the unprecedented funding of €363 million underpinning the strategy and by strong oversight and co-ordination at central government level.</p>
            <p eId="para_957"> Last week I attended the launch by Ruhama of its latest report, heard some of the harrowing stories from women who have been trafficked and heard about the violence and dehumanisation they had to suffer as a result. The importance of ensuring the supports are put in place was mentioned. I also had a chance to visit the Aoibhneas refuge out in Coolock, and only today I was talking to the Wexford Rape Crisis Centre about trying to secure additional funding for it. This is happening throughout Ireland. We must all make a collective effort to ensure not only that violence is prevented and stopped but also that it remains at the top of the agenda for the Government and for this Dáil to ensure there continues to be additional funding and that the plan for the roll-out of domestic, sexual, and gender-based violence refuges is implemented as quickly as possible so that supports are in place where and when people need them.</p>
