          <p eId="para_13">I welcome the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and his officials to this meeting for the purpose of consideration of Committee Stage of the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 1999.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_14">Chairman, in the interest of expediency may I suggest a slightly different approach to beginning our proceedings? We are dealing with Committee Stage amendments in an unusual situation in that we are amending a Bill which was originally circulated in 1999, in the last century. The amendments effectively amount to a new Bill. If one were following a perfect course of action, we would have asked the Minister to withdraw the existing Bill and start afresh. However, I understand the exigencies of the situation and I support the need to change the law. From that point of view, I am prepared to go along with the process which effectively involves the introduction of a substantially new Bill on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">It would possibly be helpful if the Minister would give us a two-minute thumbnail sketch on what he wants from the Bill and we could then agree to many of his amendments without difficulty. I realise it is an unusual approach to even invite the Minister to do this. What essentially is he now seeking to achieve in the Bill? It would help us in the organisation of our work. I confirm that I intend to deal with the Bill in the most positive and constructive way possible.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_16">Of course Deputy O'Keeffe can speak for himself. We all take different views on these matters but I agree with him that it would be desirable to get an initial introduction from the Minister. He should first outline from where the 1999 Bill originated. It was a modest proposal in the context of the 1996 Act. Why did it rest on the stocks for so long? What is the impact of the new amendments, which are much longer than the Bill? After the Minister has outlined the position we should be given an opportunity to respond following which we can proceed to the text of the Bill. I do not expect there would be undue delay on most of the amendments.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Mr. McDowell)</from>
          <p eId="para_17">I would be happy to oblige. The Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 provided for the civil forfeiture of property which is the proceeds of crime. The House will be aware of the general provisions of the Act. Applications under the Act could be made by a member of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of chief superintendent or an authorised CAB officer to the High Court. The High Court could, if it was satisfied on the balance of probabilities, make a freezing order and after seven years that property could be disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer. The belief of the applicant that the property is the proceeds of crime is admissible in evidence provided the court is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the belief and that the initial hearing is done on an <i>ex parte</i> basis, but there is provision for a full interlocutory hearing after 21 days where the respondent has an opportunity to show the High Court, again only on the balance of probabilities, that the property is not the proceeds of crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">On 25 November 1997, the previous Government approved the drafting of a Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill to amend the 1996 Act in a number of technical respects. That Bill was published in 1999 and passed Second Stage in October 2000. I was appointed Attorney General in mid-1999 and was Attorney General until June 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">The main provisions of the Bill, as published, are as follows. First, it makes provision to allow the CAB make applications under its own name as opposed to a member of the Garda Síochána using his personal name and for any document used by the bureau to be accepted as authentic unless the contrary was shown. Second, it clarifies that the details of the property and income as well as the source of that income which a respondent is required to reveal to a court may not be used in evidence in any criminal proceedings against either the respondent or a spouse. That is in order to uphold constitutional rights against self incrimination. Third, it removes any doubt that there might be when a person may be said to be in possession or control of property for the purpose of the Act even when it has been seized from that person by the Garda Síochána. Finally, it makes changes to the 1996 Act regarding such matters as the submission of evidence under the Act and the variation of freezing orders for certain purposes such as the enforcement of taxes or court orders for the recovery of money.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">Second Stage of the Bill was concluded in 2000 but it was not proceeded with pending the outcome of a number of court challenges to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996. Following those court cases, and further recent consultations with the Criminal Assets Bureau, a number of additional proposals for inclusion in the Bill are now being proposed as official amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage. For the most part the amendments concern matters that have been brought to the Department's attention by the Criminal Assets Bureau arising from its experience in the operation of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">Some of the amendments give statutory effect to the decision of the court as set out in Part 1, and there are five principal amendments. First, there is an amendment to the definition of "proceeds of crime" to indicate that it is not necessary to show that the conduct was a particular kind of criminality if it is shown that the property was obtained through conduct of one of a number of kinds of criminality which would be an offence. In other words, if one finds somebody engaged in car stealing and drug trafficking, one does not have to go to the court and say that these are drug trafficking proceeds or car stealing proceeds if one can satisfy the court that, on the balance of probabilities, it is one or the other. That would be sufficient.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">Second, provision is made for service of proceedings outside the jurisdiction. Third, and this is important because it deals with a recent court decision, provision is made to ensure that the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 can be applied to pursue the proceeds of crime in this jurisdiction where the offence was committed abroad. That is a fairly crucial distinction. If, as turned out to be the case, the Act was interpreted as meaning that it applied only to proceeds of crime committed in this jurisdiction, it introduced a very considerable element of uncertainty in regard to drug dealing and the like. Fourth, an amendment is proposed to clarify that section 11(7) of the Statute of Limitations 1957 does not apply to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996. Finally, an amendment is proposed to ensure that the interlocutory order can be obtained in a summary manner and does not have to be proceeded with on the basis of a plenary summons, statement of claim and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">Head five also contains a provision for rules of court to apply and head six contains procedures for a forfeiture in certain cases before a period of seven years has elapsed. Following publication of Mr. Justice Flood's second interim report, consideration was given to setting up a separate corruption assets bureau along the lines of the Criminal Assets Bureau. However, following consultation with the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Attorney General, Mr. Brady, it was considered that a separate corruption bureau would not be required and that existing activities of the Criminal Assets Bureau in the fight against corruption would best be enhanced by the inclusion of additional amendments in the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill set out in Part 2 of the appendix.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">Those heads include measures formerly under contemplation for a proceeds of corruption Bill, and they include the following seven provisions. First, provision for production orders for civil purposes in the Proceeds of Crime Act. Second, a provision for powers of search in regard to computers and computerised information. Third, a provision to secure disclosure of the identity of persons for whom property is held in trust or where there is an investigation into whether that person is in receipt of, or controls or has benefited from the proceeds of crime. Thus, regarding money held in trust for a suspected criminal or person in possession of the proceeds of crime, provision is made to look through the trust to see who is the beneficial owner is. Fourth, provision for seizure and forfeiture of bribes, which were considered important because people who took bribes in the course of their official duties should, in behaving corruptly, have the bribes taken from them. Fifth, provision to apply certain provisions, including appeals under section 40, interest under section 41, procedure under section 42 and disposal under section 45 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 to the new seizure and forfeiture provisions. Sixth, provision to amend sections 38 and 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 dealing with seizure, detention and forfeiture of drug trafficking money being imported or exported in cash so as to extend those sections to include cash wherever located in the State from any criminal conduct, not just drug trafficking proceeds. If one is laundering large sums of money that statutory provision applies to it regardless of whether it is the proceeds of drug trafficking. It extends the drug trafficking remedy to large lumps of cash. Seventh, an amendment to expand the definition of "cash" and an amendment to replace the reference to "criminal activity" in the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 with "criminal conduct," thus bringing it into line with a similar provision in the money laundering provisions of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">Significant changes were proposed. The Proceeds of Crime Act operates on the basis of a civil forfeiture process. One of the proposals provides for District Court orders to be made to make material available for civil purposes in a manner similar to that which applies for criminal purposes under section 63 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994. The proposal to secure disclosure of the identity of persons for whom property is held in trust would allow the High Court to go behind a trust to establish the identity of the settler of the trust, the trustees and beneficiaries of the trust and where there is an investigation of a person in regard to whether they have control of or have benefited from the proceeds of crime. As I said, there were provisions in regard to cash and extending the drug trafficking provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">It may be of some assistance also to tell the committee what was not included. Consideration had been given to two other matters following the publication of the Flood report. First, a provision to provide for freezing of legitimately acquired property where the value had been enhanced, for example, as a result of a favourable planning decisions obtained following a bribe. Second, a provision to allow the use of findings by a tribunal to ground an application to freeze assets. I shall deal with them very briefly because it is important that people realise why they were not proceeded with. In regard to the assets, if, for instance, I gave a city council official a bribe to give me a favourable decision in regard to planning permission on my house, it is my house and the money I spent on it was my money. It is my property. To extend the principle to say that my property was enhanced as an indirect consequence of a corrupt act could have endangered the core basis on which the courts have upheld the forfeiture of assets, which is that to deprive Joe Bloggs of the proceeds of crime is not to punish him by a civil process because it is not his property in the first place and never was.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">However, if one said that Deputies McDowell or Costello's houses, which are undoubtedly their properties, every last stick of which they paid for, has had an enhanced value by reason of a criminal act and that half the value of the house or whatever should be taken away from them, one is in danger of undoing the whole Supreme Court jurisprudence on which the CAB is based. One is taking someone's property from them which is undoubtedly their property legally. Thus, it may be argued that one effectively strays over the line into the area of punishment and retribution by depriving people of the value of their own property because it has been enhanced by an indirect criminal act. To press that point home, if, for instance, I gave a bribe to a local authority official to refuse planning permission to my neighbour building an extension close to my house, one could argue that the value of my house had stayed exactly the same or that it would have lost some value if my neighbour's planning permission had been granted, but depriving me of the value of my property in those circumstances crosses the line from forfeiture of something which is not one's property to punishment or retribution of some kind for getting away with it. That was one of the big problems in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">The second issue is a provision to allow the use of findings by a tribunal of inquiry to ground an application to freeze assets. One of the principal underpinnings of the distinction between tribunals and the administration of justice, which is crucial to many powers of tribunals, is the repeated statement by the Supreme Court that they are bereft of consequence and they do not amount to a deprivation of one's rights. Whatever the finding of Mr. Justice Flood, the late Mr. Justice Hamilton or whoever, it is a statement of opinion. It is a report but it does not have legal consequence for any person. If we had gone down the road of giving legal consequence to the reports of tribunals, we would have been in danger of disbanding some of the constitutional underpinnings of the distinction between tribunals and the rest.</p>
          <p eId="para_29">All of this was carefully considered in deliberations between the Office of the Attorney General and my Department. We considered matters at great length and we decided that those two proposals, which were put into the public domain at the time, were seriously problematic and could have serious unintended consequences. The worst case scenario would be that we would get two Supreme Court decisions which undermined CAB and the tribunals. In the circumstances we decided not to proceed. That is the background.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">On the question of timing, Second Stage was taken on 1 June 2000. The cases were pending at the time. The Bill was restored to the Order Paper in June 2002. In September 2002 the second Flood report was published. The debate then started between the Attorney General's office and my Department on the two constitutional issues to which I have referred and on the question of whether the corruption assets bureau and the other radical proposals were good or bad ideas. It took time to reach conclusions and decide on the way to proceed. That is the explanation as to why we are in this situation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_31">That is hugely helpful to our thinking. The Minister mentioned the various court challenges, and the amendments take into account the court decisions in the meantime. Is there a Supreme Court decision due in this general area? Have all existing court challenges been taken into account in the final framing of the amendments?</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_6" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_32">In the nature of the beast, there is a constant stream of challenges because everybody who gets on the wrong end is tempted to challenge some aspect of the general CAB regime. The most significant challenge of recent times was one which this Bill was already contemplating the need to repair. It was a challenge which succeeded. It held that the existing text of the Criminal Assets Bureau legislation restricted the proceeds of crime notion to proceeds of crime committed within the jurisdiction and, therefore, we have lost that. We were already preparing to make it clear because we had a High Court decision in our favour, but we were not sure that it would survive in the Supreme Court, and it did not.</p>

          <p eId="para_33">Taking the Minister's last point about the difficulty in dealing with the two matters he mentioned, and particularly the freezing of legitimately acquired property even though it has obtained enhanced value through criminal activity, would it be possible to include in the legislation a provision which would assess the value of the enhancement that was obtained through the criminal activity without interfering with the value of the property that was obtained legitimately?</p>

          <p eId="para_34">That is an issue from which we still have not completely walked away. The distinction of an action <i>in rem</i> — which is an action directed to the property — or an action <i>in personam</i> — which is an action directed to the corrupt person — is a live one. We are still thinking of making it an actionable wrong to unjustly enrich oneself by means of a corrupt act and therefore to expose oneself to civil liability where one does so. In other words, if a person bribes a corporation official to allow him or her build 60 rather than 50 houses on an estate, the person is not simply criminally liable for the corruption in question but is civilly liable on the balance of probabilities——</p>

          <p eId="para_38">For example, if a person obtained a rezoning of agricultural land for residential or property development use and its value multiplied ten-fold as a result, it is not difficult to estimate the enhanced value obtained through bribing a planning official or whoever in the process. Given that the tribunals are dealing with a vast amount of planning rezoning corruption, this is an area from which the Minister should not shy away because one can identify the degree of enhancement that has taken place. It would be a terrible shame if that area, which has probably been the focus of most tribunal activity in recent times, did not come under the remit of the Bill.</p>

In the present situation, is it the case that the CAB would be likely to seize property belonging to drug dealers where there is no perceptible evidence that they have the necessary finances to purchase that property but might have part of the finances? Would there not have been contests in many instances in cases of that kind, that is, money-laundering, where part of the assets of the person in question would have been legitimately purchased using their own resources but that in most cases the vast majority of it would have come from the proceeds of crime?</p>

          <p eId="para_41">While that is true in a sense, one could not possibly have a system whereby if a person proved that an aunt gave him or her a fiver which was invested in a mansion the person built, it therefore ceased to be the proceeds of crime because a tiny fraction of it was a voluntary gift from an aunt. The law does not proceed on that basis at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_42">There is one matter on which one must be clear. It is easy for these purposes to visualise it as real property, but the proposed amendment on which I am working may encompass something as broad as the following. Suppose a supermarket owner gave a bribe to a public service official to turn a blind eye to X or Y. One would not see something tangible which he got from that activity but one would know that he himself had become wealthier and one could estimate that the sum total of his corrupt action is that he either nobbled a competitor or enriched himself in some way. Tangible property is only one example of where dispossessing people of the benefit of corruption can occur.</p>

          <p eId="para_44">The Supreme Court case which formed part of the reason for introducing the new provisions on the proceeds of crime acquired outside the jurisdiction had to do, I think, with a British citizen who had acquired property in Wicklow and argued that he had been working at various things. The judge acknowledged that he had worked beneficially for a period of time when he was not in prison and that there could be a contribution there. It was struck down because it was out of the jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">There seemed to be a recognition in that judgment that some of the value of the property could have been obtained in a legitimate fashion, so I do not see why we cannot extend the principle to the proceeds of corruption involving planning, rezoning or something like that. I am glad the Minister is thinking of introducing an amendment on Report Stage but that should be a central part of this legislation because there is such a quantity of white collar corruption——</p>

          <p eId="para_46">I agree, and if I can go down that road I will do so. That is what I am signalling. However, it is not always easy to quantify the benefit to somebody of a corrupt act. For instance, imagine that I own 30 acres near Dublin Airport and bribe a local authority planning official to rezone it from A to B; ten years later this comes to light, and it is then discovered that, in any event, a subsequent county council decision swept all of that land into areas designated for development. One cannot, as it then stands, say that I have got value from my corrupt bribe because I could prove that it would, thereafter, have in all probability been rezoned in any event.</p>
          <p eId="para_47">The other point that must be borne in mind is that, unlike proceeds of crime such as drug supply and so on, there is no necessary correlation between the amount of a bribe and the benefit to the briber. One could get a lot of bang for one's buck if, say, one gave a €1,000 bribe to an official and got a benefit of €1,000,000 in return. The connection between the two is——</p>

The Statute Law (Restatement) Act 2002 was heralded as something that would help to tidy up the Statute Book, and the Minister had an interest in this approach when he was Attorney General. To date, we have had just one solitary restatement, of the sale of goods legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_67">When an Act has been amended a number of times, and in such a complex way as this Bill, given the amendments thereto now proposed, the Act should be reprinted as amended.

It is important that we have a restatement as soon as the Bill goes through the Legislature.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_68">We made that point on a number of occasions in regard to this legislation. I understand this is the oldest legislation still on the stocks. It was introduced in 1999 and, five years down the road, has still not been passed. I think the Minister promised in his election manifesto a proceeds of corruption Bill, some aspects of which he appears to have incorporated into amendments to this Bill. The Minister also deals with the recent Supreme Court decision in regard to other jurisdictions. He will probably go further down the road on Report Stage by introducing another substantial and important amendment in regard to enhancement received from criminal activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_69">These are all major matters, and it is important that they be restated in proper legislation. We are ending up with hybrid-type legislation in which things are grafted on from time to time and the original Bill is nothing like the final amended version. The final version will consist largely of a series of amendments and will be far greater that the rather modest legislation tabled originally.</p>
          <p eId="para_70">As I understood it, the purpose of the original legislation in 1999 was to more or less streamline and make more flexible the original 1996 Act. Its purpose was to smooth things out and make things easier for CAB. Now we have a Bill with large amendments designed to achieve purposes much different from the original intention. They incorporate what the Minister had intended to put into separate proceeds of corruption legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_71">It is a bad way of progressing legislation. I understand it originated from a different government, but it is nevertheless important that it be put on a proper statutory footing. In view of this, I support the proposal that a statute law replacement of the Acts be put in place as soon as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_74">First, the statute law restatement legislation was one of my great hobby horses when I was Attorney General. We pushed it through, and it is now the law that Acts can be republished in a consolidated form. It is happening now, I am glad to say. It is time consuming and is sometimes only done informally. For instance, some of the Deputies present will be aware that, in regard to the immigration and refugee legislation, my Department was already operating on the basis of informal restatements so that people could see the law in its real state rather than having a series of interrelated statutes before them. I accept the principle of Deputy Jim O'Keeffe's suggestion that a restatement should follow.</p>
          <p eId="para_75">The business plan for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform's criminal law reform division provides for a restatement of the corruption Acts to be undertaken later this year. I intend to add the proceeds of crime legislation to the restatement. I hope such a restatement will be published by the end of the year. I do not want to impose a statutory time limit on myself because the effect of that would be that somebody in the Office of the Attorney General would have to down tools on some other project to comply with the limit. Some other project would not be done because the restatement would have to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_76">An intention to restate the corruption law in late 2004 is part of the business plan for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform's criminal law reform division. I am prepared to amend our business plan to include a restatement of the proceeds of crime legislation, as appropriate, so that people can follow it in a single narrative text, rather than having to search a series of statutes to find out what the law is. I fully accept that it would have been desirable to start again, or to consolidate the entire statutory framework in a single consolidated Bill. We would have done so if we lived in a perfect world, but we live in an imperfect world. One cannot turn around the <i>QE2</i> that easily.

          <p eId="para_90">I hope the Minister will accept this amendment. The original 1996 Act was passed following the tragic assassination of Veronica Guerin. The legislation was brought forward in the context of major problems with drugs, particularly heroin, and organised criminal activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">We were concerned to deal with the proceeds of crime and money laundering. Very dangerous people were operating at that time. They were prepared to kill a journalist who was doing Trojan work in revealing publicly the darker side of Irish life, such as underworld activities. The vast majority of criminal activity centred in disadvantaged and deprived areas, just as the Celtic tiger was beginning to roar. Many marches and protests took place as communities started to come together. The institutions and agents of the State were not doing their jobs properly. Communities in many areas were left to their own devices.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">The situation has not improved greatly since that time, however. There are approximately 15,000 heroin addicts in this country. Merchants' Quay and other agencies have informed us that the supply of funds is inadequate to support the rehabilitation process and to assist the community which has been badly hit by the onset of hard drugs. We are now moving into the arena of cocaine, the new serious drug that is spreading throughout the disadvantaged areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">It is clear that there is a need for a special fund. Approximately 52% of the money in the dormant accounts fund, which has been earmarked for a particular purpose, is allocated to RAPID areas. If any fund should be earmarked for a particular purpose, it is the fund that consists of the proceeds of crime. If communities could see that illegally obtained moneys, acquired at the expense of the most vulnerable people, were being ploughed back into such areas with a view to building them up and making them less disadvantaged, it would be a powerful weapon in the fight against crime. We should give each community the resources to fight, to get on its own two feet and to provide the facilities that are required by young people. We need to build an awareness of the need to ensure that young people do not pursue a life of crime, drug addiction or, worse still, drug pushing.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">A substantial amount of money needs to be invested. Many of us represent constituencies where disadvantaged communities are to be found. When we hear that the national unemployment level is approximately 4.5% or 6%, we know that the same cannot be said of many blocks of flats or local authority housing estates in the areas we represent. Such areas have high unemployment levels. They have suffered as a result of the Government's recent cutbacks in community-based schemes such as community employment and job initiative. The schemes helped to maintain solidarity and stability in such communities by employing local people who might not have had the necessary high-powered skills to get employment in the financial services industry, etc. A considerable investment needs to be made in such areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">The moneys that are needed can be acquired from the proceeds of crime that are seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau under this legislation. Hardly anything else would have the same effect on such communities, which are fighting to maintain themselves. The proceeds of crime are taken from people who do not have any concern for communities, who have bled communities dry and who are parasites on the community. Such money should be reinvested in communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">I ask the Minister to give the committee a breakdown of the amount of money that has been seized in each of the years since the establishment of the Criminal Assets Bureau. Has all of the money simply been put back into the Exchequer? I am aware that assets are frozen for a seven-year period, so it is likely that not very much money has gone directly back into the Exchequer. The money that is waiting to go into the Exchequer funds, the Minister for Finance and the treasury could be used for the purposes I have mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">One of the Minister's new amendments to the Bill allows for the money to be unfrozen at an earlier stage, with the consent of all the parties, rather than waiting for seven years to elapse. The provision will mean that such money can more quickly be made available to the communities that need it. It is a wonderful idea. Deputy O'Dowd produced a Private Members' Bill last year proposing the same idea, more or less.</p>
          <p eId="para_98">I thought the pilot drugs court in the inner city was about to founder quite recently. We would all like to see that extended to other areas because it has a good success rate. That will also require funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">There are many reasons why we should ring-fence the money seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau under this legislation and direct it into the areas which have suffered from criminal activity and turn them into stable and solid communities.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O’Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_100">My views are in line with those of Deputy Costello. I would take a slightly different approach to where the money should be spent. My views are a reverberation of those put forward by my colleague, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, who has developed some thinking on this issue and put his views before the Dáil in the recent past. However, our thinking is essentially the same. Funds seized should be ring-fenced and used for a specific purpose. I hope the Minister has had discussions with the Minister for Finance to enable him to adopt, in principle, an approach along these lines.</p>
          <p eId="para_101">Deputy Costello's amendment refers to disposal orders and funding being used for community development purposes in disadvantaged areas. Mine proposes that funds be used for drug related initiatives, that is, voluntary and State-funded programmes established to discourage people from taking drugs or to assist in the rehabilitation of drug users. The differences are a matter of detail but we should establish the principle. These are funds seized from criminal activity largely in the drugs area and enormous amounts of money are involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">The Criminal Assets Bureau has been very successful and, like Deputy Costello, I would like to know what level of money is involved. The seven year period is too long and should be reduced to three or four years. An indication from the Minister as to whether or not he accepts the idea of ring-fencing would be helpful. We could then discuss how best to lay down a statutory framework for spending the money. It should obviously be in the drugs area where it will have an influence on discouraging the use of drugs.</p>

          <p eId="para_104">This matter was discussed at great length in the Dáil on the occasion of Deputy O'Dowd's Private Members' Bill, when the Minister for Defence stood in for me. I think I must have been in Hillsborough on that day. The issue was considered very carefully at that time. Deputy Smith stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_105">To agree to use the revenues generated from the disposition of property transferred to the Minister for Finance under the provisions of the 1996 Act would mean that the treatment of drug offenders would be financed, in part at least, by uncertain and variable revenue sources. This would not facilitate proper planning of treatment provision and programmes by those organisations that funding is proposed to support.</p>
          <p eId="para_106">Deputy Smith went on to say:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_107">Also, the majority of assets frozen to date under the Act did not derive from the activities of drug dealers and there is no logical link between those assets and drug prevention and treatment programmes. To channel all of those funds to drug initiatives could deprive other areas, such as hospitals and schools, of resources. One could argue for ring-fencing of receipts if it were seen to be the motivating factor in the generation of higher receipts [in other words, if the CAB felt more motivated to get in money because it was seen to be going to this or that purpose] but there is absolutely no indication that the CAB needs any further motivation in carrying out its work. The CAB continues to enjoy considerable success in depriving persons engaged in criminal activity from obtaining the proceeds of their nefarious activities.</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_108">The figures speak for themselves. In 2002, the bureau obtained interim orders to the value of more than €34 million and interlocutory orders to the value of more than €10 million. Taxes and interest demanded came to €12.8 million, with more than €10 million collected, and social welfare savings amounted to more than €155,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">There are more up-to-date figures. From its inception in October 1996 to the end of last year, the CAB has obtained interim and final restraint orders to the value of more than €51 million and €22 million, respectively. Final orders are interlocutory orders which are dealt with on the balance of probability.</p>

          <p eId="para_111">I do not know if those are cumulative or are two layers of the same cake. I do not want to mislead the Deputy. I imagine they must be cumulative. I cannot imagine how they would have been distinguished one from the other but I am not sure about that.</p>
          <p eId="para_112">Recently, the first disposal order, which is the seven year order, was successfully taken and more than €1 million was taken on a final disposal order.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">The Deputies opposite asked about the period of time provided, which is seven years. I have always understood the reason for the seven year period to be that it allows the statutory period of six years for an action <i>in rem</i>, or a personal action against the person from whom the property was taken, which is the normal statute period, to expire. In other words, if I am caught in possession of property and do not defend it but some of it belongs to my aunt, for example, she would have a period of time in which to make a claim on the property against me and to make a declaration that the property was hers and was not mine in the first place.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">We did not want punitively to extinguish potential third party claims against the money. The view was taken that it would not be a great social evil to balance third party rights in these matters since orders could extinguish them. The full six year period provided under the statute of limitations for those kinds of personal actions would have expired so that it could be argued at the beginning that we were not merely attacking the possessor but the rights of third parties, who might not be aware of what was going on. We wanted to avoid any question of penal confiscation and simply to have it as a civil law declaration as to the status of the property because we were worried that somebody might bring us to Strasbourg, from an ECHR point of view, and say this was an unacceptable use of civil law to achieve what were properly criminal law purposes. That is where the six and seven year periods derive from.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">Apart from quoting what the Minister for Defence said on my behalf on the last occasion, I have to say that hypothecation of assets is something to which the Department of Finance is rigidly opposed. They always say it is a bad idea. Their constant argument is that unless one can demonstrate that hypothecation of assets would increase the flow, there is absolutely no justification for it. A euro spent on old age pensions is just as good as a euro spent on inner city deprived areas or a euro spent on any other subject. They are rigidly opposed to creating some moral order of expenditures. I know I will be told about things which money should not be spent on. Mistakes are made from time to time and misjudgments are made on expenditure.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">The economists have a phrase for the use of money, termed fungible. It means that money, whatever it is used for, is just money. Earmarking money for this or that purpose, such as spending a euro on providing an artificial hip for Mrs. So and So in her 60s, may make good politics but it does not make very good economics.</p>

          <p eId="para_117">The lotto money is earmarked for specific purposes so that destroys that argument. In this instance, the public perception was that moneys seized in this manner would be directed towards tackling the specific problems created by the crimes. The Minister for Finance has the tax revenue and this is additional money. This should be spent on additional programmes which would not normally be funded by the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">I agree with Deputies Costello and Jim O'Keeffe. My leaning would be more towards Deputy O'Keeffe's idea that this type of money should be ring-fenced. Normally ring-fencing is used to deal with drugs-related initiatives or anything that would discourage young people from becoming involved in the drugs scourge. That could mean investment in sports programmes, for instance.</p>

          <p eId="para_119">I do not write the scripts for the Department of Finance but it would say that if it was generally perceived that the money from the lotto went towards buying a Government jet, it could discourage sales. People like to feel good about the lotto because it is a voluntary activity. If the money goes to community and sporting projects, people feel good about engaging in gambling and therefore it improves the flow of money to lotto. I can see that the argument that money is just money might discourage people from playing the lotto if the argument was made that such money was spent on the Government jet.</p>

          <p eId="para_121">The argument is that these are additional moneys, whether it is the lotto or CAB money or dormant accounts. They should not go into the same pot as the normal Exchequer funding. The dormant accounts fund is kept separate and that is the type of argument I am making.</p>

          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_122">The Minister said the majority of the money does not now come from drug dealers, but as the activities of CAB expand that may change. CAB was set up to deal with the drug dealers. Now that CAB will be enabled to seize money held abroad and co-operate with its foreign equivalent bodies, I presume the flow of money will increase. It is a strong argument that these are windfall gains and not the regular stream of funding to the Exchequer. It is additional funding that can be beneficial to a particular area in the same way as the lottery funding was ring-fenced for sporting activities and then subsequently diverted for health activities and so on. Much of the dormant accounts fund is ring-fenced for certain purposes such as activities in the RAPID area and the drugs task force.</p>
          <p eId="para_123">Of all the moneys seized, money which is the proceeds of crime would be the ideal type of windfall money to be ring-fenced in the fight against crime. The public would see that this money is being ploughed back for purposes relating to the fight against crime and the building up of communities. The building of communities by whatever means, such as the provision of facilities, would be very desirable. I cannot see how the Minister for Finance can argue that money of this nature should not be ring-fenced.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">There is another argument to be made about the money that is part of a regular stream of funding to the Exchequer. The money from motor taxation is being ring-fenced for local authorities to defray the cost of the water charges. The rules of the Exchequer and the Minister for Finance are more honoured in the breach than in the observance. The Minister should go back to the Department of Finance and say to the Minister for Finance——</p>

          <p eId="para_127">I have no doubt that in the fastnesses of Merrion Street, somebody is studying these remarks and watching the Deputy's recommendation carefully. In the real world in which I am forced to live, unfortunately, the chance of the Department of Finance agreeing to this form of hypothecation is small and for good reason in this case.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">As Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and as a former Attorney General, I have always thought there was a good argument for ring-fencing fines imposed by the criminal courts for the very reason that the fines would be more vigorously assessed, levied and recovered if they went to fund, for instance, the criminal injuries compensation tribunal or something similar. District Court judges deciding whether to fine Joe Bloggs €300 or €200 for a drunk driving offence and believing that money will just be lost in the maw of the Exchequer are a little inclined to be lenient with the fine.</p>
          <p eId="para_129">There could be a different approach to fines. The informal system of the court poor box shows that if people are motivated to use financial penalties because they can see the money was being used for a particular purpose, there might be greater use of fines. That said, I am fairly convinced that my little journey over to Merrion Street on foot of the advice received from Deputies Costello, O'Keeffe and Ó Snodaigh would be a forlorn journey and therefore I am not accepting the amendment.</p>

Is there a case for a broader definition of criminal conduct? Is there a case for establishing a definition of criminal conduct, whether or not that conduct has resulted in a criminal conviction?

          <p eId="para_169">My point is in regard to time limits in the issuing of warrants. If the Garda finds it necessary to secure a warrant it is obviously a matter of importance and perhaps great urgency. The importance of the seven day limit was highlighted in the recent Curtin case. Perhaps seven days is too tight but there should be some time limit because the use of a warrant breaches a person's normal constitutional rights. Therefore, there should be a time limit beyond which warrants cannot be executed.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">As I understand the drafting of the provision, such warrants would continue indefinitely. That is a dangerous approach. If seven days is not adequate or sufficient, we should set another time limit. This is why I suggested the term "not exceeding 14 days". If the Minister of State considers that further reasonable time is necessary, I would go along with it but, as currently drafted, the warrant would continue indefinitely. We should consider that in the context of some of the people the CAB has to go after. However, we are making law for everyone and must be careful we do not unduly breach constitutional limits.</p>

          <p eId="para_173">The point about the warrant time limit is well made by Deputy O'Keeffe. The original application specifies one week, unless it appears to the judge that another period would be most appropriate in the particular circumstances. That is an incredibly vague statement. There is no question of reasonable evidence or of a case being made by the Garda. It seems that the judge can give an unlimited period of time for a search warrant to be effective and operational. In such circumstances, there is scope for abuse. Later on, power is given to the seizing and retention of materials, documents and computers — not just a specific computer but any computer that might appear or any material. The powers are quite wide and I do not see the reason for it. If the Garda seeks a warrant for a specific offence which has been committed, why should it require an open type search warrant which could be extended indefinitely? It seems a grave interference with the rights of citizens.</p>

          <p eId="para_178">Amendment No. 20 inserts a definition of criminal conduct in the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996. It is included to reflect the inclusion of the definition of criminal conduct in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 contained in the earlier amendment. Its purpose is to provide for consistency between the definition of criminal conduct between that Act and the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996. The redefinition of place is to ensure that it is clear that the scope of the application of these provisions is intended to also include places other than a dwelling.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">On the proposed amendment No. 22, the change in paragraph (<i>a</i>) is consequent on the previous amendment, replacing the reference to “criminal activity” with “criminal conduct” and is done for consistency with the previous amendments. The amendment in paragraph (<i>b</i>) will allow for the Criminal Assets Bureau to co-operate formally with similar assets recovery agencies abroad, such as the assets recovery agency in the UK. Section 5 of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 provides for this already but the advice from the Office of the Attorney General is that its scope is much narrower than was originally envisaged. For example, we have been advised that agencies such as the UK assets recovery agency do not come under any of the categories referred to in section 5 of the 1996 Act as it is a civil forfeiture agency. The advice from the Office of the Attorney General also confirmed that an order under section 6 would not suffice to effect this change and a change to section 5 of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 is required to allow for co-operation with such bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">On amendment No. 23, the present section 14 search warrant provision of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act is being amended in a number of ways pursuant to these amendments. Subsection (<i>a</i>) replaces references to “criminal activities” in subsections (2) and (4) of section 14 with the words “criminal conduct”. This is done for consistency to reflect the change in the revised definition of money laundering referred to in the earlier amendments. Subsection (<i>b</i>) contains two changes. Briefly, the first change deletes the reference to the time limit of one week which applies to these search warrants and inserts in its place the words “within a period to be specified in the warrant”. This is being done to take account of a new insertion in the section of new subsection (4A), which is the subject of a later amendment and which provides for a time limit of one week unless the judge decides that another period is more appropriate. The second change is that provision is made to exclude material, which is the subject of legal privilege from the search. Subsection (3) inserts a new subsection that provides, as before, that the time limit which is to apply to a search warrant is one week, but allows for the possibility that a judge may apply a different time limit if it appears appropriate in the particular circumstances of the case. This will allow a case to be made when applying for the search warrant for seeking a longer time limit, for example, if a number of search warrants were sought in different areas of the country and co-ordination was required to allow them to be executed simultaneously. Subsection (<i>d</i>) is merely a drafting change; subsection (<i>e</i>) is a new provision which takes account of the need when executing a search to provide for making and retaining a copy of documents or records and if necessary for seizure and retention of computers or other storage medium on which a record may be kept. That is modelled on the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001. Subsection (<i>f</i>) builds on the previous subsection relating to seizure of computer media by inserting a new subsection (6A) in the search warrant provision, section 14 of the Criminal Assets Bureau 1996. Subsection (<i>g</i>) inserts a new subsection (9) in section 14 by replacing the definition section in that subsection and providing for a definition of computer at the place, which is being searched, which follows the wording already contained in section 48 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001. It also clarifies that the definition of material includes a copy of the material and a document or record. Again this definition follows the section 48 model.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">In amendment No. 29, the term "cash" is redefined and extended to make it clear that it also includes such items as postal orders, cheques, travellers cheques, bank drafts, bearer bonds and bearer shares. The amendment replaces the reference to criminal activity with criminal conduct, again for consistency purposes and inserts a definition of proceeds of crime in the Criminal Justice Act 1994, for consistency with definitions contained in this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Let me draw the attention of the committee to the amendment of section 43 of the 1994 Act, where a new subsection (1) to replace the present subsection is proposed. The new subsection contains an expanded definition of cash and a new definition of criminal conduct and proceeds of crime, but it fails to maintain the definition of exported, which is contained in the existing subsection (1), that is where cash is being exported. This omission was an oversight in the stamped copy of the amendment, in that while the new subsection 1(<i>a</i>) does not require a definition of exported, the new amended subsection (8) still does. I will move to re-introduce this definition on Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">The Bill as published amended the definition of "applicant" as defined in section 1 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996. It replaced the definition in that Act by a broader definition to include the Criminal Assets Bureau as an entity in addition to the existing categories of a member and an authorised officer. The purpose of this is to give the Criminal Assets Bureau the flexibility to take proceedings in its own name in addition to taking proceedings as it does already in the name of a member or authorised officer of the bureau. The new definition of proceeds of crime introduces the concept of criminal conduct in place of criminal activity in the existing definition as set out in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">The definition of property in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 is being amended to provide for inclusion of a reference to property which is situated outside the State but where there are specific links to this jurisdiction, that is that the respondent is domiciled, resident or present in the State and all or any part of the criminal conduct takes place within the State. This amendment takes cognisance of the recent decision of the Supreme Court in NK <i>v.</i> D, which held that the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, as currently construed has no application to the proceeds of crime committed outside the State. As a result of these changes, the Act will now apply to foreign criminality.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">The definition of respondent has been amended from the original meaning contained in the proceeds of Crime Act 1996 to include a reference to wherever the person is domiciled, resident or present, to reflect the fact that in some instances, the service of proceedings may be out of the jurisdiction, as already referred to. An additional change provides that the respondent may be a person who is not only the subject of proceedings, for which interim or interlocutory orders have been made, but also may be the person in respect of which such orders have been applied for. In addition to the changes to definitions which are already set out in the proceeds of crime Act 1996, new definitions which define consent, disposal order or criminal conduct are proposed for inclusion by way of amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">The first of the amendments tabled by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe makes it clear that an offence need not have been committed to trigger the forfeiture provision and the making of interlocutory orders and so on. The advice from the Attorney General is that the term criminal conduct is the terminology used in the legislation we are referring to here, including the 1994 Act, which relates to the seizure of drugs. As Deputy O'Keeffe will be aware, it is clear that this Act applies, as Deputy O'Keeffe envisages, whether a criminal offence is being committed. In the 1994 Act, a criminal offence must have been committed, so the last thing we want is to qualify or expand the definition, so that somebody prosecuting a person charged under the 1994 Act could argue that a criminal offence need not have taken place there. I understand the point Deputy O'Keeffe makes regarding what he understands to be the law under this Act is the position. Perhaps something may be done to clarify the situation and at the same time meet the concerns of the Attorney General. I will undertake to have that matter re-examined. I will convey Deputy O'Keeffe's views to the Minister regarding whose absence, I convey his apologies.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">The Deputy also referred to the question of 14 days and tying down the requirement to 14 days. The proposed amendment in the name of Deputy Jim O'Keeffe seeks to put a limit of 14 days on existing Government amendments to section 14 of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996, which adds subsection 4(<i>a</i>) stating that the period to be specified in the warrant shall be one week unless it appears to the judge that another period would be appropriate in the particular circumstances of the case. In preparing this legislation, we have consulted the Criminal Assets Bureau. It has been its experience that cases may arise where a number of different warrants are required to be executed at the same time. This has occurred in the case of Creaven and others <i>v. </i>McKay and others, where five different search warrants were required in order to seize the proceeds of the applicants’ criminal conduct. This resulted from the proceeds being located in several different locations. All the search warrants had to be executed at the same time to avoid tipping off the defendant about the search. It is considered that in exceptional circumstances like this it is appropriate that the time to be determined be left to the discretion of the judge who has all the facts before him or her in a particular case. To impose a time limit of 14 days or any other period may create difficulties in co-ordinating a number of search warrants. The basic law is that the search has to be executed within seven days unless the judge determines in the particular circumstances of the case that the period be extended. It will be a matter for the judge to decide in each particular case. The onus is on the applicant to convince the judge that there is a good case for extending the time. The normal period is seven days, but we have introduced this element of flexibility at the behest of the Criminal Assets Bureau based on its experience in trying to operate this.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">On the definition of criminal conduct, I accept it is an issue that must be carefully teased out and I accept the Minister of State has undertaken to do so and we can return to it on Report Stage.

          <p eId="para_189">Regarding the other amendment, I probably have spent too long reading constitutional reports, but I have a sense of unease about the possibility of an unlimited time being available for search warrants. I accept the Minister of State's point that this will require a decision of the judge. I will withdraw it, re-examine it and perhaps a reformulation might meet with approval on Report Stage. I understand that the issuance of multiple warrants and special searches over a wide area involving many people must take place simultaneously. If a warrant is not executed within a reasonable time, the CAB could go back to the judge and get another one. I will withdraw the amendment, reflect on it and re-examine it for Report Stage.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_72">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_190">The point at issue was well made by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe. There is a problem about specifying that the normal period is one week unless it appears to the judge that effectively any other period would be appropriate. The word "any" is not inserted but that is the effect of the text. I tabled a question recently to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the number of search warrants refused by the courts. The answer given was to the effect that 99.9% of such applications for warrants are granted. It is pretty much a formality for a garda to go to court to apply for a search warrant. Undoubtedly whatever is said in the courts is taken as gospel. The Minister may argue that is not the case, but the statistics speak for themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">I do not know how this will be affected by the Minister's new Garda Síochána Bill under which he intends to transfer authority for the granting of search warrants from the District Court to a Garda superintendent or a Garda inspector. Once that legislation is enacted, will that mean that a garda would be in a position to give an open-ended extension for a search warrant that might well be served within his or her own jurisdiction? The temptation would seem to be considerable in those cases. The Minister should go back to the drawing board, as Deputy O'Keeffe said, reflect on it and examine whether there is a mechanism to deal this. It seems that if the period specified in the warrant is one week and that is to be the norm, any extension of a period should be less than a week. In other words, it should not exceed two weeks. Otherwise it would become a trawling, indefinite and open-ended exercise.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
          <p eId="para_192">The position is as I outlined. We discussed this with the Criminal Assets Bureau and have worked on the basis of its experience in trying to operate the legislation. The committee will be interested to hear that the Criminal Assets Bureau wanted the period specified to be a month because there is a precedent for that in section 5 of the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001. We did not give it that time because we considered it was too long, but as a compromise we introduced this little element of flexibility. The Judiciary is aware of the danger of open-ended warrants. An applicant would need to have substantial grounds to convince a judge that the normal period should be departed from in a particular case. It was to facilitate the Criminal Assets Bureau, which we would all agree is doing a tremendous job implementing this difficult legislation, that we moved this amendment and made this change. We have not gone fully down the road of the making the change the Criminal Assets Bureau sought because we felt it was a bit too balanced in favour of the prosecution, the Garda Síochána or the authorities. I understand the points that have been made. I do not believe there is any real danger in this context. I will certainly convey what has been said to the Minister who will take Report Stage.</p>

I would favour words to the effect that in exceptional circumstances a warrant can be granted for a period of up to so many days and not exceeding so many days. The manner in which the legislation is currently drafted means this provision is quite open-ended. I am not sure how constitutionally sound it is to have such an open-ended provision.</p>

          <p eId="para_202">I refer to the definitions of "criminal conduct". Amendment No. 4 states "criminal conduct" means "any conduct which constitutes an offence or more than one offence, or which occurs outside the State and which would constitute an offence or more than one offence if it occurred within the State and if it constituted an offence under the law of the state or territory concerned" while amendment No. 29 states "criminal conduct" means "any conduct which constitutes an offence or more than one offence, or where the conduct occurs outside the State, constitutes an offence under the law of the state or territory concerned and would constitute an offence or more than one offence if it occurred within the State". If the crime took place abroad, therefore, it would have to be an offence in Ireland to be considered criminal conduct whereas amendment No. 4 suggests if the crime is an offence in another county, it is accepted as criminal conduct here, even though the same laws might not govern it. It is slightly contradictory.</p>

        <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_83" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. O’Dea</from>
          <p eId="para_203">The definitions of "criminal conduct" clarify that it can be one offence or more than one offence or conduct in a foreign state, which would be one or more than one offence if it occurred here, is an offence under the law of the foreign state and, at the time that the application for the interim or interlocutory order is made, the property obtained as a result of the proceeds of crime is situated in this State. The new definition will ensure it will not be necessary for the Criminal Assets Bureau to show that the conduct was a particular type of criminality, if it is shown the property was obtained through conduct of one of a number of kinds, each of which would be an offence.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">In addition, the extraterritorial elements in the definition of "property" clarify that service outside the jurisdiction may be effected on an individual. Service outside the jurisdiction has been adjudicated on by the High Court on a number of occasions in favour of the CAB and the amendment gives a statutory basis to such service. The effect of the combined changes relating to the definitions of "proceeds of crime", "property", "criminal conduct" and "respondent" is to ensure the proceeds of crime legislation covers five specific scenarios in regard to jurisdiction.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">They are where the respondent and the property are in the State and the criminal conduct occurs within the State; where the respondent is situated outside the State but the property is located and the criminal conduct occurs within the State; where the criminal conduct occurred outside the State but the respondent and the property are situated within the State; where the respondent is within the State and the criminal conduct occurred within the State but the property is located outside the State; and where the property is located within the State, the respondent is situated outside the State and the criminal conduct occurred outside the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">I refer to a technical amendment. Amendment No. 23 refers to section 14(<i>a</i>) of the 1996 Act, which deals with search warrants. “Criminal conduct” is referred to in subsections (1), (2) and (4) but the reference to subsection (1) was omitted in the final stamped copy of the amendments and this was only noticed yesterday. Accordingly, I will move an amendment on Report Stage to include this reference.</p>

          <p eId="para_229">The amendment deals with disposal orders obtained by originating summons and is intended to ensure a special summons procedures applies to section 4 disposal orders similar to the amendments to section 2 interim orders and section 3 interlocutory orders. All three can be obtained by originating summons. As with the other amendments, the intention of the amendment is to ensure the matter will be listed at the earliest opportunity with the full case of both parties set out in a formal manner. In other words, the amendment will ensure a special summons procedure and, as a result, defendants will be obliged to respond to proceedings on affidavit and so avoid the need for particulars and discovery at an early stage in the process.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">Currently, there is no specification as to how the application for the order should be made. Under the current system, the practice of the Criminal Assets Bureau has been to have an initiating motion in parallel with the plenary proceedings with a statement of claim, although it would be possible for the bureau to start proceedings on a writ only, which would not be fair to the defendant. Equally, the current position means that the defendants are under no obligation to specify at an early stage the case they will be making. Along with this, the current circumstances which allow for the duplication of the motion process with the plenary proceedings causes a multiplicity of hearings with unnecessary costs.</p>

          <p eId="para_233">It is a reasonably important amendment because the Minister has just outlined that the originating motion will be a special summons type procedure with no specifics or details. That would appear to ignore due process and a question would arise as to how it would stand up under the European Convention on Human Rights. Why can the CAB not proceed in the normal way with a detailed pleading and with specifics, where the case would be set out and there would be an opportunity for the defence to respond? In the recent Supreme Court case we discussed earlier — I am not sure of the reference — normal due process was upheld but the Minister appears to be trying to reverse that position. I do not understand the reason we cannot proceed in the normal fashion. Indeed, in the Civil Liability and Courts Bill, which the committee will debate later, there is specific emphasis on having detailed pleadings so that both sides can be fully aware of the case. This is beneficial in resolving the matter speedily and I do not understand why the Minister should decide to go along the process of a special summons without the details of the case being put. It will only delay matters and be more costly in terms of taxpayers' money. There is also the question of the normal due process under which the courts operate.</p>

The next Bill to go before the House concerns civil liability and provides that where, for example, somebody is knocked down and suffers crushing leg injuries, their entitlement to damages will be reduced.

One of the primary purposes of the proceeds of crime legislation is not to enrich the Exchequer with expropriated property but rather a desire to freeze proceeds of crime in order to deprive those concerned of the benefits of criminal proceeds. The most constant criticism of the legislation from civil rights groups etc., has been that it penalises without the individual affected being convicted of any offence. A reduction of the period between the interlocutory order and the disposal order to three years might render the legislation more open to challenge on the grounds that it is a penal confiscation without due process. The shorter the period before the forfeiture stage, the greater the chance that the forfeiture may be considered penal.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">While a period of seven years does not overcome all the relevant periods under the Statute of Limitations, it addresses some of the issues. At the end of seven years, any contractual claims against real property will have been defeated, albeit claims by mortgagees and other claims against real property will not have been defeated in that time. Accordingly, the period of seven years is a desirable timespan during which contractual claims could be defeated. The new provision which we are introducing for a consent disposal order allows for that seven year period to be reduced to a mediacy, provided all the parties concur.</p>

          <p eId="para_307">This amendment is included to clarify that section 11(7) of the Statute of Limitations 1957, which applies a two year limitation period to certain actions for forfeiture, does not apply to any proceedings under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996. Confusion has arisen where proceeds of crime applications for interlocutory orders pursuant to section 3 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 were challenged because it had been assumed, incorrectly, that they are actions for forfeiture so as to benefit from the two year limitation period provided by section 11(7) of the Statute of Limitations 1957. In two High Court cases Mr. Justice Finnegan held that this was not so. The issue was more recently considered by the Supreme Court on 17 May 2004 in McK. <i> v </i>D. The court followed the earlier decisions of the High Court. The amendment confirms that decision of the Supreme Court and is included on an avoidance of doubt basis to show that section 11(7) of the Statute of Limitations 1957 did not apply at any stage to proceedings under the Act.</p>

          <p eId="para_312">Section 9 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 is a provision relating to affidavits specifying property and income of defendants. Section 7 of the Bill added an additional subsection (2) into section 9 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and was intended to prevent the use of information supplied by the respondent or the respondent's spouse under section 9(1) of the principal Act in any criminal proceedings, with the exception of proceedings for perjury, in relation to the information supplied.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">However, during discussions with the Office of the Attorney General and the Director of Public Prosecutions concerns were expressed about the use of the phrase, "any information", in section 7 as being too wide. It was felt that such wording could allow a defendant to swear a wide ranging affidavit referring to many offences, some of which might be currently under investigation or could be before the courts as a prosecution. By swearing such an affidavit as could have been comprehended in the original wording, there was a likelihood that further prosecution might be avoided. Accordingly, this new formula of words is being used.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_472">(3) The standard of proof in proceedings under this section is that applicable in civil proceedings.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_473">2C.—Sections 40 (appeal against forfeiture order), 41 (interest on cash detained), 42 (procedure) and 45 (disposal of forfeited cash) of the Act of 1994 shall apply in relation to cash and, as appropriate, to any other gift or consideration detained under section 2A, or forfeited under section 2B, of this Act as they apply in relation to cash detained or forfeited under section 38 or 39 of that Act.'.".</p>
          <p eId="para_474">This new section providing for seizure of a bribe is modelled on section 38 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994. A bribe, as an instrumentality of an offence, is not automatically forfeit at present. The term "proceeds of crime" covers not only the proceeds of an offence but also the instrumentalities of the offence, as it means property obtained or received in connection with the commission of an offence as well as a result of the offence. It follows, then, that a bribe can be the subject of a proceeds of crime order. However, in the criminal law area there is no specific provision rendering forfeit a bribe. This provision will provide in criminal legislation that a bribe, as an instrumentality of crime, should be automatically forfeit in much the same way as an illicitly held firearm or a pirated video is forfeited.</p>
