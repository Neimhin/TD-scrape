          <p eId="para_1">Today, 2 July, will see the production of probably the worst figures on our economy ever seen.  I hold the Taoiseach responsible as the former Minister for Finance for presiding over this situation.  He knew this would happen.  He had the advice, he was given the warnings and he knew the signs.  Can he outline one intervention that he made in the past six months to rectify the slide into which this economy is facing?</p>

          <p eId="para_15">We are in a position to do so because our overall public finance position has greatly improved since we have had ten of the last 11 budgets in surplus.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">When one meets a downturn, as we are meeting it, the ability to accommodate that through deficit is possible but we must work within our framework.  We must recognise that our responsibility during the course of the remainder of this year is to work within the agreed spending limits we have set ourselves and ensure that the corrective action we take is such that we can devise during the course of the Estimates campaign a strategy for 2009 and beyond.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">It is important to point out that the ESRI, which has had the most pessimistic forecast for this year, makes the point that, while in the short term we face that challenge, it acknowledges the underlying strength of the economy, the ability to return to growth rates of 4% over the medium term once we get over this present difficulty.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">Those are the facts of the situation in terms of the context in which we must operate, and to suggest that this economy has suddenly become a poor or bad economy overnight is not correct, is not an accurate assessment of the situation and is basically a consistent political charge which is not backed up by the facts.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">That is the usual Fianna Fáil response, that if one mentions a challenge to the economy one is guilty of national sabotage.  The Taoiseach has been at this for 18 months.  He has been in charge of this economy for the past three years.  He saw these signs.  He stated that the ESRI produced a report.  The ESRI also stated that he blew the boom.  The ESRI pointed out that this Government has blown the boom.  As Minister for Finance, the Taoiseach increased spending to a reckless point with no return for the taxpayer.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">His Minister for Finance stated recently that it is his misfortune to arrive in the Department of Finance at this stage to clear up the mess left by his predecessor, who happens to be the Taoiseach.</p>

          <p eId="para_24">The Taoiseach has arrived at a position today, on 2 July, where tax receipts have collapsed; where he is facing an €8 billion deficit; where unemployment is rising at the highest rate in Europe; where the cost of living is at the highest rate; where, unfortunately, our economy is winning the losers' league; and the Taoiseach has presided over that.  His Minister for Finance has stated that he is now in the unfortunate position of having to clear up the mess — the first time, I might add, that Fianna Fáil has ever had to clean up its own mess.</p>

I have a letter from the parents of an 18 year old man with intellectual disabilities who has just finished special school and secured a place in a day training centre.  This man had begun his induction course but his parents then received a letter stating that the school regretted to inform them that it had not yet received clarification from the HSE regarding funding for new clients who had applied for admission.  Until it received this information and agreement on funding, it was unable to offer their son a start date.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_85">we are now in a state of panic and are writing to you in desperation.  What is to happen to our daughter?  She cannot lead an independent life and without a day service she stands to lose everything that makes her day-to-day life worthwhile.</p>

          <p eId="para_87">The cutbacks are already happening.  When the Taoiseach talks about corrective action, this is what he is talking about.  Let us be clear about it.  Is this the corrective action about which he is talking?  People with disabilities finishing school need a day service, but they are being told the HSE has no money.  There was a story in one of yesterday's newspapers stating the HSE had diverted €75 million from these services to plug a hole elsewhere.  This is the position to which the Taoiseach has brought us.</p>
          <p eId="para_88">There will be much talk today about the economy, figures, Exchequer returns — billions this and that.  However, it all comes down to the worries that people will have over the summer about whether their son or daughter will get a service in a day care centre, or the worry of a young woman about whether her personal assistant will be taken away.  Can the Taoiseach say where the bottom line on all of this is when he talks of corrective action?  Can the Taoiseach give an assurance to those parents that their children will have the services they had hoped for next year?  Can he give an assurance to that young woman that her personal assistant will not be taken away.</p>
          <p eId="para_89">Terms such as corrective action are all very well — they are economy-speak and political-speak.  However, what matters to people is whether they get the services they need.  When the Taoiseach talks about painful adjustments, who will bear the pain?  Is it these parents and these people with disabilities?</p>

          <p eId="para_95">The Deputy wants the answer to the question and he is getting it.  The HSE hopes to be able to finalise the position regarding the commencement of the developments, including those required to meet the needs of school-leavers with disabilities, over the next ten days.  We are trying to ensure that those people are not the sufferers.  I stand over the record of the Department of Health and Children, the Government and my personal record in this area and compare them favourably to any record of Deputy Gilmore's or any Government he has ever had the pleasure of being involved in.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">The financial review which took place was in an effort to ensure that we provide services.  When Deputy Gilmore asks if it is all double-speak and political-speak, there is €3 billion less in tax revenues this year than was hoped for.  We have to deal with that situation.</p>

When I talk about corrective action, I mean we must cut our cloth to meet our measure on the basis of the revenues available.  That is what we must do and we can do this on the basis of consolidating the progress that we have made thus far, if we go about it in a sensible manner.  However, there is no painless or easy formula that the Opposition might like to suggest by which this can be done.</p>

There is a contention that the economy has not grown this year compared to last year and it will not grow much this year, if at all.  I make the point to those who are trying to run down the economy that output this year compares favourably to last year and is 30% higher than in 2002.  The economy has grown by 30% since 2002.</p>

Every other country is facing precisely the same issues we are and does not have as much ability to take the hit in the way that we have been able.

          <p eId="para_106">Regarding the specific issue raised this morning, I am glad to say that my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy John Moloney, has been able to ensure that the provision of those services arising out of the extra €50 million for disability services that we are providing this year will come through.  The 2008 service plan as set out by the HSE will be met.  This follows from €75 million extra the previous year and €75 million extra the year before that again.  That is not to suggest we have everything sorted out in the disability sector.  However, the commitment of the Government compares very favourably to any Government of which Deputy Gilmore was a member.</p>

            <p eId="para_185">Much progress has already been achieved in fulfilling the commitments in the programme for Government.  Clearly, the Government must make decisions in light of the fiscal position which will be indicated on publication of the half-yearly Exchequer returns.</p>

As I understand it, the programme for Government was based on the assumption of an economic growth rate of 4.5% per annum over the life of the Government, which will clearly not be achieved.  Will there be a revision of the specifics in the programme for Government?</p>
            <p eId="para_188">I wish to ask about two specific points.  The first is the commitment by the Government, and Fianna Fáil in particular, to reduce the top rate of tax by 1%, the lower rate of tax by 2%, and to cut employee PRSI contributions by 2%.  Is the Taoiseach proceeding with that or is it still in the programme for Government or to be believed?</p>
            <p eId="para_189">There is also a commitment in the programme for Government to cut the VAT rates on certain environmental goods and services from 21% to 13.5%.  Is it still intended to proceed with that?</p>

During the election campaign, I set out my priorities with regard to those tax commitments and these are on the record and available for public consumption.</p>
            <p eId="para_191">All commitments made in the programme for Government and our manifesto were very clear.  They were more conservative than commitments made by others but I made it very clear that they are in the context of a sustainable public finance position.  We must work within certain guidelines as members of the euro currency area.  Clearly, we must contend with that position.</p>
            <p eId="para_192">These matters must be considered in the context of the full tenure of Government.  Which ones are to be implemented and how will be a matter for budgetary decision from year to year.</p>

            <p eId="para_194">In respect of this particular set of commitments, I wish to know if it still the Government's intention to cut the top rate of tax by 1%, the standard rate by 2% and employee PRSI rates by 2%?  Is that still the Government's intention in its lifetime and does it form part of the programme for Government?</p>

            <p eId="para_200">I am answering the question.  The Deputy seeks to suggest the commitments were absolute or made without reference to the public finances, which is not the position.  When the commitments were made they were set out very clearly on that basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_201">A sound economy is the bedrock of social progress and an absolute prerequisite for all our ambitions.  To that end, we will defend prosperity and the consequences of that determination are clear.  If we ever face into a global economic downturn, we will act prudently, as we have done previously, and will keep the healthy fundamentals intact through the downturn.  We said that if there was a downturn, we would have to take account of it.  There were no absolute commitments made in any respect before, during or after any election because the first priority is to maintain a sound economy, without which one has no prospects and one can talk aspirationally about anything one likes.  That is the position, as was set out in writing at the time.</p>

Currently, more than €400 million per annum is expended on the rent supplement scheme.  The ultimate recipient of this money, which first goes to tenants, is the landlord.  We do not have an efficient system in place to ensure landlords pay tax on the money they receive through the rent supplement allowance.

The most recent indication from the ESRI indicates that the national debt will increase by 60% in just three years and that it is rapidly on the way to doubling over the period of the programme for Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_310">Does the Taoiseach accept that the programme for Government, as an indication of this Administration's medium-term strategy, is now meaningless, particularly when one considers the expectation, as indicated by the Department of Finance, that, in cumulative terms, tax revenue will be out by €30 billion when compared to what was predicted when the programme was drawn up?  Does he agree that an alternative medium-term strategy will be required if the programme for Government no longer constitutes such a strategy?  Does he agree that such an alternative strategy should set out what will be the new priorities on the basis of the resources expected to be available?  The programme for Government gives priority to the delivery of the national development plan, in full and on time.  However, the Minister for Finance clearly indicated that this will not happen.</p>

            <p eId="para_312">On the basis that the growth rate will not be 4.5%, it is clear that we will not be able to implement all aspects of the programme for Government.  The latter is, after all, based on the assumption of achieving such a rate of growth.  We must prioritise certain areas of activity, ensure we make the correct strategic decisions in order to increase the capacity of the economy and make it able to withstand the competitive pressures to which it is being subjected and emerge from this difficult period with as resilient and as good an economy as possible.  Even if we were not experiencing difficulties such as those with which we are faced, in the absence of a growth rate of 4.5% we could not achieve full implementation of the programme for Government.  The consequence of that will be set out during the course of this year and, indeed, in the next budget.  As is the case in every  Budget Statement, we will set out our medium-term strategy based on our expectations for the debt to GDP ratio.  That is the normal budgetary provision over a three year period but it is clear from the level of growth achieved this year that the elimination of debt is not an achievable target during the course of this Administration.  We have to devise a sustainable public finance position which will address the present situation, allow the economy to continue to function and provide basic levels of service, while at the same time ensuring that we return to the medium-term growth rates discussed by the ESRI in its report.</p>

            <p eId="para_313">Surely, the Taoiseach does not pretend that the budget represents a medium-term strategy.  It is an arithmetic projection of existing levels of services.  There is no attempt to drive efficiency or find ways of economising in certain areas in order to provide resources for priorities.  We have four difficult years ahead of us and we need a proper compass to guide us.  Every time I ask the Taoiseach about this, however, he consistently refuses to acknowledge that the programme for Government does not represent such a strategy and that we need an alternative.  The sooner he wakes up to that and starts to build the strategy, the better for this economy's recovery.</p>

That was in the programme for Government for a good reason, namely, to achieve structural separation between the ESB and Eirgrid in the context of facilitating competition in energy generation and supply in Ireland.  Now the Taoiseach cannot even tell us when the legislation to facilitate that will be brought before the House despite the promises made last September and October that it would be introduced by mid-2008.  Why has he changed his mind on that issue?</p>

In education, for example, the Taoiseach is aware that 56 priorities have been set out for the lifetime of the Government.  Which of these commitments will be met?

The commitment on technology has not seen a brass farthing since it was outlined in January 2007.</p>

            <p eId="para_350">When the NDP was published, it stated clearly on page 16 that it was subject to a prudent budgetary policy fully consistent with the Stability and Growth Pact.  That was reiterated by me and my colleagues on numerous occasions.  It is stated on the same page that the NDP will "allow for reallocation as necessary depending on evolving priorities and the economic and budgetary situation."  The NDP is the same as a budget or anything else in that it has to be subject to the availability of resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_351">To answer the Deputy's question on prioritisation by Ministers, if in the first year of a five year programme one ends up in a situation where the rate of growth is much less than anticipated because of the environment in which we find ourselves, one's first priority has to involve consolidating the existing position and trying to maintain the services built up over the years.  That is the amount of resources available.  If one can get out of this situation — it is said that 2009 will be a difficult year, with higher growth rates perhaps beginning in 2010 — one will be in a position to resume the prioritisation.  One will see the priorities for years three, four and five at that stage.  In the context of 2009, one would use the Estimates campaign to work out with the Minister for Finance the policy changes, value for money and level of increased output that can be obtained for the resources allocated on the basis that one has to sustain a doable budgetary position over the period.  That is how one would proceed and that will emerge in due course.</p>

            <p eId="para_418">We now have no idea what commitments in the programme for Government will be met.  Perhaps the Taoiseach will tell us what are the priorities of this Government, in particular in respect of health given the delivery of a fully modern patient-centred health service is one of three issues listed as important.</p>
            <p eId="para_419">Already, money allocated for areas such as mental health, palliative care, disability services, as raised again this morning by Deputy Gilmore, and care of the elderly has been diverted by the Health Service Executive for other purposes.  Will the Taoiseach give a clear indication, as leader of the country, whether money will be spent in those areas to which it has been allocated, in particular, in respect of the provision of disability services?  Also, will he devise a mechanism through which he can control what the HSE does with its budget?  Given the cutbacks recently announced, funding specifically ringfenced for these areas is in danger.</p>
            <p eId="para_420">What mechanism will the Taoiseach, as leader of Government, use to ensure this funding is spent in areas such as disability services given the concerns outlined in this regard by my party leader this morning?  Young people coming out of educational services have nowhere to go.  Similarly, people in acute beds in hospitals who need only support in the community have nowhere to go.</p>

            <p eId="para_423">The Taoiseach, when he took office, mentioned specifically in his speech — I remember it well — issues such as the environment and climate change.  In this regard, the programme for Government sets an important target of a 3% reduction in carbon emissions per annum.  This has goodwill across this House as we all recognise the importance of meeting the challenge of global warming.</p>
            <p eId="para_424">I must raise with the Taoiseach an issue of grave concern.  I am glad Deputy Behan is present in the House.  It appears the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, has lost the confidence not alone of Members on this side of the House but on the Government side.  I do not expect the Taoiseach has read <i>The Wicklow Times</i> but I presume he is aware of this loss of confidence on his side given he is leader of the Fianna Fáil Party.  I submit to the Taoiseach that we are in trouble when a member of a Government party states the Taoiseach should seriously consider finding an alternative portfolio for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government who self evidently is not up to the job and also calls on that Minister to reconsider his position.  This is at a time when we must meet onerous requirements from the EU in respect of climate change.  We all want to meet those requirements.</p>
            <p eId="para_425">Will the Taoiseach offer to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government a new portfolio with which he can cope?  It is clear he has lost the confidence of Members on the Government side of the House to live up to his requirement.</p>

          <p eId="para_484">I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to raise a matter of national importance: the threat to the most vulnerable children in the country posed by the lack of positive action by the State, which is failing in its duty to protect vulnerable children.  According to the annual report of the Ombudsman for Children, complaints about the State's education services made up nearly half of all representations to the ombudsman last year, including complaints about a lack of support for children with special needs.</p>

In view of that openness, I ask the Taoiseach whether it is intended to release the five reports that were produced on this issue.

We seem to be slower in receiving reports following independent inquiries.  There was an independent inquiry into the tragedy in April 2007 involving the four members of the Dunne family in Monageer, County Wexford.  I understand the report was due for publication in April this year but that this deadline was then extended by three months.  I understand from reports yesterday that its publication is being delayed again.  When will it be published and released?</p>
          <p eId="para_515">The second issue I wish to raise arises from a judgment of the European Court of Human Rights yesterday involving a number of human rights organisations.  It was established that over a seven year period every telephone, fax, e-mail and data communication between the United Kingdom and Ireland, including legally privileged and confidential information, had been intercepted and stored, <i>en masse</i>, by an electronic test facility operated by the British Ministry of Defence.  This breaches the human right to privacy.</p>

          <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
          <p eId="para_653">I welcome this opportunity to address the House on the former steelworks site on Haulbowline island.  When the matter was last raised in this Chamber, I was in Cork at a meeting on the Green Paper on local government reform with local representatives from all political parties.  I thank my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Hoctor, for deputising for me on that occasion and dealing with such a complex issue.  I wish to address the real concerns of those living and working in the Cork Harbour area.  I want to make it clear that we are dealing with an environmental challenge that did not manifest itself overnight but is instead the legacy of an industrial past.  While we do not have much experience of such a legacy in this country, it is common elsewhere in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">The steel plant on Haulbowline island was an important part of the local economy for more than six decades.  The site has the potential to contribute to the local society and economy again in the future, albeit in a more environmentally acceptable manner, and I think it will do so.  Industrial activities of this nature were poorly regulated during those decades, unfortunately.  By contrast, an integrated approach to the regulation of such facilities is now the norm.  The consequence of such poorly regulated activity is the accumulation of an unquantifiable, but clearly significant, quantity of waste in the area of the facility known as the "east tip".  While we do not have all the details of what was dumped there over a 62-year period, we know that the site is seriously contaminated.  It has been widely known for some time that serious contamination has taken place.  The contamination is rightly a cause of concern for the local community.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">I propose to address the role of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in managing the Haulbowline site.  I will do so from a twin perspective — to allay public concern and to challenge those who are interested in other issues.  As Deputies are aware, the steel plant was sold by a previous Government in 1996 for £1 and went into liquidation in 2001.  In 2003, the Government gave the Department the task of co-ordinating the complex legal issues which were outstanding at that time.  The Department was also asked to provide for site security and maintenance.  Crucially, it was given responsibility for enabling a site investigation to be carried out to assist the Government in determining the best option, environmentally and economically, for the future use of the site and its remediation.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">In its discharge of this mandate, the Department arranged for the carrying out of a comprehensive site investigation; established a system of ongoing environmental monitoring; decontaminated and demolished the steelworks buildings; and arranged for a site surface clearance contract with Hammond Lane Metal Company Limited.  As a result of these actions, the Government can now make an informed decision on the future use of the site.  A detailed risk assessment of the entire site, with recommendations for the appropriate remediation that is required, can be undertaken.  Last evening, I met representatives of the local community, including Senator Boyle.  I took the opportunity to hand to them the entire report on the site investigation which concluded in 2005, including the full suite of technical data it generated.</p>

          <p eId="para_672">I gave the representatives all that data and the full suite of technical data which it generated.  I also gave them the reports on the ongoing monitoring of the site which has been carried out over the intervening period.  These documents are now in the public domain and my Department has arranged with the consultants who produced the 2005 report that they will clarify any technical issues which may be raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">This information is the total of the reports and investigations of the site arranged by my Department.  The 2005 report in particular summarises earlier desktop studies and, more importantly, reports on comprehensive intrusive site investigation which included extensive analysis of soil, water and air, including sub-surface testing for heavy metals.  It is important to stress this point.  The more recent work on the site was intended to be solely for the purpose of surface clearance.  The earlier investigation involved extensive sub-surface investigation.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">I base my reassurance to the community on these reports which have indicated no immediate threat to human health or the environment in the locality, while, of course, recognising that this is a problematic site which will ultimately require an extensive and co-ordinated resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">The particular issue which arose recently relates to the uncovering by a sub-contractor of sub-surface waste.  Sub-surface excavation of waste was not part of the Department's contract with Hammond Lane Metal Company Limited.  It was the considered view of the Department, following consultations with the Environmental Protection Agency and Cork County Council, that the required course of action in the short term would be to cap the exposed waste with inert slag material.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">This was not acceptable to one of Hammond Lane's subcontractors who expressed concern that liability might accrue to it as a consequence of any impact that the disturbed material might cause.  By way of reassurance, and in the context of the then proximity of the end of the planned surface clearance works, the Department wrote to the contractor on 18 April 2008 advising that the back-filling approach was what was required.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">It was also stated that the management of the area which had been disturbed would fall to be determined by the Government, in the context of the pending decision on the overall future of the site and the resultant more comprehensive remediation which might be required.  The contractor was also assured that it would not be expected to accept future liability.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">Despite these assurances, and repeated instructions to stop unauthorised works related to the sub-surface waste, including by letter from the Chief State Solicitor on 23 May 2008, the sub-contractor refused to leave the site and continued to operate without authorisation and in a piecemeal fashion, causing a potential threat to the environment.  Following legal advice, the contract with Hammond Lane Metal Company Limited was terminated with immediate effect on 30 May 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">In light of these recent events, my Department has now re-engaged the consultants to carry out an independent and rigorous assessment of site conditions.  This assessment is now under way and will involve analysis of soil, slag, dust, surface and ground water samples for all likely contaminants, including heavy metals such as chromium.  The results will be published.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">My Department and other relevant agencies are properly engaged in the management of this legacy site in a manner which is consistent with good practice and minimisation of risk to human health and the environment.  A coherent overall approach, rather than piecemeal action which could inadvertently cause problems to the local community and the environment, must be taken and that is the objective pursued by the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">I have been an environmental campaigner for 26 years.  I understand fully the concerns of local people and those of the Deputies opposite.  I know they are doing their job in trying to hold the Government to account.  I say to those Deputies, genuinely, that I will give them any information they require and I will give the same to any residents who seek it.  It may not be sufficient to talk across this Chamber but if the Deputies wish to meet with me to discuss the matter, I am more than happy to oblige them.</p>

          <p eId="para_682">I wish to share my short time with Deputies Stanton, Clune and Hogan.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">I recognise the Minister's commitment to the environment which is not in question here.  I also recognise that information we have seen in respect of this site and its handling raises serious concerns.  I do not want to get into issues of relationship between sub-contractors and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  My issue is one of public health.  This is a site in the middle of Cork Harbour which is not safe, as information from independent sources suggests.  That is why I questioned the Minister's statement which attempted to reassure people that there is no risk to public health.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">I will raise four specific issues.  Last December, a shoreline sample was taken, the results of which I have in front of me.</p>

          <p eId="para_686">The sample measured mercury.  It was taken by independent consultants and I can show the reports to the Minister afterwards.  If he has not seen them, he should have.  The figure quoted for mercury found on the beach outside this site is 281 milligrams per kilogram.  The recommended intervention level is ten.  This is 28 times the level that should require intervention.  What does the Minister say to that?  Has he seen that report?</p>
          <p eId="para_687">A second issue of concern is that, in an effort to get agreement, the Department agreed to take on an independent engineer with expertise in landfill to try to establish how much surface level material was left to be moved by the contractors.  I have an e-mail from that engineer which states, in part:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_688">Today is our fifth day on site and the process of quantifying the quantities of surface waste left for disposal for the Department of the Environment is progressing well.  However, we feel obliged to make an interim report regarding the findings so far.  It is of considerable concern to us that there are significant levels of hydrocarbon-contaminated mud under the constant influence of tidal movements and percolating rainwater which we would deem necessitating emergency treatment immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">That engineer was let go the following week by the Department.  What does the Minister say to that?  Why did this occur?  What has happened regarding the concerns expressed by that engineer?</p>
          <p eId="para_690">Third, is it appropriate that the Department's representative at the former Irish Ispat site, in respect of managing the environmental monitoring and clean up of the site, used to be Ispat's quality and environmental manager?  That is a genuine question.  It was the same situation for Irish Steel.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">Is it appropriate to appoint, again, White Young Green to do a job it already did in 2005?  That company is the only one that says there is not a serious public health threat at Haulbowline while three or four other reports state that there is such a threat.</p>

          <from>Deputy David Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_692">Deputy Coveney is right to say that this is a public health issue.  We have had much correspondence from people in the Cobh area who are concerned about public health.  Is the Minister aware of the National Cancer Registry report which indicates that when rates for the Cobh urban area were compared to Ireland at large, the incidence of cancer in Cobh was 44% higher than what might have been expected?</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Will the Minister organise a baseline independent health study in Cobh and the Cork Harbour area?  Does he agree that this is very serious and worrying?  The study I mentioned was carried out for the years 1994 to 2005.</p>

A member of the service rang me yesterday to tell me that when the recent work started, the high levels of dust on the base were frightening in the mornings when they entered it.  In his response the Minister said he was worried about a potential threat to the environment.  Could he quantify that threat?  Why was it okay to move the surface slag from the site and not okay to move the underlying material, which amounts to 500,000 tonnes?  Is the cost of the work a factor in the Minister's decision to cease work and cap the site?  Will he state whether there is an aquifer under the island or in the area that might be at risk?  I understand the site is in a limestone area.  Is there leachate seeping from the site into ground water or sea water and is there a danger of dust blowing into Cobh, east Cork and the surrounding area?</p>

          <p eId="para_699">There is considerable concern and people need to have the facts in order to answer the questions for themselves.  That would be an important first step for us.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">Last week the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Máire Hoctor, referred to a comprehensive site survey carried out by White Young Green.  Its content seems to be quite extensive.  I cannot understand why the company is on site again to look for chromium 6.  People are asking whether this did not arise originally and whether the first site survey was not fully comprehensive.  Given the recent concerns, what was done in 2005?  The Minister stated the new survey is in response to the work being carried out by the subcontractor but the type of waste would not have changed because, as he said, it had been accumulating for over 60 years under Irish Ispat, which was formerly known as Irish Steel.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The issues associated with the subcontractor comprise a side issue to many people; the main issue comprises the waste deposited on the site and the need for the Minister to provide information and reassure people he is fully committed to dealing with it.  I accept he is committed personally but we need the Government as a whole to be committed.  There ought to be enough funding made available in the budget to carry out the required clean-up on the site.  I understand the tide is washing through boreholes and that the run-off and leachate from the site are being washed into the harbour.  Capping the site seems fruitless if the tidal elements affect the boreholes.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">What kind of survey was carried out in 2005 such that it did not indicate the levels of waste that have now been made known to the public?  If we had the results of the survey, perhaps we could answer that question.  The Minister stated another site survey is being carried out at present.  This will result in further questions and I call on the Minister to ask an independent body to examine the results.  This will enable people to formulate answers to worrying questions.  The Minister stated in the media last week that he is happy there is no threat to public health in the harbour area.  We need the relevant information to be satisfied on that question.</p>

          <p eId="para_703">This is a very serious issue and I know the Minister is treating it seriously.  When was he first briefed on it and when was its seriousness first brought to his attention?  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has been involved with this matter since 2005.  It arises from a court case that was struck down in respect of a licence by the Environmental Protection Agency in 2002.  The agency, the Minister and Cork County Council have reports and they should be made available to all Members of the House.  It was disrespectful to Members of the House that information was given to residents yesterday evening, including a person who has no democratic mandate, and not given to all Members of the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_714">This is certainly a public health issue and is possibly the most significant one that has arisen in the State in a long time, if not ever.  When the story broke last week, it presented an opportunity for the Minister to show some leadership.  Instead of showing leadership, he engaged in a blame game and blamed the local newspaper that broke the story.  He blamed the contractor and also political parties.  There were two specific responses.  The newspaper that broke the story, the <i>Irish Examiner</i>, summed up the Minister’s response in its editorial last Friday when it stated “His was an amateur, half-cocked attempt to undermine the messenger, and amount to no more than a momentary diversion in a scandal that has run unchecked for nearly a decade”.  As Deputy Stanton indicated this morning, there are genuine concerns in the area and the residents are rightly concerned.  That no action has been taken on the many reports on this matter is of concern.  Verbal assurance on the part of a Minister is not enough because the people living in the area in question know the worth of verbal assurances.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">Last Thursday, given that the Minister was in Cork and attending to Green Party business, among other matters, he should have got into his ministerial car and travelled to the site, phoned the county manager, met the chief executive officer of the Environmental Protection Agency and begun to work on an action plan.  He should not enter the House a week later and state that steps are beginning to be taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">We are still at a loss regarding the Minister's communication with the county manger or the Environmental Protection Agency.  Are all the reports of all the agencies on the Minister's table or are there others he has not seen and which are not available to the public?</p>
          <p eId="para_717">I welcome the fact that the Minister met residents last night but his duty of care is far greater than that which would have him meet a residents' association.  First, he is accountable to this House.  Last week, the town council in Cobh and the county council requested a meeting with him but he has not yet agreed on a date to meet.  Further matters arise with regard to accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">What plan has the Minister to offer assurance to the local community?  Assessment reports have been carried out and further ones have been indicated this morning.  What is the correlation between what we are now finding out and what was known originally?  How accurate were the assessment reports produced in 2004?</p>
          <p eId="para_719">Last year, before the general election, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, was running around telling people he was to build a hotel and jetty on the site.  In light of the risk assessment reports, can he state what his plan was based upon?  Is the plan still active?  Last week the Minister for Environment, Heritage and Local Government stated he had difficulty obtaining information from various agencies and Departments.  This is an utter nonsense in that he, as Minister, should experience no blockage in obtaining any such information.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">Some 80,000 tonnes of material were removed from the site in 2004 and 500,000 tonnes remain to be removed.  If one wanted to visualise the remainder of the waste material, one should visualise a tonne, multiply it by 100,000 and then by five.  This indicates the extent of the difficulty.  The residents need clear indications as to what will happen.  I understand some of the material removed from the site was used as underlay in roadworks.  Can the Minister clarify this?</p>
          <p eId="para_721">In his response today, the Minister stated that work will begin soon.  It was indicated to me this morning that the contractor is to resume work on Monday morning.  If so, given the Department's concern that the work was being carried out in a piecemeal manner, what will be done differently next week?  The contractor is on record as saying that no surface work can be done on the site because, as soon as one goes near the surface, further serious problems arise.  I wish to know what the contractor intends to do next week.  I also wish to know what timeframe is envisaged by the Minister in this regard and what costs will arise.  What price will the Minister pay?  As this issue is examined more closely, only one conclusion can be reached, namely, that the Haulbowline site must be dealt with in its totality.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">While I believe two air monitors are operating at Haulbowline, I understand there may have been a third, which has been removed.  The Minister should clarify what are the specifications of such air monitors.  Given that staff returned to work last Friday morning without any assurances as to their personal safety, are the monitors modified or do their specifications enable them to detect the materials disclosed in the <i>Irish Examiner</i> last week?  In respect of the workers’ day-to-day safety, such monitors provide their only assurances, by indicating they are working in a safe environment.</p>

          <p eId="para_723">Interest in this debate is wider than those who have spoken.  An entire harbour community is interested and I was pleased the Minister met the residents last night.  However, this issue goes beyond them.  Town commissioners in Monkstown, Passage West and Cobh, as well as Cork county and city councillors, ultimately will be obliged to oversee and be responsible for what happens on this site.  The Minister must meet such individuals as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">When the issue first came to light, the Minister started on the basis that because he was a Green Party Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, he knew best.  Clearly, this was not the case.  Certain questions must be asked and responded to.  Not one, but three reports were produced.  While there is uncertainty as to whether the report available to the Minister constitutes a fourth report, three reports were produced from 2003 onwards.  It is not as if people did not know about the issue.  Moreover, they knew of the difficulties involved and the necessity to solve the problem.  However, this does not appear to have been the attitude taken when the story was unearthed and exposed in the media.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">Chromium 6 is the most dangerous substance present on the site and one must be extremely careful about it.  My information is that the dust is most dangerous.  Therefore, one cannot unearth any part of the slag heap without covering it to ensure the dust will not be carried away on the prevailing winds.  As anyone from Cork is aware, there are prevailing winds in the harbour.  This is what must happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">The people living around the harbour must be told what action is being taken.  Moreover, they must be reassured because this is not the first issue people in Cork have dealt with in respect of dangerous chemicals.  Cork is the location for the preponderance of Ireland's chemical industry.  The people will not be fobbed off as they are able to read reports and have been doing so for years.  They know what to look for and when they are being fobbed off.  One must be extremely careful in this regard, as one cannot put people's health at risk.  It is not good enough for the Minister to lecture Members to the effect that he is the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and knows more about the environment than anyone else.  Clearly, he does not.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">People living around Cork Harbour must be reassured that what must be done at the site will be done in a safe manner to protect them, their children and those who will come after them.  Moreover, there should be no further leaks about discoveries of matters already contained in reports.  The Minister should outline the plan.  Will it involve a covered unearthing to prevent dust particles from being carried away by the prevailing winds?  I refer to the other three reports that the Minister continues to state are not available.  They are.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_730">The first point regarding the situation at Haulbowline is that the persistent claims by the Government that there is no health risk do not ring true.  This morning I was informed that excavation work was being carried out in what was believed to be the most contaminated part of the site.  Interestingly, a departmental official who was present to represent a Department which claims that there is no health risk was wearing a protective mask.  Perhaps the precautionary principle was in operation.  Apparently, the driver of the excavator was not wearing such a mask and Members may take from that what they will.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">This matter has arisen previously.  Several reports in 1995 stated the site was heavily contaminated on the basis of dust samples and indications there had been leaks into the river.  However, these reports were not acted upon and 39 workers who were allowed onto the site were not advised to wear protective masks, thus placing them in a highly dangerous position.  This was a highly irresponsible decision, given that the reports ought to have acted as a warning sign regarding the health risks to any person accessing the site and, in particular, any person working directly in the contaminated area.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">When workers and contractors on the site heard of the rumoured reports and their contents, they requested copies but were told they were confidential.  I have been informed that five reports have concluded the site is heavily contaminated.  If there are such reports on health and safety issues, there is a legal and moral obligation to make them available.  To do otherwise is to place those working in such circumstances in danger without their knowledge.  Arising from their concerns, the aforementioned 39 workers have sought medical advice.  However, the doctors who have examined them are hampered by not knowing what tests to carry out because no one is certain exactly what contaminating substances are involved, apart from the confirmation that chromium 6 is one of them.  However, such information is contained in the reports and making them available constitutes a clear matter of public interest, not least to the 39 workers concerned, as well as others who may have come into contact with those substances.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">This is the issue at stake.  While it may be a source of embarrassment for several Ministers and former Ministers as far back as 1995, that is only a minor issue.   The Minister should put aside the desire to score points or to hide his blushes and publish the reports, which is what the people want.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_735">In fairness to the Minister, he has at least shown a degree of openness in his dealings with local residents.  I understand that yesterday he made available to them a number of reports, including a previously confidential report from 2005 commissioned by Cork County Council which found the carcinogen, chromium 6, to be above acceptable levels.  This certainly would explain the above average rate of cancer in the general area.  I understand he also has promised to make available to them all previous reports, as well as a new report by independent consultants.  If that is the case, it is to be welcomed but as I stated previously, he should go further and publish them.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">Apart from the specific case under discussion, once again Members are dealing with a situation in which the public interest has been sacrificed to political expediency.  This has been the case in respect of the Sellafield plant, an issue with which I have been involved for many years and in which we have had to contend with persistent denials, cover-ups and sleight of hand designed to obscure the facts.  The bottom line in many instances appears to be that State bureaucrats and their political masters — perhaps that ought to be the other way round — will go to inordinate lengths to prevent the emergence of any facts that might embarrass them or prove that they have been in error, even in instances where they are left carrying the can for events that happened before they had responsibility for them.  Perhaps an inherited corporate code of <i>omerta</i> is in operation.  On the other hand, members of parties who were once in the position in which the Minister now finds himself, are acting as if the matter has nothing to do with them and their parties were never in government.  People affected by these issues do not care about those matters. They are not interested in who was Minister back then and who got which report and on which date.  They are solely interested in the truth about the potential risks to which they have been exposed.  We need to ensure that they get the facts.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">Just to remind the House that some things have not changed, I wish to revert briefly to the proposed destruction of a consignment of hydrogen cyanide at the Kilbride military camp in County Wicklow.  Had it not been for public protests and information being made available to public representatives and to locals who were being deliberately kept in the dark about it, this might very well have become yet another Haulbowline.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">The common factor in all of this is the Defence Forces personnel.  Members of the Naval Service were, and still are, at risk in Haulbowline, yet seemingly it was thought acceptable to destroy a highly dangerous substance in an area under the control of the military.  The added advantage was that anything done in such a location would be less likely to become public knowledge, due to the restrictions placed on members of the Defence Forces regarding what takes place in military installations.  Despite this, local people know what was supposed to have taken place and I call on the Minister, in the spirit of the new openness which he displayed towards the Cork people he met last evening, to make a statement on exactly what is proposed to take place in Wicklow and to prevent it going ahead if it presents a risk to either the local population or to people within the Kilbride camp.</p>

          <p eId="para_740">This is probably one of the greatest public health issues we have encountered during the lifetime of this Dáil.  We have reports which show that the level of mercury in the soil is 281ppm, when action should be taken when the level is 10ppm.  This causes severe neurotoxicity in people and is well known to be a major cause of neurological disease and disorder.  We do not have any statistics for the incidence of neural diseases in the Cobh area, and it would be interesting to get them.  However, we know that chromium 6 is there and is a carcinogenic.  We also know from the National Cancer Registry that there has been a 44% increase in the incidence of cancer in the Cobh area.  We are in a situation where there is a known carcinogen on site.  We have information showing there is an increased incidence of cancer in the immediate area.  One plus one equals two — this is an urgent issue the Minister needs to address.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">There have been reports in the newspapers drawing an analogy between this case and the Erin Brockovich case.  Even if the Minister does not have a moral or ethical problem with this, there is a great litigation bill coming down the tracks if we do not take action and make this as safe as possible as soon as we know about it.  Now that we know about it, we need to act on it.  We need to know what actions the Minister will take.  It is not sufficient to await another report that will take several more months, exposing people in the interim to this carcinogen.</p>

          <p eId="para_816">Deputy Morgan asked about the Naval Service personnel.  They have their own medical services.  Deputy Morgan asked that personnel be examined.  That is a matter for the Defence Forces.  I do not have any input into that whatsoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">On the points raised by Deputy Michael Ahern, of course I will make all of the reports available to all of the Deputies in the area.  My Government colleagues have expressed the concern of the residents in the areas they represent and I take on board all of those comments.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">Deputy Ahern stated that he wanted different consultants used on this occasion.  The reason that these consultants have been hired is exactly because they have done a previous study.  We discussed this issue yesterday evening with the residents, who have got their own experts.  Deputy Lynch alluded to the fact that these people have expertise and that is undoubtedly the case.  Many of them have scientific and legal expertise.  It was their belief that what there ought to be is a peer review of the existing report and, indeed, the new report.  I am happy to do that again to ensure that the methodology that is being used is correct and that it stands up to the best scientific scrutiny.  That is the way we are proceeding.  It is an open and transparent way and it is sound from an ecological and scientific point of view.</p>

          <p eId="para_820">I will be brief.  I thank the Minister for coming into the House and discussing this in an open fashion.  There are a couple of main points.  One immediate issue is the need to reassure the general public in terms of any potential health consequences.  Can the Minister, Deputy Gormley, set a deadline for the presentation of the White Young Green report at the earliest possible date?  This will allow him to give a categorical assurance to people that there is no health risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">The Minister should commit to full remediation of the site and I hope he will bring proposals to Government at the earliest opportunity.  Will the Minister make a commitment to full remediation on-site?  Finally, I welcome what I hope is a commitment that he will proceed with a baseline study of the harbour area.  This will set the parameters for any future measurements to be undertaken in terms of health affects.</p>

Up to this point they have not and I hope this can change.  We must ensure people are confident that this situation will be dealt with adequately, properly and speedily.  I asked a question, which the Minister did not answer, related to meeting various town councils and the city and county councils in Cork.  These are the groups which will determine how well this operation is carried out.  The Minister will not be there all the time, but these councils will.</p>

Will he also make that report available?  Given the history lesson the Minister gave earlier on these matters, he will be well briefed regarding the decision of the courts to strike down the EPA licence.  This prevented the EPA from carrying out enforcement proceedings in 2002.  The EPA had a licence as the company went into liquidation.  In case the Minister was under any illusion about this matter, the EPA failed in the High Court bid to secure enforcement proceedings and force remediation.</p>

I hope the report and options paper will spell out in detail the best approach.  It all depends on the proposed use of the site.  If the site is used for residential purposes, extensive remediation is necessary.  Remediation of course, brings its own difficulties.  It involves bringing up all the material and so extreme care must be taken.  There are other options.  One can remediate part of the site and cap another part.  I am sure the experts will come back with a series of options.  If it is used for parkland that is quite a different matter, one does not have to remediate to the same extent——</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_727">
          <from>Deputy Joe Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_845">Last night before the proceedings were adjourned I broadly welcomed the proposals for reforming the liquor licensing laws included in the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008.  However, the issues of public disorder and behaviour related to alcohol abuse which is the real thrust of this legislation are unlikely to be resolved solely through enacting legislation.  This can be shown by the fact that each Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has produced new Bills to curb alcohol abuse in his or her time, yet each Minister has dismally failed in his or her efforts.  Ironically the previous Government introduced later opening hours for public houses, while the current Minister is reducing the opening hours for off-licences.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">There is a considerable body of existing legislation which is not being implemented.  The first imperative should be to effect measures to ensure implementation of existing, appropriate, relevant and pertinent legislation on the Statute Book.  For example, the Intoxicating Liquor Acts 1999 and 2004 contain provisions for labelling alcoholic products sold in supermarkets, convenience stores, petrol stations and dedicated off-licences.  The relevant sections of that legislation provide for traceability of all cans and bottles sold on these premises by means of a bar code or other labelling mechanism, which immediately identifies the outlet where the alcohol was sold.  This allows for rogue off-licence outlets selling alcohol to minors to be identified quickly by the Garda and prosecuted effectively.  These sections of the legislation require ministerial order, but no order has ever been activated by any Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">The proposals in the current Bill are substantially directed at the various off-licence outlets through curtailing hours of opening, providing for structural separation of alcohol products from other products, installing closed circuit television systems and giving local gardaí and residents a greater say in objections.  These provisions are, of course, welcome.  However, there is no reference in the Bill to labelling provisions.  I call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to either activate the provisions in previous legislation which would provide for labelling and traceability of all alcoholic products sold at off-licences, or to introduce new updated provisions by way of an amendment to the current Bill, or to indicate in his response that he will accept amendments to that effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_848">I am chairman of the supply control committee of the Dublin north inner city drugs task force.  This is an initiative that started in Blanchardstown but has moved into the inner city, especially the Store Street area and it operates largely from there.  The committee aims to address the link between alcohol and drugs in public houses.  We have established on a fairly successful pilot basis a procedure to "dial to stop drug dealing" campaign.  We are using beer mats in public houses and signs are being erected in such pubs indicating they are a drug-free area.  This has been done in the Store Street area since Christmas and is proving to be quite effective.  There is anecdotal information that people are using the service to stand up to drug dealers.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">The programme's purpose is to prevent the multi-use of alcohol and drugs, as public houses in inner city and other areas have often been used as a location for the sale or consumption of drugs, with drink an added element to the combination.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">I would like the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to streamline that measure, which does not really require any legislation.  The drugs task force would be very anxious to see that introduced.  There are some good and pragmatic proposals in this Bill.  If they were added to by the traceability and labelling provisions already in legislation, which could be boosted by being updated and included in this legislation, it would be very welcome.</p>

          <p eId="para_851">I wish to share time with Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher.  Perhaps the Acting Chairman will let me know when ten minutes of the slot has expired.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">Like other Members, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill.  I commend the Minister on his prompt response to the report of the alcohol advisory group, which reported in March this year after only being set up in January.  I compliment the group on its quick work and the Minister on the speed with which he brought this legislation before the House because it is a very important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">There is not a town or village in the country today which does not have problems relating to public disorder.  I welcome that the Bill will tackle public disorder and alcohol-related harm.  Society in general is suffering, as well as people's enjoyment of their environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">The health of individuals — in many cases, under age people — is also suffering as a result of problems related to the sale of alcohol to them.  It is important action is taken to curtail drinking in public places, particularly by under age drinkers.  In every town in the country we know the various locations where under age people congregate to drink alcohol, and it is important that this Bill provides measures to tackle the problem.  We have facilitated the necessary mechanisms for gardaí to be able to act on the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">To put the issue in context, between 1996 and 2002 public order offences increased by 247% in this country.  That sets the tone and indicates very clearly to us what we already know from anecdotal evidence.  This is a serious problem along the length and breadth of Ireland.  Sadly, we have the largest number of binge drinkers in Europe among our young population.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">Traditionally, all our social events in Ireland tend to have drink as a central focus, which is disappointing.  It will take many years to change our cultural attitude to drink in this country, although this is a welcome first step.  I welcome the Bill being brought before the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">To me, one of the most important parts of the Bill is section 18, which I will focus on in the small amount of time available to me.  This deals in particular with the new powers being given to the Garda Síochána to seize bottles or containers in the possession of people who appear to be under 18, and where it is assumed by gardaí that alcohol is intended to be consumed by a person under 18 in a place other than a private dwelling.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">This is important, even regarding my own town of Castlebar.  I can identify many places where under age people are drinking.  In the past, gardaí probably felt they did not have the necessary powers to confront these individuals, seize these containers and stop the practice.  These young people eventually congregate around chip shops later in the night and this is where all the public order problems seem to happen, as much alcohol has been consumed from many of the off-licences in the town.  Drink has been obtained by these people and sometimes it is bought for them by people older than 18, which is an act that must be frowned on by society.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">In fairness to many off-licences, petrol stations and supermarkets, they have a strict policy.  Having spoken with a deputation from small supermarkets in my own locality in recent weeks, I know they have a very strict policy on the sale of alcohol to under age people.  They also have a very strict training programme.  It must be acknowledged that these shops have a very serious policy and in some shops, staff face instant dismissal if alcohol is sold to a person under 18.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">It is very clear that in businesses where the name of the operator is over the door, a reputation is valued very strongly.  These people are anxious to ensure alcohol is not sold to people under 18.  Many of these operators have asked that some form of a national identification card system be put in place to make their job a little easier.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">Another section of the Bill deals with the segregation of alcoholic products from other parts of the shop so they can be closed off.  There is also the option of selling alcohol from behind a counter.  To my mind, the most important thing we can put in place is that, at the point of sale, a person over the age of 18 should be able to prove this to the person at the till.  That would be an effective step.  I welcome that the Minister is prepared to look at a code of practice with regard to the segregation within these places of business.  If we could strengthen the position at the point of sale, it would be an effective mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_862">With regard to section 18, I welcome the new powers permitting the seizure of bottles and containers of alcohol where there is a reasonable apprehension of public disorder.  This can happen even when people are over the age of 18.  This is an important strength to give to the Garda Síochána in dealing with the idea of public order or where gardaí feel public disorder is about to take place.  It is important that aspect is there irrespective of age and it may be the most critical part of the Bill.  Public disorder is one problem society at large is crying out for us to do something about and it is important that it is tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">Sections 12 and 14 of the Bill relate to penalties.  I welcome that penalties have been strengthened.  If penalties are not severe enough to ensure compliance, sadly, it will not occur.  I welcome the minimum penalty of two days closure where it is shown that alcohol has been sold to persons under the age of 18.  This will ensure publicans and those selling alcohol will put measures in place so that sale of alcohol to minors will not happen.  It is critical this provision be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">Section 9 of the Bill relates to extended opening hours.  I have some points on this, particularly as it relates to late bars.  At the moment many late bars are applying for special exemption orders.  My understanding is these were intended to be made available through the District Court for special occasions.  In practice, many late bars in every town in the country get exemption orders every Friday, Saturday and Sunday night.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">The difficulty is there are now many people, including those from nightclubs and late bars, congregating on the street at the same time.  If the focus in the courts, when they are granting these exemption orders, was to give them only for a special occasion — the original intention — it would provide a necessary safeguard.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">I welcome the new provisions where the District Court can require that a CCTV system be installed.  This is important in terms of tackling crime, identifying those who are guilty of public disorder on our streets and in ensuring premises are fully compliant with safety standards.  It is hard to believe the measure had to be introduced in this Bill and did not exist before.  It is an important provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">My main point is that we should try to restrict the number of special exemptions given by the District Court in the first place.  This would make it easier, certainly in towns, for gardaí to monitor the level of public disorder and number of premises people leave at a late hour.  As is consistently pointed out in debates on this issue, the reason for having pubs and nightclubs close at different times is to prevent the patrons of all licensed premises converging on the streets at the same time.  The special exemption orders should be reviewed on the basis that they negate this reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">On the sale of alcohol, I welcome the provision to require wine off-licences to obtain a certificate from the District Court because it is a transparent mechanism.  I welcome, in particular, the provision that in granting new off-licences consideration will be given to the needs of the neighbourhood in question and the adequacy of the existing number of off-licences in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_869">I am aware of a small supermarket in my town which was doing good business in the sale of groceries and had no plans to enter the off-licence trade.  However, as every small grocer now has an off-licence and people are no longer prepared to stop at a grocery and an off-licence, the owner was compelled to obtain an off-licence to continue the core grocery business.  The proliferation of off-licences and small supermarkets selling alcohol is creating a major problem in terms of the visibility of alcohol and its accessibility to young people.  This is a disappointing development but I am not sure what action can be taken to roll it back.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">While I welcome the code of practice, I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to introducing a identification card to try to improve the regulation of off-licences.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_729">
          <from>Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_871">I welcome the opportunity to participate in this important debate.  For some of the past 11 months I had responsibility for health promotion, during which time I took a special interest in the marketing of alcohol, as well as the issues of communications and sponsorship.  I am pleased progress was made with the industry during this period, culminating in an agreement between the Department of Health and Children and the sector to strengthen the code of practice.  Compliance with the current code of practice stands at almost 100%, which leads me to believe that we will have full compliance with the stronger code of practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_872">All Members are concerned about the impact of alcohol advertising on young people.  I welcome the decision of the industry to buy into the strengthened code and pay tribute to it and the departmental officials with whom I worked for securing an agreement through a partnership approach.  While it was suggested this matter should be addressed by way of legislation, I believed the objective could be achieved more expeditiously by strengthening codes of conduct because legislative measures would have taken a considerable period to implement.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">I refer to this process because it is intertwined with the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008.  This legislation is motivated by the concern of the alcohol advisory group that the display and sale of alcohol side by side with ordinary foods serve to create the false impression that alcohol is an ordinary retail product.  The group's view was that restricting the sale and display of alcohol to a separate area would be beneficial.  While this proposition is fine in theory, following meetings with representatives of the retail sector, including business people from my constituency, I concluded that implementing such a restriction would cause considerable disruption and impose considerable costs on smaller shops and supermarkets.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">I am pleased retailers have, by and large, bought into the spirit of the Bill.  Bearing in mind that the Minister shares Deputies' anxiety to enact the Bill before the summer recess, his meeting with representatives of the retail sector several weeks ago was welcome.  The meeting culminated in a proposal to introduce a code of practice.  The retail industry has shown good will on this issue and is anxious to submit a proposal to the Minister, one I hope he will be in a position to accept.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">The proposed restriction is a matter of concern for small and medium-sized businesses in the retail sector which provide services in rural areas and towns but may not prove too onerous for larger businesses.  I understand off-licences which decide to sell goods other than alcohol may not be required to comply with the requirement to separate alcoholic and non-alcoholic goods, whereas businesses with an off-licence which are engaged substantially in the sale of non-alcoholic goods would be required to comply with the provision.  I accept, however, that the problem would only arise if the legislation were enacted as presented.  This is no longer the case, thanks to the pragmatic approach taken by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">The vast majority of retailers do not want to make a profit from young people and realise, as Deputies do, that young people are vulnerable and habits formed at an early age persist throughout life.  Retailers do not want to be party to this problem and are concerned about the name over the door of their businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">The Minister addressed the issues I raise in his Second Stage contribution, which is welcome.  Nevertheless, I am concerned about the necessity of the decision to block up the courts with 5,000 to 6,000 wine licence applications.  It remains to be seen if this potential problem materialises and it is the Minister's call as to whether applications should continue to be made to the Revenue Commissioners.  We should consider the impact of requiring retailers of wine to go to court every year to secure a wine licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">Secondary purchasing is a major problem which cannot be dealt with by the retail sector.  The authorities must clamp down on the practice which is difficult to detect.  Most of those who buy drink in shops and take it outside to minors are responsible people.  A major change in culture is required.  We must call on people to drink in greater moderation because it is in the best interests of everyone, especially young people.  Drinking at an early age has an impact later in life.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">While the early opening of licensed premises was important in rural and coastal areas a long time ago, this is no longer the case.  I would not have a difficulty with a ministerial decision to close early houses.  I accept, however, that this is an issue in cities.  I am confident the Minister will do what he believes is right.</p>
          <p eId="para_880">Mar focal scoir, tá áthas orm go bhfuair mé deis páirt a ghlacadh sa dhíospóireacht seo ar feadh cúpla nóiméad.  Fágfaidh mé mar sin é.</p>

        <b>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Defence</b>
         if he will make a statement on the recently published second report of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces. 
        [25784/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" as="#Minister_for_Defence" eId="spk_730">
            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_882">I welcome the second annual report of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, which covers the period January to December 2007.  This is a further milestone in the development of the office, which became operational on 1 December 2005 and which represents a significant development in the modernisation of the military redress of wrongs process.  The Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 provides that the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is independent in the performance of her duties and it is not considered appropriate for the Minister to report on her behalf or to give details in respect of her reports on individual cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">The ombudsman reported an increase in the number of referrals to her office from 26 in 2006 to 76 in 2007.  She also reported that 15 of the 2007 referrals were carried over from 2006 and that eight were from former members of the Defence Forces.  I acknowledge that the increase in the number of referrals arises from an greater awareness of the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, as well as rising confidence among members of the Defence Forces.  I welcome this development.</p>
            <p eId="para_884">The input of the ombudsman has assisted the Defence Forces in the revision of a number of HR procedures, including the selection processes for career courses and overseas service.  The recommendations in the ombudsman's reports to me have also informed the revision of selection processes for promotion, a new version of which is currently being progressed with the representative associations through the conciliation and arbitration scheme.  In this regard, I note the ombudsman's recognition of the continued co-operation that she has received from the Defence Forces and my Department.  I remain committed to the successful implementation of the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">In her report, the ombudsman highlighted the challenge of identifying appropriate and proportionate remedies while retaining due regard to the practicalities of the military environment.  I fully support her proposal to engage in a constructive dialogue with a view to identifying appropriate solutions.  With this in mind, my officials wrote to the ombudsman earlier this month indicating my Department's desire to engage with her in this task.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">The ombudsman reported 30 referrals in respect of non-selection for promotion, 13 in respect of non-selection for career courses or overseas service, 29 in respect of other issues and four in respect of complaints of bullying and harassment.  With regard to the latter category, I understand from the ombudsman that one of these was withdrawn, the second did not fall within her jurisdiction, the complaint was not upheld by her in respect of the third and the fourth is being processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">The report of the ombudsman refers to resources and office accommodation.  I am advised that the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces recently achieved a steady staff level of four, consisting of the ombudsman, an investigating officer, an office manager and clerical support.  The Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is currently located in Hatch Street, Dublin 2.  I have supported the request from the ombudsman to the Office for Public Works in respect of the provision of alternative accommodation.  My commitment to the success of the office of the ombudsman extends to ensuring that, in keeping with overall public service standards and requirements, appropriate staff levels and other resources will be available to it.  My Department is in discussions with the ombudsman on these issues.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_731">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_888">At the launch of her report, the ombudsman was quite scathing with regard to staffing, the level of which is simply not adequate to allow her to carry out her functions properly.  The ombudsman was <i>in situ</i> for nine months before a second member of staff arrived.  It appears there is no interest in supporting the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces, which was established by the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_889">The ombudsman is operating in what is described as an "environmentally sick building", which has extremely poor ventilation and an inadequate heating system.  The position of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is an innovative one.  Ireland is ahead of other countries in establishing such a position.  I understand the UK authorities are considering the steps that have been taken here in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">The ombudsman's caseload has increased by 192%.  At the launch of her report, she apologised for the delay in issuing decisions in respect of cases.  Despite what the Minister said earlier, there is surely an argument in favour of staffing her office properly and moving it to adequate accommodation.  If additional staff and accommodation at a new location are provided, the ombudsman will be in a position to carry out the brief that was given to her by the House — not the Minister or his Department — and deal efficiently with the complaints received by her office.  I am sure the Minister agrees that, in the interests of natural justice, complaints made to the ombudsman should be heard sooner rather than later and dealt with in an adequate manner.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_732" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_891">I agree with Deputy Deenihan's final point.  It is extremely important that people can make complaints to the ombudsman.  That is why we introduced legislation to establish her office in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">I am informed by my officials that there has been a high turnover of staff in the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  I do not know the reason for this.  The difficulty is that there is no similar office with which we could compare and contrast the workings of the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  The Ombudsman for Children has 15 staff at her disposal.  However, she received 750 complaints last year as opposed to the 76 received by the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  The Ombudsman for Children also has a research and advocacy function on behalf of children.  We are involved in ongoing discussions with the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces in respect of staffing.</p>
            <p eId="para_893">I take Deputy Deenihan's point regarding the building in which the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is housed.  The ombudsman made a request to the OPW to be provided with more suitable accommodation and we have given her our support in this regard.  We contacted the OPW on a number of occasions in respect of this matter.  In view of the Deputy's question, I will renew my representations to the OPW.</p>

          <speech by="#JimmyDeenihan" eId="spk_733">
            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_894">Will the Minister give a firm commitment to the effect that the issue of staffing resources will be addressed?  I understand that the ombudsman made a submission in respect of this matter in June 2007 but that no action was taken.  Will the Minister ensure that the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces will be housed in proper accommodation as soon as possible?</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_734" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_895">I will give two commitments.  First, we are engaged in discussions with the ombudsman in respect of staffing and these will continue in a constructive manner.  Second, and as regards accommodation, I am not responsible for the activities of the OPW.  We already made a number of representations to it but we will renew these.</p>

        <b>Deputy Jack Wall</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Defence</b>
         the role played to date by the Defence Forces contingent serving with EUFOR in Chad; the main difficulties being encountered to date; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_735" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_897">Ireland has deployed 411 personnel to the UN-mandated European Union military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic.  Some 371 personnel are deployed with the 97th infantry battalion at Goz Beida in the south east of Chad and 22 are deployed at the force headquarters in Chad.  In addition, 18 personnel, including the operation commander, Lieutenant General Pat Nash, are deployed in the operational headquarters in Paris.  Some 60 members of the Dutch Armed Forces, comprising an armoured scout platoon, have deployed with the Irish Battalion at its headquarters at Camp Ciara, Goz Beida.</p>
            <p eId="para_898">The EU force, as defined in UN Security Council Resolution 1778 of 2007, is authorised to support the UN by contributing to protecting civilians in danger, particularly refugees and displaced persons.  The mission is also mandated to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and the free movement of humanitarian personnel by helping to improve security in the area of operations.  The mission is also mandated to contribute to protecting United Nations personnel, facilities, installations and equipment and ensure the security and freedom of movement of its staff and associated personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_899">Initial operational capability for the EUFOR mission was reached on 15 March 2008.  This marked the start date for the 12-month duration of the operation as set out in UN Security Council Resolution 1778 of 2007.  Full operational capability is expected to be reached by end of this month.  When fully deployed, the EU force will comprise up to 3,700 personnel.  As of mid-June, a total of 3,048 personnel have deployed  to the mission area.  EUFOR troops already deployed have been warmly welcomed by the local population and authorities.  This is due in part to the information campaign undertaken by EUFOR throughout its area of operations and the professional manner in which troops from all member states are acquitting themselves on this mission.</p>
            <p eId="para_900">Personnel of the Irish-led multinational battalion currently conduct patrols in and around Goz Beida, the Djabal refugee camp and sites for internally displaced persons, IDPs, within its area of responsibility.  The Irish battalion's area of responsibility, which encompasses 76,000 sq km, equates to an area the size of Munster, Connacht and Leinster together.  The battalion has continued to liaise with local contractors, authorities and NGOs.  Such liaising had been established by personnel of the Army Ranger Wing during their recent deployment to Chad.</p>
            <p eId="para_901">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_902">Almost 450,000 refugees and internally displaced people who fled the violent and horrific conflict in Darfur are living in refugee camps along the border between Chad and Sudan.  Irish troops are responsible for protecting and securing the area around these camps to ensure that the refugees can live free from fear of attack and that humanitarian aid can be safely distributed to them.</p>
            <p eId="para_903">The theatre of operations for the Chad deployment poses serious logistical challenges due to the nature of the operation and the mission area and environment.  However, the primary difficulties encountered to date by the Irish contingent are mostly associated with the weather, that is, extreme heat and the imminent arrival of the wet season, which will reduce mobility in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_904">The days prior to my recent visit to Chad had been particularly tense in the region, when EUFOR Irish troops, deployed to protect Djabal's IDP-refugee camps 4 km north west of Goz Beida, received incoming fire from an unknown group.  Irish personnel returned warning fire.  There were no casualties.  On 14 June 2008, some 234 members of various NGOs were evacuated to Camp Ciara.  They were given food, water and bedding in camp.  Included in this figure are the UNHCR personnel who were evacuated at their own request by the Dutch contingent which is deployed with the Irish 97th infantry battalion.  They were also brought to Camp Ciara where they were accommodated until it was safe for them to return to their own compound.  The situation in the Irish battalion's area of responsibility is currently calm.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jack Wall</from>
            <p eId="para_905">I thank the Minister for his detailed reply.  In regard to what were seen as disappointing remarks by UN officials on Irish participation, the media have reported that the Minister and the Chief of Staff, Lt. General Earley, sought to have the matter rectified.  Can the Minister confirm that the matter has been put to bed and that harmony has been restored?</p>
            <p eId="para_906">Concerns have been expressed about air protection for Defence Forces members in the area.  Has France provided the necessary protection or are the newspaper reports that two helicopters have been hired correct?</p>
            <p eId="para_907">Will the deadline for the mission be extended beyond March 2009?  There have been indications that the Minister may decide to extend the mission in order to ensure continuity and further involvement by UN troops.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_737" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_908">In regard to Deputy Wall's first question, comments were made to an Irish newspaper on 18 June by a representative of the UNHCR.  Within hours of the statement, the UNHCR officially contacted the Chief of Staff and me to apologise for those remarks and to thank the Army for the work it has done on the ground.  Later that day, I met the regional representative of the UNCHR in Camp Ciara in Goz Beida, who personally apologised to me and thanked me for the Army's efforts in regard to the evacuation of UNHCR staff.  During the previous day, I met the special representative of the UN Secretary General, who expressed similar sentiments.  I regard the incident as closed and we will work together with UNHCR staff to fulfil our mandate to the best of our abilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_909">I will respond in detail to Deputy Wall's question on air assets later in the context of parliamentary questions which specifically raise the matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_910">I want to clarify the issue of the deadline.  I read a newspaper report which claimed the Government was getting worried because I emphasised that the deadline is 15 March 2009.  I was asked a straight question regarding the length of time decided on by the Cabinet for the deployment of troops to Chad.  We decided to deploy them for 12 months, from 15 March 2008 to 15 March 2009.  I do not know how anybody could have interpreted that to mean that I was worried.  A mid-term review will be conducted next month and it is intended that a traditional UN blue helmet mission will be ready to replace the current EUFOR mission in Chad before 15 March 2009, so there will be no hiatus.  If that is successful, I do not doubt that we will be approached to contribute to the UN mission but if the ambitious deadline is not met, the present operation will without doubt be continued in some shape or form and, again, we will be asked to contribute.  That decision will be taken by the Government.  I will study the military operation, consult with the Army and travel to Chad to review the situation on the ground before bringing my recommendations to the Government.  Giving a straight answer to a straight question should not imply that I am in any way worried or that I mean something other than the plain words uttered in the English language.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_738">
            <from>Deputy Jack Wall</from>
            <p eId="para_911">Defence Forces personnel who live in my constituency, of whom there are many, appreciate the Minister's visit to Chad and the media coverage it received.  It is important that we have regard for the loved ones of personnel serving in the region.</p>
            <p eId="para_912">In regard to the extension, there have been reports in the media that the UN is declining to meet the financial implication of the mission to Chad.  Extending the deployment will obviously entail further costs.  Will negotiations be entered into with the UN if that happens?  The total mission cost is projected to be €77 million, which will put pressure on the Department of Defence in the current economic downturn.  How will that be addressed?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_739" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_913">The cost will be €57 million, a large part of which covers the transportation of equipment to the region.  Normally, contributing countries to UN-led missions are reimbursed for most of the costs they incur.  If a mission is organised by the European Union or the African Union at the behest of the UN, each country carries its own costs.  I do not know whether a hybrid arrangement can be reached if the UN is unable to step up to the mark but that is a matter for negotiation.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_915">I visited Chad from 16 to 18 June 2008 to see at first hand the work of Defence Forces personnel serving with EUFOR.  I was accompanied on my visit by the Secretary General of my Department, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, Lt. General Dermot Earley, and Kyle O'Sullivan, Ireland's ambassador to Nigeria, accredited to Chad.  On arrival in N'Djamena, I met with Chad's Secretary of State for National Defence, General Hassan Saleh Al-Djinedi and, afterwards, with Mr. Victor Da Silva Angelo, the special representative of the UN Secretary General, who is head of the UN mission in Chad, MINURCAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_916">In my meeting with General Hassan Saleh Al-Djinedi we discussed the role of EUFOR.  I outlined the mandate and the neutral and impartial nature of the force.  I specifically pointed out Ireland's neutral status and that our key concern and the reason for Ireland's participation was to create a safe and secure environment for refugees, internally displaced persons, IDPs, and the distribution of humanitarian aid.  We also discussed the difficult security situation on the ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_917">In my meeting with Mr. Victor Da Silva Angelo, I discussed the security situation in the camps and the ongoing work on the deployment of police and gendarmerie units.  The special representative pointed to the difficulties involved in progressing the return of IDPs to their homes because of the fraught security situation on the ground and the lack of support available to returning IDPs.  He noted that the difficult security situation is also impacting on humanitarian workers and their capacity to service the camps and advised me that the first contingent of police and gendarmerie commanders had just graduated from the UN course and that he expected to see significant progress on policing by the end of the rainy season.  In referring to events over the previous few days, the special representative referred to the important role the Defence Forces had played in safely evacuating and providing shelter for the humanitarian workers in Goz Beida.</p>
            <p eId="para_918">I also met with the deputy force commander, Colonel Derry Fitzgerald and other senior Irish officers based in EUFOR force headquarters, who briefed me on the security situation on the ground.</p>
            <p eId="para_919">Additional information not provided on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_920">On 17 June 2008, I visited Camp Ciara, which is the headquarters of the Irish-led multinational battalion.  The standard of the camp and the facilities in it are very impressive, particularly when one considers the distances and logistics involved in transporting the equipment and constructing the camp.  Great credit is due to the advance party for the magnificent effort it has put into preparing the ground for the main contingent.  After a series of briefings and lunch with the troops, I addressed them and congratulated them on the tremendous job they are doing under extremely difficult conditions and terrain.  I conveyed to them the best wishes of the Government and the Irish people in the work they are undertaking.</p>
            <p eId="para_921">The Irish personnel are already making a significant difference on the ground and are enhancing Ireland's international reputation as neutral, impartial and professional peacekeepers.  I was very impressed by the motivation being shown by our troops in the performance of their duties in difficult circumstances, their energy and the good atmosphere in the camp generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_922">The days prior to my recent visit had been particularly tense in the region.  EUFOR Irish troops, which were deployed to protect Djabal IDPs and refugee camps north west of Goz Beida, received incoming fire from an unknown group.  Irish personnel returned warning fire.  There were no casualties.  The Defence Forces personnel, along with their Dutch counterparts, were also involved in the evacuation of humanitarian workers, NGOs and staff of the UNHCR.   A total of 234 personnel were brought to Camp Ciara where they were accommodated until it was safe for them to return to their own compounds.</p>
            <p eId="para_923">While at the camp, I met representatives from the international organisations and Irish personnel from Concern.  The local UNHCR representative in Goz Beida, Mr. Jose Fischel de Andrade, thanked me for the action which the Defence Forces had taken in evacuating humanitarian personnel, including UNHCR staff, and in accommodating them in the camp.  Unfortunately, I had to cancel a scheduled visit to the UNHCR refugee camp and the IDP site due to the prevailing security situation.  However, I did meet with some of them near the camp before departing.  I am pleased to report that the situation in the Irish-led multinational battalion's area of responsibility is currently calm.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_924">I thank the Minister for responding to my calls for helicopter support for the force in Goz Beida.  I understand two helicopters are now in place.  The mission has been successful to date and we should recognise the work of the Minister, his Department and Lt. General Pat Nash in regard to arranging the logistics.  Transporting the equipment to Chad was a major task and it is important to acknowledge it was carried out efficiently.  To date, things have gone well.</p>
            <p eId="para_925">I have one specific question.  Two unmanned air vehicles, spy drones, owned by the Army were lost in Chad.  Was this due to technicalities or as a result of hostile fire?  Also, can the Minister tell us of the cost of each unit?  It is important this issue is clarified.</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_742" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_926">Two helicopters, which have not yet been allocated, will be provided to the Goz Beida area.  I appreciate Deputy Deenihan's remarks in that regard.  Also, I appreciate his remarks in regard to what has been done to date.  I will pass on his comments to the Army.</p>
            <p eId="para_927">I take this opportunity to inform the House that I visited the camp and was very impressed, taking into account the distances and logistics involved, with what has been done in a very short time.  I would also like to inform the House that the Irish troops and their EUFOR colleagues are making an enormous difference on the ground.  The rate of attacks by bandits on defenceless people and aid workers and so on has reduced by approximately 95%, which is a significant contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_928">On the specific question raised by Deputy Deenihan, as I understand it the vehicles cost approximately €70,000 each.  The vehicles are covered by warranty.  Given the first vehicle was never found we are not in a strong position to argue about what happened.  However, I understand the second vehicle malfunctioned and discussions in that regard are ongoing with the supplier.</p>

          </question>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_745" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_932">In June 2007, I was asked by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, if the Defence Forces would provide explosives for use in the disposal of a number of hydrogen cyanide cylinders in the possession of a private company and for a site on which they could be disposed of safely.</p>
            <p eId="para_933">The disposal of commercial hazardous waste is not a matter for the Department of Defence or the Defence Forces.  The involvement of the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces in this particular matter is solely in response to a specific request for assistance from the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  That assistance is conditional on compliance with all planning, environmental and public health and safety legislation.  A full legal indemnity in favour of my Department has also been sought from South Dublin County Council.  The question of payment has not been raised by my Department as its role arises in response to a request from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  Any recoupment of costs in this instance is a matter for South Dublin County Council.</p>
            <p eId="para_934">Officials from my Department and representatives from the Defence Forces have participated in discussions on this matter together with representatives of a number of State authorities and agencies including South Dublin County Council, the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Wicklow County Council, the Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive, and the Health and Safety Authority.  All these bodies are working together to develop a plan to remove and dispose of the material in a safe and responsible manner.  South Dublin County Council, as the relevant local authority in this matter, has lead responsibility.</p>
            <p eId="para_935">Local authorities have substantial powers under the Waste Management Act 1996, as amended, to enable them to tackle problems associated with the disposal of waste.  Under section 55 of the Act, a local authority has the power to order as it sees fit measures to be taken in the disposal of waste.  Section 56 also empowers local authorities directly to take appropriate actions to prevent or limit environmental pollution caused by waste.</p>
            <p eId="para_936">South Dublin County Council proposes to use its statutory powers under section 56 of the Act to arrange for the safe disposal of the cylinders.  As the lead agency, South Dublin County Council is responsible for the development and implementation of the disposal plan together with the public information and awareness process.  In this regard, a fully risk assessed plan has been developed and is being independently risk assessed for South Dublin County Council.</p>

            <from>Deputy Liz McManus</from>
            <p eId="para_937">I thank the Minister for his response.  The plan to move seven cylinders of hydrogen cyanide from a safe place in Dublin to a remote Army camp in County Wicklow has been the source of much local concern and criticism.  Is the Minister aware, for example, that his colleague, Deputy Joe Behan, has called for the Taoiseach to transfer the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, out of his portfolio given the approach he has taken to this particular plan?</p>
            <p eId="para_938">Perhaps the Minister will advise me as to how widespread is this loss of confidence in the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as a result of what is essentially a debacle.  There has been no public consultation on the matter, the only public understanding of which came about as a result of a leak to the media.</p>
            <p eId="para_939">As I understand it, the Department identified four sites from which one was chosen.  Perhaps the Minister will inform the House the location of the other three sites and outline why this particular one was chosen.  Why was the burn-off and explosion which was due to take place on 23 June cancelled?  Was this related to the sabotage of the Army camp in question?</p>
            <p eId="para_940">In an effort to re-assure people, will the risk assessment be published?  What security checks have been carried out on the British company that will undertake this work?</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_941">While I can understand the logic of the questions raised by Deputy McManus — I know she is representing her constituency and wants to get answers for her constituents — I must respectfully suggest that many of them would be better addressed to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and South Dublin County Council.  The Department of Defence involvement in this matter relates only to the provision of a site.  However, I will try to answer those of which I have some knowledge.</p>
            <p eId="para_942">As regards the Deputy's comment in respect of the removal of the waste from a safe to a remote location, South Dublin County Council has decided the original location of the cylinders was not safe and that an uncontrolled escape of the hydrogen gas from there could have lethal consequences.  In this regard, it decided to exercise its powers under the Waste Management Act 1996 to ensure this material is taken to what it believes is a safe site and destroyed by an agreed and safe process.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">As regards what any of my colleagues did or did not say about the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, I must confess I did not hear any comments in that regard.  I have every confidence in the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_945">Deputy McManus correctly stated that four sites were examined.  The site was selected on the basis that the other three sites did not meet the criteria in terms of safety.  I do not know the locations of the other sites.  However, I will obtain that information and communicate it to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_946">The Deputy is correct that the burn-off and explosion was cancelled as a result of sabotage on the Army camp.  The matter is under investigation by the Army.  Security at the camp is being reviewed.  The Deputy will appreciate I cannot say much more in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_947">Security checks of the UK company is a matter for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The Department of Defence simply seeks from that Department a guarantee that it has met its requirements in regard to safety, planning and so on.  Once we receive that assurance and are provided with an indemnity we give the go ahead for use of the site.</p>

            <p eId="para_948">Obviously, I have put these questions to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  However, my difficulty is that I have not received a response to them.  This, too, may be the reason Deputy Behan is calling for the head of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_949">On the legal indemnity, has this been provided to the Department of Defence?</p>

            <p eId="para_950">The answer is "No".  I do not have it yet, but I will have it before the actual procedure takes place.  If it had taken place last Monday as planned, I would have insisted on having that indemnity before we allowed it to go ahead on our property.</p>

        <b>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Defence</b>
         the age profile of the Defence Forces; the way the age profile compares to those of other EU armies; if he will increase the retirement ages of officers and other ranks; and if he will make a statement on the matter.  
        [25985/08]
      </p>
          </question>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_752" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_952">The age profile of the Permanent Defence Force is presented in a tabular statement which follows.  There are no plans at present to extend the retirement age of officers or other personnel in the Defence Forces.  The 2000 White Paper on Defence and the earlier Defence Force review implementation plan both identified the requirement to address the high age profile of the Defence Forces.  The plan recommended reductions to retirement ages in an effort to address the age profile and fitness of the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_953">The retirement arrangements for officers and other ranks differ.  However, the key element in military life — the need for personnel to maintain a level of fitness for combat readiness — is similar throughout the Defence Forces.  This requirement must be balanced with the need to retain experience and expertise, particularly at managerial level.  Apart from the overriding requirement of combat readiness, any increase in retirement ages would have cost implications and would affect the career path of personnel further down the ranks.  While it would permit some personnel to lengthen their careers, it would act as a disincentive for others whose career aspirations would be diminished.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">Very few officers currently retire at age 54 in the rank of captain or age 56 in the rank of commandant.  This information will be circulated to Deputies.  Officers more commonly retire from the rank of lieutenant colonel at the maximum retirement age for that rank, which is 58.  A claim to increase the mandatory retirement age to 60 years for officers serving in ranks up to and including lieutenant colonel was received from the Representative Association of Commissioned Officers under the conciliation and arbitration scheme for members of the Permanent Defence Force.  The claim has been the subject of correspondence between the Department and the representative association.  The Deputy will appreciate that as discussions under the scheme are confidential, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">In the case of enlisted personnel, persons who enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force before 1 January 1994 may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of 60 years.  However, the retirement arrangements are different for persons who enlisted on or after 1 January 1994.  Enlisted personnel in the rank of private may not automatically continue beyond 12 years' service, and enlisted personnel in the rank of corporal may not serve for more than 21 years.  Enlisted personnel in the rank of sergeant may be permitted to continue in service up to the age of 50, while those in higher ranks may continue in service up to the age of 56.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">Neither the Defence Forces nor my Department maintains comparative data on the age profiles of other armies within the EU.  It should be recognised that the profile of national armies varies considerably between countries in terms of both their make-up and their roles.  Consequently, it would not be possible to make a meaningful direct comparison of age profiles with these armies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1024">Will the Minister confirm to the House that there are currently more servicemen on pensions than in active service?  I saw a statistic to this effect in one of the national newspapers recently.  I know the Defence Forces are different, but in all other Departments in the Civil Service the ratio is three active personnel to every one retired person.  That is the general ratio across the Civil Service.  If the mandatory retirement age was 60 for personnel at officer level, this would redress the balance somewhat.  It seems 54 is quite young for a captain to retire.  Life expectancy is much higher now than when these retirement ages were set some time ago.  In addition, it is obvious that fitness levels among the Army have increased considerably.  If we in the House had to retire at 54 we would all, apart from Deputy Collins, be leaving politics at this stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_1027">It might not be any harm if Deputy Deenihan's suggestion were taken on board and we were all made to retire at 55.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">Deputy Deenihan mentioned there were more people in receipt of Army pensions than there are serving Army personnel.  I do not know whether that is the case, although the numbers are close.  I will find out for the Deputy.  Even if it was the case, however, it would not worry me unduly.  People put in their service on the basis that they will get a pension after so many years and when they retire they are entitled to their pensions.  Army pensioners tend to be healthy people and have comparatively long lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1029">People retire at a younger age in the Army.  They have to do so because they need to clear the way for younger people who have reasonable expectations of promotion but do not wish to spend their whole lives waiting to be promoted.  In addition, the Army age profile needs to be reasonably low because the role of the Army has changed considerably in recent years.  The focus is now on peace support operations abroad.  When one considers environments such as Liberia, the Lebanon, the Balkans or Chad, one realises that a certain minimum level of fitness is essential.  I remember headlines some years ago, before some of the recommendations in the first White Paper were implemented by my predecessor, former Deputy Michael Smith, in which the Irish Army was dubbed "Dad's Army".</p>

        <b>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Defence</b>
         the progress made in the civilianisation of the Defence Forces arising from the pay agreement and modernisation agenda agreed with the Defence Forces representative associations in the context of the Towards 2016 partnership agreement; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_764" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_1039">The White Paper on Defence 2000 covers the potential benefits of civilianisation and contracting out of certain military posts.  It recognises that civilianisation could "release personnel for operational duties for which they are specifically trained".  It could release them "from essentially administrative and other tasks which can more appropriately be undertaken by civilians".  It further states: "The argument for civilianisation and contracting out is that it is generally more cost effective".  The White Paper also recognises that there may be additional benefits such as enhancing continuity in certain appointments, which can be lacking due to the frequent transfer of military personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1040">Opportunities to civilianise certain posts are continuously being explored.  This has resulted in agreement that certain posts that would in the normal course of events have been filled by military personnel will be filled by civilian personnel.  Four such posts are being filled in the management information framework area and three in the military archives.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041">The review of implementation of the White Paper on Defence, which was published in April 2007, emphasised that the primary objective of civilianisation is to release soldiers for operational duties, thus increasing the operational capacity of the Defence Forces.  The review recommended further civil and military exploration of options for civilianisation.  Subsequent to the publication of the review, civilianisation was incorporated into the pay agreement and modernisation agenda agreed with the Defence Forces representative associations in the context of the Towards 2016 partnership agreement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042">My Department is currently engaged in discussions with the military authorities to identify military posts that may be suitable for contracting out and civilianisation.  This work in progress requires careful consideration of the costs and benefits arising from the civilianisation of any identified posts and assessing the feasibility of any such proposals, with particular reference to resource constraints.  When potential posts have been identified, discussions with the representative associations, as envisaged in the pay agreement and modernisation agenda, and any other relevant stakeholders will commence.</p>

            <p eId="para_1043">I am disappointed that only seven positions have been filled through the civilianisation of the Defence Forces.  Everyone will agree that the professionalism of the Irish Army today renders it unrecognisable from days gone by.  Everyone in the Army wants to play his or her part and seeks promotion, within the confines of his or her qualifications.  What is evident is a drawback and I would like to see greater progress.  There has been much progress in the civilianisation of Garda positions which has made a huge difference.  There should be greater drive with regard to the Defence Forces and its representative bodies.  Agreement was reached on providing for this in the pay agreement and modernisation agenda.  Surely it is fair to assume the delays are being caused by the Department and senior Army personnel.  The process is not moving forward at as fast a pace as one might have expected.</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_766" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_1044">Regarding the Deputy's comments on the speed at which the process is being driven, we do not want to impose it on anyone and are taking a partnership approach based on agreement.  My answer may have been misleading in that I mentioned four posts in the IT area and three in the archives area, but the catering business has also been contracted out, which has released 100 soldiers for operational duties.  I understand ten other posts are under consideration for civilianisation.  Some 830 civilians are employed in the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045">The White Paper of 2000 was based on the PricewaterhouseCoopers report of 1994.  The world and the Army have changed greatly since.  The Army has been downsized by around 25% and its focus has shifted very much towards overseas missions, in respect of which there less scope for civilianisation.  We are proceeding more slowly than originally anticipated because circumstances have changed dramatically.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jimmy Deenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_1046">There seems to be no great urgency about civilianisation but perhaps the Minister is proceeding with caution.  I have referred previously to the medical corps in this regard and I am sure the Minister agrees that there should be a role for the employment of medical doctors, given that there is such difficulty in attracting personnel to the Army medical corps.  The position does not seem to be improving, despite the incentives provided.  Does the Minister see an opportunity for attracting civilians into the Army on a permanent basis through the medical corps?  There should also be scope for civilianisation of the dental service.</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_769" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_1048">I agree with Deputy Deenihan.  As he will be aware, because the incentives did not succeed in increasing the complement of doctors and dentists to the level needed by the Army, rather than avail of the services of the private sector we will completely organise the Army medical corps.  We have brought in consultants to advise us in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1049">Regarding Deputy Wall's question, to the best of my recollection there is not a specific subhead for civilianisation, to which there is a cost attached.  For example, an Army colonel may do work that could be done as well, if not better, by a civilian.  If a civilian is employed to do this work and the colonel remains <i>in situ</i>, there is a question of extra staff, which is not a popular concept in the Department of Finance.</p>

         when he will conduct a review into the effectiveness and impact of the recent public information campaign on emergency planning; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_771" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_1052">A public information and awareness campaign on emergency planning was launched in April.  The campaign was implemented following proposals that I brought to Government in late 2006 and January this year.  My desire to implement a public information and awareness campaign on emergency planning stemmed from research that I had commissioned.  The research clearly showed that there was a desire among the public to receive information on emergency planning.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053">The central focus of the campaign was the handbook, <i>Preparing for Major Emergencies</i>, which was delivered to every household in the country.  It brings together for the first time details of the State’s emergency plans to respond to a wide range of emergencies.  It also provides practical advice on what to do in the event of an emergency.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">To coincide with the launch of the handbook a three-week advertisement campaign was undertaken to let the people know that it was on the way and encourage everyone to read it.  I propose to carry out market research later this year to review the impact of the campaign.</p>

            <from>Deputy Niall Collins</from>
            <p eId="para_1055">I am encouraged to hear the publication of the handbook was based on professional research, which showed how little the general public knew of the State's emergency plans.  It would be helpful to conduct follow-up research to determine whether awareness levels have increased.  In this context, I have some linked supplementary questions.  Is there a risk that the handbook could be out of date soon?  Is the information contained within it too basic?  Has the Minister received feedback on the success of the campaign?</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_773" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_1056">I will answer the final question first.  Anecdotal evidence suggests the campaign was a success, although we intend to conduct some relatively low cost market research later this year to determine what the impact the handbook has had.  It should not go out of date soon because the information it contains is general.  Any changes would be a matter for the lead Department and flagged on the website, on which the report is also available.  I do not believe the information is basic because we researched what members of the public wanted and gave it to them.  They wanted basic information and sought reassurance that there was an accessible system in place.  That is what we gave them.  We will carry out research later in the year to determine the success, or otherwise, of the campaign.</p>

            <p eId="para_1077">The day-to-day administration of recruitment in the Defence Forces is the responsibility of the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces.  I am informed by the military authorities that the Army equitation school has an establishment strength of 34, all ranks.  Vacancies exist for two non-commissioned officers and ten privates, or grooms.  As no serving personnel are available to fill these vacancies, arrangements are under way to fill them by means of direct recruitment.  The equitation school has conducted interviews to establish the suitability of applicants to serve as grooms.  The normal intake procedures, including medical screening, physical training tests and security clearance, are ongoing with a view to placing successful candidates on a panel for enlistment in the Defence Forces as privates, or grooms, in the Army equitation school.</p>

            <p eId="para_1078">It is obvious that this is a major problem.  It is also being experienced in the racing industry's equitation schools.  If one sees horses from any stable being brought out in the morning, one will observe that approximately 75% of those riding the horses are non-nationals.  Do the problems being encountered by the Army equitation school result from difficulties in finding Irish personnel to fill the vacant positions?  It is obvious that we have to keep the equitation centre, which has a fine international reputation in the sport of showjumping, at the top of the agenda.  The planned return of Eddie Macken to the Irish showjumping team is a major boost in that regard.  If the problem I have mentioned is being experienced, can we look at alternatives, such as the appointment of non-nationals to these positions to ensure they are filled?</p>

I wish to focus on one of the reasons we have been unable to recruit new staff for the Army equitation school.  It would be ideal if we could recruit people to work in the school from within the people we have listed at the moment.  As the work in question involves early starts and late finishes, there tends to be a high turnover of staff, unfortunately.</p>

The normal intake procedures, which include medical screening, physical training tests and security clearance, can take a great deal of time.  I will state honestly that we have had some difficulty with security clearance.  By the time successful candidates are called, they may have secured alternative employment.  Members will be interested to learn that 29 of the 40 people who were interviewed recently have been deemed suitable.  They will now have to undergo the usual series of tests, such as the physical training test and the medical screening examination, and the Garda clearance check.  If they come through those tests successfully, they will be placed on a panel.  It is obvious that the first ten people from the panel will be considered.  People will be recruited from it as vacancies occur.</p>

          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_802" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_1097">I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 81, 91, 96, 100, 104, 112, 116, 119 and 125 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1098">Ireland has deployed 411 personnel to the UN-mandated European Union military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic.  Some 371 personnel are deployed with the 97th Infantry Battalion in Goz Beida in the south east of Chad, 22 personnel are deployed in the force's headquarters in Chad and 18 personnel, including Lt. Gen. Pat Nash, are deployed in Paris.  The EU force, as defined in UN Security Council Resolution 1778, is authorised to support the UN by contributing to the protection of civilians in danger, particularly refugees and displaced persons.  The mission is mandated to facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid and the free movement of humanitarian personnel by helping to improve security in the area of operations.  The mission is also mandated to contribute to protecting UN personnel, facilities, installations and equipment and ensuring the security and freedom of movement of its staff and associated personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099">The mandate for this mission is robust and will be conducted under Chapter VII of the UN charter.  The rules of engagement for a Chapter VII mission allow for the use of all necessary force to ensure the success of the mission.  Therefore, the EU force is authorised to support the UN and take all necessary measures within its capabilities and area of operation to fulfil its functions.  I have previously outlined the size of the Irish battalion's area of responsibility.  In light of the size of the area of operations, it needs to be understood that the Defence Forces cannot be everywhere at the same time.  Ongoing patrolling, surveillance, intelligence and monitoring of the situation, including contacts with the local population and village leaders, will enable the contingent to develop a situational awareness that will help it to direct and target its operations and patrol plans.  The deployment of helicopters to Goz Beida will enable the Defence Forces to project troops forward quickly.  They can also call on air assets as required.</p>
            <p eId="para_1100">The theatre of operations for the Chad deployment poses serious logistical challenges due to the nature of the operation and the mission area and environment.  Force protection will, as always, be a key consideration.  The Defence Forces will have all the required military hardware to fulfil their role in the mission.  They have deployed a full range of force protection assets, including 17 Mowag armoured personnel carriers and four close reconnaissance vehicles and indirect fire capabilities, namely, mortars.  These will provide the necessary armoured protection, mobility, firepower and communications.  The Defence Forces have also deployed a suite of robust tactical communications systems.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101">As the House will be aware, significant investment has been made in Defence Forces equipment in recent years to provide them with the most modern equipment to undertake tasks assigned to them by the Government.  The equipment issued to the Defence Forces is in keeping with the most modern requirements from the health and safety perspective.  Ongoing investment in the Defence Forces will ensure this remains the case and will continue to be a key focus for me as Minister for Defence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1102">Regarding air support for the Irish contingent, the Defence Forces have contracted through a UK company for the supply of two Ukrainian Mi8T helicopters which arrived in the theatre on 28 June.  They are being used mainly for operational deployment, while also facilitating the rapid movement of supplies, stores and equipment from the forward logistic base in Abéché to the battalion base in Goz Beida.  The contract value will depend on the number of hours flown by the helicopters over the duration of the contract but is expected to be in the order of €3 million to end March 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1103">EUFOR also has four French attack helicopters and five French Puma helicopters in the theatre which are under the operational control of the operational commander.  The French also supply to EUFOR one reconnaissance mission per day by a Mirage, as well as having two Mirages on standby for close air support.  The Polish battalion has three Mi17 helicopters in the theatre.  In addition, EUFOR is arranging for the supply of four further utility helicopters.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">The estimated cost to the Defence Vote arising from participation in this mission for 12 months will amount to approximately €57 million.  Provision to meet the additional costs of the operation has been made in the Defence Vote for 2008.  Unlike a UN blue hat-type operation, all the costs of deployment, repatriation, rotation and sustainment, together with strategic and in-theatre tactical lift of the contingent, are met by each of the relevant troop contributing countries.  The only costs met by contributions from EU member states are generally those of establishing and operating the headquarters facilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">The EUFOR mission in Chad is mandated to run for a 12-month period, to 15 March 2009.  It is envisaged that a UN-led blue helmet mission will replace the present EUFOR mission thereafter.  The Government is committed to retaining troops in Chad up to March 2009.  No decision has been made on whether we will continue in Chad after that date.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106">The mid-point review of the operation of the EUFOR mission is due to be completed in August.  At that point discussions will commence on the successor mission and how the hand-over to the new mission can be conducted, while ensuring continuity of security and humanitarian assistance for both refugees and displaced persons.</p>

            <p eId="para_1107">A person who has a relation in Chad has informed me that it is the roughest and toughest area to which the Irish Army has been deployed.  Every assistance should be given to the troops.</p>
            <p eId="para_1108">Six extra helicopters had to be hired, two by the Irish Army and four by the United Nations.  Is this extra to what was envisaged in the first instance as being necessary?  Did the French renege on their original promise to provide helicopters?  The Minister mentioned four or five aircraft under different guises.  Were they what the French had promised originally?  If the three Polish helicopters are included, was the total number part of the first package?  There was some doubt in the initial stages and the Minister did not at first agree to Army personnel going to Chad unless there was a proper air service.  Are the six extra helicopters required because of what the Army has seen in its operations, or are they required because the French did not supply the necessary number as promised?  Were the three Polish helicopters part of the original agreement the Minister obtained from the United Nations before the Defence Forces went to Chad?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#WillieODea" eId="spk_804" as="#Minister_for_Defence">
            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_1109">I agree with the Deputy's comment about the terrain in Chad.  It is certainly the roughest I have ever seen.  It was a wonderful operation to have transported all the equipment and the camp set up so quickly in such a remote part of the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_1110">Regarding air support and logistical backup, the position is that we knew in advance what the operation commander's advice was and also that of our own military personnel.  We needed a certain amount of air support to declare initial operational capability.  We also envisaged that we would need some extra support as time passed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1111">The Deputy and the House will be aware that we had great difficulty in mustering the requisite air support.  As Members can see from the figures I gave, the French are doing quite a lot.  It was not only the French from whom we requested air support.  This is an EU-led mission and all member states were contacted.  Unfortunately, as Members can judge, assistance from most of the bigger countries was not forthcoming.  I listened to a considerable number of lectures recently during the Lisbon referendum campaign about the European Union becoming too militarised.  It took us almost 12 months to find a mere 3,700 troops with the requisite backup to save people's lives in Chad.  That certainly does not suggest a militarised European Union to me.</p>
            <p eId="para_1112">We are hiring helicopters, which is not unprecedented in the case of a peace mission, although it is unusual.  We had hoped our fellow EU countries would come up to the mark.  We knew we had to get those helicopters and had hoped it would not be necessary to hire them on the open market.  However, we were prepared to do so, if required.  Other countries did not step up to the mark, which is why we had to hire the aircraft.</p>
            <p eId="para_1113">As Deputies can see, the theatre of operations is very big.  Nevertheless, we know where the refugee camps are and where the internally displaced people are located.  When we have the four extra utility helicopters, we will have plenty of air support.</p>

            <p eId="para_1114">I agree with the Minister and Deputy Wall that air support is critical.  I understand it is the beginning of the rainy season in Chad and it will be impossible to travel overland in jeeps or 4WDs.  Therefore, air support and transport are essential if the troops are to carry out their functions properly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1115">I have three questions.  First, I understand the issue originally raised by the UN spokesperson concerned the protection of humanitarian staff working in Chad, which caused some confusion at the time.  Will the Minister clarify that, apart from protecting refugees and the camps, the Irish mission's brief is to protect humanitarian workers in the vicinity of the camps?  It is important to have this clarified.  The Minister mentioned the subject in his reply.</p>
            <p eId="para_1116">Second, a matter I raised earlier, two UAV spy drones went missing.</p>

            <p eId="para_1119">My third question concerns air transport capability.  If Defence Forces personnel are to serve on similar missions, should we not obtain our own air transport which not alone could be used on such missions but also employed in our huge humanitarian aid programme, in the process giving us more independence and certainty?  It would also save money in the long run.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_1120">The first question, on the extent of the brief of EUFOR in Chad, is important.  Its brief is to protect refugees and internally displaced persons, of whom there are approximately 450,000.  It also has a mandate to protect UN personnel, equipment and installations.  It is not just a matter of protecting the lives of people in the camps but also of ensuring the flow of aid to them is not interrupted.  This involves a specific mandate to protect NGOs and UN personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1121">On the question of whether we have replaced the drones, I understand we have.  One of them appears to have malfunctioned.  We are discussing the issue with the supplier.  As the Deputy knows, we have a number of drones.  As far as I know, we have replaced them but I will double check for the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1122">With regard to acquiring our own air transport, we must consider the question of value for money.  I take the Deputy's point that the humanitarian aid element could be included in this regard.  The matter will be considered in the context of the new White Paper on defence which we will start preparing shortly.  To date, we have not gone down this road because we have generally been advised that we would not have enough work for the equipment in question to justify the cost of acquisition and maintenance.</p>

At our last Question Time Deputy Deenihan asked about telephone calls home by Irish troops in Chad and the Minister said he would investigate the matter.  What is the position in this regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">The Minister has obviously seen conditions on the ground at first hand.  It is only right that we should congratulate everyone involved in this considerable operation.  It is the toughest ever and everyone involved must be congratulated as a consequence.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie O’Dea</from>
            <p eId="para_1125">On the problems with the terrain, one arose because Chad does not have any port, thus necessitating the shipment of much of the equipment to Douala in Cameroon, from where it had to be brought across country to Goz Beida at the other end of Chad.  A certain amount of damage was done on this long journey which I understand was in excess of 2,000 km.  The damage has, by and large, been repaired.  I inspected certain items in kitchens etc., that should have been working when I arrived but which were not because they had been damaged in transit.  This does not surprise me given the terrain.  I plan to return to Chad after the rainy season to see how those on the mission are settling in.</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">I told Deputy Deenihan that I would raise the issue of telephone calls and when in Chad, I asked a specific question about it.  I was told that, ordinarily in a four-month tour of duty, there were 45 minutes of free telephone access.  In the case of a six-month tour of duty, one has 90 free minutes.  However, there is now an alternative to the telephone, that is, the Internet.  I was assured by the Irish force commander that, while the authorities were trying to adhere as closely as possible to the 45-minute rule, they were being fairly flexible.  He told me troops had virtually unlimited access to the Internet, by way of e-mail and voicemail.  There are plenty of opportunities to communicate with home.</p>

However, I have told the commanders that if at all possible, they should accommodate the delivery of parcels.  They probably will do so.</p>

          <from>Deputy Paul Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_1134">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important Bill.  I have strong views on under-age drinking.  The Intoxicating Liquor Bill goes far but not far enough in some areas.  Under-age drinking is a considerable problem, not only in cities but also in every town, village and pub in the country.  The Government has had numerous opportunities in the past ten years to address it but the problem has worsened.  Not only do I refer to a drink culture but also to drug taking by young teenagers who persist into their late teens and early twenties.  Had the Government taken this matter by the scruff of the neck some years ago and established structures of redress, the problem would not be as bad as it is.</p>
          <p eId="para_1135">I agree with some parts of the explanatory memorandum to the Bill, but believe the Government has not gone far enough in others.  The fine of €500 for those who fail to give their proper names and addresses to the authorities is short change to many of them.  The provision does not extend far enough.</p>
          <p eId="para_1136">On the granting of liquor licences to petrol stations or off-liccences, the explanatory memorandum states, "When granting a certificate, the District Court may also impose a condition that a CCTV system be installed".  This should be mandatory.  We all want to tackle under-age drinking but the word "may" is not strong enough.  Most public houses now have CCTV cameras installed.  It should be mandatory that such cameras be installed at counters and other points of sale in off-licences, supermarkets and other locations where alcohol is for sale.  This would strengthen the law in trying to prevent under-age drinking and making alcohol freely available to those who are under age.</p>
          <p eId="para_1137">Deputy Flanagan listed statistics, one of which indicates that there was a 57% increase in the number of public order offences between 2003 and 2007.  No Deputy would disagree.  I regularly speak to my local superintendent and local gardaí in villages throughout County Wexford who tell me many public order offences are not reported because those affected believe the Garda has its hands tied, is unable to help or does not have the time or energy to solve the problem.  Moreover, one can see an increase in general thuggery, robberies or whatever, all of which comes down to anti-social behaviour.  Much anti-social behaviour in estates happens late at night when such people are filled with drink and have no fear of consequences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1138">Although I am almost certain the Minister has rowed back on the proposal to restrict the sale of alcohol to a separate part of a shop, I make the point that many such shops are stuck for space.  Were I to enter my local branch of Dunnes Stores in Enniscorthy at a time when alcohol is not for sale, that section would be railed off.  That is a good idea as people then know alcohol is not for sale because it is out of hours.  The Minister should seriously consider the possibility of obliging off-licences and supermarkets in particular that gain wine or spirit licences to rail off the shelving after closing time or when they are obliged to desist from selling alcohol.</p>
          <p eId="para_1139">I revert to my original point, which is that while the Bill has gone far, it has not gone far enough.</p>

        <!--Fix-->
        <speech by="#OlwynEnrightFG" eId="spk_817">
          <from>Deputy Olwyn Enright</from>
          <p eId="para_1140">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate.  As a country, we must face up to the difficulties caused by alcohol abuse.  The HSE's report in April highlighted some of the negative impacts of alcohol abuse both to people's health and to society.  It is important, however, that Members should consider its role in issues such as domestic violence, murder, manslaughter and public order offences as being a factor, rather than their sole cause, in order that it is not perceived to be an excuse.  I share the concerns expressed by the Minister regarding alcohol abuse among young people and I will return to this point briefly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">However, in addressing this problem and the need for cultural change, honesty is required in this debate.  When dealing with the abuse caused by a minority as a result of irresponsible drinking, Members have a tendency to introduce measures to restrict the free will of the majority who drink safely and sensibly, know not to drive, know when to go home and who simply know how to behave properly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1142">That said, Members must realise a cycle pertaining to drinking in Ireland has been passed from generation to generation and the majority of social events have an alcohol component.  Adults, in their frequent lamentations about the behaviour of young people regarding drink, must realise that behaviour is learned and the attitudes of young people frequently, although perhaps not always, reflect the circumstances in which they were brought up, as well as the attitude of their families and peers to alcohol.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">This legislation appears to have come from a public order perspective and I welcome the clarification it will bring to the Garda's ability to seize in particular.  However, the majority of alcohol consumption among minors does not take place in licensed premises.  Moreover, a degree of fairness is required in this regard, particularly from the perspective of retailers.  I believe that many wish to ensure the law is upheld and do not wish to sell alcohol to minors.  Likewise, they do not want employees who are minors to sell alcohol.  I have had the experience a few times of being at checkouts and being told by the checkout assistants that they are unable to serve me because they are under age, although I obviously am not.  In the absence of a national identification card, people are being asked to uphold a law and are being told they will be punished if they do not.  However, they are not being provided with a proper opportunity to verify a person's age.  Effectively, this makes the legislation a half measure, which will have serious consequences if someone is convicted of serving alcohol to an under age person.  I urge the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to deal with this issue when he introduces the amended version of the Intoxicating Liquor Bill that has been promised for later this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">As for the proposed infrastructural changes in retail outlets, I remain unconvinced of the practicality and effectiveness of what was proposed originally.  The costs involved would make it prohibitive for some retailers to continue selling alcohol, which obviously could give rise to competition issues and could cause difficulties for the viability of their businesses.  It may be that one would be creating a "back of the shop" mentality for the sale of alcohol and I do not believe this would do anything to curtail binge drinking or excessive consumption.  I believe that people enter shops with the intention of purchasing alcohol if they want it, rather than making a purchase on a spur of the moment impulse.  While I have no difficulty with alcohol not being dotted throughout shops, complete segregation would prove to be impractical.  Moreover, the practice of dotting alcohol throughout a shop is far more prevalent in major supermarkets than in small retail units, which lack the space to do so.  In the main, small local shops are owned and run by families who act responsibly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">I wish to turn to the issue of young people and alcohol.  The submission made by Youth Work Ireland on this subject was quite informative.  It stated the problems young people have with alcohol happen within the context and as a direct result of a broader societal problem and cannot be ring-fenced or dealt with in isolation.  While under age drinking undoubtedly is a problem that can affect young people, it is important to state it is quite natural for young people to wish to experiment and to push out their own limits.  It is when they go beyond this at a young age or when drinking, particularly to excess, becomes a habit, that there is a real need for concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">The legislation addresses this issue from a "stick" approach that is aimed at the retailer, rather than at young people.  I was interested in the comments of Ruairí McKiernan of SpunOut, when he stated that young people are tired of being negatively stigmatised.  They want to be listened to and get involved in what is happening in their lives, be it at home or in their class, locally or nationally.</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">The Ombudsman for Children's report also was informative regarding the views of young people on these types of issues.  In that report, the second issue highlighted by young people was that of play and recreation.  I visited a youth project in Camross, County Laois, recently that runs two nights a week between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. and 10 p.m. and 12 midnight for older teenagers.  It has fantastic facilities, including DVDs, couches, PlayStations and so on and is supervised, but in a highly non-invasive way.  This is the type of project that should be rolled out nationwide for young people.  Similarly, I refer to the issue of providing facilities such as skateboard parks in order that people have alternatives.  I ask the Minister of State to ask the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to make a decision finally as to whether it will provide funding this year.  I understand it has a scheme for local authorities regarding such facilities ready to go but has not received sanction to so do.  If people are to be penalised for this, alternatives must be offered.</p>

        <speech by="#TerenceFlanagan" eId="spk_818">
          <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_1148">I also welcome the opportunity to speak on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008 and thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in this regard.  This Bill certainly is a small step in the right direction by the Government towards controlling the supply of alcohol to the public and certainly is not before its time.  As Members are aware, major problems arise nationwide, at weekends in particular, on many of our main streets.  Much binge drinking takes place, both by young people and those of all other age groups.  Binge drinking certainly can lead to public disorder and to problems on our streets, particularly after the closure of the nightclubs or late pubs when everyone congregates on the streets at the same time.  As there has been a 35% increase in the number of off-licences from 2003 to 2005, it is no wonder statistics show there has been an increase of 17% in alcohol consumption in the past ten years.  As alcohol is so readily available, many more public order offences are being committed at weekends.  All Members can pinpoint black spots in their constituencies, where problems take place and where the Garda must maintain a presence in large numbers, particularly late on Friday and Saturday evenings.  In the absence of sequential closing times, this problem is set to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">The attitude and tolerance in Ireland towards drink and the drinking culture must change dramatically if we wish to stop accident and emergency wards being clogged up by drunks.  At weekends, accident and emergency units in particular experience a much greater volume of people, some of whom, unfortunately and sadly, are young people who arrive in a particularly bad state and who must be looked after by the medical staff.  This issue must be examined.</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">The Bill certainly is a positive step towards changing things for the better in society and contains many positive elements.  However, there are blatant omissions from the Bill that Members from the Fine Gael Party will seek to have included on Committee Stage.  I note the sale of alcohol in off-licences will be restricted to the hours of 10.30 a.m. to 10 p.m. from Monday to Saturday.  On Sundays and St. Patrick's Day, off-licences will open from 12.30 p.m. and will close at 10 p.m.  However, we appear to experience many more public order offences on St. Patrick's Day than on other days, particularly in Dublin.  A former Lord Mayor of Dublin, Councillor Michael Conaghan, attempted to close off-licences a few years ago because of the ready supply of alcohol and all the problems and public order offences that take place on St. Patrick's Day.  Perhaps the possibility of more restrictive hours could be considered, particularly on Ireland's national feast day, which seems to turn into a drink festival for many young people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">I am glad to see that under section 5, an applicant for a wine off-licence will now have to obtain a District Court certificate.  This is currently the case for beer or spirit off-licence owners, and it is good to see this anomaly closed off in the Bill.  Section 8 relates to the structural separation of alcohol products from other products in commercial premises, particularly those engaged in mixed trading.  A separation is badly needed.  We have all received feedback that the cost factor is a major issue for convenience stores, especially with costs up to €50,000 per annum to keep the alcohol in a separate section in the shop.  We will be looking for more of a turnstile approach, which seems to be the case in Northern Ireland, rather than forcing traders to redefine their shops completely.  In many supermarkets, alcohol is displayed in one's face as one walks in the front door.  One should not have to walk past all the alcohol to get to the groceries section.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">A national identification card is needed in this area.  We oppose the test purchase of alcohol until such a system is brought in.  Young people should not have to use passports, as many of them lose their passports when they go to pubs and clubs.  By introducing a national ID card, we will ensure there is less of a risk of that happening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">Sequential closing times are not addressed at all in the Bill.  We need to look at that, as the vast majority of public offences occur when people come onto the streets of our towns and cities at the same time.  There is no evidence that early houses are causing these problems, rather it is our late pubs and nightclubs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">This Bill is very welcome.  The area of binge drinking needs to be examined.  There are some good points, but there are also omissions in the Bill, and we will be trying to rectify that on Committee Stage.  We also look forward to the forthcoming sale of alcohol Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#UlickBurke" eId="spk_819">
          <from>Deputy Ulick Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_1155">I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this Bill.  When we examine some of the legislation on alcohol that already exists, we have to wonder if sufficient legislation is already in place.  The only problem seems to be that it is not being effectively applied.  There is no use in blaming the Garda.  If the Garda had sufficient resources and numbers, many of the difficulties caused by the abuse of alcohol could be easily tightened up.  I am glad to see that one of the points that the advisory group on alcohol raised related to the adequacy and effectiveness of existing sanctions and penalties.  That is the kernel of the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156">When we tried to eliminate the sale of tobacco to under age people, health board officials sent minors into shops to buy cigarettes in order to catch out the retail agent.  I do not agree with that, but this Bill is even worse as gardaí will be able to send a minor, with parental permission, into an outlet to try to purchase alcohol.  That is a retrograde step, because such a minor will become a hero among his peers.  I ask the Minister of State to bring this issue to the notice of the Minister.  It should be withdrawn from this Bill.  It is an admission that the law is unable to monitor adequately the difficulties surrounding the sale of drink at existing outlets.  Using a minor to purchase alcohol is to renege on our responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">About six weeks ago, I raised a matter on the Adjournment that dealt with the importation of what are known as "shots" from Mexico, the US and Canada.  These drinks are targeted at young people and contain 80% alcohol.  The company's marketing statement claims that it has revolutionised the alcohol industry by introducing a single shot premium liqueur in a lightweight and durable plastic pouch.  It states that the 50 ml shots come in a safe, break-resistant plastic pouch which makes them safer than glass, and have a built-in spout that makes them ready to use in any location.</p>

          <p eId="para_1159">The Minister gave an undertaking that, in conjunction with the Minister for Health and Children, he might ban these particular products.  I welcome the advertising code on alcohol that was published yesterday, even though it was only voluntary, but if the Minister does not amend the Bill to ban the sale of products such as these, then we are turning our back on one of the most deadly instruments out there.  They can be bought on-line and delivered to the home.  The idea behind them is that the individual buying them can hide them on his person.</p>
          <p eId="para_1160">The voluntary code published yesterday states that the Broadcasting Commission of Ireland has a separate advertising code, stipulating that alcohol advertising shall not link the product to physical well-being or sexual attractiveness.  One of the promotions that I have before me clearly indicates the latter category.  I want the Minister to act on that.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy John McGuinness)</from>
          <p eId="para_1162">I welcome the opportunity to say a few words on this important Bill.  The last debate we had on café bars triggered a public response and a political debate on whether we had enough alcohol outlets.  Towards the end of that debate, I was asked on radio if I was a publican.  I did not presume that I was, but I had a loose connection as I had a publican's licence.  Therefore, while I do not operate a pub, as a person who owns a property that contains a public house, it may be no harm to state that.</p>
          <p eId="para_1163">This does not mean that I do not have a view on these things.  As someone in business who is familiar with how bar licences operate, I consider the debate on this Bill to be very worthwhile.  The vintners' groups have made a positive contribution.  The advisory group on its operation is a model that could be used in many other areas of legislation.  It brings together the stakeholders involved and gives them the opportunity to put forward their views and even their solutions to the many problems that are affecting society in general.  When trying to find a solution to the problem, we should seek the views of those who are central to it, be they the publicans or the Garda and so on, so that legislators can be fully informed when making their decision.  From that point of view, the exercise of going through the advisory group was a good one.</p>
          <p eId="para_1164">This legislation is only part of an overall approach.  A number of pieces of legislation, which will follow subsequently, will deal with the other complex issues that constantly plague society arising from the abuse of alcohol.  As legislators, we can try to offer workable solutions to the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1165">It is an opportune time to acknowledge that over the years publicans, those who hold restaurant licences and all of the entrepreneurs involved in this business throughout the country have invested vast amounts of money in their premises.  We must acknowledge such businesses exist, that their owners want to participate fully in them and are responsible people delivering a service that is in demand.  In difficult times it is good to acknowledge that they continue to make such investments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1166">Some of the issues raised in the context of people doing business include local charges and rates, which impact on the level of business being conducted.  Those matters, which do not form part of this Bill, are related to local government, but the background to this Bill and the consultation that took place show solutions can be found.</p>
          <p eId="para_1167">I welcome the general thrust of the Bill.  I am glad that the Minister, in the context of section 8, is dealing with off-licences in the way he has outlined, through a voluntary code of practice.  It is an issue that arose early on in the debate on this Bill.  People were genuinely concerned as to how they might operate their premises should they have to separate the off-licence from the general business area within their retail outlets.  If one looks at the structure of retail outlets, particularly the changes that have taken place in recent years, the corner shops are generally gone and are replaced by named outlets.  There is a methodology of doing business in them and there is space in some of them for off-licences.  The example of Northern Ireland which was given, where the off-licence can be separated and features a turnstile operation, is a reasonable way to look at this.</p>
          <p eId="para_1168">The voluntary code of practice is to be welcomed.  It will now be down to the industry to show its credentials and show it is a responsible group in abiding by that code.  The Minister stated clearly that if that does not work, an alternative option exists.  The code of practice shows that we, as legislators, and the Minister in championing this Bill, are prepared to listen, particularly to people who are making a significant investment and having an impact on society.</p>
          <p eId="para_1169">I want to conclude my remarks by referring to the issue of anti-social behaviour arising from drink.  This is to the fore in every constituency right throughout the country and plagues many of our housing estates, river banks, derelict sites and other areas where people can gather.</p>
          <p eId="para_1170">In my local authority area, a by-law has been introduced to impose a fine on those who enter certain areas to drink in public, but rarely have I seen that implemented.  In fact, all around the signposts along by the riverbank, which state that those drinking in public places will be fined, one can see such public drinking going on.  It is a source of nuisance and of anti-social behaviour, and it is has got out of hand.</p>
          <p eId="para_1171">Likewise, late night drinking is something that annoys residents in most towns and cities throughout the country because there is an outturn onto the streets at a particular time and the row usually starts at a chip shop or other location along the route from the premises where the drinking occurred.  Local authorities have a role play in this in that they provide planning permission and consider the opening and closing hours of enterprises.  The planning permission itself can be policed.  The local authority should play an active role, with the Garda, to ensure that some of the nuisance experienced in our towns, villages and cities can be eliminated.  This legislation will not be the answer to everything.  It will take a great deal of effort at local level to ensure that local government and other agencies play their part, with the Garda and in accordance with the legislation, to ensure that what is proposed happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_1172">I welcome the legislation.  I welcome the change the Minister has introduced and hope the Bill will have a speedy passage through Committee Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelCreed" eId="spk_824">
          <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
          <p eId="para_1173">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute briefly on this legislation.  Regrettably, my overall view is that it will have little, if any, impact on the problem it is intended to resolve, namely, anti-social behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_1174">We seem to have a fascination with talking about the drinking culture and its consequences.  It seems to be the stock in trade of any Oireachtas term now that legislation is being introduced in this area, yet the problem continues apace.  That is a matter we need to reflect on.  If we were to stand back and take an entirely market approach to this issue on the basis that people have a fixed amount of money to spend on alcohol and they should be allowed to get on with that, we might find that the structures or artificial controls we are putting in place are more of a hindrance than a help in many respects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1175">For that reason, I want to make the point that pubs and publicans have taken a hammering, and particularly in rural Ireland.  That is happening for a variety of reasons, such as that people's behaviour patterns are changing, but it must be said that the safest place for anybody to drink is probably in a regulated, well-supervised, well-run public house and the problems of anti-social behaviour are often the consequences of people opting out of that environment and drinking elsewhere.  That is something we should examine.  In fairness to the overwhelming majority of publicans, they are committed to running orderly public houses and to supervising their clients in an acceptable manner.  It is worth noting the number of public houses that are closing, particularly in rural areas.  I am sure the Ceann Comhairle would be aware of this.  It is a factor in Macroom where I live, but is probably equally a factor in every country town where publicans have simply gone out of business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1176">A significant contributory factor to anti-social behaviour, which is not addressed in this Bill at all, is the cross consumption of drugs and alcohol.  As much as alcohol contributes to anti-social behaviour, so too do illicit drugs.  That is something of which we need to be conscious.</p>
          <p eId="para_1177">Another issue that is not addressed in the Bill is that of sequential closing.  The previous speaker, the Minister of State, Deputy John McGuinness, made the point that local authorities have power to deal with these issues when planning permission is granted.  I am not sure that that is the appropriate place.  The opportunity was lost when framing this legislation to take an initiative here in terms of obliging public houses and especially nightclubs to address that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1178">The real problem of anti-social behaviour stems from people pouring out of public houses and especially nightclubs at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. looking for taxis and chippers.  If one took the free market approach and abolished closing times, people would go home at various hours as it suited either their pocket or their obligation to get up for work the following day and so on.  There might be some madness initially while such a proposal took root, but there is some merit in examining the proposition.  The moral police will probably crucify me for making this suggestion, but we must acknowledge all the efforts made to date have only tinkered with the problem and not brought about a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1179">If we were serious about tackling the problem of under age drinking, we would have addressed the issue of a national identity card, either in this legislation or separately.  There is a problem with under age drinking and people acquiring drink for those who are under age.  The previous speaker alluded to people consuming drink subsequently on the banks of rivers, unsupervised, and the consequent dangers.  The single instrument of a national identity card would substantially stem the flow of alcohol to those who are by age not entitled to drink it, instead of creating these facile impediments dictating how and where alcohol can be sold in a garage forecourt or a supermarket.  I fail to see the civil liberty issues that make this a matter no Government appears willing to grasp and tackle, which is regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1180">As I come from a rural constituency, I am aware, as is the Minister, Deputy Ahern, of the practices of small shops and supermarkets selling alcohol, including bottles of wine and cans of beer and so on.  The initial costs associated with the legislation for such merchants will be significant and there will be no benefit in minimising the outflow of alcohol.  If a person walks into a local supermarket and wants to buy a bottle of wine, he or she does not want to be staring through a grill.  People like to browse when they buy a bottle of wine.  As I understand the legislation, all of those products will be behind a grill or counter.  A customer might want a bottle of Chardonnay, or to have the option of looking see if the wine he or she had last Saturday when out for a meal is in the local supermarket.  The broad thrust of the proposals is bordering on the ridiculous and should be examined.  There will be additional costs for small shops, but such costs will not pose a problem for the big supermarket chains such as Tesco, Quinnsworth and so on.  I do not have anything against these multiple outlets, but we must examine how smaller shops can survive and trade against them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1181">There is an issue with below cost selling of alcohol where bonus points are available.  This is another issue that could have been usefully addressed in the legislation.  There may be ways of encouraging people to consume alcohol in licensed public houses under appropriate supervision.  This would be preferable to allowing a person to go to the local supermarket or retail outlet to buy a slab of cans for less than €1 per can, or to buy 24 bottles of Miller or a similar beer for the same price, and go to the bank of the river with mates to drink.  This legislation presented an opportunity to tackle this matter, with below cost selling.  I do not know if it would be appropriate to ban low cost selling in legislation, but these are measures that would make a practical contribution to stemming the flow of alcohol to under age drinkers.  The prosecution of persons who procure and provide alcohol for minors should also have been dealt with in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1182">The Minister is not short of advice on the shortcomings of the legislation and what I have said is probably not new.  We have a fascination with discussing this matter, but despite all the efforts made, we have made little progress.  As a nation, we have a serious alcohol problem.  Alcohol consumption is glorified, especially in advertising.  Alcohol has too close an association with sports activities.  These issues need to be addressed, but without adopting a nanny State approach.  Placing alcohol behind the counter and out of sight will not address the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1183">I hope the Minister will accept these comments in the spirit in which they have been offered and be willing, open-minded and consider amendments on Committee Stage which might result in better legislation at the end of the process.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DermotAhern" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform" eId="spk_825">
          <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_1184">I thank all speakers for their contributions and words of advice.  In the context of Deputy Creed's comments and those of other Deputies on browsing in the purchasing of a bottle of wine, I indicated earlier on Second Stage that I was prepared to bring forward an amendment on Committee Stage to exempt wine sales from the structural separation requirements because it is a drink that is purchased after browsing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1185">On the matter of staggered closing hours, I have heard the arguments and there is strong lobbying by night club owners on the disgorging of large numbers of people onto the streets at the same time.  In practice — I said as much to those I met — is it not the case that if one has staggered closing hours, people will leave the bar with normal opening hours, go to the late bar with a special exemption order and perhaps even go on to the nightclub?  Such persons will move from one place to the next.  That would defeat the purpose in having staggered closing hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_1186">I read a report issued recently from the UK Local Government Association which examined the effects of the extension of drinking hours introduced in November 2005 in the United Kingdom.  The report stated the Ministers who had promoted the legislation wanted to promote what was called a café culture in an effort to reduce the level of disorder following the calling of "last orders" when everyone emerged out onto the streets at closing time.  The survey suggested that nearly one third of primary care trusts had reported an increase in the number of alcohol related incidents.  Half of the police authorities had reported that the Act had merely resulted in incidents occurring later in the night.  More than two thirds of health authorities believed they had to spend more as a result of alcohol related admissions in accident and emergency units.</p>
          <p eId="para_1187">Sir Simon Milton, chairman of the Local Government Association, said the new drink laws had had no impact whatsoever on reducing the alcohol related violence that blighted towns and turned them into no-go areas on a Friday and Saturday night.  The then Minister with responsibility for culture, Ms Tessa Jowell, said the reason they had moved to more flexible licensing hours was all the evidence that crime and disorder were at their peak at chucking-out time.  Apparently, the report is now indicating the opposite is the case some two years after implementation.  From what I have seen of it, the UK Department of Culture, Media and Sports states there is other research which suggests the overall figures for alcohol consumption are down.  I do not believe, therefore, that there is an easy solution to this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1188">I wish to be fair to all concerned and level the playing field as much as possible.  The response by the British Government to a report was to say the legislation was not going to be a silver bullet to solve alcohol and public disorder problems.  Similarly, I am not holding out this legislation as the panacea for all the ills.</p>
          <p eId="para_1189">I have said it is a very small attempt, particularly in the context of asking that it be passed before the summer in order to give the Garda the powers in this Bill relating to public order.  It will equip gardaí properly before the summer starts with a vengeance, weather-wise, and give them the power to apprehend people who have alcohol in cases where there is public disorder.</p>
          <p eId="para_1190">I have already indicated that there will be a comprehensive sale of alcohol Bill later this year, which will provide the opportunity for a more thorough and comprehensive discussion of the role of alcohol in our society.  This Bill will modernise and streamline all the licensing laws by repealing the Licensing Acts 1833 to 2004 and replacing them, in effect, with one consolidated and updated statute.</p>
          <p eId="para_1191">As I mentioned here last week, research published by the Health Research Board indicates that alcohol consumption in Ireland increased by 17% between 1995 and 2006, with binge drinking a particular problem.  The resulting public disorder and health-related harm cannot be ignored or tolerated and although I accept the point made by several Deputies that a change of culture regarding alcohol is required, the Government has a responsibility to ensure licensing law and public order legislation are sufficiently robust to address these problems.  That is the purpose of the Bill before us.</p>
          <p eId="para_1192">With regard to wine off-licences, section 5 provides that the new requirement to obtain a District Court certificate will only apply to new applications made after the entry into force of this legislation.  The same applies to the new grounds for objection set out in section 6.  In short, existing wine off-licences are not affected by the proposed change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1193">As regards renewal of wine off-licences, the existing position under the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 is that an objection may be made to such renewal.  Where such an objection is made, a District Court certificate is required before the Revenue Commissioners will issue a renewal.  That is the position under existing law and it will not change under this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1194">The question of whether a temporary closure order applies to the entire premises or a part of the premises only was also raised in contributions.  Under existing law, the District Court may make an order for the closure of the premises or any part thereof.  The extent and duration of closure orders are, therefore, matters for the court to determine and the only change proposed in this Bill is that the minimum closure period will in future be two days.  We came across a number of instances where temporary closure orders were made for a matter of a few hours, which is not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1195">I referred to the staggering of closing times, which was mentioned in several contributions.  The position is that this Bill contains no proposals to change rules covering the duration of special exemption orders.  It will remain the case that special exemption orders expire at2.30 a.m., or 1 a.m. on Sunday night and Monday morning.  The Government alcohol advisory group had recommended that 2.30 a.m. be brought forward to 2 a.m. but this was not accepted by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1196">Recently late-night venues, including some nightclubs and late bars, have sought to exploit a loophole which has opened up as a result of a High Court decision on theatre licences last year.  The result has been a proliferation of theatre licences and a resulting circumvention of the special exemption order provisions.  It is also resulting in a significant loss of revenue to the Exchequer.  The proposals in the Bill will mean this loophole, which is being unfairly exploited by some operators, will be closed and this will restore fair competition between all late night venues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1197">As regards test purchasing, I note the comments made by some speakers even today.  I intend to table an amendment on Committee Stage which will provide that test purchasing be carried out in accordance with procedures set out in guidelines which will be drawn up following consultation with the Garda Commissioner and the Minister for Health and Children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1198">Regarding structural separation, I repeat what I said earlier in order to avoid any misunderstandings.  During discussions with organisations representing supermarkets and convenience stores two weeks ago, the bodies concerned offered to implement an agreed code of practice as an alternative to implementation of the section 8 provisions.  The code would cover issues such as the location and display of alcohol within premises, signage, warning signs and in-store advertising, as well as staff training standards.  Implementation would be overseen and enforced through an independent audit and verification mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_1199">I received a first draft of the proposed code from Retail Ireland earlier today and it will now be examined in my Department and in the Department of Health and Children.  On cursory examination, it does not seem to go far enough so we will raise the issue with the groups concerned.  The groups must demonstrate widespread support for its contents from all the bodies representing mixed trading outlets across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1200">If agreement can be reached on its contents and the required level of support exists for its strict implementation across the mixed trading sector, if I can be satisfied that the code would achieve, in effect, what we have set out to achieve through structural separation and if the code is subject to independent verification on an annual basis, I would be disposed to deferring implementation of section 8 for the moment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1201">If independent verification of compliance were to show that the code is being implemented effectively across the country and achieving, in effect, what we have set out to achieve through structural separation, it may not be necessary to commence section 8.  If it does not achieve this — I want to repeat this — I will not hesitate to commence section 8.</p>
          <p eId="para_1202">Many contributions to the debate mentioned the special promotions and price discounts that have become so prevalent and are almost the norm in recent times.  The advisory group acknowledged in its report that the increased affordability of alcohol is a result not only of reduced prices, but also the increased disposable income levels that have resulted from economic progress and increased prosperity.  The group was satisfied, however, that the price at which alcohol is sold remains an important influence on purchasing patterns and that lower alcohol prices are being used as a means of attracting customers in the expectation that they will purchase other products as well as alcohol once inside the premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_1203">For this reason, the group identified the control of those promotional and pricing practices which appear to encourage increased purchases of alcohol as a potentially important means of tackling excessive consumption patterns.  Section 15 of the Bill provides for the making of regulations prohibiting or restricting the advertising or promoting the sale or supply of alcohol at a reduced price, or free of charge, on the purchase of any quantity of alcohol or any other product or service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1204">Preparatory work has commenced on the drafting of these regulations and because of their potential impact on the EU Internal Market rules, it will be necessary to submit the proposed regulations in draft form to the European Commission for clearance.  I do not foresee any specific difficulties with implementing such regulations at this stage, but failure to follow specified procedures could lead to a legal challenge and the subsequent striking down of regulations on technical grounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_1205">With regard to special exemption orders, existing law currently provides that these may be extended to 2.30 a.m. on the following day and 1 a.m. on Sunday night and Monday morning.  When 30 minutes drinking-up time is added, it means that these premises normally close at 3 a.m.  The District Court may, for stated reasons, grant orders for a shorter period, which it does.  The Bill strengthens the public order ground on which the Garda may object to such orders and, in future, a CCTV system will be a requirement for all events to which the public have access.</p>
          <p eId="para_1206">I intend to table an amendment on Committee Stage regarding a new provision which will require applicants for special exemption orders to ensure all door supervisors on duty during the events for which the orders are being sought hold the required licences under the Private Security Act 2004.  This is intended to assist the Private Security Authority in the enforcement activities under that Act.  As I mentioned at the outset, compliance with fire safety requirements will also become a statutory requirement for the grant of special exemption orders.</p>
          <p eId="para_1207">I am pleased that Deputies from all sides of the House gave a favourable response to the proposals in the Bill that are aimed at tackling the public order problems associated with excessive alcohol consumption.  Apart from the upset and annoyance this causes to the public in general, it also places the Garda under serious pressure.  I am aware that the point was made in the debate that the success of the public order reforms will be evident only if there is full and vigorous enforcement.  I can say that, in drawing up the current proposals, both my predecessor and I were very conscious of that point and, as a result, I believe that in our new proposals for the seizure of alcohol we have come up with a mechanism that is not only going to be easier to enforce, but more effective in pre-empting and preventing public order offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1208">I take this opportunity to emphasise once again that the new powers to seize alcohol — either in the case of persons under 18 or from persons causing or likely to cause annoyance or a breach of the peace — can be used even where an offence has not been committed.  These new powers are designed primarily to pre-empt and prevent the commission of an offence.  The Garda will continue to have a wide variety of existing powers to deal with offences.</p>
          <p eId="para_1209">Deputies will recall I mentioned my intention to press ahead with plans to introduce fixed charges for certain public order offences, namely, being drunk or being disorderly in a public place, as soon as technical amendments I will introduce on Committee Stage are in place.  These amendments will be primarily concerned with removing the Garda from the administrative aspects of the new arrangements.  This should add to the attraction, from a Garda perspective, of using the new procedures.  While I will spell out the details of the amendments on Committee Stage, suffice to say their introduction should lead to improved enforcement by the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210">A number of Deputies drew attention to serious incidents which have arisen in recent times from rows developing at house parties.  Unfortunately, a number of people have died in such cases and there is every reason to believe alcohol consumption contributed to many of the incidents in question.  Deputies will be aware that, as a rule, there are limitations on the right of the Garda to enter private dwellings.  These arise from the Constitution's protection of the inviolability of the private home.  As a result, there can be no question of granting powers to the Garda to enter homes in a routine way to seize alcohol.  Apart from the constitutional aspects, such a power would be regarded by many as excessive and disproportionate.  The law on nuisance is probably more relevant when dealing with problems of this kind.  Gardaí may respond if complaints are made about noise and, once at the scene, take steps to disperse a group or to give warnings about the need to desist.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211">I thank Deputies who contributed to the debate.  I have taken note of the points they made and I appreciate their co-operation.  I hope the legislation will be passed before the summer recess.  I look forward to discussing the wider issue of the sale of alcohol when more comprehensive legislation is introduced at the end of the year.</p>

          <p eId="para_1219">On a point of order, I support my colleague, Deputy O'Dowd, on this matter.  I note also that the Ceann Comhairle ruled out of order amendments Nos. 20, 34, 39, 43 and 94, which I also tried to table on Committee Stage, on the basis that they involve a potential charge on the Revenue.  I fail to understand the application of this rule.  The Minister made changes and we do not yet have exact costings for the operations of the Dublin transport authority.  It is unfortunate that these amendments have been ruled out of order as their purpose was to ensure the Dublin transport authority does not become a Health Service Executive on wheels and Deputies do not need to endlessly raise questions about the authority in the House, thereby annoying the Ceann Comhairle and wasting his time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">The Ceann Comhairle should at least allow Deputies to ventilate our demand for true democracy and accountability for the new Dublin transport authority.  I did not want to vote against the Bill but I am being left with no alternative.</p>

It will be possible for Deputies Broughan and O'Dowd to ventilate their views on certain matters when discussing the section without reference to any amendments.</p>

A document listing the three amendments and containing a note for information on each was attached.

          <p eId="para_1249">Doubts arose on Second and Committee Stages with regard to who would have the final say in respect of planning matters, bus routes and many aspects of the operation of this significant new regional authority.  The Dublin transport authority, DTA, represents a major step forward because it represents the first element of a serious regional system of government in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1250">I tabled amendment No. 1 in order to indicate that the Minister, and, therefore, the House, will have responsibility in this area.  It states in the Bill that the authority means the DTA.  My amendment suggests that, under EU Regulation 1370/2007, the Minister for Transport shall be the "competent authority".  There was some correspondence among the Department and several of the stakeholders in respect of this matter and it was stated that the Minister and the DTA would both constitute the competent authority.  I do not understand how that could work because in respect of any of the controversies that might arise, the authority that must be ultimately responsible to the House is the Minister for Transport.  I cannot see how the Minister and the DTA could both act as the competent authority.  The Department further indicated that CIE will be precluded in this regard because it will be operating within the DTA's area.  As owner of that company on behalf of the people, the Minister would, therefore, find himself in a difficult situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1251">It would add to the Bill and the list of definitions contained therein if we included a reference to the Minister for Transport being the competent authority.  EU Regulation 1370/2007, on which the Bill is based, contains provisions on public service and direct award contracts.  It would improve the legislation if a clear line of authority involving the Minister was established, particularly in view of the fact that he has ultimate responsibility in this area.  Direct provision should be made in the Bill in this regard.</p>

Deputy O'Dowd raised this matter on Committee Stage and suggested that a specific reference to park and ride facilities would strengthen the DTA's position in ensuring that such facilities will be provided.  This means that the DTA's functions in respect of public transport infrastructure, as specified in section 44, will be clearly and specifically outlined.</p>

          <p eId="para_1257">I welcome the fact that the Minister has taken on board the point I made on Committee Stage.  The location of park and ride facilities is a critical aspect of public transport in and out of the city of Dublin.  The DTA will now have a specific role to play in the provision of such facilities.  One of the difficulties is that the DTA will have responsibility for transport in Dublin and will not be a national transport authority.  Therefore, the number of areas in which park and ride facilities could be established will be limited by the boundaries of the DTA's area of influence.</p>
          <p eId="para_1258">What will happen if it is deemed that there is a need for a park and ride facility outside the DTA's area?  In that context, provision is not made, for example, in respect of County Louth.  If the DTA is of the view that a need for park and ride facilities exists and if the local authorities responsible for the areas adjacent to its area of influence agree, how will such facilities be provided?</p>

In the circumstances he outlined, I envisage that there would be direct contact among the DTA and the relevant local authorities.  It is intended, at some point in the future, to consider establishing a national transport authority and an issue such as that to which the Deputy refers would be relevant to the debate thereon.  Initially, matters of this nature will be resolved with through agreement rather than by the introduction of legislation.</p>

Those who work for the DTO tend to take a broad view in respect of matters of this nature, on which they will be advising the DTA in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_1265">This is a technical amendment designed to catch all references to the word "subsidiary" in the amended Bill.  It arises because of the inclusion of a reference to "any subsidiary" in amendment No. 59.  The latter arose on foot of an amendment tabled by Deputy O'Dowd on Committee Stage, the intent of which I agreed with, and it provides that the authority's annual report will be used to report on the continuing justification for its subsidiaries, if there are any.  The annual report forms part of the existing formal reporting structure to the Minister and it is also a public document.  All organisations should, in any event, review their operations on a regular basis, including in the context of the continued need for any subsidiaries.  The amendment will ensure that the authority will do just that.</p>

          <p eId="para_1266">I thank the Minister for taking on board the views I expressed in respect of this matter on Committee Stage.  However, questions arise in respect of subsidiaries and the level of accountability that applies in respect of them.  The fact that their activities will be commented upon in the annual report is something.  However, people will be concerned that any such subsidiaries might be established.  Deputy Varadkar recently highlighted the number of quangos and subsidiaries of State and semi-State bodies which remain in place for long periods and an appalling vista has opened up with regard to the financing of FÁS.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">The Minister stated that subsidiaries will be accounted for through the authority's annual report.  There is a view on this side of the House that a sunset clause ought to come into operation after a number of years in respect of any or all subsidiaries.  There is also the suggestion that these subsidiaries should be obliged to report to the Oireachtas every two years in order that we might evaluate whether they are working, the nature of the work they are doing, whether they are accountable and transparent and whether control is exercised over them.  Issues relating to accountability and control are important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1268">Under the Oireachtas committee system, representatives of the new DTA, Bus Éireann, etc., can be requested to appear and report on the work in which they are involved.  The difficulty is that the windows of opportunity which exist in this regard are small, particularly in light of the extremely busy committee schedule.  Are there any other means by which the Minister can ensure that there will be total accountability on the part of any quangos or subsidiaries that may be established as a result of the passage of this legislation?</p>

          <p eId="para_1269">Deputy O'Dowd made the original suggestion in respect of this matter.  As drafted, the Bill merely indicated that subsidiaries might be established.  The Deputy made a strong case in respect of ensuring that subsidiaries could not remain in operation for an indefinite period without a review of their activities being carried out.  These amendment represent an honest attempt to try to meet his concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_1270">The one thing every organisation must do is produce an annual report, which is then used for the purposes of invigilating in respect of various matters, etc.  Annual reports are used by companies in the financial sector and also by the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1271">The Deputy will recall our discussion on whether to do it every three or five years.  Arising from those discussions, the annual report is a mechanism whereby a committee of this House can at any stage draw attention to the subsidiary if it is not sufficiently reported or if it should not be there.  It is also useful from a departmental point of view because it is a means by which we can judge the efficiency or effectiveness of a subsidiary.  It is a beginning and I think it will be effective.  The Department and the Oireachtas will both have opportunities to conduct reviews.</p>

                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1276">In page 12, line 40, after "Kildare," to insert "Drogheda and South Louth,"</p>
          <p eId="para_1277">The section of the Bill which deals with the definition of the DTA refers to the city of Dublin, the administrative counties of south Dublin, Fingal, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Kildare, Wicklow and Meath and such other areas as may be declared by order of the Minister.  It is clear the development of counties Louth and Meath is integrated.  The constituency review commission, the legislation for which will be published this week, recommends that part of east Meath should join County Louth for the purposes of political administration and Dáil constituencies.  The Minister will be aware that east Meath is experiencing a phenomenal population growth but south Louth and Drogheda have equally high growth rates.  A new development proposed for the outskirts of Drogheda, Sienna Valley, could attract up to 20,000 new residents over the next 15 years.  The development of east Meath is, therefore, a mirror image of south Louth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1278">The difference is, however, that the Bill provides for a land use strategy within the DTA area.  The DTA will have responsibility for ensuring the primacy of transport in planning considerations in this area.  The authority's writ runs to the River Boyne but does not cross it, even though south Louth is experiencing the same problems as east Meath.  Every day, thousands of commuters in the area leave estates which lack proper road networks.  More traffic passes through Julianstown than travelled along the old N1.  This is a serious issue.  Including Drogheda and south Louth into the DTA area would allow for proper planning and development.  An Bord Pleanála recently granted planning permission for more than 800 houses in east Meath even though Meath County Council had pointed out that the application made no provision for infrastructure to deal with the impact of the development.  This Bill will prevent that from happening in the future in County Meath, but it will not prevent it in County Louth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1279">I also spoke to transport operators in County Louth, including Matthews Coach Hire.  The DTA can offer incentives to transport operators in its area in regard to integrated ticketing, so those who are outside the area may have to bear additional costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1280">If we are to introduce a dynamic and integrated planning regime and a proper land use strategy, communities on the edge of the proposed DTA area will have to be included because otherwise they will be left with developer and An Bord Pleanála led infrastructure.  I referred earlier to An Bord Pleanála's decision in east Meath.  People cannot understand how permission was granted in that instance but that will be repeated if transport planning does not become a primary consideration in land use strategies for south Louth and Drogheda.  The thousands of people who live in the area will be faced with more of the same, which is unacceptable.  It is critical that the Bill gets it right.</p>
          <p eId="para_1281">I acknowledge that the Minister may declare other areas from time to time.  On Committee Stage he suggested that if elected members or local authorities write to the Minister, due consideration would be given to including them in the DTA area.  However, he has not accepted the fundamental point that the same conditions apply both north and south of the River Boyne.  If the boundary of the DTA runs only as far as the Boyne, the north of that border will not have the benefit of proper planning because it will be relatively easy for developers to get permission, they will be able to take advantage of loopholes and there will be less emphasis on sustainable and integrated development, including proper transport planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_1282">Other issues arise in regard to transport.  The DTA will play an important role in deciding the location of new railway stations.  It may require a local authority to construct a new railway station, which will have to be funded from planning charges, before allowing a development to proceed.  Proposals have already been made for new commuter railway stations in Drogheda north and Dunleer, and commuters in mid-Louth are calling for a station to be built in order to cope with the increasing pressures commuters from the area are experiencing.  If this area is not included, it is possible these railway stations will never be built.</p>
          <p eId="para_1283">It will not be a requirement at the planning permission stage.  It will not be a requirement that such practicalities and sensible, reasonable and essential transport planning be considered.  I do not believe the Minister will deny there is a need for these areas to be included.  His colleagues in Louth do not deny it.  In fact, the construction of the railway stations is a priority for all parties and for Louth County Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_1284">I put it to the Minister that he needs to re-examine this provision and to include Drogheda and south Louth in the DTA area thereby avoiding future problems.  If they are included then planning in south Louth in terms of development and transport must go hand in hand.  If they are not included, this will not happen.  If under subsection (<i>c</i>) the Minister decides at a later date to add new areas what new arguments that have not been already put forward will have to be made in this regard?  In my view, there are no further arguments that can be made in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">If the Minister were to decide to include them, when might this happen?  For what length of time must the legislation be in force before he could agree to include Drogheda and south Louth in the DTA area?  I assume the timeframe in this regard would be at a minimum one year.  It is not good enough to neglect or leave out these areas.  I believe I have made a reasonably strong argument for their inclusion.  I put it to the Minister that south Louth cannot afford to wait for this to happen or to wait for developer-led development with no proper public transport strategy.  It cannot afford to wait for badly needed railway stations, which are being campaigned for locally, that are not part of the planning process.  The Dublin Transport Authority will ensure developers, as part of the planning process, provide a proper transport strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">I congratulate Dublin Bus on its transport planning in the south Louth area generally.  I have met with private contractors wishing to provide an orbital bus route around Drogheda, throughout County Louth and on into east Meath.  The two areas are linked.  There are other transport providers in the area.  Matthews Coach Hire carries approximately 10,000 to 15,000 passengers per week on that corridor.  It would mean a lot to its business if it could expand.  The company is planning for the advent of the DTA and is also making plans in respect of the south Louth area.  The inclusion in the DTA of Drogheda and south Louth would make a significant difference to this company and to everybody in that region.  Bus Éireann is also doing great work in this region.</p>
          <p eId="para_1287">The inclusion of Dunleer and Drogheda north in the DTA would add to the capacity of Iarnród Éireann to agree to proper and decent transport planning.  The Minister might argue, as he did on Committee Stage, that Drogheda is the same as Mullingar or any other city or town.  It is not the same because it comes within the greater Dublin area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288">The national spatial strategy examined issues such as growth centres throughout the country.  It states that Drogheda is an important base, as is Navan which is also mentioned.  The economies of these areas, as part of the greater Dublin area, are tied up in this.  There are many sustainable and important arguments in favour of what I am saying.  There are no indicators to the contrary.  No other areas so close to Dublin are experiencing the type of problems in regard to transport, planning and proposed developments, domestic and commercial, as are Drogheda and south Louth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289">I put it to the Minister that the national spatial strategy has identified a need in this regard.  However, the problem is that the political representatives on the national spatial strategy who come from areas such as Kildare, south Dublin, Fingal, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Wicklow and Meath are all included in the planning process while elected representatives and officials in County Louth are not, as far as I am aware, included.  I urge the Minister to take on board the arguments I have made.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_1290">While amendment No. 5 is in my name it is grouped with amendment No. 4 and, as such, I will be speaking to both amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1291">I support the arguments made by my colleague, Deputy O'Dowd.  The Labour Party amendment seeks the inclusion of "Louth" after "Wicklow" as part of the DTA area.  I am a former member of the Dublin Regional Authority which had a great deal of interaction with the Mid-east Regional Authority in its attempts to bring forward serious regional planning.  One of our key ambitions was the establishment of a regional transport authority which I am glad to say is finally being established.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292">We discovered during our discussion relating to Navan, Kells and, in particular, Dublin, that many of the issues raised, such as transport and land use planning, also affected south Louth and Drogheda, as clearly outlined by Deputy O'Dowd.  There is no doubt that Drogheda is economically and, in many respects, socially and infrastructurally part of the greater Dublin area.  As Deputy O'Dowd stated developments, in particular those north of the Boyne, will be profoundly affected by what happens in the rest of that region.  From this point of view, it is only fair that the Louth region come within the remit of the Dublin Transport Authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1293">We are seeking the inclusion of the whole of County Louth in the DTA area.  The Minister on Committee Stage referred to bringing Mullingar and most of Leinster within the remit of the DTA.  Obviously, power is provided in the Bill for the DTA remit to be extended, possibly into a national transport authority.  Also, all services beginning and ending in the DTA area will come under the remit of the transport authority.  Nonetheless, it is important that Louth be directly involved in the functioning of the DTA from the start.  In the past, crazy land use planning did not include major transport infrastructural developments.  Only recently, we heard a presentation on the massive metro north corridor which will run through Fingal and north of Swords.  This will have a profound impact on the economic and transport structure of Fingal, east Meath and, Louth as outlined so eloquently by Deputy O'Dowd.  It is critical that the people of Drogheda and Louth have an input into this through representation on the board of DTA, above all at the planning stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_1294">We have had great debates on decentralisation.  I had many great debates with the Acting Chairman, Deputy Noel O'Flynn, about decentralisation and, in particular, the importance of developing, in economic terms, Cork city as a major counterpoint to Dublin city.  I know this is a cause dear to the Acting Chairman's heart.  A recent study states that despite the Government's botched programme of decentralisation we will still have massive ongoing growth in the eastern region.</p>
          <p eId="para_1295">A study was recently carried out by the Dublin Institute of Technology, which clearly shows that no matter what we do there will be significant growth in the Dublin-south Louth corridor.  The public transport function must be properly integrated and it is, therefore, important that amendments Nos. 4 and 5 are approved by the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1296">I agree with my colleague that if it is intended to extend the DTA into south Louth, we should get some indication this evening, before we have finished with these amendments, of when and how this will happen.  The overall point is that on proper planning grounds and all conceivable socio-economic grounds, south Louth in particular should be part of the Dublin Transportation Authority area.  That is why I will be moving amendment No. 5 on behalf of the Labour Party.  This is something that is close to the hearts of my colleagues in the Louth constituency, particularly Councillor Gerald Nash of Drogheda——</p>

It is important for local representatives such as Councillor Nash, who, it is to be hoped, will be with us some day in the House, that Louth is properly and democratically represented in the DTA area.  I warmly support amendment No. 4 and intend to move amendment No. 5 when I can.</p>

        <speech by="#AengusOSnodaighSF" eId="spk_878">
          <from>Deputy Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_1299">There is a logic to Deputy O'Dowd's amendment, given the substantial growth that has taken place in the area of south Louth in particular.  I do not think the people of south Louth would be too concerned about coming under the umbrella of Dublin, but if need be we could change the title to the Greater Dublin Transport Authority Bill.  Given the major growth in that area, of which the Minister is aware, and the growth in commuter traffic, particularly from Drogheda but also from places such as Dundalk, the amendment is logical.  Why wait until such time as the Minister is required to designate areas, as he is entitled to do when this Bill is passed?  Why not do it now?  At the very least we should be looking at south Louth, but there are other major commuter areas.  Any decision that changes transport arrangements in Dublin will affect a number of neighbouring counties, or parts of them.  We should make sure these counties are not an afterthought.  If we go along with this, Louth will become an afterthought for the Dublin transport authority.  In fact, the infrastructure in Louth serves Dublin in many ways.  We are not talking about small boreens and the like but about main thoroughfares.  This is about infrastructure and planning of transport for the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1300">We have waited a long time for this Bill and there is agreement that it is needed.  However, it is interesting that there seems to be cross-party support for widening its remit slightly, perhaps to reflect what used to be the Pale.  We still seem to have the Pale surrounding Dublin, albeit in a different context.  If we draw a semicircle on the map extending 50 miles from the centre of Dublin, with Dundalk at the top, this represents the commuter belt, which has been identified by various Government strategies over the years as containing the major commuter hubs of Dublin.  They are the areas that should be included in the remit of a transport authority that is trying to address the transport needs of a growing city.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">I support Deputy Broughan's amendment as it covers the whole of Louth and not just as far as Drogheda, given that the M1 now serves areas from Dundalk southwards.  We may in future consider extending the remit of the transport authority as far as Portlaoise or Carlow, but those arguments have not been made.  The argument is being made that one of the biggest commuter belts, which extends from north Dublin as far as north Louth, be included in the area covered by the DTA.  I hope the Minister will give consideration to accepting the amendment at this late stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_879" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
          <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_1302">It may surprise people to know that I do not disagree with points made about the closeness of Drogheda and south Louth to the greater Dublin area and the population growth and development that have taken place.  That is why we have included specifically in the Bill the power to extend the greater Dublin area.  Section 54 states that the Minister may designate bus and rail services originating or ending outside the GDA as being part of the GDA transport system.  This is designed to cover some of the points made by Deputy O'Dowd about firms such as Matthews Coach Hire and, indeed, Bus Éireann services that originate outside the GDA.  Thus, the Bill confers the power to designate transport services as GDA transport services.  Section 63 provides that the Minister may extend the functions of the DTA with regard to integrated ticketing, fares and public transport information to public transport service areas outside the GDA.  These provisions are as far as we can go.</p>
          <p eId="para_1303">I do not want to be political about this, but what the Deputies are asking me to do would be profoundly undemocratic, although I know they do not mean it that way.  As I said, I am not making a political point.  As I was at the Cabinet table at the time, I know that representatives from County Louth fought very hard to ensure Louth would be included in the BMW region.  Many people were surprised it ended up in this region, including some of my constituents.  Thus, Louth is not just a different county but part of a different region.  A planning system was established in the Planning and Development Act 2000 which includes regional planning guidelines.  This is integrated regional planning — we have the national spatial strategy and, on the next level down, the regional planning guidelines.</p>
          <p eId="para_1304">I do not disagree with the sentiment that it would probably be a good idea to include Louth, but we cannot divide a county because this would result in a whole raft of difficulties with regard to county development plans, with one set of criteria applying at one end and another set at the other end.  We just cannot divide it.  Thus, we can only consider Deputy Broughan's proposal that the entire county of Louth be included in the GDA.  I have no major problem with that, but the decision should not be made by three Members of this House.  I genuinely do not think it is a decision for us to make.  As Minister, I do not feel I can make that decision because the local government system and the regional authorities are under the aegis of another Minister.  It is right and proper, particularly in the context of local government reforms being discussed, to ask the local authorities concerned to move from the BMW region to the mid-east region.  We could then slide them into the DTA.  That is the process needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1305">Deputy O'Dowd makes a convincing case and I am not arguing against the integrated planning needed.  This Bill relates to what should be standard practice for any local authority in drawing up a development plan.  I appreciate that the Deputies opposite have acknowledged this.  Transport services should be integral to county development plans, let alone this Bill.  Deputies have argued their case strongly and while I do not disagree in principle, the amendment is not the way to do it.  It would not be right and democratic to do so in this manner.  If Louth County Council wishes to take this route and become part of the Dublin transport authority, I would have no objection.  It would make much sense, but not in the way proposed.</p>

        <!--Fix-->
        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_880">
          <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_1306">The weakness in the Bill is that it does not relate to a national transport authority.  All of the problems we encounter stem from the geographical area to be covered by the authority.  The problem is of the Minister's making because the cities of Cork, Limerick, Waterford and Galway all have problems with transport, yet there is no joined-up thinking.  I suggest the Minister needs a national transport authority.  He would not then need to ask Louth County Council to move from region A to region B.  A national transport authority would mean the county council could ensure proper planning and development in the county, something that will not happen under the Bill.  The same goes for Cork, Limerick and Galway.  Limiting the Bill in this way is a major weakness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1307">I welcome that section 54 allows for transport services from outside the DTA region to be designated as DTA transport services.  It is important that the DTA has the power to fix the price of travel, particularly rail travel, as there are serious inequalities in this sector.  When one leaves Balbriggan by rail, one enters an area with an entirely different fare structure.  Under the Bill, lower fares will apply in respect of services to Balbriggan, Laytown and Gormanstown but not to places to the north.  If the Minister designated transport services that originate in Dublin to County Louth, it would make a big difference to commuters who want a decent, proper equitable fare structure.  There is no reason people should pay twice as much to get to Dublin from Drogheda and Laytown as they do from Balbriggan.  It does not make sense.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_881">
          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_1308">The Minister has repeated the argument made about the problem with the structure of the regional authorities.  Will this continue into the future with regard to the BMW region?  After the Lisbon treaty referendum, perhaps there will be a new battle covering the entire country in the next round of Structural Fund grants at European level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309">The Drogheda area is expanding at a colossal rate and many are dependent on public transport to get to Dublin.  Some Members may make this connection this evening, as they did this morning.  Trains passing through Balbriggan tend to be packed.  It seems wrong-headed to exclude the important growing city of Drogheda and the south County Louth region from the essential redevelopment that will take place in the Dublin region.  Perhaps the entire county should be included.  My colleague from Sinn Féin mentioned the commuter belt.  If one looks at the map, one will see that the Minister's county has a small coastline.  County Louth almost touches the Dublin county boundary, yet it is the only such county not to be included.  It is not as though County Meath has a coastline of 50 miles — the reality is that County Louth is in the same position as Couinty Wicklow and west and south Kildare.  We should reconsider this aspect of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1310">The Minister mentioned sections 63 and 54 which grant him important powers.  At what stage will he be able to initiate a process to allow borough councils or local authorities in the County Louth region, if they express an interest, to come within the remit of the DTA?  How can this be facilitated?  When I represented the Dublin mid-east regional authority, we had close connections with County Louth, although it was not a member of our organisation.</p>

          <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_1311">I have touched on many points and noted what the Deputies said.  The procedure is that local authorities in an area must first decide if they want to take a particular route and make this known to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, and me.  A decision would then be made.  A consequence of authorities being included in the GDA might be that they would have to leave the BMW region to ensure coherence in the regional planning guidelines.  Nothing more formal than a decision by the local authority and an application would be required.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_883">
          <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_1312">I wish to return to the analysis of population growth in the region.  I refer the Minister to the report compiled by the HSE on the location of the regional hospital.  The maps are included on pages 12 and 18 of the report.  I could not bring them with me today because when one prints them over a certain size, one cannot see them.  The report examines population figures in 2006, 2015 and 2025.  The area around Drogheda is colour coded red, meaning a population density in excess of 239.  The rest of County Meath and south Louth, particularly the area around Drogheda, is colour coded yellow, meaning that it is the next most intensive region of population growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">I do not seek to bring the entire county of Louth under the auspices of the DTA because views in Dundalk are different from those in Drogheda.  There are also different expectations of population growth.  The key to the Dublin Transport Authority is development.  It is clear that there will be massive growth by 2025 in the areas north and south of the Boyne.  We ask that the area north of the Boyne come under the auspices of the DTA.  If councillors and local authorities are asked to leave one region and join another, other issues will arise.  I do not know what the position on the CLÁR programme is in the Cooley Peninsula but rural areas in north County Louth would be concerned that joining the DTA would result in the loss of benefits under other programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314">The reality is that we cannot use the fact that a county is within the boundary of the BMW region as a bargaining chip when deciding whether a certain part of that country deserves to have proper transport planning.  We support proper transport planning, which is the important principle that is at the core of this Bill.  It has nothing to do with counties — we are talking about growth centres.  The population statistics are self-evident.  There is no difference between the parts of south Louth north and south of the River Boyne.  I refer to electoral areas like Drogheda east and Drogheda west, which will encounter problems if this change is not made.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">A great deal of planning was done in advance of this Bill.  Issues such as population growth, the needs of certain areas and various transport matters were examined.  This legislation should put them strongly at the heart of commuter life in growing towns like Drogheda.  However, the Minister is setting such matters aside.  I do not think his argument, which is that part of County Louth will have to leave the BMW area if this amendment is accepted, stands up.  I do not think people want the county to leave the BMW region.  However, they want their houses to be served by public transport.  They want to walk, cycle and use public transport.  They will not get such services if we do not amend this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">I wish to repeat my criticism of the Minister's approach.  If we had a national transport authority Bill, it is obvious that the major cities would opt to be included in it.  Areas like County Louth would be part of the national transport authority.  None of the issues relating to the BMW region would arise.  We would have decent public transport options.  We would definitely not have developer-led planning.  The Minister is putting down a marker.  I am not being personal when I say that I utterly reject what he is saying.  He is not giving adequate weight to the strong, well-researched, clear and independently assessed arguments which are being made.  South Louth will be a nightmare for transport planning as a result of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317">I am sure the Minister is aware that it was suggested some time ago, as part of the strategy for the port of Drogheda, that a northern cross route be developed in the town.  The entire area north of Drogheda needs a proper road network.  Such a network is not being developed by the NRA because there is no national road in the area.  We need to invest in road infrastructure if Drogheda is to grow.  We now have a mechanism for that, more or less.  It is critical that the future transport needs of the area be considered if it is to develop.  Is it right and proper that the local authority has to go cap in hand to all the land owners?  That is what happened.  A properly planned road network was needed, but those involved could not get a VAT refund.  The local authority asked developers to pay for the north Drogheda development plan.  It said it would pick the consultants if the developers paid them.  That is what happened.  I am not saying there was anything wrong with it, but it did happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318">At present, local authorities have to go cap in hand to developers when they are deciding what is going to happen — where roads will be developed and who will make the contributions, etc.  There is a voluntary relationship between the local authority and the developers.  Under this legislation, however, the Dublin transport authority will tell the developers what they must do and how they must do it.  The developers will have to go ahead and do it.  I am talking about the transport needs of the south Louth area, such as the roads which will have to be linked to the national network in the future.  There will be total and absolute chaos if south Louth is not in the Dublin transport authority area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319">I would like to conclude by speaking about some of the other issues in the east Meath and south Louth area.  People in the east of the town are unable to get to the other side of the Rover Boyne without going through the town centre.  The new bridge that is needed has been planned since 1962.  If Meath County Council feels that a bridge is needed for economic reasons, is viable in terms of the local transport network and will facilitate A, B or C, it may state that it wants such a bridge to be developed.  The authorities on the other side of the river will not have the funds to provide any money towards the bridge, however, if they are not in the Dublin transport authority area.  If the Dublin transport authority decides that a major piece of infrastructure such as a new bridge in Drogheda is needed, its writ will extend throughout Meath County Council's administrative area — to the edge of the River Boyne at Mornington — but it will not cross the river to Baltray or adjacent areas in County Louth.  How does the Minister propose to deal with this anomaly?  He is losing a golden opportunity here.</p>

The key problem with State agencies is the lack of accountability to this House.  The Labour Party and all colleagues are very anxious that the Dublin transport authority will not become a HSE on wheels.  This is everybody's great fear.

          <p eId="para_1456">This is the most important goal.</p>
          <p eId="para_1457">Amendment No. 11 seeks, in page 15, between lines 13 and 14, to secure the provision of full strategic policy and operational information for the Minister, the Members of the Oireachtas and the Joint Committee on Transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_1458">Amendment No. 57 seeks to extend this provision by ensuring that guidelines the Minister might lay down for the Dublin transport authority will be laid before and approved by each House of the Oireachtas.  Amendment No. 58 is similar in that it seeks that documents laid before the Oireachtas should be approved by both the Dáil and Seanad.</p>
          <p eId="para_1459">Amendment No. 62 is the most important of the grouped amendments.  It seeks to insert the following in page 36, between lines 15 and 16: "The Minister is fully and directly accountable to Dáil Éireann through standard Dáil procedures including oral and written questions and all forms of debate for all policy, strategic decisions and financial accounts of the DTA."  This is the core amendment of the series.  We want to ensure the authority will be accountable to this House through the Minister.</p>
          <p eId="para_1460">To date, all Deputies, including Government backbenchers, have had a very bad experience regarding accountability.  We have experienced tortuous circumstances regarding the responsibility of the Minister for Health and Children to the House in respect of the HSE.  We have tried to raise vital health issues morning after morning over the past four years but have been prevented from doing so and rebuffed by the Ceann Comhairle and his predecessor.  We have been prevented from having the Minister for Health and Children answer our questions in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1461">This has happened in respect of many other agencies, particularly the National Roads Authority, NRA.  We have frequently been refused permission to ask the Minister for Transport urgent questions on transport and road infrastructure in the House in so far as those questions concerned policy pertaining to the NRA.  The main problem I have had in this regard, with which the Acting Chairman, Deputy Ardagh, will be familiar, concerns the Dublin Port tunnel.  I have endlessly tried to raise the issue of safety in the tunnel, which issue has been highlighted by RTE, particularly "Prime Time", and newspapers such as the <i>Evening Herald</i> and the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  I have tried to raise the issue of the accountability of the NRA, Dublin City Council and Transroute International to the House but, time and again, my oral and written questions have been refused on the grounds that they concerned strategic policy and operational matters of the NRA.</p>
          <p eId="para_1462">This must not be allowed to continue in respect of State agencies.  I ask the Minister, through my proposed amendments, to break with the past and make all agencies responsible to this House.  The Taoiseach has already outlined that he wants a rationalisation of agencies.  He does not want a number of agencies performing virtually the same task and, in a sense, invigilating the same area of the economy.  Their doing so does not seem to make sense and, in the current economic circumstances, seems insane.  Along with the required efficiencies, we need full responsibility to Dáil Éireann.  The Dublin transport authority must be fully responsible thereto and we must not allow for the circumstances that pertain in respect of the NRA, HSE and so many other agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1463">In other democracies, in Europe and further afield, there is no question but that all state agencies are generally accountable to their parliaments.  Famously in the House of Commons, the Secretary of State for Transport, Ruth Kelly, the counterpart of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, answers on all aspects of transport policy.  She provides road safety figures directly to the UK Parliament and does not direct Members to the UK equivalent of the Road Safety Authority.  She answers directly to the UK Parliament on key issues because it is clear that the death rate in the transport sector is a fundamental issue that affects the people and their public representatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1464">My amendments seek to establish a definitive break with the bad and undemocratic behaviour that has obtained in the past.  They require the Minister to accept full responsibility for reporting to this House.  The Minister referred to operational matters but nobody wants the minutiae of operational issues to be debated in the House <i>ad infinitum</i>.  This sometimes happens in respect of the health service because we cannot have discussions on major policy decisions on health.</p>
          <p eId="para_1465">On the question of transport, we do not want direct operational issues to be raised but we do not want to be fobbed off in respect of policy, major developments, crucial safety issues and key infrastructure, such as the Dublin Port tunnel.  We want the Minister to be able to answer in the House for all agencies, including the Dublin transport authority, the NRA and Road Safety Authority.  If we do not achieve this tonight in regard to the Dublin transport authority, we will have to do so in the future.  Some future Government, which I hope will include my party, will try to do so and secure full accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1466">The Minister should break with the undemocratic regime that developed over recent years and allowed agencies to feel they are laws unto themselves and can do whatever they want.  There was criticism of a State agency other than the Dublin transport authority today with regard to financial problems.  We want agencies to be accountable to Members, the people's representatives.  I ask, therefore, that the grouped amendments be accepted.  Amendment No. 62, in particular, codifies very briefly what should be the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_1467">The Minister may refer to the role of the Ceann Comhairle and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  I am a member of that committee and am aware, as a Whip of the Labour Party, that there are ongoing discussions on reforming the structure of this House.  However, the subject to which I refer does not really concern the reform of the structure of the House but the Dublin transport authority and the Minister's reporting thereon to the House.  We have the power to introduce the amendments to ensure the Minister will discuss in the House directives, guidelines and major policy decisions pertaining to agencies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1468">I accept the Minister has come before the House a number of times such as, for example, when he came before the House to discuss the recent wildcat rail strike, after the Ceann Comhairle had kindly given Members time to debate the issue.  While I welcome such debates, the fundamental issue is that the agency must be responsible, through the Minister, to the House at all times in all debates and in respect of all questions without any equivocation or dodging.  My colleague, Deputy Durkan, is to be commended on his raising of this issue on the Order of Business many times.  When he and I were communications spokespersons for our respective parties, we used to come into the House with sheaves of disallowed questions regarding agencies under the remit of the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who then was Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  We simply were unable to get answers to questions which did not pertain to detailed daily operational matters but to major policy issues.  The Minister was not prepared to talk to us and, to some extent, the Ceann Comhairle protected him and the aforementioned Department.  It was neither acceptable nor democratic.  Such practices should be changed through the acceptance of these amendments.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_889">
          <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_1469">These amendments are highly important and go to the heart of the Bill.  While the heart of the Bill should be accountability, transparency and openness, there is no evidence that will happen in this case.  As Deputy Broughan noted, most people are worried about the possible creation of another HSE.  The Dublin transport authority, DTA, will have unbelievable powers, all of which I consider it to be entitled to because it will make decisions on the future of the greater Dublin area, including the counties contained within its remit.  Many problems will arise in those areas and highly controversial decisions will be taken in respect of issues, including planning, the insistence on transport options, land use strategy planning, rows between local authorities and the DTA and the role of An Bord Pleanála which could be extremely important in this regard.  The Minister has stated An Bord Pleanála will be obliged to dovetail its decisions with whatever DTA transport strategy is extant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1470">Moreover, there is another side to the argument.  I refer to the scandal of the problem regarding integrated ticketing which has continued for approximately ten years and has cost between €20 million and €30 million.  There has been no accountability and no one knows what is going on, except for those involved.  Moreover, the taxpayer is funding this appalling mess and waste of money.  Another point that has arisen concerns the question of turf wars between service providers.  For example, the Railway Procurement Agency and Iarnród Éireann could fight over a plot of land in my constituency and a row broke out at Broadstone in which the Minister intervened to provide a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1471">Even more fundamental issues concern the board.  One problem I envisage is that two senior executives of the DTA, together with the chief executive, will be members of the board.  Consequently, three board members will be employed by, or executives of, the DTA.  What would happen in the event of a major transport strike issue or a major problem regarding industrial relations or human resources and one of the aforementioned directors was on the board?  While I will not use the term, "vested interest", I simply make the point that there will be interests on the board at times when significant conflicts could arise within the DTA in respect of the opinions of the board's executives and what might be a greater public good.  Such a conflict could arise and conflicts will take place.  How can one ensure accountability and transparency about what is going on?</p>
          <p eId="para_1472">As for the rail strike in Cork, the truth is that it was the Ceann Comhairle who gave permission for the debate in the House.  While I do not suggest the Minister would not have come before it, given the manner in which the system in the House operates, the Ceann Comhairle makes such decisions.  The difficultly I perceive is that this organisation is not sufficiently transparent.  In respect of all aspects of transport, there should be no diminution or change in the Minister's accountability to the House regarding issues such as rail strikes.  What will be the position on the tabling of parliamentary questions?  They should not be referred, as are questions directed towards the HSE, into never-never land, from which one may receive a reply in one, two or three weeks and, in some cases, never.</p>

          <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
          <p eId="para_1474">The questions are well padded.</p>
          <p eId="para_1475">Accountability in respect of parliamentary questions will be highly important.  The same principle should apply as operates with regard to parliamentary questions, whereby the Minister makes his response within a set number of days.  While Adjournment debates are held at the discretion of the Ceann Comhairle, there should be no change to the procedure for Adjournment debates in respect of transport matters.  In other words, I envisage that the Ceann Comhairle would not and could not state such issues were not matters for the House.  In addition, requests to adjourn the Dáil Standing Order 32 which generally are not allowed and private notice questions concern highly important issues on which Members must receive assurances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1476">In fairness, the Minister indicated on Committee Stage his consent in respect of many of these matters.  However, for this Bill, Members must step forward together, learn from the mistakes of the HSE and provide for the accountability and transparency that are badly needed, particularly with regard to transport.  As Deputies or Ministers, the last comment one wishes to make is that one has no role or power regarding these issues.  Major controversies could arise in respect of park and ride facilities and the location of railway stations.  The DTA must be accountable to the Dáil for general policy issues and, <i>in extremis</i>, when issues arise such as strikes.  While no one wishes to interfere with its internal affairs, when serious and significant policy issues arise, they ought to be raised in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1477">The Minister may reply to the effect that while he does not disagree with Members, they can raise such issues at meetings of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Transport.  However, I do not believe that to be adequate or sufficient.  Many of the major players appear before the joint committee.  For example, the Dublin Airport Authority appears before it for a few hours, as does Bus Éireann.  A calendar of events has developed in which one has an hour or two to query the executives on issues of importance.  However, the primacy of the House, particularly in respect of transport planning and conflicts that arise therein, should rest and remain here.  I hope this will be the case.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelDempsey" eId="spk_892" as="#Minister_for_Transport">
          <from>Deputy Noel Dempsey</from>
          <p eId="para_1478">The series of amendments under discussion is not necessary in the context in which I operate.  Once the Bill has been enacted, the Minister for Transport will be accountable to the Houses of the Oireachtas in respect of the DTA in accordance with the normal arrangements made under Dáil and Seanad Standing Orders.  Under the aforementioned Standing Orders, the Minister is answerable to the Dáil regarding the public affairs connected with the Department of Transport and the bodies under its aegis, as well as matters of administration for which I am officially responsible to the Government in respect of Government policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1479">I will go through the amendments in this group.  On amendment No. 6, the Deputy should note that section 7 provides that any regulation made by a Minister for Transport under the DTA Bill must be laid before each House of the Oireachtas and that either House may, by a resolution passed within 21 sitting days after the date of the regulation, annul the regulation.  Consequently, were I to make regulations, they would have to be brought before the Houses which would have the right to discuss them, annul them or confirm them, if they so wished.</p>
          <p eId="para_1480">In respect of amendment No. 11, I am fully satisfied it would be inappropriate to insert a requirement for the DTA to provide operational information for the Minister or the Oireachtas.  The DTA should be allowed to get on with its job, while remaining accountable for the decisions it makes.  There should not be someone looking over his or her shoulder every step of the way.  I am satisfied that such an approach would not achieve results.  In fact, it would probably inhibit good decision making and organisational leadership.  Operational matters should be just that.  That is not to say that a Deputy, who feels that a certain part of the greater Dublin area is not being adequately served due to the policies of the DTA, has no right to raise that issue by using any of the various means to which we referred earlier.  Deputies have a right to bring the DTA before the joint committee, question the Minister on the issue, put special notice questions down and so on.  All these mechanisms are available to Members, but I do not think it is a productive use of this House to discuss the timetables of bus companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_1481">When enacted, the Bill will provide for the publication by the DTA of its draft transport strategy.  It is the basis for everything it will do and is effectively its policy document.  As Minister, I will outline the broad strategy and the policy I want implemented and the DTA will deal with the implementation process.  That draft policy will effectively be the strategic policy over a period of 12 to 20 years.  The DTA will have to prepare an integrated implementation plan to follow on from that strategy.  That is subject to approval by the Minister and I will be accountable to the House for it.  I am not too sure what advantage would accrue from requiring the DTA to provide full strategic policy information to the Minister or the Oireachtas.  The DTA should be allowed to get on with its business in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1482">With regard to amendments Nos. 57, 58 and 81, it is important that the Minister be able to issue guidelines and give directions as and when he or she sees fit.  He or she should have regard to Government policy and to any other relevant policy considerations, including a report from an Oireachtas committee.  However, sometimes a Minister may have to make quick decisions because of something an authority might contemplate doing.  The authority could have made decisions and spent money before the Minister got through an unwieldy process, so I believe the amendments would have the opposite effect to that claimed by the Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1483">In the case of amendment No. 62, the Minister is accountable for the DTA in accordance with the normal arrangement under Dáil and Seanad Standing Orders.  However, section 32 of the Bill provides that the DTA's account must be audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, while section 41 provides that the DTA's chief executive must give evidence to the Committee of Public Accounts concerning those accounts and the general economy and efficiency of the authority in the use of its resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1484">While I accept the intent and the principle of Deputy's Broughan's amendments, they are adequately catered for in the Bill.  There are many sections in the Bill where the Minister has a direct role and is accountable to this House for how he or she discharges that role.  Section 12 deals with the transport strategy.  Section 13 deals with the integrated implementation plan.  The board and the authority are in section 14, while section 17 deals with the advisory council and section 19 deals with the appointment of the CEO.  DTA staff and superannuation schemes are in sections 20 and 21.  Subsidiaries, resources, policy direction, policy guidelines, advice services, Exchequer funding and borrowing requirements are in sections 24 to 30, respectively.  The annual report is in section 32 and disclosure of interests is in section 35, in which a Minister may remove a member of the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1485">Sections 44, 45, 49, 52, 54, 62, 63, 64, 68, 73, 74, 81, 102, 112 and 113 all contain direct intervention powers by the Minister to prevent the DTA from going in the direction suggested by Deputy Broughan.  It is a fundamentally different Bill from that which created the HSE.  For that reason, I am satisfied the Bill is sufficient to make sure that everybody is accountable to this House and its committees, including the DTA and the Minister.</p>

        <speech by="#TommyBroughan" eId="spk_893">
          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_1486">We have to judge people by their deeds and not by what they say.  Judging this Minister in this Department and in the previous Department, the record shows that he has refused to answer to the House for strategic policy matters regarding agencies.  I have copies of dozens of questions for which the Ceann Comhairle, probably on the instruction of the then Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of Transport, refused to allow an answer.  Agencies are unaccountable to this House.  It is very frustrating and is the reason we have so much hassle on the Order of Business.  We just cannot get answers to questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1487">In his response to these amendments on Committee Stage, the Minister referred to the danger of trying to micro-manage an agency outside this House.  However, none of us wants to micro-manage an agency.  Just like any company, the board of directors allows the executive get on with its job.  In a sense, we are like the board of directors for this country and we have the right to detailed reports about strategic policy making by agencies.  The Minister states that this Bill is very different from that which created the HSE, but the reality is that there are striking similarities.  Before the advent of the HSE, there were decentralised bodies in which there was a large elected component.  There were faults in the delivery of services by these health boards, but at least there was a democratic element.  Many Members were on those boards, although I never was, and they were able to see at first hand how their particular health board operated.  The reality since then——</p>

          <p eId="para_1489">Yes.  The reality since then is that the agency has not acted responsibly.  I have often asked questions about agencies covering a wide range of issues, especially the NRA.  I gave the example of the port tunnel as it is so critical for constituents that I represent.  Its cost and safety features should be discussed in this House, given their critical importance.  I have not got any answers.  Sometimes there has been a point blank refusal to answer, rather than the usual anodyne non-answer that we often receive when we put down written parliamentary questions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1490">Accountability to the House is critical.  On the first of these amendments, amendment No. 6, it is important to insert in the section that the Minister shall be "fully and directly accountable to Dáil Éireann . . . . for the regulations" for the simple reason that such a reference is not included.  Amendment No. 11 is similar.  The Minister mentioned the implementation plan.  Obviously, there will be an input at that stage but it is not mentioned in the Bill.  Amendment No. 11 merits consideration at least.</p>
          <p eId="para_1491">Of the other amendments included in the group, in respect of amendments Nos. 57 and No. 58, I do not see why the guidelines should not have to be approved by the Oireachtas.  The critical amendment is amendment No. 62 which states that the Minister should be fully responsible to Dáil Éireann for the DTA.  I ask him to break with the past and provide for a new regime for agencies under the auspices of the Oireachtas and responsible to the people.  We should do it differently this time.  This time next year let us not come into House to ask the Ceann Comhairle why questions about the DTA had not been approved.  Amendment No. 81 which is also included in the group and which I forgot to mention initially is important in terms of accountability to the House as regards direct award contracts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1492">The Minister is not alone with regard to his track record.  Other Ministers behave in the same way.  I contend that the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, has the worst record in the House for answering questions about basic issues within the remit of the health service.  I wonder why we have a Department of Health and Children.  I have stated to Professor Drumm that my fundamental problem with his office is that he never stood for election.  Effectively, he is the Minister.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Ardagh, might sympathise with that view in private because most Members do.</p>
          <p eId="para_1493">I ask the Minister to break with the past and make the DTA different by making it responsible to the House.  I ask him to accept the first of the amendments, amendment No. 6.</p>

          <p eId="para_1497">Will the DTA be directly accountable through the Minister?  If we ask him a parliamentary question about a new railway station proposed by the DTA, for instance, who will answer it?  Will it be the DTA or will it be the DTA through the Minister?

          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_1636">In general terms this group of amendments seeks to put important protections for transport workers directly into the Bill.  Given that transport workers are among the most important of safety-critical workers in our economy, responsible day in and day out for the lives of tens of thousands of our fellow citizens, these amendments seek to make the role and position of workers stronger.  They also look to make the Minister more accountable for their protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_1637">Amendment No. 7 asks on page 14, line 21, after "the provision of a well-functioning, attractive, integrated and safe public transport system for all users", to insert as a general objective of the Dublin transport authority the phrase "including the upholding of the highest safety and professional standards by all operators involved in the provision of public transport services".  When we discussed this section on Committee Stage, there was reflection on a number of occasions in the past when some of those standards were allowed to slip.  Clearly, it was most appalling at the horrendous crash at Kentstown in County Meath and the dreadful incident on Wellington Quay a number of years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_1638">This amendment seeks to, once and for all, lay down a very basic structure for the protection of safety-critical workers and ensure the highest safety and professional standards by all operators involved in the provision of public transport services.  It relates also to the case I know the Minister found when he entered the Department, whereby operators in the public transport area were responsible for safety standards themselves.  The system we have become used to for our private cars and other vehicles is not replicated in the commercial area of public transport services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1639">In particular, people were effectively invigilating safety standards on their own, although I know the RSA has sought to address the matter.  The Minister has addressed it partially in his amendments to the Bill, which coincide with one of my own amendments relating to the granting of full powers to transport officers to operate on the roadside.  This would prevent cases we have had in the past whereby some HGVs and public service vehicles were not kept to the highest possible safety standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1640">As the Minister knows, we have learned this from systems operated by road safety authorities in the UK, which found a couple of years ago that half the Irish vehicles stopped were deficient or had safety problems.  We have seen recent efforts by our own RSA and the Northern Ireland safety authority that also revealed major problems.  The amendment seeks to add an important phrase to the general objectives of the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1641">Amendments Nos. 8 and 67 are fundamental from the perspective of my party and the labour movement.  Amendment No. 8 seeks to add to the principal functions of the authority, which include important issues such as strategic planning of transport, integrated accessible public transport and fares and the range of invigilation of services which will be the DTA's responsibility.  I seek to address some of the key issues which have arisen with this Bill and European legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1642">I have in front of me some of the past legislation in this area, with the most important piece of legislation underpinning the DTA Bill.  This is Regulation (EC) No. 1370/2007 of the European Council and Parliament, from 23 October 2007.  In the preamble to the regulation, the key elements of a public transport system in any of the 27 member countries of the European Union are laid down.  There are a number of elements which provide for competition in public transport systems and services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1643">One of these elements stipulates that in the provision of public transport services, it is not a key concern of the European Union, first and foremost, whether those services are carried out by public or private operators.  In other words, the European Union is effectively neutral on the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1644">There are a number of other elements in the preamble of this European legislation, which has highly stressed competition.  That is reflected to some extent in the public service contract in the Bill.  At the same time, the legislation includes a number of references to the rights of transport workers, whether in the public transport service or private sectors.  As a result, I seek to include this directly in the Bill through this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1645">The amendment inserts a new paragraph (<i>g</i>), which would state:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1646">establish social and qualitative criteria to maintain and raise quality standards for public service obligations with regard to minimal working conditions, passenger rights, the needs of persons with reduced mobility, environmental protection, the security of passengers and employees as well as collective agreement obligations, and other rules and agreements concerning workplaces and social protection at the place where service is provided; In order to ensure transparent and comparable terms of competition between operators and to avert the risk of social dumping, the DTA should be free to impose specific social and service quality standards with due regard to recital 17 of Regulation (EC) No. 1370/2007 of 23 October 2007,</p>
          <p eId="para_1647">I have sought to insert that important section, recital 17 of the preamble of this European regulation on the protection of workers' rights, into the legislation.  To have the full spirit of the European legislation, it is important to have, along with references to competition and greater competitive mobility in European, the other side of the legislation, which is recital 17, and I would like that inserted.</p>
          <p eId="para_1648">In addition, I wish to insert a new paragraph (<i>h</i>), which adds to the principal functions of the authority.  It states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1649">maintain the highest standard of working conditions, including fair and reasonable salaries for all transport workers including those established by collective agreement obligations. The Minister shall request every two years that the Labour Court undertakes a review of conditions of employment in the public transport sector and sets out its recommendations for the appropriate minimum conditions of employment for the sector which will be accepted by the Minister and laid as an order before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Following 21 days this order will take affect and the DTA will make arrangements to adjust the terms of their contracts with public transport operators to give effect to the order.</p>
          <p eId="para_1650">In this case I am seeking to ensure that in any contracts awarded under this legislation, the spirit of paragraph (<i>g</i>) would also be directly reflected in the legislation and the Labour Court would have a special role in the protection of the rights and conditions of transport workers.  It would be a fundamental requirement of the Bill that the Labour Court would have this role, every two years, to invigilate those salaries and conditions.</p>

          <from>Deputy Thomas P. Broughan</from>
          <p eId="para_1651">I wish to share time with Deputy Kathleen Lynch.</p>
          <p eId="para_1652">I commend the Fine Gael Party on introducing this critical motion.  Two weeks ago in the House, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and I outlined the horrendous position facing fishing families, including in Howth in my constituency, Greencastle, Burtonport, Killybegs, Rossaveal, Dingle, Castletownbere, Union Hall, Dunmore East, Kilmore Quay, Clogherhead and smaller ports, of which there are 30 to 35 in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1653">Fishermen cannot afford to go to sea because the price of fuel has increased by as much as 50% in the past four or five months and an increasing number of them face the bleak prospect of unemployment.  The worryingly high level of cheap imported fish from Africa and Asia and the historically destructive impact of the Common Fisheries Policy quota system have also had a devastating effect on fishing communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1654">More recently, fishermen have felt under siege from the new regime of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority based in Clonakilty.  I have received many e-mails illustrating this point, with the actions of the new authority described by some of my constituents as akin to waging a war of attrition against fishermen and attempting to criminalise a whole community.  The Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, introduced the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority Bill and criminal penalties for what are essentially administrative failures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1655">Irish fishermen continually see foreign vessels fishing with impunity in Irish waters.  In my previous role as fisheries spokesperson of the Labour Party, I and my colleagues on the Joint Committee on Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, as it was known then, invigilated the Commodore of the Naval Service.  It emerged from our meeting that Spanish, French and Dutch fishing fleets operate according to one law, while a different law applies to the Irish fleet, in other words, our fishermen are treated much more harshly than foreign fishermen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1656">Many fishermen and their families believe they have no option but to accept the recent decommissioning proposals, for which €43 million has been allocated.  It is heartbreaking for families with a fishing tradition stretching back for generations to decide no longer to put to sea.</p>
          <p eId="para_1657">The Labour Party has a longstanding view of the fishing industry.  In the early 1970s, for example, the great Justin Keating and others in the party believed the Common Fisheries Policy would be a disaster for Ireland.  Unfortunately, this element of our relationship with Europe continues to require invigilation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1658">In recent weeks, the Minister had an opportunity to make a case on behalf of Irish fishermen and their families.  The outcome of last week's Fisheries Council meeting was greeted with intense disappointment.  It appears we must wait until 15 July at the earliest before positive steps will be taken.  The Taoiseach, Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, and Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Tony Killeen, failed yet again to deliver for Irish fishermen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1659">There is no time for prevarication.  With fuel prices crippling the industry and damaging the prospects of as many as 50,000 people who depend in some way on sea fisheries, short-term support is needed.  I fail to understand the reason the Minister chose to rebuff the request by the Federation of Irish Fishermen to introduce some short-term measures.  It was an incomprehensible decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_1660">The Minister's lethargy and inaction are in marked contrast with the conduct of President Sarkozy who will visit Ireland next week.  Speaking in a French fishing port, the President stated the French fishing tradition was an integral part of the French nation which would be defended, come what may.  Unfortunately, Government incompetence on the Lisbon treaty and, subsequently, on the fisheries issue has allowed circumstances to arise in which our maritime tradition, which is integral to the nation, is in a desperate state.  The Government has failed to act.</p>
          <p eId="para_1661">I ask the Minister to outline what positive measures will be taken.  Money must be put on the table as part of a vigorous response to the problem.  It is pointless to state decisions will be taken in two or three weeks when the House will be in recess and the fishing industry in tatters.  It is time for action and the Minister must live up to his responsibilities.</p>

          <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_1662">I congratulate the Fine Gael Party on introducing the motion and thank my colleague, Deputy Broughan, for affording me speaking time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1663">Those working at sea are employed in one of the most regulated sectors but among the poorest working conditions in the world.  Approximately 12,000 people work in the fishing industry in Ireland.  This figure, which includes those who work at sea, on the quayside and in fish factories and processing facilities, is not to be sneezed at.  Ireland's fishing ports include towns such as Union Hall, Kilmore Quay, Castletownbere, Kinsale, Youghal, Ballycotton and Killybegs, all of which are in peripheral areas with few other industries.  For this reason, it is vital we take seriously the crisis facing the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1664">One does not often see fishermen blockading ports and they do not tie up their boats unless absolutely necessary, whether because quotas have been filled or it is pointless to go to sea to fish a livelihood.  We must take seriously recent actions by fishermen by offering an aid package.  It is no longer good enough that our main competitors, France and Spain, provide state aid, while Irish fishermen do not receive any assistance.  We would all prefer if, under a common European policy on state aid, assistance would be provided on equal terms across the fishing industry.  Failing this, however, it is the Government's duty to step up to the plate and take responsibility, as the French and Spanish Governments have done.</p>
          <p eId="para_1665">Recent events have provided the first test of the negotiating skills at EU level of two new Ministers.  Unfortunately, neither the Minister nor his Minister of State has done well.  We remain hopeful, however, that something can be done and the Minister and Minister of State will enter new negotiations.  It is a widely held view in the fishing industry that fisheries were the victim of the Common Agricultural Policy and formed part of a trade off in the early days of our negotiations with the European Economic Community.  This should not hold us back because the fishing industry is as important as agriculture and must be treated as such.</p>
          <p eId="para_1666">Why is fish not marketed better?  Other areas, for example, Scotland, have successful seafood sectors because they had successful marketing campaigns.  People working in the fishing industry live in areas where there are few, if any, other industries.  It is not only a question of livelihood but also of being able to remain in the places where they live and work.  Ireland would be much worse off if we allowed those engaged in the industry to drift out of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1667">In every other country, breaches of regulations are considered administrative matters and subject to fines, whereas we have decided to criminalise fishermen by making breaches of regulations a criminal offence.  This issue needs to be resolved.  The industry is in crisis and a package of aid is needed.  Fishing boats would not be tied up in ports if there was no crisis.  When will Ministers take the crisis seriously and act on behalf of fishermen and maritime communities?  Why is the Minister not in Brussels continuing to press the case of our fishermen?  Other countries take their fishing industries seriously.  For example, France considers it part of its entire agri-aquaculture industry.  France insists on defending it and has been successful in doing so.  Why can Ireland not do the same?  Fishermen throughout the country are monitoring this debate and wondering why the Ministers with responsibility in respect of this matter do not take the industry here as seriously as do their counterparts in other countries.</p>

          <from>Deputy Christy O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_1670">I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this motion in light of the importance of the fishing industry to Cork South-West, which I represent, and the country as a whole.  The entire coastal area of my constituency that runs from Kinsale to the Dursey Sound looks out on the Atlantic Ocean.  There are people in every town and village along this coastline who, in one way or another, have spent all their lives involved in the fishing industry.  The main fishing ports in the area are Castletownbere, Bantry, Schull, Baltimore, Union Hall and Kinsale.  I have first-hand knowledge of the importance of the fishing industry to everyone in Cork South-West, particularly to those who live along the stretch of coastline to which I refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1671">This is a timely debate in respect of an extremely important sector which is experiencing very difficult times.  According to the Cawley report, the Irish seafood industry generates total annual revenues in excess of €700 million and provides direct employment for over 11,000 people.  It is a vital indigenous industry and makes a significant contribution to the economy in terms of output, employment and exports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1672">I fully accept the commitments of both the Minister, Deputy Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, in respect of a long-term sustainable and profitable Irish fishing industry, which is critical to coastal communities throughout the country.  I am satisfied that, since they were appointed, both have engaged fully with the Federation of Irish Fishermen.  They met on several occasions with representatives of the federation and kept them fully briefed during the meeting of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Luxembourg last week.  This is the kind of dialogue through which progress can be made.  The Minister and Minister of State also travelled to Luxembourg for the specific reason of meeting the EU fisheries Commissioner and conveying to him, in the strongest possible terms, the concerns of Irish fishermen.  I have no doubt that Commissioner Borg is now fully acquainted with the difficulties being experienced by Irish fishermen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1673">It was not today nor yesterday that the Irish fishing industry began to experience difficulties.  Recent increases in fuel prices have not helped.  In recognition of this, the then Minister appointed Dr. Noel Cawley to chair an independent review of the industry and to bring forward a plan for its restructuring and development.  Following intensive discussions with fishermen and fishing communities, Dr. Cawley brought forward a strategy, Steering A New Course: A Strategy for a Restructured, Sustainable and Profitable Irish Seafood Industry 2007-2013.  This strategy maps the way forward for the industry.  One of its key recommendations relates to the need to restructure the Irish fleet in order that it might become world class in nature and be ideally suited to coping with matters relating to fish stocks and species and the sustainable practices of the modern fisheries sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1674">The decommissioning scheme launched in February reflects the extensive consultation that took place with the industry.  This scheme will permanently remove fishing vessels from the Irish fleet, particularly a number of older and larger boats that are over ten years old and over 18 m in length.  The first offers of grants under the scheme were made in the past couple of weeks and the programme of decommissioning will remove up to 35% of the larger whitefish vessels from the fleet.  This will have significant consequential benefit for those who remain in the industry by increasing the quotas available to more modern, competitive fishing vessels and to smaller vessels.  It will also ensure that we have a more sustainable and profitable fleet.  This is particularly relevant to the home ports of the vessels being decommissioned.  The scheme represents a very substantial commitment on the part of the Government to bring the fishing fleet into balance with remaining resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_1675">I find it difficult to understand or accept the issue relating to discards.  While I accept this is a complex problem, it is one which simply must be addressed.  I welcome the commitment on the part of the Minister and Minister of State to focus on the early adoption of new conservation measures to reduce the deliberate discarding of fish.  Most discarded fish do not survive and I see no advantage, from the point of view of conservation, in throwing them overboard.  When one takes into account the cost to fishermen of going to sea and then being obliged to discard perfectly good catches, what is happening makes no sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_1676">I welcome the announcement by Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, regarding the establishment, under the chairmanship of the CEO of An Bord lascaigh Mhara, of a new Irish seafood marketing initiative to maximise opportunities in the domestic seafood market for the Irish fishing fleet.  I also welcome the establishment of a new Irish fisheries science research partnership under the chairmanship of the CEO of the Marine Institute.  The latter will enhance collaboration and mutual understanding on fisheries science priorities that are beneficial to the long-term future of the fishing industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1677">I support the efforts of the Minister and Minister of State to persuade the EU fisheries Commissioner to examine new information in respect of cod stocks in the Celtic Sea and to consider the possibility of a sustainable increase in access for Irish fishermen to these stocks in order to alleviate the pressure on their incomes.  No one knows better than fishermen the importance of the conservation of stocks and it is not in their interest to overfish.</p>
          <p eId="para_1678">It is important to remember what lies at the heart of this matter, namely, fishermen and their families trying to survive.  People who have invested huge amounts of money and time in building up the industry in the past are finding it impossible to make a decent living.  These individuals are not just constituents, they are neighbours and friends.  I live in a part of the country where we, as a community, suffer the pain of lives lost at sea and observe our friends and neighbours enduring extreme hardship as a result of the serious problems the industry faces.</p>
          <p eId="para_1679">It is vital we remain in regular contact with fishermen and listen to what they have to say.  We must listen when they inform us about the difficulties they face and work to resolve them.  Fishermen state that they are being over-policed by fishery officers who make it almost impossible for them to work and carry out their business and that their counterparts in other EU countries are treated differently.  Action must be taken in respect of their concerns.</p>

There is something seriously wrong in this regard.  I am strongly of the view that the introduction of administrative sanctions must be considered in cases where minor offences are committed.  This would be better than the current regime under which all offences, major or minor, are seen as criminal in nature.</p>

I wish them every success in their continuing efforts to secure additional EU funding to help address the current short-term difficulties being experienced by fishermen.  These difficulties must be considered within the context of the Common Fisheries Policy and must be addressed by a common EU-funded approach.  When our fishermen say they are in difficulty, we must listen and act appropriately.</p>

        <speech by="#BrendanKenneally" eId="spk_915">
          <from>Deputy Brendan Kenneally</from>
          <p eId="para_1684">I am glad to contribute to this debate on the fishing industry.  We do not often have the opportunity to comment on that industry in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1685">Fishing has been a Cinderella industry for many years.  Approximately 12,000 people are involved in the industry, many of the difficulties relating to which date back over 30 years.  Those in the industry were partly responsible for creating these difficulties because the organisations which represented them were far too diverse.  I refer here to the Killybegs Fishermen's Organisation, the Irish South and West Fish Producers Organisation, the Irish South and East Fishermen's Organisation, the Irish Fishermen's Organisation, the Irish Fish Producers Organisation and one or two others.  These organisations did not speak with one voice and this never helped their cause.  However, they are now under the umbrella of the Federation of Irish Fishermen and the position is changing.  The president of the federation, Mr. Michael Walsh, comes from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's constituency.  He is a sensible and knowledgeable person and if we are fair with him, that will be reciprocated to the benefit of us all.</p>
          <p eId="para_1686">I welcome the agreement among EU Ministers on illegal and unreported catches both within EU waters and outside them.  It is estimated that such catches are costing us in the region of €1 billion annually, so the practice has to be stopped.  Our fishermen have also been guilty of catching fish illegally and of landing them in undesignated ports, but their offences were minor compared to the fishermen of other countries.  I understand that regulations were lacking in some of the major fishing states in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_1687">Several years ago, as a member of the Oireachtas marine committee, I met the Commodore of the Naval Service.  I told him about an incident involving fisheries officers and a local fisherman who was fishing close to shore.  The fisheries officers were only doing their job but a Naval Service member was sent to assist them.  There was no need for that and it represented a poor use of resources.  It is easy to catch fishermen close to shore but the Naval Service should be out at sea stopping the people who do the real damage.  Too often, they chase our own instead of foreign fishermen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1688">I do not often agree with Deputy Broughan but I concur with his comments on the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  I have heard that organisation referred to by fishermen in my area as the Gestapo, the Black and Tans and in other less than complimentary terms.  I was told that officials of the authority planned to set up a stand at a fair in Killybegs but were advised against it.  I could relate further incidents but I will not do so because I have been told by fishermen that they could face repercussions.  Fishermen are being targeted for minor technicalities.  Everybody will make a mistake in a log book at some stage but that is not being recognised.  Perhaps the Minister can bring sanity to the authority.  I agree with administrative sanctions.  I visited Brussels with the Rinn committee and met the Commissioner for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs, Dr. Joe Borg.  Administrative sanctions are applied in most continental jurisdictions, so I do not accept the advice of the Attorney General that they cannot be introduced in Ireland.  Administrative sanctions were introduced a number of years ago on the advice of a former Attorney General and the legislation on regional fisheries boards also provides for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1689">I commend the Minister and the Minister of State on their efforts to increase access by Irish fishermen to cod stocks.  Several years ago, Dutch boats were permitted to come within six miles of the coast to catch juvenile cod, which they then discarded.  The South and East Fishermen's Organisation wanted to act responsibility by changing the regulations.  That meant they could not fish for cod either but they did not mind because it would allow the stocks to replenish.  This goes to show that if we work with them, they will work with us.</p>
          <p eId="para_1690">Before concluding, I have to mention the port of Dunmore East, which is in my constituency.  Development of the port is proposed in the national development plan.  It currently has a turnover of €13 million and that figure is rising steadily.  It has not been well managed in the past but it now has an excellent harbour master.</p>
          <p eId="para_1691">I commend the Minister, Deputy Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, on their engagement with the Federation of Irish Fishermen.  Their efforts are appreciated, as are their representations to the Commissioner, Dr. Borg.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seamus Kirk</from>
          <p eId="para_1692">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion.  The fishing industry is important to County Louth and the people who fish from Port Oriel and Clogherhead provide a significant income base for many families in the area.  I commend the Department of Transport and Louth County Council on the ongoing upgrade of Port Oriel's facilities.  During my time in this House, the development of Port Oriel and Clogherhead has been one of the political priorities in my constituency, so I am glad this significant investment has given us an excellent port facility which will support fishermen and the industry's well-being for generations to come.</p>
          <p eId="para_1693">This is my first opportunity to publicly congratulate the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, on his appointment to that most important of offices, and Deputy Killeen on his appointment as the Minister of State at the Department with responsibility for fisheries.  I know both men well on a personal level and I have no doubt they will bring their diligence and commitment to bear on an industry that is of significance to our economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1694">Since their appointments, the Minister and the Minister of State have engaged fully with the Federation of Irish Fishermen, in recognition of the difficulties being experienced by the Irish fishing industry.  They have had a number of meetings with the federation at which all the issues of concern to the industry were thoroughly considered.  During the course of last week's Fisheries Council, the federation met the Minister and the Minister of State on a number of occasions and was kept fully advised of developments.</p>
          <p eId="para_1695">The Minister had a lengthy telephone conversation with the Commissioner, Dr. Borg, on 5 June and, with the Minister of State, travelled to Strasbourg for a face-to-face meeting with the Commissioner and his senior officials on 18 June, where they conveyed in the strongest terms the difficulties being experienced by Irish fishermen.  They noted that the current problems have arisen throughout Europe and must be understood in the context of the Common Fisheries Policy, with the consequence that a common European solution is required.  They have, therefore, pressed the Commissioner to provide an EU funded package of measures to alleviate the concerns of Irish fishermen.  At the Fisheries Council meeting on 24 June, the Minister and the Minister of State set out a strong case for this package of measures and a number of their colleagues supported their view that a pan-European approach was urgently needed to resolve the short and medium-term difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_1696">The proposals published by the Commissioner on 17 June are welcome, although they highlight the absence of any provision for additional EU funding to underwrite the proposals.  The Ministers welcome the commitment of the Commissioner to explore all possibilities for the identification of additional funding for the package and look forward to the outcome of his efforts.  Following an initial consideration of his proposals at last week's Council meeting, the Commissioner has undertaken to come back to the next meeting on 15 July with definite proposals on an EU package.  The Minister and the Minister of State remain committed to the long-term sustainability and profitability of the Irish fishing industry, which is critical to our coastal communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1697">The decision to appoint Dr. Noel Cawley to chair an independent review of the industry and bring forward a plan for its restructuring and development is to be welcomed.  Following intensive discussions with fishermen and fishing communities, Dr. Cawley brought forward a strategy with the support of Mr. Joey Murrin and Mr. Ruán Ó Bric, entitled Steering A New Course: A Strategy for a Restructured, Sustainable and Profitable Irish Seafood Industry 2007-2013.  This strategy maps the way forward for the industry and a key component is the restructuring of the Irish fleet to create a world-class fleet ideally suited to the stocks, species and sustainable practices of the modern fisheries sector, as committed to by the Government in the programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1698">The National Development Plan 2007-13 has earmarked €216 million for the fisheries sector with a further €118 million to be made available over the life of the programme subject to verified progressive change in the industry as set out in the national strategy for the industry.  The most critical element in addressing the impact of high fuel prices is making the fleet more profitable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1699">I regret I do not have more time to deal with this important issue.  I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to make my brief contribution.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Cregan</from>
          <p eId="para_1700">I am glad to have the opportunity to contribute to this important debate.  I am not from a fishing constituency.  However, it is important that those of us who do not represent such constituencies come into the House to speak about the marvellous asset we have in our fishing industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1701">The Government has acknowledged the grave problems being experienced by our fishermen in the short term and going back over many years.  In terms of the current difficulties being experienced, the biggest issue of concern is that of insufficient quota to which I will return.  There have been enormous increases in fuel prices.  It is fair to say they have in some instances trebled in recent times.  I understand from media reports that the cost to trawlers of diesel for a ten day fishing trip is now almost €20,000, which is astronomical.  It is hard to make margins of any meaningful proportion when faced with such costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1702">Another issue mentioned by many speakers is that of discards which fishermen are obliged to go along with.  It is a terrible shame that this is the case.  I referred earlier to quotas.  The problems I have listed are not, by any stretch of the imagination, of the Government's or fishermen's making.  Some of them, such as fuel prices, are beyond the control of Government.  The quota situation dates back to 1973.  It is true the fishing sector has been the poor relation for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1703">Ireland is surrounded by almost 20% of EU waters yet it receives only 4% of the quota.  There is something radically wrong with that.  This problem dates back to 1973 when quotas were first put in place.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Cregan</from>
          <p eId="para_1705">Ireland may not have been in a position at the time to produce adequate evidence which would have determined reasonable quotas.  It may be that Brussels held back on us but I do not know if that is the case.  At the end of the day, we received totally inadequate quotas.  It is important to recognise we are starting from a low base.  It is easy to be critical of Government as Deputy Kathleen Lynch has been in saying it is not defending fishermen.  While I admire Deputy Lynch, I disagree with that statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1706">We are fortunate to have a Minister and Minister of State who are absolutely committed to improving the lot of our fishermen and our fishing industry.  The current problems did not arise under the watch of the current Ministers; they have been around for many years.  It is about time they were tackled.  I know from the level of engagement that has taken place in Europe with the Commissioner in recent days and weeks that they are being tackled.</p>
          <p eId="para_1707">It is hoped that at the end of the day agreement will be reached on EU-wide proposals that will satisfy our fishermen in terms of their having meaningful margins when they go to sea.  Fishing is a tough, difficult hard life and the margins available are very small.  I do not believe any of us would work for these margins.  I sincerely hope there will be vast improvements in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_1708">I welcome the decommissioning scheme and the €42 million committed in that regard.  While this will suit some people it will not, as is the case in any walk of life, suit others.  It will result in many older fleets leaving the industry thus ensuring there are more stocks available for those who remain in it, which in itself will be of tremendous help.  It is regrettable that skippers only will qualify for the pay-out.  Adequate resources should be put in place to ensure those who lose their jobs are upskilled to re-enter the workplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_1709">I regret my time is limited.  This is an important debate on what is an important national asset.  It is incumbent on all of us to stand up and be counted in terms of protecting our fishing industry.  I am sure both Ministers, who have shown great commitment in the portfolios they have held to date, will ensure we achieve substantial improvements in our fishing industry.</p>

          <from>Deputy Niall Blaney</from>
          <p eId="para_1710">I am particularly pleased to have an opportunity to contribute to this debate.  This is an issue of extreme importance in my constituency of Donegal North-East.</p>
          <p eId="para_1711">Fishing has always been a major employer among rural dwellers, along the coast in Donegal and throughout the country.  The industry has been dealt its fair share of blows in recent years.  It is only right that it is recognised that the Fianna Fáil Party has seen the fishing industry through many good years.  Ministers across the board have done as much as they could for fishermen down through the years and I do not believe this is about to change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1712">I commend the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, and his Minister of State, Deputy Tony Killeen, on their handling of this issue thus far given their recent appointments to this portfolio.  Given the current global economic climate, it is a difficult brief.  However, it is in capable hands.  Members will be aware that some of the issues affecting the fishing industry, in particular rising fuel costs, are beyond the Minister's control.  These increases are having a devastating effect on many industries.  I commend the Minister and Minister of State on their efforts to convince the Commission to focus on issues such as research and innovation in the development of more efficient engines and fishing practices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1713">It is important that we realise at this stage that the decline in fishing stocks, the cause of many of our current problems, is an issue which we neglected for many years.  We did not realise the importance of regulation in this area.  I acknowledge that climate change is also causing problems in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1714">Stocking levels of cod, whiting, herring, sole and so on in the Irish Sea are of major concern.  It was never going to be easy to ask fishermen to decommission in order to allow restocking.  However, this is what has to be done.  This issue pertains not alone to Ireland but to other countries in the EU.  To put it bluntly, there are too many fishing boats and not enough fish.  It is a European issue.  We, as proud members of the EU, must contribute to solving the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_1715">I welcome that the Minister and Minister of State met last month with the EU Commissioner for Fisheries and Maritime Affairs, Mr. Borg, to again outline the urgent issues facing the Irish fishing industry.  I also commend both Ministers on their close engagement with the Federation of Irish Fishermen in an effort to allay their fears and to hear firsthand their concerns.  As the Minister informed the House last night, he outlined last week to the Council of Fisheries Ministers a strong case for a package of EU funded measures to address the current difficulties being experienced by Irish fishermen.  I remain hopeful that a series of tangible short to medium-term measures will be presented by Commissioner Borg to the fisheries Ministers on 15 July.</p>
          <p eId="para_1716">Under the National Development Plan 2007-13, the Government has earmarked €216 million for the fisheries sector with the possibility of a further €118 million being made available over the lifetime of the programme subject to verified progressive change in the industry as set in the Cawley strategy.  With all interested parties engaging with one another and with a favourable set of proposals on funding from the EU we can achieve a sustainable and profitable industry in Ireland.  I look forward to real measures being proposed on 15 July in an effort to sustain this critical industry for our coastal communities.  It is an EU-wide issue.  I commend the Minister and the Minister of State on their substantial efforts, particularly over the last number of weeks, to inject aid into this failing industry.</p>

          <from>Deputy David Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_1719">I commend Deputy Creed on the introduction of this important motion, as recognised by a number of Deputies.  There is agreement across the House that this is an important industry that is under severe pressure.  I wish to talk about illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, commonly referred to as IUU fishing.  I note the proposal for a Council regulation establishing a Community system to prevent, detect and eliminate such fishing.  This measure will address the high incidence of illegal fishing and will tackle the marketing of fish and fishery products acquired through illegal fishing.  It will mean that all fishery products will have a certificate proving they have been caught and imported to the Community legally.  The measure has an international focus and aims to remove illegal products from the market.  The problem is that it will not come into force until 2010, almost two years away.  Do the Ministers opposite have any interim measures to step up controls to combat illegal fishing and illegal importing of such products into Ireland and into the Community?  What more will be done in this area?  This is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_1720">A fisherman told me recently that what he wants is the maintenance of the industry in Ireland and the labelling of fish caught in Irish waters, so that if fish are caught elsewhere and brought to Ireland people will recognise that.  A fish caught in Icelandic waters would be labelled accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1721">Many speakers have alluded to the criminalisation of Irish fishermen.  I understand we are almost unique in the European Union in this regard.  Surely if other countries have not gone down this road, we must ask the question of why we have done so.  The Minister has a responsibility to revisit this issue and to implement changes.  The current situation is wrong.  In my area, which includes the three ports of Cobh, Ballycotton and Youghal, the fishermen are under terrible pressure.  I have a question for the Minister in this regard which he might address later.  I understand the Government's amendment to the motion commends the Minister on attempting to secure an EU-funded package of measures which will be made known on 15 July.  If this EU-funded package includes permission for state aid, can the Minister give a commitment that the Exchequer will be in a position to extend such aid to Irish fishermen?</p>

          <p eId="para_1724">A fisherman told me this evening that some of the larger boats here can catch between €3,000 and €4,000 worth of cod throughout the week, which they must dump.  There is something very wrong there.  At a time when parts of the world are starving, food is being dumped at sea.  This is an important issue which has been mentioned to me by fishermen.  I ask the Minister to consider how this might be addressed.  There is something immoral about dumping perfectly good food into the water.</p>

          <p eId="para_1727">With regard to illegal fishing, it is important that boats of all nationalities should be treated in the same way.  Trawlers from other jurisdictions which are fishing illegally should be arrested and treated in the same way as Irish boats.  The feeling at the moment is that this is not the case.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_928">
          <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_1728">I compliment Deputy Creed on the motion he has put before the House.  I want to take up a point mentioned by Deputy Stanton, namely the criminalisation of fishermen.  The Minister and the Minister of State should immediately introduce the necessary legislation to get rid of this.  It is wrong.  These are hard-working men and women in a hard-pressed industry.  We have seen many tragedies over the years, as has the Leas-Cheann Comhairle in his constituency.  The people of this country have great respect for fishermen.  They know they work hard and that it is a difficult life.  In my constituency and others, fishermen do not have the wealth that builders and others had for the last 20 years when things were going well.  Fishermen have always had it hard.  It is a hard life.  The least we can do is support them in their hour of need.  I have heard from fishermen on the west coast that when the boats are near shore they seem to be picked up easily by the naval men, yet the Spanish fishermen and those of other nationalities can come into our waters and steal our fish.  They can break the law and we do not seem to do anything about it.  We let them away with it because they are from the EU, yet when they are our own people we keep them down and try to make sure they cannot make a living.</p>
          <p eId="para_1729">The fishermen of this country were sold out over the years by previous Governments, and particularly by Fianna Fáil.  They have been sold out for the agriculture sector.  Fishing is a sector in which we should be strong, but we are not.  Now we have a major problem with fuel.  The Minister and the Minister of State will be in Brussels on 23 July.  I ask them to tell the Commissioner that we need something done for our fishermen now.  We need to make sure that we protect the industry and retain the few people that are left in it.  In my constituency, if one sees a fishing boat now it is a tourist attraction, although thousands of people used to live and work in that industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1730">If the Ministers do not understand why coastal people voted "No" in the referendum, it is because they have been put out of their jobs and are over-regulated.  I do not blame Europe for this but Irish Governments.  As Deputy Stanton said, when making regulations we cannot just go one step but must go ten steps further.  This has become a major problem.  Everybody trying to make a living in this country is sick and tired of being over-regulated by people who have never employed anybody in their lives.  Those people's cheques will arrive this month whether they go to work or not, but the fishermen must go out and work hard in all kinds of weather and when they bring in their catch they must hope and pray they will get a decent price for it.  In some cases they do not.  It is time we realised we have one of the best available commodities and we are not using it.  We are not supporting fishermen and giving them the help they need.</p>
          <p eId="para_1731">Deputy Stanton mentioned something about which I spoke in the Dáil ten years ago, although I never thought it would come back to haunt us so fast.  I said that within an election or two we would have a problem with water quality and it would be an election issue.  I never thought it would happen so quickly but it happened in Galway.  We are not far away from the next crisis, which will be about food.  We are importing so much food to this country that if there is a scare in some other country — when people start dying from a disease or getting cancer from certain foods — we will have none of our own.  We will have neither our fishermen nor our farmers and we will be producing nothing.  We will have let the fishermen go out of business.</p>
          <p eId="para_1732">I was recently in Wexford for a meeting of the British-Irish Interparliamentary Body, and it was a shame to see so many marvellous boats tied up along the shore.  They have been taken out of commission by Europe and by the Irish Government.  This is a disgrace and something needs to be done.  Fishermen need support now.  They have been a quiet people for a long time.  I am calling on the Minister and the Minister of State to come back from Europe with a decent package for them and to fight for our coastal communities.  We are letting the Spaniards in and they are robbing us of our fish.</p>

          <from>Deputy Terence Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_1734">I welcome the opportunity to discuss the motion and I thank my colleagues, Deputies Creed and Sheahan, for all their hard work in this area and for bringing this motion before the House.  I congratulate the Minister and the Minister of State on their appointments and wish them well in their roles.</p>
          <p eId="para_1735">This is an extremely important motion that needs to be taken seriously by the Government.  The seafood industry employs more than 12,000 people and contributes €750 million to the economy.  If the Government does not resolve the issues that are crippling this industry by obtaining direct assistance from the EU, we are facing the loss of the entire industry and the way of life of our fishermen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1736">Numerous problems are faced by Irish fishermen every day, including the high cost of fuel, which has risen by 40% since January this year.  Irish fish prices have declined, EU quotas are restrictive and fish stocks are depleting.  As stated in the Fine Gael motion, the Government has been too slow to implement the Cawley report and ensure that Irish fish is banded and marketed as such.  On this side of the House we want to see the Government immediately negotiate a package of financial assistance for fishermen.  We want to see the Irish fishing industry not disadvantaged relative to its competitors and other EU countries that seem to be permitted state aid in certain circumstances.  Irish fishermen do not receive such aid.  We want the Government to introduce regulations on illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing without delay, following agreement at EU level.  There are numerous other measures, already mentioned by my colleagues, that we in the Fine Gael Party wish to see implemented and they are included in the motion before the House this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_1737">Ordinary people's lives and livelihoods are at stake here.  I have received numerous telephone calls and e-mails at my office from fishermen based at Howth harbour, in my constituency of Dublin North-East.  These men face uncertain times and their prospects seem dismal.  An e-mail sent to me by a constituent in Howth states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1738">I have been a fisherman since I left school at 15 and possess two boats.  My vessels operate from Howth and the crews consist solely of local fishermen.  For the last six weeks the larger vessel has not been to sea as I could not afford to pay the fuel bill with the minuscule amount of quota fish we are allowed to catch.  The six men who operate this boat all live in Howth and Baldoyle and they are suffering as they have had no wages for six weeks.  The future is extremely bleak as there is presently no hope of going back out fishing.  I am struggling to keep my other boat going.  Four of her six crew live locally.  I am appealing now for grant aid from the EU as otherwise both vessels will be tied up with 12 men out of work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1739">Crisis point has been reached in our fishing industry and we need immediate intervention before it is wiped out.  The headline of the cover story in my local newspaper, the <i>Northside People</i>, reads “Northside fishermen fear for livelihood”.  The story is about a northside fisherman, with us this evening in the Visitors Gallery, and other fishermen.  The fisherman will have to come to terms with the fact that he may be the last generation of his family to work out of Howth harbour if the Government does not take immediate steps to protect the Irish fishing industry.  It is a sad day for all fishermen operating out of Howth harbour as only a few decent-sized fishing vessels operate from the pier.  As Deputy Ring said when pointing out the gravity of the situation, if one sees such a vessel nowadays it is most likely to function only as a museum piece.  This should not be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1740">This motion was tabled by Fine Gael in response to the escalating crisis facing the fishing industry.  To date this Government has secured nothing concrete from the EU for the industry.  The Government, in conjunction with the EU, must take urgent measures now if it is serious about saving the fishing industry.  I ask the Minister and Minister of State to discuss this critical issue at the meeting on 23 July and to secure whatever financial assistance they can for the industry, otherwise it will be doomed forever.  The Government must negotiate a better quota system for fishermen and an allowance must be provided for them, in line with that issued to the Naval Service.  A direct financial assistance package is required to save the fishing industry.  We have run out of time and the fishermen of Howth and other Irish ports need direct intervention by this Government.  There is a proud tradition of fishing in this country, particularly from Howth harbour in my constituency.  We in the Fine Gael Party will fight to ensure that this tradition continues.</p>

        <speech by="#SimonCoveney" eId="spk_931">
          <from>Deputy Simon Coveney</from>
          <p eId="para_1741">I am glad to have the opportunity to speak briefly on this motion and I thank my colleague, Deputy Creed, for bringing it forward and continuing to raise issues that affect fishermen and their families along the coast.  I wish the Minister well because he has come in at the deep end on this issue.  This is not a time for learning — the Minister has many experienced advisers available to him — it is a time for action and a tough stance in Europe with regard to Irish fishing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1742">It is no exaggeration to say the fishing industry is in crisis.  It needs help at a national level, which the Government can provide if it wishes, and also at an EU level to ensure the industry survives and grows in the future.  The commercial viability and very existence of many fishing boats is under threat from what can only be described as a perfect storm of challenges that are hitting the industry simultaneously.  Fishermen have no control over most of these challenges.  They include a combination of dramatic increases in fuel prices, which are up by 40% this year, a lack of quota, over-capacity in the fleet, the stagnation and decline of fish prices and competition from illegal, unregulated and unreported catches, which are driving prices down.  Other challenges include enforcement practices in Ireland that, in many areas, are outside EU norms, particularly to the criminalisation of fishermen for certain breaches of regulations, an issue that has been raised by many of my colleagues, and the slow progress in implementing the Cawley report, the accepted blueprint for the future development of the industry at sea and, equally importantly, on shore.  Owing to all of these factors the Irish fishing industry faces a severe challenge.  Fishermen are not politicians and would not easily decide to blockade ports in an effort to focus attention on this issue but they have decided to do so on this occasion out of desperation.  Any person in this House who has met fishermen or their families in the past month will understand the desperation they feel.</p>
          <p eId="para_1743">Fishing is, rightly, a highly regulated industry, influenced and controlled by policy decisions at a European and national level.  Within the EU it is acknowledged that fishermen face a crisis and agreement on a financial rescue package was expected in last week's Council meeting.  The rescue package has not yet materialised and we have been asked to wait until next month to see what happens.  I urge the Minister to ensure that Irish fishermen get their fair share in the package finally agreed at Council level and, more importantly, that the way in which the fund is calculated and divided, in terms of EU funds and national funds, does not disadvantage Irish fishermen and their families.  If the Government is required to match compensatory funds from Europe it should be forthcoming with them, even allowing for the budgetary constraints we face.</p>
          <p eId="para_1744">I welcome progress regarding illegal and unreported fishing but it will take time to see results in pricing and so on.  I commend my colleague, Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, on his examination of how we can make the shift from criminal prosecutions to a fines-based mechanism.  He is making a genuine effort to do this in a way that is legally consistent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1745">I will finally mention discards, the most disgraceful element of the Common Fisheries Policy.  I would like Ireland to take the lead on this issue.  At a global level, 7.3 million tonnes of dead fish are thrown back into the sea each year, at a time when many people throughout the world do not have enough food to feed themselves.  Some 18% of those discards happen in the north-east Atlantic, much of which is designated as Ireland's territorial waters.  Some 1.3 million tonnes of fish are thrown back into the north-east Atlantic each year because fishermen cannot bring it ashore or are trying to hide what they have caught.  It is not sustainable, morally acceptable or right.  In fairness, the Department has made an effort to bring about a change of policy in respect of discards at EU level.  The Minister should champion such efforts in Brussels because people are looking for leadership.  It is ridiculous that fishermen have to throw dead by-catch into the sea.  Whatever they do with it, they should not have to discard it in such a manner.  They should be allowed to bring it ashore.  A mechanism should be put in place whereby fishermen can report any by-catch they should not have caught.  They should be encouraged to bring it to the shore so it can be used to feed people.  Fishermen should get some compensation for catching it, rather than hiding it as many of them do at present.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PJSheenan" eId="spk_932">
          <from>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</from>
          <p eId="para_1746">I commend Deputies Creed and Sheahan for tabling this motion.  I regret that it has to be taken in Private Members' time.  We should be debating a Government motion offering an aid package to hard-pressed fishermen around our coast.  I represent the constituency of Cork South-West, where hard-pressed people have nothing but the mountains behind them and the sea in front of them.  It used to be possible for such people to get some income from tourism for a few weeks during the summer, but this is drifting away as a result of the demise of the Cork to Swansea ferry service.  The Government has done nothing to restore that service.  The ever-increasing value of the euro is also keeping tourists away.</p>
          <p eId="para_1747">With such a background in mind, it is time for this Government, which is led by Fianna Fáil with the Green Party and the Progressive Democrats bobbing behind, to take some steps to assist the seafood industry.  I challenge it to take a step to assist fishermen and their families.  There is widespread support in urban and rural communities for the plight the fishermen are in through no fault of their own.  The Irish seafood industry, which is worth €750 million to our economy, directly employs over 12,000 people.  The immediate priority of the Minister, Deputy Smith, should be to tackle the cost of fuel, which is accounting for up to 75% of the value of each fisherman's catch.  There has been an increase of 40% in the cost of fuel since the start of the year.  The suggestion that fishermen are supported when paying for fuel is untrue.  While the duty is removed from their fuel, that does not explain why French and Spanish fishermen pay 50 cent a litre while our fishermen pay 91 cent a litre.  If the Minister does not take action in this area over the next few days, no trawlers will leave our ports and harbours for the rest of the summer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1748">The second most important issue in this vital sector is the large-scale importation of fish and seafood products, most of which are untraceable.  I understand that Cork Airport is now the biggest fishery port in the country.  It is estimated that 500,000 tonnes of illegal, unreported and unregulated fish products, worth approximately €1.1 billion, are illegally imported into the EU each year.  This has led to a decrease in fish prices in the European market and a loss of market share for EU fishermen.  Such activity is a major contributor to over-fishing and a threat to marine biodiversity.  Many of the fish in question are harvested in Irish waters by foreign boats before being transported back to ports in other countries and then flown back to Cork Airport.  Will the Government take action on this issue, which is vital if a fishing industry is to be maintained in this country?</p>
          <p eId="para_1749">The third area on which the Minister must focus is the implementation of the fisheries regulations and the criminalisation of fishermen.  I hear complaints on a daily basis about the over-vigorous enforcement of regulations by officers of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority, which has more than twice as many fisheries protection officers as the combined total of the equivalent authorities in France and Spain.  We do not need the permission of Commissioner Borg to decriminalise the activities of Irish fishermen.  The Minister can take action by speaking to the Attorney General.  Where there is a will, there is a way.  The Minister should act before it is too late.  The measures in question were imposed under Irish, rather than EU, legislation.  Some €42 million has been secured to support the decommissioning of 46 boats.  However, no provision of any description has been made for the deck hands on the boats in question.  Are they expected to live on fresh air and cold water?  A scheme should be put in place in this country to compensate such people on the loss of their livelihoods.</p>

While Ireland has 24% of the EU's fisheries area, under the terms of its membership of the EU it is allowed just 4% of the Union's total catch.  I welcome the recent announcement that an independent appeals officer is to be appointed to examine fishermen's complaints about the operations of the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority.  I have not seen the terms and conditions of the officer's appointment, however.  I hope this measure will help to forge a new and balanced relationship between fishermen and Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority officials.  I remind the Minister that self-praise is no praise.  The sooner he delivers the goods, the better for Irish fishermen.  Pious words butter no bread for our fishermen.</p>

          <p eId="para_1753">As a representative of a maritime county, I am delighted to have an opportunity to say a few words as part of this debate.  I acknowledge the work of Deputies Creed and Sheahan, who have given us an opportunity to discuss the fishing industry this evening.  The potential of the industry to benefit this country has not been tapped — instead, it has been neglected.  There was a time when this country was not prepared to make the most of its fish stocks.  I refer to the era when most fishermen went to sea one day a week.  We abandoned our fishing industry in 1973, more or less, because we did not have the resources to maximise its potential.  We sold out to concentrate on the greater prospects offered by the agriculture sector.  Many European countries, some of which are landlocked, saw the potential of Ireland's fishing grounds.  They were aware that we were not in a position to exploit that potential ourselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_1754">The fishing industry is important in the context of healthy eating, which is being promoted by the Government.  Almost every nutritionist recommends fish as a critical part of a balanced diet.  They suggest that one should eat fish three or four days a week, rather than just one or two days a week.</p>

          <p eId="para_1756">There is a shift away from red meat, which nutritionists recommend one should consume one day a week.  When one considers that obesity is a growing problem among this country's population, it is even more important to place a renewed emphasis on the fishing industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1757">The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food is aware that there is a scarcity of supply of fish.  There are concerns about the availability of fish.  What will happen in a county like Kerry, which depends greatly on tourism, if fishermen are unable to go to sea to bring in a catch?  Most restaurants rely on fish dishes to attract customers, but if something is not done they will not have enough fish in a few weeks' time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1758">I am not sure whether the Minister, Deputy Smith, or the Taoiseach was responsible for building up such huge expectations in advance of the most recent meeting of the Council of Ministers.  Many people were under the impression that an aid package would be offered to Irish fishermen on foot of the meeting.  I met some fishermen who were convinced that a package would be made available, but that did not happen.  I understand that there was a reluctance at that meeting to offer assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1759">It is time for the Government to do something.  I accept that we face difficult times.  We are fortunate to have many good professional operators in the fishing industry but we could be witnessing the end of them if something drastic is not done to help as soon as possible.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Tony Killeen)</from>
          <p eId="para_1760">Last night my colleagues, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Brendan Smith, and the Minister of State, Deputy Trevor Sargent, set out clearly the issues facing the fishing industry.  They outlined progress made and detailed measures we intend taking to resolve the outstanding problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1761">I am heartened by some of the constructive suggestions that have come from all sides of the House, notwithstanding some predictable point scoring.  It has been a well-informed debate with an acknowledgment of current fiscal realities and the historical constraints that beset the fishing industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1762">Our ministerial predecessors with the fisheries portfolio established the seafood strategy review group under the chairmanship of Dr. Noel Cawley to restructure and develop the industry.  The Cawley strategy, Steering a New Course, was launched in January 2007.  Dr. Cawley also agreed to chair an implementation group of all relevant stakeholders, including the Federation of Irish Fishermen, FIF, to bring forward delivery of the report's recommendations.  This ensures that, at a time when the industry is experiencing extreme difficulties, we have an excellent blueprint to help it develop in a sustainable, profitable and self-reliant way for all participants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1763">Since taking over the portfolio, the Minister, Deputy Smith, and I have had several meetings with the FIF.  An introductory meeting on 29 May addressed the fuel crisis and other general issues.  There was a nine-hour meeting in Athlone on 13 June——</p>

        </speech>
        <speech by="#TonyKilleen" eId="spk_941" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food">
          <from>Deputy Tony Killeen</from>
          <p eId="para_1765">——where we confirmed that we would meet Commissioner Borg and convey in the strongest terms the depth of feeling of Irish fishermen and that we would press him to bring forward a new EU-funded package of measures to alleviate the immediate concerns of the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_1766">We had meetings with the FIF before and during the Fisheries Council on 24 June.  I also met the FIF last Thursday at the innovation and sustainability conference in Donegal town on 26 June.</p>
          <p eId="para_1767">By way of direct engagement with the Commissioner, the Minister had a long telephone conversation with him on 6 June.  We had a bilateral meeting on 18 June at which, having already met the FIF, we were able to convey to him exactly what the fishermen had said to us.</p>
          <p eId="para_1768">At the Fisheries Council on 24 June we reiterated our demands for a co-ordinated EU-funded package of short-term measures to address the present difficulties.  I was pleased by the support extended by some other fisheries Ministers at that Council and hope, with that support, to put further pressure on the Commission at the next Fisheries Council on 15 July.  We want a viable package that must include additional EU-funded provisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1769">It is clear that there is a degree of common understanding of the issues.  This has been the case throughout the entire process of the Cawley strategy.  There is significant additional pressure on the industry because of the rise in fuel prices.  There is appreciation also that some of the issues cannot be resolved overnight.  However, in at least two of the contributions tonight there was a total misunderstanding of the nature of the French and Spanish measures which fall considerably short of those that have been taken in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1770">In the matter of decommissioning, many people emphasise the payments to those who leave the business but the really important element is the economic lift from the redistribution of the whitefish and prawn catch previously taken by the decommissioned vessels.  The figure for this is currently estimated at €20 million per annum, a considerable amount to those who remain.  Ultimately, decommissioning is only valuable if it also benefits the owners and skippers who stay in the fleet.</p>
          <p eId="para_1771">The issue of administrative sanctions was dealt with last night by the Minister, Deputy Smith.  He emphasised that we had listened to the arguments made by the federation and, as promised, that we have referred the matter to the Attorney General for a fresh look at the issue.  As the Ministers responsible, we will be led by the proper legal advice in this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_1772">Contrary to what a Member said, the Council meeting was very successful in moving to deal with illegal, unreported and unregulated, IUU, imports.  This trade impacts negatively on the income of fishermen.  As Deputy Stanton rightly noted, from the beginning of 2010 the outcome will be of enormous benefit to Irish fishermen.  The reason for the timescale involved is because of the nature of the proposals which are wide ranging and will take some time to come into place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1773">In the matter of discards, Ireland has been to the fore since 2004 in trying to ensure the EU brings forward proposals that are sensible and that address the issues.  We raised the matter with the Commissioner and at the Council meeting and will continue to pursue it until we get a workable resolution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1774">A number of speakers referred to the market and research initiatives which are very important.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulKehoeFG" eId="spk_942">
          <from>Deputy Paul Kehoe</from>
          <p eId="para_1775">I wish to share time with Deputies Michael Creed and Pádraic McCormack.  I thank Deputy Creed for bringing this motion to the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1776">I come from a constituency with a strong fishing tradition and a significant economic dependency on the industry and therefore I have been dismayed over the past number of years, particularly during the past few months, by the Government's inaction on this issue.  It ignores the warning signs concerning the future viability of the Irish fishing industry.  Fishermen in my county, in communities such as Kilmore, Duncannon, Fethard-on-Sea and other areas, are being forced off the sea and into the social welfare system.  The Government should recognise the short sightedness of its approach in allowing a long established industry to die.  In the long term it will pay a cost in providing social welfare payments to support families who previously earned their livelihoods from fishing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1777">This Government has witnessed the decimation of the fishing industry.  Fishermen and their representatives are angry and frustrated.  They know they have a good product for the marketplace but bad management has allowed the situation reach crisis point.  It is not only those directly involved in the industry who will suffer if the Government does not take decisive action.  There is a knock on effect.  Vibrant economic and social communities have been built around the fishing villages and if the industry becomes unviable, those shops, petrol stations, pubs and restaurants will suffer.  The social fabric of these villages will be damaged.  I cannot stress enough the importance of that point.</p>
          <p eId="para_1778">Fishermen's representatives have been very vocal in getting out their message and I ask the Minister to heed their concerns.  Against a backdrop of core difficulties and restrictions which have already led to hardship, the impact of rising fuel prices is effectively the straw that breaks the camel's back.  Boat owners have been unable to afford or justify the cost of diesel to go to sea and over the past few weeks many crew members have been forced to sign on and seek social welfare assistance.  In many instances members of extended families are involved in the crewing of boats and when the boat is no longer at sea there is a double whammy effect.  If a father, a son and a son-in-law are on a single boat that can no longer fish, there is a significant economic impact on that family.</p>
          <p eId="para_1779">If there was a factory closure in my part of the country there would be news headlines, television cameras and promises of taskforces from any Government.  Allowing the fishing industry to decline has the same impact but unfortunately the reaction is not as visible.</p>
          <p eId="para_1780">It is a most depressing sight to drive into a small fishing village and see boats tied up in the harbour.  On behalf of the fishermen of County Wexford and the rest of Ireland, I plead with the Minister not to allow this industry to die.  The consequences will be dire and far reaching.  People are willing and able to work.  I ask the Minister to ensure they have an industry in which to work and to secure its viability into the future.</p>

        <speech by="#PadraicMcCormack" eId="spk_943">
          <from>Deputy Pádraic McCormack</from>
          <p eId="para_1781">The last straw for small coastal fishermen was the introduction of amendments to the Sea Fisheries Maritime Jurisdiction Bill by the then Minister of State, Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher.  However, because Deputy Gallagher was from a sensitive fishing area the Bill was put through by another Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, who had no fishermen and only a few yards of coastline in his constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_1782">That Bill was draconian and attempted to make criminals out of fishermen.  It wiped out small inshore fishermen because its measures dictated that if they were to be fined for any offence they would have a criminal record that would remain on their account for life.  This is despite the fact that breaches of regulations in other EU member states are regarded only as administrative offences.  Why is Ireland always overly enthusiastic in introducing and dealing with directives?  Only for a Fine Gael amendment to the legislation, naval officers would have been allowed to open fire on fishermen in carrying out their work.  This provision was dropped by the Minister following the Opposition amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1783">It is no wonder that the Lisbon treaty was defeated comprehensively in all small coastal areas, from County Donegal to County Cork.  The residents are sick and tired of regulations and protested in the referendum on the treaty.  Let me give two examples.  In Kilkieran in Connemara, a small fishing area, the "No" vote amounted to 155, while the "Yes" vote amounted to 37.  Therefore, approximately 80% of the people voted against the treaty.  In Ballyconneely 181 voted "No", while "56" voted "Yes", which implies that approximately 76% in the area voted against the treaty.  This was a response to over-regulation, as the electorate perceived it, and the over-enthusiastic approach of the Government in implementing directives.  The electorate voted as it did, despite the efforts of the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív.</p>
          <p eId="para_1784">Despite the statement of the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, the Council of Ministers has failed to issue a financial rescue package for the Irish fishing industry.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, at the meeting with the Federation of Irish Fishermen, gave the impression this would be achieved on 23 and 24 June.  The fishermen's hopes have been dashed again as a result, irrespective of what the Minister of State now says.</p>
          <p eId="para_1785">With the 40% increase in diesel prices, fishermen are leaving their boats tied up, as many Members said.  Why is there such a delay in implementing the recommendations of the Cawley report, as stated by Deputy Coveney?  The Minister of State must support Irish fishermen in the current crisis.  What does he — he is accompanied by the Minister of State responsible for food, Deputy Sargent — intend to do about the 7 million tonnes of dead fish returned to the sea while one third of the world's population are starving?  This scandal must be faced up to and regulated for in order that fishermen will be allowed to bring smaller catches aboard for consumption.  Dumping dead fish back into the sea in this day and age is a scandal and must be eliminated.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
          <p eId="para_1787">I thank my colleagues on all sides of the House for their contributions to the debate.  I concur with the assessment of the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, in that the debate has been excellent and informative.  It addressed, in the necessary detail, all the issues having an impact on the fishing industry and the opportunities for fishermen to make a living.  The question that remains to be answered is whether the will of the House, as expressed by Members on all sides, will be reflected in the vote on the matter tonight.</p>
          <p eId="para_1788">It is not possible, in the time remaining, to address all the issues but I will address a number of the critical ones.  We are primarily talking about people whose livelihoods are flashing in front of their eyes who may not be in a position to go to work tomorrow, next week or certainly next month, which is in the critical timeframe.  The meeting of the Council of Ministers on 15 July is the last chance for many fishermen.</p>
          <p eId="para_1789">I am extremely concerned about the amendment to the motion tabled by the Government.  It concentrates exclusively on the view that "the current short-term difficulties . . .  require to be addressed by a common EU-funded approach" and refers to efforts to "secure an EU-funded package".  What if Commissioner Borg who has a very good grasp of the fishing industry states to the Council of Ministers on 15 July that his package contains EU-funded measures and permits State funding?  The Minister and Minister of State should have made us certain tonight that Irish fishermen will not be at a competitive disadvantage after 15 July <i>vis-à-vis</i> their French or Spanish counterparts, with whom they compete every single day when they go fishing.  Their diesel prices and the prices they receive in the market are contingent on their playing on a level playing pitch.  If it is the case that the French and Spanish exchequers are in a position to finance a state-aid measure, Irish fishermen must not be left swinging in the wind for the want of Exchequer funding.</p>

          <p eId="para_1791">The industry is worth €750 million and there are 12,000 employed therein.  It operates almost exclusively in areas where other economic opportunities are not readily available.  We cannot allow the opportunity that presents itself to pass.  The Government's silence is deafening on the proposal that we match, euro for euro, the packages made available to fishermen by other exchequers.  This silence is extremely disappointing and the Opposition will not accept a package, presented by the Minister on his return from Brussels, that does not ensure a level playing pitch.</p>
          <p eId="para_1792">The Government's amendment removes, in one fell swoop, all reference to a level playing pitch in dealing with sanctions for breaches of fishery legislation.  All the fine words by the Government to the Federation of Irish Fishermen and the producer organisations will not wash with them as a consequence.  The Government insults the intelligence of fishermen and their families by saying the regime in place is required to protect fish stocks and the long-term future of coastal communities and to seek to avoid financial penalties being imposed on the State and the Irish taxpayer.  Shame on the Minister of State; this is not factually correct.  The senior Minister, Deputy Smith, took the same terminology verbatim from the same word processor.</p>
          <p eId="para_1793">The European Commission is interested in the conservation of our stocks.  So, too, are fishermen who depend on the stocks as they comprise the lifeblood of their industry.  However, the Commission never stated fishermen should be criminalised for minor breaches of fishing legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1796">The Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food considered this issue and obtained legal opinion that was entirely at variance with that given by the Attorney General.  While the advice of the Attorney General is privileged, I want to see published the letter requesting the advice.  If one frames a question in a particular way, one will receive the answer one wants.  I do not believe it is impossible to change the law and introduce administrative sanctions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1797">If one commits an offence in respect of a REPS grant or headage payments, administrative sanctions apply.  If one commits a road traffic offence, one is subject to an administrative sanction, as is the case with offences pertaining to inland fisheries.  The criminal sanctions imposed on fishermen do not hold water legally.  They are the result of the bully-boy tactics of the former Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Noel Dempsey.  It was the spineless acquiescence of Fine Fáil backbenchers that allowed the legislation to be introduced that criminalised fishermen for minor offences.</p>

          <p eId="para_1801">I acknowledge the contributions made by all my colleagues.  I agree, in particular, with the point made by Deputy Kenneally.  One of the weaknesses of the fishing industry during the years was its failure to speak collectively and coherently with one voice.  However, what is now occurring in this regard is a new departure for the fishing industry.  The IFA is not the premier league pressure group by default.  It is cohesive, speaks with one voice and pursues its objectives relentlessly.  When fishermen stand united and express their views coherently, they will deliver.  We cannot allow the industry to go down.</p>
          <p eId="para_1802">I pay tribute to those in the Federation of Irish Fishermen and the producer organisations from Killybegs to south-west Cork who, as the Minister of State and Opposition Members know, tirelessly advocate on behalf of, and work endlessly behind the scenes to deliver for, their organisations.  As for administrative sanctions, this was a slap in the face to them and their efforts.  While the Minister of State has made the correct soundings, his speech was off-keel tonight and was not what is required to resolve the issue of administrative sanctions.  Some of these issues are outside our control and must be determined in Europe.  Others, however, rest within the capacity of this House to deliver.</p>

          <heading>Radiology Services Review.</heading>
          <speech by="#FergusODowdFG" eId="spk_960">
            <from>Deputy Fergus O’Dowd</from>
            <p eId="para_2086">It is becoming increasingly difficult for the public to understand why, despite so many external reviews of clinical services in north-east hospitals, so many problems continue to occur.  External independent reviews have been conducted in the past few years on services in Cavan, Monaghan and Navan, and on maternity and midwife services in Drogheda and Cavan.  All of these reports have been critical of clinicians and of lay management.  They have highlighted deficits in staffing levels and in management oversights.</p>
            <p eId="para_2087">Now we hear of another external independent review of radiology services conducted at a time when it seemed there were significant problems with staffing levels in the radiology units in Drogheda, Dundalk and Navan hospitals.  I raised the serious concern outlined in 2001 by a consultant radiologist in the region about the dependence of the hospitals on locum consultants and the intolerable work pressure on the permanent staff.  Is it true that a shortage of consultants led to concerns about the ability of all three hospitals to provide a full range of radiology services?  Is it true that the significant work pressures, and the resultant work practices, contributed to a climate where the work of a locum consultant was not monitored or audited within the Louth-Meath radiology department?  What confidence can this House and the public have in the ability of the HSE to provide safe acute hospital services in the north east?</p>
            <p eId="para_2088">This review took place.  It was initiated in early March 2006.  It was commissioned by the HSE by an outside consultant.  The problem is that, just after that review commenced, there was a consultant radiologist who took up to 6,000 X-rays of 4,500 persons, many of whom must have had two or more X-rays.  As a result of mis-diagnosis, at least six persons died subsequently of lung cancer.  These incidents occurred over two years ago and some people, even today, do not know what the full outcome of their radiology was after this review took place.  Everybody knew about this, but nothing happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_2089">The key point relates to the recommendations in this report which were issued in December 2006.  To date, some of these recommendations have been implemented, some are currently being worked on, while others have not been progressed for a number of reasons, including the financial and recruitment implications.  However, the facts are that people have died prematurely because of errors that were made.</p>
            <p eId="para_2090">I want to know what this review found out.  What was it saying?  What were the recommendations?  I put it to the Minister that inadequate action was taken.  Subsequent to this review we had the appalling vista of 6,000 X-rays being revisited and upwards of 150 persons at least have been called back for a review of their X-rays, some of them two years after they were taken.</p>

          <speech by="#JohnMoloney" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_961">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy John Moloney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2091">I hope in the response I can cover the points raised by Deputy O'Dowd.  I will be taking the matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, who cannot be available this evening.</p>
            <p eId="para_2092">It is important to distinguish clearly between the review referred to by the Deputy which was carried out in 2006 and the review currently under way.  The 2006 review was essentially concerned with organisational arrangements to ensure optimum efficiency.  The current review is concerned with patient safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_2093">In 2006, the Health Service Executive commissioned an external human resources and industrial relations specialist to carry out a review of the organisational arrangements in the department of radiology at the Louth-Meath hospital group.  The joint department of radiology provides services at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, Our Lady's Hospital, Navan and Louth County Hospital, Dundalk.  The HSE advises that the review was commissioned as an internal advice document for the hospital group with recommendations on the optimum organisation arrangements for the department.  The hospital group wished to ensure that it would make best use of the personnel and expertise in the radiology department and across the three hospitals, to meet the service requirements of the population in Louth and Meath.  The review was finalised in 2006.  A number of recommendations came out of the report dealing with staffing levels; consultant involvement in management; other governance issues; information and communication technology support; safety, health and welfare at work; communications; and service developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2094">The Department has since been advised by the HSE that the hospital group has taken the recommendations on board and has worked with the staff of the radiology department in the Louth/Meath hospital group to progress the implementation of the recommendations as far as possible.  Some of the recommendations have fed into the process of the overall reconfiguration and development of hospital services in the north east, and are currently being addressed by the radiology network, which was established following the teamwork report on health services in the north east.</p>
            <p eId="para_2095">The HSE has stressed that the 2006 review was commissioned as an organisational design and administrative aid.  The current look-back review of X-rays and CT scans in Louth/Meath hospital group was prompted by concerns that four patients had their diagnosis delayed due to an abnormality on their chest X-ray not being noted on initial examination by a locum consultant radiologist.  These patients were subsequently diagnosed with lung cancer and, unfortunately, have since passed away.  The HSE arranged for these cases to be reviewed by an external expert.  The HSE also decided that a look-back exercise was required to review the approximately 6,000 X-rays and 70 CT scans reported on by the locum consultant radiologist between August 2006 and August 2007.  The look-back review is being carried out by a panel of radiologists from Louth/Meath and Northern Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_2096">The HSE has stressed to patients that the look-back review is a precautionary measure.  Chest radiographs are performed for many reasons — most are done for respiratory tract infections, bronchitis, asthma, pneumonia, accidents, injuries, chest pain and heart failure.  A small number would have been done for possible lung tumours, but the majority of patients who are being checked are extremely low risk and included as a measure of prudence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2097">In the interests of patients and their families, the HSE is not making any public comment while the look-back review is ongoing.  When all the X-rays and CT scans have been reviewed, a report will be produced which will detail the background to the look-back review, the methodology, the outcome and the learning from this review.  It is expected that the final report will issue within four weeks of the completion of the review.</p>

        <heading>Services for People with Disabilities. </heading>
        <speech by="#AlanShatter" eId="spk_962">
          <from>Deputy Alan Shatter</from>
          <p eId="para_2098">I thank the Acting Chairman, Deputy Jack Wall, for allowing me to raise this issue.  Several of my constituents have children with intellectual disability who have been attending Saint Michael's House.  Upon completing their education at the end of this academic year and reaching 18 years of age, these children expect to proceed to Cheeverstown House for what is known as rehabilitative training to facilitate maximising their potential for their future lives.  In the context of the Government's plan to provide disability services, it was promised that moneys would be ring-fenced, training facilities would be extended and additional places would be made available.  As at yesterday, as far as these parents were concerned, there was no certainty that places would be made available.  One family received a letter from Cheeverstown House stating that it had not received confirmation of funding for rehabilitative training placement for their son from the HSE and, therefore, it was not in a position to offer him a place.</p>
          <p eId="para_2099">My colleagues Deputies Michael Creed and Kieran O'Donnell raised the same issue yesterday evening with regard to the provision of places for children suffering from intellectual disability in counties Cork and Limerick.  I want to clarify for certain where matters now stand.  I read with interest the Minister of State's speech last night in which he made contradictory statements.  He said: "The funding will be in place for the children in question."  That seemed as if it was resolving the issue.  He then went on to say:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2100">There has been a delay in explaining how soon it will come through.  Most of the concerns raised, quite properly, by the voluntary organisations were raised because they had not heard that the funding was in place.  The reality is that once we can commit ourselves to allocating the funding, the issue will be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_2101">Having said the funding will be in place he then said, conversely, that when he could commit himself to allocating the funding the issue would be dealt with.  A perception was created last night that the problem was solved.  That perception is confirmed from a statement on the Minister of State's website this afternoon.  This states developments with regard to intellectual disability "will include new day places for young people leaving school and additional therapy supports for pre-school children and for children with autism".  The statement further states "the HSE was now in a position to roll-out the planned disability developments as outlined in its 2008 Service Plan".  While the Minister of State put that on his website this afternoon, the Taoiseach, today in the Dáil told Members when the issue was raised:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2102">The HSE hopes to be able to finalise the position regarding the commencement of the developments, including those required to meet the needs of school-leavers with disabilities, over the next ten days.</p>
          <p eId="para_2103">The Minister of State in his speech last night referred to a press release he said the HSE issued that afternoon which confirmed the problem was solved.  When I contacted the HSE it knew nothing of the press release.  It does not appear on its website and the press officer could not find one.  Will the Minister of State say very clearly that the training places for these school-leavers with intellectual disability, which parents expected to be provided earlier this year in Cheeverstown House, will be available for certain?  If this is the case I welcome it.</p>
          <p eId="para_2104">Nevertheless, the level of mismanagement on the part of the HSE and the Government in creating these difficulties and uncertainties is unforgivable.  I have received phone calls from parents who, having assisted their children to work through the education system within the resources available in Saint Michael's House — indeed people elsewhere have been in contact with me on this matter — are greatly stressed and believe their children have been cut off from further services to which they were entitled.  These parents believe the Government was breaking its promise to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_2105">If the Government is not breaking its promise and if the disability services will be provided, it is welcome.  However, no parents should have been put in a position where they received a letter such as the letter from Cheeverstown House to which I referred earlier.  Cheeverstown House should not have been in a position where it had no certainty about the funding it would receive, or did not know whether it could provide the service.  It is now essential that in very simple straightforward language, with no qualification, we are told if the places will be available.  Can the Minister of State confirm the funding will be provided?  Can the Minister of State explain why he put on his website what appears to be a confirmation that all is in order on the same day the Taoiseach tells the House that the matter will not be resolved for at least another ten days?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_963">
          <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_2106">I thank the Acting Chairman and with his permission I will share time with Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  I welcome the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, again in the House tonight.  As Deputy Shatter said, we need more clarity on this issue.  I welcome the statement last night from the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney regarding an expected resolution to this matter within ten days.  I also welcome the statement from the Taoiseach this morning in response to questions from my party leader, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, on the same matter.  However, we need to know for definite if this will happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_2107">I am also aware of people leaving school with intellectual disability and autism in Limerick, Cork and Dublin.  I am sure the same applies to other parts of the country.  Such people have absolutely no certainty about what will happen, which is simply unacceptable, especially when €50 million additional funding for disability services was allocated this year.  In a reply to a question which I received yesterday, the Minister for Health and Children said that the HSE has informed the Department that it plans to release €20 million of the €50 million additional funding for disability services.  We need clarity that there is €50 million allocated and not €20 million.  We need to be told that this €50 million will be ring-fenced for the purposes for which it was designated.  We do not want to see a recurrence of what previously happened to mental health, palliative care and some disability funding which was not spent on the services for which it was allocated.</p>
          <p eId="para_2108">There are currently people with physical disabilities in acute hospitals ready for release if the appropriate supports are available.  These people are occupying acute beds for a much longer period than necessary, because the supports are not in the community as a result of this money not being released.  I will name an individual, whose name has already been in the media and I have permission to do so.  Mr. Ted Kennedy is currently in an acute bed in Beaumount Hospital in Dublin.  He has been there for two and a half months longer than necessary.  He was ready for discharge approximately two and a half months ago.  He cannot leave because he does not have the support he needs at home.  He cannot go back to his job because he does not have the supports there.  He is in danger of losing his job and accommodation because of loss of income, which makes no sense.  He is in an acute bed which should be available for someone else.  He wants to get back to his home and job but he cannot because the supports do not exist.  This is another aspect of the difficulties and we need clarity from the Minister of State.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#KathleenLynch" eId="spk_964">
          <from>Deputy Kathleen Lynch</from>
          <p eId="para_2109">I sincerely congratulate the Minister of State on his appointment as I have not previously had the chance to do so in public.</p>
          <p eId="para_2110">Located some 50 yards from where I live in Blackpool is the Cork Centre for Independent Living.  The staff there work in appalling conditions.  They use the most awful office facilities even though some have a severe disability and need motorised wheelchairs.  However, they run a very successful operation because they know the needs of clients and they know what is necessary to live independently when one has a severe physical disability.  I met two of these people yesterday and they were so stressed out that they were simply thinking of giving up the whole enterprise and handing it back to the HSE.  What kept them going — this is what they told me — was the knowledge that by handing the operation back to the HSE, their 120 clients would probably fall by the wayside.  The additional resources they were prepared to argue for simply would not be otherwise provided.  The centre sent out letters last Friday to all its clients.  Most of the centre's work centres on facilitating the provision of personal assistance.  This includes helping clients to get out of bed, be washed and fed, travel to work or the library, or simply go outside the door for the sake it.  Basically, it is to be part and parcel of what we all consider normal and everyday life.</p>
          <p eId="para_2111">They are cutting back the hours of personal assistance by anything up to 20 hours per week.  One girl wrote to me and told me she had just got a home of her own and with her personal assistant was looking forward to the future.  Now she feels everything is crumbling around her and she thinks she will have to look for a place in care.  Imagine the cost to the State of this retrograde step.</p>
          <p eId="para_2112">These people need €220,000, which is minuscule.  As that woman pointed out, it is exactly what it cost to do up an office for the former Taoiseach.  I am not saying the former Taoiseach should not have a nice office and I do not begrudge people such things.  However, the difference this minuscule amount would make to people's lives is incalculable.</p>
          <p eId="para_2113">I have telephoned HSE south, which is local, and the people there threw their hands up.  They told me they were supposed to have €50 million in development money but it did not come through.  They were told they may hear about it in the next two weeks but as a result of a parliamentary question I submitted, along with Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, it has emerged that €20 million may be released.</p>
          <p eId="para_2114">What happened to the notion that when an issue was itemised in a budget, it would come through?  If we, as elected representatives of the people in the highest Chambers in the land, have indicated the money is to go to a certain area, how can somebody come along and decide otherwise without a Vote, correspondence or consultation?  How can they decide the money will go elsewhere?  This leaves people like those in the independent living centre no longer able to manage to be part and parcel of common society because of a miserly sum of money, in today's terms, being allocated.  Is the €50 million coming, as it means so much to so many?</p>

        <speech by="#JohnMoloney" eId="spk_965">
          <from>Deputy John Moloney</from>
          <p eId="para_2115">I will try to respond to all the specific issues mentioned.  I note the sincerity of Deputies Lynch and O'Sullivan, although I am not too surprised by Deputy Shatter looking at another issue which is not relevant.  I am not into perceptions or pretence and I stand over what is on the website.  I do not believe in the nonsense of creating another row as I am more concerned with the central issue.  I wish Deputy Shatter could be also but I am not sure about it.</p>
          <p eId="para_2116">I stand over the funding announced last night in response to Adjournment matters.  I agree with Deputies O'Sullivan and Lynch in that if funding is allocated under a specific heading for disability, it should be ring-fenced for the area.  As a Minister of State or otherwise, I have always felt like that.  While I was on the committee dealing with health issues, we met with representatives of disability groups many times and we felt the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_2117">I am aware of similar letters detailing issues in my constituency so I do not need to be here responding on the matter to be able to work out what are the true issues on the ground.  It is unfortunate — the best word which can be used — that people should have to wait for so long.  I will have to read the official script but at the same time it is better to look at the programme which was committed to with the €50 million, or the 200 new residential places and the 487 day places, along with other specifics.  These are the figures committed to under the current funding.  What was proposed for disabilities remains intact.</p>
          <p eId="para_2118">I regret that it takes ten days for the letters to go out.  However, what is being committed to will be followed up on.  For those people contacted by the voluntary groups to suggest there may not be places, this is the figure involved to resolve the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_2119">I must go through the official script to respond specifically to the queries.  I am pleased to take this opportunity to address the important issues raised by Deputies Shatter and O'Sullivan.  I will explain about development funding first.  The multi-annual investment programme for disability services makes provision for the development of additional day, residential and respite places each year between 2006 and 2009 for people with intellectual disability and autism.  Some €50 million was provided to the HSE in 2008 to fund a range of additional services under the multi-annual investment programme for disability.  This €50 million is a response to allegations suggesting this Government is uncaring.</p>
          <p eId="para_2120">With regard to the remarks about the Taoiseach, he ensured this funding would go to that specific centre.  As the Deputies will be aware, the commencement of the planned developments in disability services this year had been delayed due to a financial review in the HSE.  However, I am pleased to be able to inform the House that the HSE has assured me that it is now in a position to roll out the planned developments as outlined in its 2008 service plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_2121">I do not know who Deputy Shatter rang but I will put on record the facts I have and believe.  If somebody in the HSE told him the opposite, I advise Deputy Shatter to check out who that was.  I am giving him the facts as they stack up for me.</p>

          <from>Deputy John Moloney</from>
          <p eId="para_2127">I prefer to deal in facts.  The Deputy is looking for targets but I am not.</p>
          <p eId="para_2128">Planned services include additional residential, day care, including training places, and respite care places for people with intellectual disability and autism; additional residential care and home support services for people with physical and sensory disabilities; and additional multi-disciplinary therapy posts to provide assessment and ongoing intervention services to children with a disability.</p>
          <p eId="para_2129">I understand the HSE hopes to be able to finalise the position on the commencement of the developments, including those required to meet the needs of school leavers with disabilities, over the next ten days.  I believe this will happen over the next ten days.</p>
          <p eId="para_2130">With regard to rehabilitative training, as the Deputies will be aware, within the health and training sector a range of training, health and personal social day services are provided by several State agencies, including the Health Service Executive, non-statutory agencies funded by the HSE and specialist training providers supported by FÁS, to young people with disabilities when they leave school.</p>
          <p eId="para_2131">With regard to training and particularly the provision of life skills training, otherwise referred to as rehabilitative training, the HSE and HSE-funded agencies provide such training services for persons with disabilities to enhance their individual level of skill, which will focus on the enhancement of an individual's care, fundamental skills, life skills and social skills.  The level of outcome from rehabilitative training is not pre-determined but is dependent on the level of the development capacity of each individual.  Consequently, it is important that training services are matched to the person's need.</p>
          <p eId="para_2132">In meeting this need, the HSE employs guidance officers at local level to assist in the profiling of young school leavers with disabilities to appropriate training and day services.  The guidance officers work with the school leaver, the family, school authorities and service providers to ensure school leavers with disabilities have access to appropriate services.</p>
          <p eId="para_2133">The co-ordination and planning of services to meet the needs of people with disabilities form a central tenet of the national disability strategy.  A critical element of such co-ordination and planning is the requirement to provide financial support for the development and implementation of services.</p>
          <p eId="para_2134">In terms of funding requirements for service development for HSE-funded services, the Government has set aside specific funds for service delivery for people with disabilities by way of the multi-annual investment programme 2006 to 2009.  Significant additional funding has already been provided and spent on developing new and enhanced health and personal social services for people with a disability, including young people leaving school in the period 2006 to 2007.  These areas will continue to be the focus of developments for the remaining years of the multi-annual investment programme in 2008 and 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_2135">The Government has provided the HSE with an additional €75 million in 2006 and 2007.  This funding provided an additional 506 day places and 492 day places in 2006 and 2007 respectively.  In addition, day services were enhanced with the provision of additional supports to deal with school leavers or other adults with significant disabilities, with 52 places in 2006 and 66 places in 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_2136">The increase in services in recent years has ensured that young people with intellectual disabilities and autism have appropriate services in place to ensure a smooth transition from secondary school.  In some cases, the funding provided supported the school leavers to access appropriate day services, in line with a person-centered plan.  In many cases, this funding provided places for individuals completing rehabilitative training, thereby creating training places for other school leavers.  The HSE and HSE-funded agencies also provide a range of other day services designed to meet the needs of adults with disabilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_2137">With regard to the specific issue raised by Deputy Shatter in Cheeverstown day care centre, I am advised by the HSE that over 400 people are availing of the service provided.  In addition to the residential and day services operated from the main complex in Templeogue, the voluntary organisation also operates 16 community houses in the Tallaght area, a sheltered workshop in Broomhill Drive and training, rehabilitation and education service from centres in Tallaght main street and Airton Road.  I understand the Cheeverstown centre receives the bulk of its funding from the Health Service Executive and its allocation for 2008 is slightly more than €25 million.  The HSE has advised me that the places in Cheeverstown for school leavers from St. Michael's House will be made available with the payment of the development funding for 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_2138">I propose to inform the House of some developments in areas related to the issues raised by Deputies Shatter and Jan O'Sullivan.  The HSE is in the process of undertaking a comprehensive national review of HSE-funded day services for adults with a disability.  This review will seek to advise on the reconfiguration and modernisation of existing adult day services to reflect the core principles of the health strategy, namely, access, quality, accountability and person centredness.  The review includes, as part of its work, examining and reviewing the range of day services such as activation, rehabilitative training and sheltered work.  To date the strategic review of HSE-funded adult day services has consulted widely with service users, families and service providers and is about to engage in discussions with all parties to the sectoral plans, including the Departments of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Social and Family Affairs.  A census of HSE-funded adult day services has been completed and the findings will help inform decision making in this process.</p>
          <p eId="para_2139">As a further significant development in support of the national disability strategy, the office for disability and mental health was established by the Government in January this year.  The office brings together responsibility for different policy areas and a range of services which impact on the lives of people with a disability and people with mental health difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_2140">As I indicated last night regarding the commitment to the funding allocation of €50 million, it is not a matter of taking credit.  The funding should remain in place.  While I am not in a position to provide a direct answer on the issue of people with physical disabilities raised by Deputy O'Sullivan, I will issue a response before the end of the week.  It is in the interest of all of us that funding for disability and mental health should be ring-fenced.  I hope to achieve such a commitment.</p>

          <speech by="#TomMcEllistrimFF" eId="spk_972">
            <from>Deputy Thomas McEllistrim</from>
            <p eId="para_2141">As this is my first opportunity to do so, I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, on his appointment.  I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important issue and call on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to establish a special squad in the Garda to deal with anti-social behaviour and public disorder.  I urge the Minister to introduce this squad on a pilot basis in Tralee.</p>
            <p eId="para_2142">Local newspapers across the country provide almost weekly reports of court proceedings involving public order offences and anti-social behaviour, which principally occur at weekends, although unfortunately they also take place on week days.  Our communities and town and county councils regularly discuss the problems caused by drunken revellers late at night.  Shopkeepers often spend Mondays cleaning up broken windows and other damage.  It is unfortunate that many people seem to be unable to have a night out without causing annoyance, distress or harm to others.  Their social night out develops, usually with the aid of alcohol and possibly other substances, into an anti-social experience for everyone around them.  Fuelled by substances they would be better off without, they can make life a misery for members of the public, local businesses, the Garda Síochána and personnel in emergency departments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2143">Intoxication in a public place, disorderly conduct, threatening, abusive or insulting behaviour, assault, violent disorder, affray and attacks on emergency service personnel are examples of some of the many types of disorderly behaviour and public order offences which adversely affect the quality of life in our towns and cities.  We all want our town centres to be alive and vibrant places where people want to live.  Urban renewal schemes were devised with this objective in mind.  However, there is no incentive to live in a town centre if one is kept awake at night by rowdy drunks and greeted on Monday mornings by shards of broken glass, an abundance of litter, graffiti and other damage to property.  What about members of the public or tourists who go out for a night and find themselves threatened, abused, insulted or intimidated for no good reason?  Sadly, this type of anti-social behaviour is probably an unfortunate side effect of the booming economy we have had over the past decade or more.  In dealing with such behaviour, it is necessary to specifically target locations where civil disorder is rife, including areas outside pubs, clubs, discos, fast food outlets and at taxi ranks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2144">The record shows that assaults have increased substantially in Tralee.  Headline incidents in County Kerry for the first quarter of 2008 rose to 493 from 462 in the first quarter of 2007, while in Tralee and Listowel they increased from 244 to 256 and 76 to 81, respectively, over the same period.  Public order offences in County Kerry rose from 762 to 842 and while public order offences in Tralee declined, the number of more serious incidents increased from 95 to 110.  Tralee has six night clubs, 24 off-licences, 126 pubs, 44 restaurants, 18 hotels and 13 fast food outlets.  A zero tolerance approach by the Garda, which involved a complete clampdown on unruly behaviour, resulted in more than 100 arrests for public order offences in Kerry's three main towns in one weekend in early May.  Arrests for fighting, drink driving, possession of drugs and other offences reached the three figure mark and there were 32 arrests in Tralee alone.  Garda reinforcements, including members of the dog unit, were drafted in to help to keep the peace on the streets where people were partying until the early hours.  Recently, Tralee Town Council debated whether to close a laneway in the town where there is a problem with anti-social behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_2145">The identifying and targeting of trouble hot spots in consultation with stakeholders can ensure more effective deployment of Garda resources and CCTV can be utilised to enhance public safety.  It is, however, time to consider the creation of a special squad within the Garda to deal with this type of behaviour.  The starting point should be the establishment of a local task force.  Such a squad could involve the Garda, particularly community gardaí and Garda Reserve, and liaise with joint policing committees, the community and local business people, such as the proprietors of nightclubs and taxi ranks.  The squad must be given the support, resources and skills it needs to tackle anti-social behaviour.  Its members should be specially trained in dealing with public order problems, dress as a public order unit with protective gear if necessary and be capable of operating as a unit.  Visibility, the use of a paddy wagon and a robust but fair approach to public disorder would act as a deterrent and would be appreciated by members of the public.  This investment would pay dividends, particularly social dividends, in the long term.  I urge the Minister to establish such a squad on a pilot basis in Tralee, County Kerry, and Abbeyfeale, County Limerick.</p>
            <p eId="para_2146">The Garda Síochána already has a number of special squads, including the traffic corps which deals with drink driving and speeding, the drugs squad which deals with the drugs problem and the special crime squad which deals with serious crime.  I commend the Garda on the great work these special units do.  Why should we not establish a squad to tackle the many problems associated with the scourge of anti-social behaviour and public disorder in a timely fashion and perhaps, in time, reduce the incidence of more serious crime?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JohnMoloney" eId="spk_973">
            <from>Deputy John Moloney</from>
            <p eId="para_2147">I thank the Deputy for his good wishes and for raising this important matter.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regrets that he cannot be present as he is dealing with other business.  However, I assure the Deputy that the Minister shares his concern, and the concern of all right-thinking citizens, regarding anti-social behaviour and public disorder.</p>
            <p eId="para_2148">Under the Garda Síochána Act 2005, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has the power to set policing priorities for An Garda Síochána.  One of the priorities set for 2008 is to combat, in co-operation with other agencies and the community in general, problems relating to public disorder, with special emphasis on alcohol-related behaviour — including under age drinking — and socially disadvantaged communities, particularly through the utilisation of the legal mechanisms, such as behaviour warnings and closure orders, that are available.</p>
            <p eId="para_2149">Strong provisions are already in place to combat anti-social behaviour.  The Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 1994 modernised the law in this regard.  Furthermore, the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2003 contains provisions to deal with alcohol abuse and its effect on public order.  In addition, the Criminal Justice (Public Order) Act 2003 provides the Garda with powers to deal with late night street violence and anti-social conduct attributable to excessive drinking.</p>
            <p eId="para_2150">It is unfortunate, however, that excessive use of alcohol continues to be the cause of far too much of the anti-social behaviour experienced in Tralee and other communities.  To address this, the Minister has introduced the Intoxicating Liquor Bill, which is currently being considered by the House.  The Bill contains a number of significant reforms of the licensing laws and public order legislation, with the aim of addressing the adverse consequences of alcohol abuse in society.  The measures being proposed are a balanced response to problems caused by excessive alcohol consumption and binge drinking.</p>
            <p eId="para_2151">The strategy underpinning the draft legislation will allow for the increased visibility and availability of alcohol through off-licences, while tightening the conditions under which premises with on-licences qualify for special exemption orders permitting them to remain open beyond normal licensing hours.  The Bill increases penalties for public order and licensing offences.  Furthermore, it contains measures to curtail drinking in public places — particularly by those under 18 — including allowing gardaí to seize alcohol.  These powers will add significantly to the effectiveness of the Garda response to drinking in public places.</p>
            <p eId="para_2152">The Minister is informed by the Garda authorities that An Garda Síochána proactively targets public disorder and anti-social behaviour in Tralee.  Areas subject to such behaviour have been identified as hot spots by local Garda management and additional foot and mobile patrols are directed into such areas during times when these offences are most likely to occur.  All such incidents detected by members on patrol or reported to An Garda Síochána are dealt with immediately and the suspected offenders are dealt with in accordance with the law.</p>
            <p eId="para_2153">CCTV systems play an important part in support of policing and the maintenance of public safety.  They also act as a useful deterrent to street crime and public disorder.  Garda town centre CCTV systems are planned and implemented on the basis of operational needs identified by An Garda Síochána.  I understand that CCTV systems have been installed in Tralee and are monitored at the local Garda station.  In addition to monitoring of images in real time, all images are recorded and can be reviewed at short notice when required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2154">The Garda Síochána Act 2005 provides for the establishment of a joint policing committee in each local authority administrative area.  The purpose of these committees is to provide a forum where members of a local authority and senior Garda officers, with the participation of Oireachtas Members and community interests, can consult, discuss and make recommendations in respect of matters affecting the policing of an area.  Some 29 committees are currently operating on a pilot basis in order that experience might be gained before such committees are rolled out to all local authority areas, including that in which Tralee is located.  In general, the outcome to date of the work of the committees has been positive and they are meeting definite local needs.  Guidelines are being drafted which will enable roll out of the committees to take place and the Minister intends to ensure that this occurs at an early date.</p>
            <p eId="para_2155">An unprecedented increase in the strength of the Garda Síochána is continuing in line with the commitment in the programme for Government to have 15,000 members of the force by 2010, with an intake of approximately 1,100 recruits per annum.  The personnel strength of Tralee Garda district at the end of May was 11% higher than was the case in May 2007.  Policing operations and the deployment of Garda resources are matters for the Garda Commissioner.  It is, and must remain, the responsibility of Garda management to allocate personnel within the Garda organisation on a priority basis in accordance with overall policing requirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_2161">I propose to take Questions Nos. 78, 98, 105, 123 and 133 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2162">I welcome the second annual report of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces covering the period January 2007 to December 2007. This is a further milestone in the development of the Office which became operational on the 1st December 2005 and which itself represented a significant development in the modernisation of the military redress of wrongs process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2163">The Act provides that the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is independent in the performance of her duties and it is not considered appropriate for the Minister to report on her behalf or to give details in relation to her reports on individual cases.</p>
            <p eId="para_2164">The Ombudsman reported an increase in the number of referrals to her office from 26 in 2006 to 76 in 2007. She reported that 15 of the 2007 referrals were actually carried over from 2006 and that 8 were from former members of the Defence Forces. I acknowledge that the increase in the number of referrals arises from an increased awareness of the Office of the Ombudsman as well as increasing confidence among members of the Defence Forces. I welcome this.</p>
            <p eId="para_2165">The input of the Ombudsman has assisted the Defence Forces in the revision of a number of HR procedures including the selection processes for career courses and overseas service. The recommendations in the Ombudsman's reports to me have also informed the revision of selection processes for promotion, a new version of which is currently being progressed with the representative associations through the conciliation and arbitration scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2166">In this regard I note the Ombudsman's recognition of the continued co-operation that she has received from the Defence Forces and my Department. I remain committed to the successful implementation of the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004.</p>
            <p eId="para_2167">In her report, the Ombudsman highlighted the challenge of identifying appropriate and proportionate remedies while retaining due regard to the practicalities of the military environment. I fully support the Ombudsman's proposal to engage in a constructive dialogue with a view to identifying appropriate solutions. With this in mind, my officials wrote to the Ombudsman earlier this month indicating my Department's desire to engage with her in this task.</p>
            <p eId="para_2168">The Ombudsman reported thirty (30) referrals in respect of non-selection for promotion, thirteen (13) referrals in respect of non-selection for career courses or overseas service, twenty-nine (29) referrals for other issues, and four (4) in respect of complaints of bullying and harassment. On this final category, I understand from the Ombudsman that one of these was withdrawn, one did not fall within her jurisdiction, the Ombudsman did not uphold the complaint in one and one is being processed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2169">In her report, the Ombudsman mentions staff resources and office accommodation. I am advised that the Ombudsman has recently achieved a steady staff level of four (4), consisting of the Ombudsman, an investigating officer, an office manager and clerical support. The Office of the Ombudsman is currently located in Hatch Street, Dublin 2. I have supported the request from the Ombudsman to the Office for Public Works for alternative accommodation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2170">My commitment to the success of the office of the Ombudsman extends to ensuring that appropriate staff levels and other resources are available, in keeping with overall public service standards and requirements. My Department is in discussion with the Ombudsman on these issues.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_2173">I propose to take Questions Nos. 79 and 95 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2174">An order for two (2) man portable mini Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Systems, commonly referred to as UAVs, was placed with Aeronautics Defence Systems Limited from Israel, in May 2007. The value of the order was in the region of €780,000, inclusive of VAT. The award of the contract followed on from a two stage tender competition in which eight proposals were initially received and three tenders subsequently evaluated by a Military Board in the first quarter of 2007. Delivery of the UAV systems took place at the end of 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_2175">The UAV systems were acquired to enhance the capability of the Defence Forces to carry out surveillance and target acquisition for overseas Peace Support Operations. The UAVs have the capability to provide a low cost and low risk means to increase capabilities and enhance force protection by performing missions without requiring or risking the use of manned aircraft. The UAVs are an information-gathering asset and are unarmed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2176">Both UAV Systems have three unmanned mini airframes and the cost of each mini airframe is €70,000. Three mini airframes were deployed for operational use in Chad. Since the commencement of the mission in Chad one mini airframe has been lost and another damaged.</p>
            <p eId="para_2177">I am advised by the military authorities that on 19 March 2008, following a report of unidentified armed elements near Goz Beida in Chad, a mini unmanned airframe was launched by Defence Forces personnel.  After approximately 25 minutes the controllers lost contact with the airframe. The airframe was not subsequently recovered. An investigation by the Defence Forces into the loss of the mini airframe proved inconclusive mainly due to the fact that the airframe was not recovered.</p>
            <p eId="para_2178">On 14 June 2008, another mini unmanned airframe was launched during an incident in Goz Beida.  Shortly after the launch, the airframe malfunctioned.  The airframe was recovered but was damaged.  An investigation is being carried out by the military authorities into this malfunction. The investigation, which is ongoing, involves contact with the Israeli supplier, Aeronautics Defence Systems Limited.</p>
            <p eId="para_2179">The UAV systems are covered by warranty relating to the replacement or repair of any parts found to be defective or not working properly.  The normal procedure is that a warranty claim will be raised on finalisation of investigations into issues that arise with regard to such equipment.  If a warranty claim is validated, the defective parts will be replaced or repaired free of charge and the issue of recoupment of costs does not arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2180">The loss or damage to equipment is not taken lightly by the Defence Forces. Every effort is made to establish the reasons for damage to or loss of equipment with the primary purpose of ensuring that, as far as possible, such incidents do not occur in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_2182">The current projected figure for recruitment to the Permanent Defence Force in 2008 is in the region of 690 general service recruits, comprising 540 Army recruits, 120 Naval Service recruits and 30 Air Corps recruits. In addition in the region of 30 apprentices will be recruited. The number of cadets to be recruited is currently under consideration and is expected to be in the region of 45.</p>
            <p eId="para_2183">The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 set out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force as the strength sufficient to meet all foreseeable military requirements for the period comprehended by the White Paper (i.e. up to 2010). This remains the position.  It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces.  This recruitment will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper.</p>
            <p eId="para_2184">The agreed Programme for Government provides for an additional provision of up to 350 troops to be in training at any given time.  However, due primarily to the requirement to prioritise funding for the Chad mission, it has not been possible to provide funding to activate this provision in 2008. This matter will be further considered in the context of the 2009 Estimates.</p>

            <p eId="para_2189">I am advised that 38 foreign military planes have landed at Casement Aerodrome, Baldonnel to date in 2008. The purposes of these visits involved transport of troops for onward deployment to the UN mandated EUFOR mission to TCHAD/RCA, inter-military liaison visits, navigation training, aircraft delivery flights, crew rest and refuelling stops, and VIP and official visits.</p>
            <p eId="para_2190">The presence of foreign military personnel on board the flights referred to above is usually limited to crew, who generally number between two to four per flight.</p>
            <p eId="para_2191">There have been two troop transfer missions to date in 2008, which involved the arrival of a total of 65 Dutch military personnel at Baldonnel for onward travel to TCHAD with the deployment of Irish troops to the region.</p>

            <p eId="para_2204">Arising from the accident in Granard Co. Longford in June 2007, a Study Group advised on the introduction of a roll over protection system for troop carrying vehicles incorporating roll bars and safety belts. The Defence Forces have begun the process of setting up a programme for the purchase of this equipment. A sum of €400,000 has been allocated for expenditure on the systems for 2008 and suppliers of the system are currently being sought.</p>
            <p eId="para_2205">A company has been requested to fit a system to a troop carrying vehicle for evaluation and trial. The company advised in April 2008 that due to the manner of construction of the vehicles it might take six to eight weeks to manufacture and fit such a system. For various reasons connected with the contractor, the fitting of the evaluation has been delayed somewhat.  However, I understand that the company is ready to fit a system to a DAF 4X4 in late July.</p>
            <p eId="para_2206">On receipt of this system and after a period of evaluation and user feedback, tenders will be sought for the provision of a suitable restraint system.

            <p eId="para_2210">I propose to take Questions Nos. 87, 115 and 122 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2211">As deputies will be aware, the days prior to my recent visit to Chad had been particularly tense in the region with ongoing clashes between Chadian Government troops and rebel forces.   In response to these clashes, EUFOR immediately reinforced the area between the ongoing engagement and the IDP's/refugee camps and sent ground and air reconnaissance elements to monitor the situation to ensure protection of the camps.  Throughout Saturday 14 June 2008, Irish and Dutch troops operating in Goz Beida were deployed in and around Djabal Refugee Camp (approx 15,000 occupants) and four other sites for Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) (approx 36,000 occupants).  In the course of these clashes, a component of the Irish Forces which was deployed on observation post duties, received incoming fire from an unknown group.  Irish personnel returned warning fire.  There were no casualties.</p>
            <p eId="para_2212">At the height of the clashes, when over 250 Irish troops were deployed, a request for evacuation was made by UNHCR in Goz Beida town to the battalion HQ as they were "in imminent danger".  The Officer Commanding, acting on a military evacuation plan, tasked a platoon of Dutch Marines, accompanied by Irish personnel, to go to the UNHCR compound.  When they arrived at the compound there were between 100-120 rebel forces in and surrounding the compound.  Over the course of the following hour the Platoon acted extremely professionally and evacuated the UNHCR staff and retrieved five vehicles, which had been stolen by rebel forces.  A total of 235 humanitarian personnel were evacuated by Irish and Dutch forces to Camp Ciara, the headquarters of the 97th Infantry Battalion, where they were accommodated until it was safe for them to return to their own compounds.  The Irish Forces maintained the protection of the Refugee and IDP Camps until the Government/Rebel clashes subsided and the engagement ceased.</p>
            <p eId="para_2213">When I visited Chad, I met with Mr. Victor Da Silva Angelo of Portugal, UN Special Representative of Secretary General and Head of the UN Mission (MINURCAT). The SRSG referred positively to the important role the Defence Forces had played in evacuating and providing safety and shelter for the humanitarian workers in Goz Beida.  On 18 June 2008, the UNHCR apologised for the confusion caused by remarks published in a report in The Irish Times on that date, when a UNHCR spokeswoman criticised Irish troops serving in Chad. UNHCR appreciates the role EUFOR and the Irish forces are playing to protect refugees, displaced people and aid workers in the difficult and dangerous environment in Chad.  MINURCAT also issued a press statement in this regard.  I have accepted the apology and the matter is now closed.  Irish troops will continue with their operations and will co-operate with and support the NGOs and the International Organisations throughout the Defence Forces deployment with EUFOR.</p>
            <p eId="para_2214">The Irish personnel are already making a significant difference on the ground and are enhancing Ireland's international reputation as neutral, impartial and professional peacekeepers. During my recent visit to Chad, I was very impressed by the motivation being shown by our troops in the performance of their duties, their energy and the good atmosphere in the camp generally. I want to assure the House that the personnel of the 97th Infantry Battalion know the job that they are there to do.  There is no misunderstanding of EUFOR's mandate, which includes contributing to the protection of civilians in danger, particularly refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid, and the protection of UN personnel.  I am satisfied that EUFOR is discharging its mandate in a professional and impartial manner.</p>

            <p eId="para_2220">I propose to take Questions Nos. 90, 107 and 130 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2221">During the period 16 –18 June 2008, I took the opportunity to visit Chad, where 393 members of the Permanent Defence Force are currently serving with the UN mandated European Union military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR TCHAD/RCA.  The primary purpose of my visit was to see at first hand the work of the Irish Defence Forces Personnel serving with EUFOR and to convey to them, on behalf of the Government and the people of Ireland, the deep appreciation felt regarding the outstanding manner in which they are performing their duties in this challenging mission.  I was accompanied on my visit by the Secretary General of my Department, the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, Lt. Gen. Dermot Earley, Assistant Secretary General Ciaran Murphy, and Ambassador Kyle O'Sullivan, Ireland's Ambassador to Nigeria, who is accredited to Chad.</p>
            <p eId="para_2222">On 16 June 2008, I met with Chad's Secretary of State for National Defence, General Hassan Saleh Al-Djinedi and with Mr. Victor Da Silva Angelo of Portugal, UN Special Representative of Secretary General and Head of the UN Mission (MINURCAT) in N'Djamena.</p>
            <p eId="para_2223">In my meeting with General Hassan Saleh Al-Djinedi we discussed the role of EUFOR TCHAD/RCA.  I outlined the mandate and the neutral and impartial nature of the force.  I specifically pointed out Ireland's neutral status and that our key concern and the reason for Ireland's participation was to create a safe and secure environment for refugees, internally displaced persons and for the distribution of humanitarian aid.  We also discussed the difficult security situation on the ground.  I advised him that we would have no role in any internal issues which would be a matter for the Chadian authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2224">In my meeting with Mr. Victor Da Silva Angelo of Portugal, UN Special Representative of Secretary General Head of the UN Mission (MINURCAT), I discussed the security situation and the ongoing work on the deployment of Police/Gendarmerie units in the camps.  The SRSG pointed to the difficulties involved in progressing the return of IDPs to their homes because of the fraught security situation on the ground and the lack of support available to returning IDPs.  He noted the difficult security situation which he said is also impacting on humanitarian workers and on their capacity to service the camps.  He advised me that the first contingent of police and gendarmerie commanders had just graduated from the UN course.  While the recruitment process is slower than expected, he hoped to have 5 or 6 companies of Gendarmes in the camps by the end of the rainy season.   He advised that the mid-term review of the mission was about to commence and a joint EU/UN Technical Assistance mission was in Chad to conduct the review.  The SRSG confirmed that there was very satisfactory co-ordination on the ground with MINURCAT and praised the role which the Irish Deputy Force Commander was playing in this regard.  We also discussed the incidents which occurred in the days immediately prior to my arrival.  The SRSG referred positively to the important role the Defence Forces had played in evacuating and providing safety and shelter for the humanitarian workers in Goz Beida.</p>
            <p eId="para_2225">Before travelling to Goz Beida on 17 June to visit troops of the Irish 97th Infantry Battalion at their headquarters in Camp Ciara, I met with EUFOR's Deputy Force Commander, Col. Derry Fitzgerald and other senior Irish Officers based in EUFOR Force HQ.  I was briefed on the humanitarian and security situation on the ground; particularly on the recent incidents in Eastern Chad; their impact on the security of the camps and the delivery of humanitarian aid to those in need.</p>
            <p eId="para_2226">On 17 June 2008, I visited Camp Ciara, which is the headquarters of the Irish-led multinational battalion.  The standard of the camp and the facilities in it are very impressive and quite remarkable, particularly when you consider the distances and logistics involved in transporting all the equipment and constructing the camp.  Great credit is due to the advance party for the magnificent effort they have put in to prepare the ground for the main contingent.  The camp is adjacent to an airstrip, which is approximately 5 kilometres east of Goz Beida.  While there, I met with the troops of the 97th Infantry Battalion who are settling in well into the new Camp.  After a series of briefings and lunch with the troops, I addressed them and congratulated them on the tremendous job they are doing under extremely difficult conditions and terrain. I conveyed to them the best wishes of the Government and the Irish people in the work they are undertaking.</p>
            <p eId="para_2227">The Irish personnel are already making a significant difference on the ground and are enhancing Ireland's international reputation as neutral, impartial and professional peacekeepers.  I was very impressed by the motivation being shown by our troops in the performance of their duties in difficult circumstances, their energy and the good atmosphere in the camp generally.</p>
            <p eId="para_2228">The days prior to my recent visit had been particularly tense in the region, when EUFOR Irish troops, deployed to protect Djabal IDP's/ refugee camps 4 kilometres North West of Goz Beida, received incoming fire from an unknown group. Irish personnel returned warning fire.  There were no casualties.  The Defence Forces, along with their Dutch counterparts, were also involved in the evacuation of humanitarian workers, NGOs and staff of the UNHCR.  A total of 234 personnel were brought to Camp Ciara where they were accommodated until it was safe for them to return to their own compounds.</p>
            <p eId="para_2229">During my time in the camp I also met representatives from the International organisations and Irish personnel from Concern who briefed me on their activities in the camps and on the security situation for them.  The local UNHCR representative, Mr. Jose Fischel de Andrade, in Goz Beida thanked me for the action which the Defence Forces had taken in evacuating humanitarian personnel including UNHCR staff and in accommodating them in the camp.</p>
            <p eId="para_2230">Unfortunately, I had to cancel a scheduled visit to the UNHCR refugee camp and the Internally Displaced Persons' site, both in Goz Beida, due to the security situation prevailing at the time of my visit. However, I did meet with some of them near the Camp when I was departing.</p>
            <p eId="para_2231">I am pleased to report that the situation in the Irish-led multinational battalion's area of responsibility is currently calm.</p>

            <p eId="para_2233">From 1995 to 2004 an annual contribution of €2.86m was paid by the banks in respect of Army escorts.  The contribution from the banks was designed to part-cover the total costs to the State of providing cash escorts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2234">The agreement which I signed with the IBF on 11 May, 2005 provides that the banks will pay the total actual costs incurred by the Defence Forces in the provision of cash escorts for the banks. Under the agreement, which is for a 5 year period, the banks are charged for their proportion of the total escorts provided i.e. approx. 78%. The remainder relates to post office escorts which are not subject to charge as they come under State expenditure.</p>
            <p eId="para_2235">Costs in respect of each 12 month period to end-December, are paid the following year, with payment due on or before the 1st June. This is to allow for the compilation of returns from the brigades and allocation of costs following the year-end.</p>
            <p eId="para_2236">The total amount paid by the banks for the years 2005 to 2007 inclusive was:</p>
            <p eId="para_2237">2005 — €6.03m</p>
            <p eId="para_2238">2006 — €6.47m</p>

            <p eId="para_2240">The total number of cash escorts during 2007 was 2,291. The total to the end of May in 2008 is 916.</p>

            <p eId="para_2265">Military medical services and their facilities exist to maintain the health of the Defence Forces and to support them in operational and overseas activities. The focus of the military medical service is on primary care, occupational medicine, acute trauma management, preventative medical programmes and field medical training.</p>
            <p eId="para_2266">The challenges in the medical arena have been recognised for some time and a review of the provision of medical services, in association with the representative associations, is ongoing as part of the Modernisation Agenda for the Defence Forces.</p>

The first phase, which is a review of the current and future requirements in relation to medical services, has already started.  I expect the report to be delivered before the end of the year.  I eagerly await receipt of the report and I can assure the House that following consideration of the recommendations I will publish the report and engage with all of the key stakeholders on the way ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_2274">The development of the Medical Corps forms part of the agreed programme for Government. I am committed to providing a sustainable medical service to meet the needs of the Defence Forces both at home and abroad. Notwithstanding the current situation, I can assure the House that Defence Forces personnel requiring medical treatment are getting the care they need.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_2320">The Naval Service provides the maritime element of the Defence Forces and has a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime defence requirements.  In the 2000 White Paper on Defence, the Government decided that the Naval Service would be based on an 8-ship flotilla and committed to a modernisation and replacement strategy to maximise the operational capacity of those 8 vessels consistent with the roles assigned to the Naval Service.   The White Paper specifically provides that "New vessels will be brought on stream to replace older ones as these fall due for replacement".  Naval Service Vessels are replaced when they have come to the end of their useful life, which is normally around 30 years.  Three ships will fall due for replacement over the next 3 to 5 years — LE Emer, commissioned in 1978, LE Aoife, commissioned in 1979 and LE Aisling, commissioned in 1980.</p>
            <p eId="para_2321">Following a detailed examination of the needs of the Naval Service within my Department, a vessel replacement strategy for the Naval Service was put in place to cover the period up to 2012.  The strategy combined with a continuous process of refurbishment will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a very high level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2322">Following Government approval in July 2007, notice of a tender competition for the purchase of replacement vessels for the Naval Service was sent to the Official Journal of the European Union on 24 August 2007.  The competition is for the purchase of two Offshore Patrol Vessels with an option of a third and one Extended Patrol Vessel with an option on a second.  The options provide an effective value for money opportunity, at locked in prices, to provide replacements for Naval Service vessels which will reach the end of their service life in the years immediately following the current replacement programme.  The competition uses a Restricted Procedure comprising two stages — the first stage a Request for Proposals and the second stage an Invitation to Tender.</p>
            <p eId="para_2323">The closing date for stage 1 was 26 October 2007.  The evaluation of proposals has now been completed.  Detailed specification development for the vessels is nearing conclusion.  It is expected to issue the invitation to tender for the second stage of the competition for the OPV in August this year. Tender evaluation will take place in October and it is intended to award a contract in late 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2324">In relation to the larger EPV, my Department intends to undertake further analysis of the proposals in relation to the EPV project before the second stage is initiated.  Once this has been completed, my Department will review the matter with a view to initiating the second stage of the EPV competition, probably later in the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2325">The purchase of the vessels will be subject to Government approval on funding.   This matter will be reviewed in detail following the conclusion of the tender competition at which point detailed costings will be available to inform the Government decision. It is expected that the vessels will be delivered on a phased basis between 2010 and 2012.  The Government is committed to continuous investment in the equipment needs of the Naval Service to enable it to carry out the roles assigned to it.</p>

            <p eId="para_2328">I propose to take Questions Nos. 101 and 135 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2329">Entry to the Permanent Defence Force is either through the Cadetship Competition, General Service Enlistment, Apprenticeship Competition or Direct Entry Competitions which are held to fill vacancies in specialist appointments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2330">Cadet Competition</p>
            <p eId="para_2331">The number of applications received for the Cadetship Competition in 2006, 2007 and 2008 was 1,085, 1,231 and 1,183 respectively. 55 Cadets were enlisted in 2006 and 48 were enlisted from the 2007 Cadetship Competition.  The number of cadets to be recruited in 2008 is currently under consideration and is expected to be in the region of 45.</p>
            <p eId="para_2332">General Service Enlistment</p>
            <p eId="para_2333">The number of applications received for General Service Enlistment to the Permanent Defence Force in 2006, 2007 and to date in 2008 was 2,495, 3,958 and 1,540 respectively. 559 general service recruits enlisted in the Permanent Defence Force in 2006 and 565 in 2007.  192 recruits have been enlisted to date in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2334">Apprenticeships Competitions</p>
            <p eId="para_2335">The most recent recruitment campaign was the Apprenticeship Competition for Aircraft Mechanic, Heavy Vehicle Mechanic and Fitter Armourer Apprentices. The competition was launched on 29 February 2008. A total of 612 applications were received from which the military authorities propose to offer in the region of 30 apprenticeships. The recruitment selection process is ongoing.  All qualified applicants have completed the assessment phase, which includes fitness and psychometric testing. The successful candidates will be inducted in September 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2336">There were 427 applications for the Apprenticeships Competitions held in 2006 and a total of 30 Apprentices were enlisted. In 2007 there were 454 applications and a total of 28 Apprentices were enlisted.</p>
            <p eId="para_2337">Direct Entry Competitions</p>
            <p eId="para_2338">Direct Entry Competitions were held in 2006 from which 2 Doctors were appointed to the Medical Corps, 2 Engineers were appointed to the Corps of Engineers and 2 Instrumentalists were appointed to the Army School of Music. A total of 128 applications were received for these competitions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2339">In 2007, a total of 58 applications were received for all Direct Entry Competitions. As a result 2 Doctors, 1 Psychologist and 1 Dentist have been appointed to the Medical Corps along with 4 Instrumentalists to the Army School of Music and 2 Aeronautical Engineers (who were commissioned in 2008) to the Air Corps. To date in 2008, 2 Doctors have been appointed to the Medical Corps and 1 Instrumentalist has been appointed to the Army School of Music. In addition 1 Doctor and 2 Aeronautical Engineer Officers will be commissioned in the near future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2340">The number of applications received for positions in the Permanent Defence Force usually far exceeds the number of positions available in any year.  In general terms, the Defence Forces are attracting more than a sufficient number of suitable candidates of the standard and calibre required for the filling of the general body of vacancies on offer.</p>

            <p eId="para_2344">The position is that there are a number of physical and medical standards laid down by the Military Authorities for entry to the Defence Forces. These requirements are based on the professional advice of the Medical Corps and having regard to the nature of the job, the duties of military service and the training exercises undertaken by members of the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_2345">The Medical Corps regularly reviews the medical standards for entry to The Defence Forces. The question of the suitability for military service of persons who have had laser surgery to correct their visual acuity is complex, because it depends among other factors on the exact type of surgery and on the amount of visual correction effected.  I have asked the Military Authorities to report to me specifically on the issues relating to laser eye treatments and I will review the vision requirement in light of that report.</p>
            <p eId="para_2346">I have been advised that the report will take some time to complete in the light of the complexity of the issues arising. I anticipate that the report will be presented to me later this year.</p>

I am advised by the OPW that the building should be ready for occupation in December 2009 and that site acquisition, construction and fitting out costs amount to approx €30 million.  Approximately 83% of clerical/administrative staff is now in place in preparation for the move to Newbridge.  The building will provide for a total of 244 personnel (including 43 military).</p>
            <p eId="para_2359">In relation to the provision of accommodation for DFHQ at the Curragh, I am advised that OPW are currently preparing the necessary technical documentation and will shortly be inviting tenders.   A definitive estimate of cost will be available once a contract has been awarded.  I am advised that the current estimated date for availability of this accommodation is the end of 2010.  Approximately 410 military personnel will be decentralising to the Curragh.</p>

            <p eId="para_2371">The White Paper on Defence outlines the blue print for a new Reserve Defence Force. This blueprint outlined a new Reserve with a clearly defined role, an enhanced relationship with the PDF, better equipment and training and opportunities for reservists to serve on overseas peace support missions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2372">An Implementation Plan has been developed that will ensure the realisation of the White Paper vision.  The Plan is being rolled out over the period to the end of 2009.  There has been significant progress to date in implementing the detailed recommendations of the Plan e.g. new organisation structure implemented, major improvements in clothing, equipment, training and resourcing.  In addition, the Reserve is now organised along similar lines to the PDF and the development of the integrated element of the Reserve is in its second year.  All of these changes are enhancing the capabilities of the Reserve as well as improving interoperability with the PDF. These factors are significant enablers in facilitating future participation by Reserve personnel in overseas missions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2373">The Agreed Programme for Government contains the commitment to fully execute the Reserve Defence Force (RDF) Implementation Plan by the end 2009 target, including the introduction of procedures to allow suitably qualified RDF personnel serve on overseas duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_2374">There are no plans for participation by members of the Reserve in overseas missions in the current year. However, it is hoped that a small number of Reservists will be available to serve overseas by the end of next year (2009). As specified in the Plan, any such participation by members of the Reserve is likely to be in specialised areas such as medical, transport, engineering and communications and information services.  This will also be subject to personnel having suitable qualifications, their personal availability and appropriate advance training.</p>

            <p eId="para_2376">The acquisition of new equipment for the Defence Forces continues to be a key focus for me as Minister for Defence.  Significant investment has taken place in recent years across all facets and elements of the Defence Forces. This investment has been assisted by pay savings arising from the reduction in the strength of the Permanent Defence Force in the context of the White Paper of 2000, which have been re-invested in the provision of equipment and infrastructure for the Defence Forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_2377">A tender competition has been initiated for the acquisition of Light Tactical Armoured Vehicles and tenders are due back next week.  The intention is that the LTAV will complement the Mowag Armoured Personnel Carriers (APCs) in the conduct of conventional and Peace Support Operations and will fill a gap that exists between soft-skinned vehicles and the Mowags.</p>
            <p eId="para_2378">The proposal is to acquire an initial twenty-seven vehicles (17 for overseas mission and 10 at home for training).   The tender competition will allow for two additional options, for another twenty-seven vehicles.   There is a sum of €6m in this year's Estimates provision as a down payment on an LTAV contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_2379">The Department has acquired eighty Mowag APCs since 2001 at a combined cost of some €120m. The final stage payment of just over €6m was paid last January. A contract was entered into with Mowag last year for the provision of a stock of strategic spares to cover all areas where the APCs are deployed. The value of the contract is over €8m spread over three years (2007 to 2009).</p>
            <p eId="para_2380">In recent years, significant work has been carried out on the acquisition of an Integrated Protection and Load Carrying System for individual soldiers. This system includes Body Armour, Helmets, Back Packs (Rucksacks) and Battle Vests.  8000 units of Body Armour, 12,000 Helmets and 12,000 Rucksacks have been delivered in recent years at a combined total cost of €13.5m.</p>
            <p eId="para_2381">To complete the modern integrated protection and load carrying system, an order has been placed for the supply of 12,000 Battle Vests at a cost of some €2.2m.  The Battle Vests are used for the carriage of essential items such as ammunition, personal radio, water and ancillary equipment.  The order will be completed shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2382">A further 500 General Purpose Machine Guns have been ordered from FN Herstal in Belgium for delivery late this year. A sum of €3.8m is provided in 2008 to complete the purchase.</p>
            <p eId="para_2383">With regard to the Air Corps, a total of six utility AW 139 helicopters are being acquired from AgustaWestland, Italy at a cost of €75m, inclusive of VAT. Two AW 139s were delivered in November 2006, two were delivered in 2007 and the final two will be delivered in 2008. The final stage payments for the two helicopters will be made in 2008 at a cost of circa €13.5m.</p>
            <p eId="para_2384">A contract was signed with EADS, Spain, for a major mid-life upgrade for the Air Corps two CASA maritime patrol aircraft in late 2006 at a cost of €16.456m, inclusive of VAT. The upgrade on the first aircraft was completed in 2007. The upgrade on the second will be carried out this year and a final payment in the region of €5.3m will be made.</p>
            <p eId="para_2385">The issue of the replacement of the Air Corps Cessna Fleet is under active consideration at present. The question of funding the replacement programme has to be considered in tandem with the overall equipment requirements of the Defence Forces generally and the funding available for this.</p>
            <p eId="para_2386">On the Naval Service front, a tender competition for the purchase of replacement vessels for the Naval Service commenced in 2007.  The competition is for the purchase of two Offshore Patrol Vessels with an option of a third and one Extended Patrol Vessel with an option on a second.  The options provide an effective value for money opportunity, at locked in prices, to provide replacements for Naval Service vessels which will reach the end of their service life in the years immediately following the current replacement programme.  The competition uses a Restricted Procedure comprising two stages — the first stage a Request for Proposals and the second stage an Invitation to Tender.</p>
            <p eId="para_2387">The closing date for stage 1 was 26 October 2007.  The evaluation of proposals has now been completed.  Detailed specification development for the vessels is nearing conclusion.  It is expected to issue the invitation to tender for the second stage of the competition for the OPV in August this year. Tender evaluation will take place in October and it is intended to award a contract in late 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2388">In relation to the larger EPV, my Department intends to undertake further analysis of the proposals in relation to the EPV project before the second stage is initiated.  Once this has been completed, my Department will review the matter with a view to initiating the second stage of the EPV competition, probably later in the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2389">The purchase of the vessels will be subject to Government approval on funding.   This matter will be reviewed in detail following the conclusion of the tender competition at which point detailed costings will be available to inform the Government decision. It is expected that the vessels will be delivered on a phased basis between 2010 and 2012.</p>

            <p eId="para_2406">I can clarify that there is no pilot project whereby military personnel visit first level and second level schools with a specific view to familiarising students on the activities carried out by the Defence Forces.  Rather, there is ongoing contact between the Defence Forces and the secondary schools and third level institutions primarily with a recruitment focus.</p>
            <p eId="para_2407">As I indicated in my reply to Question No. 48 on the 22nd May 2008, the position is that during visits to schools and third level institutions by Defence Force recruitment teams, the briefings include an explanation of the peacekeeping role of the Defence Forces throughout the world.  The briefings also outline the Defence Forces involvement in previous and current peace support operations.</p>

            <p eId="para_2410">I propose to take Questions Nos. 127 and 137 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2411">Significant progress has been made recently in commissioning from the ranks. The revised cadetship competition is now seen as the primary means of commissioning from the ranks. The cadetship competition has been revised to increase the maximum entry age to 28 and to award bonus marks to candidates with previous experience in the Permanent Defence Force (PDF) or Reserve Defence Force (RDF).</p>
            <p eId="para_2412">Results for the 2006 and 2007 cadetship competitions were encouraging with a total of 23 applicants with military service in the Defence Forces being successful in the 2006 cadetship competition and a further 18 applicants with military service being successful in the 2007 cadetship competition.</p>
            <p eId="para_2413">In addition, since 2005, 5 members of the Defence Forces were commissioned as officers from Direct Entry Competitions for appointments as Engineer Officers in the Corps of Engineers, Conductors in the Army School of Music and Aeronautical Engineer Officers in the Air Corps. Arrangements are currently being made to commission one further member of the Defence Forces to fill an additional Aeronautical Engineer Officer vacancy in the Air Corps.</p>
            <p eId="para_2414">An internal Commissioning From the Ranks competition was held in June 2007.  This competition provided an opportunity for enlisted personnel who had passed the cadet entry age to compete for entry on a potential Officers Course and ultimately, a commission.  As a result of the competition, a total of 24 applicants (23 males and 1 female) were selected from the ranks of Junior and Senior Non-Commissioned Officers.  Following successful completion of training in the Cadet School, these enlisted personnel were commissioned as officers of the Permanent Defence Force on 10 June 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2415">The policy on the running of similar future competitions, to provide Non-Commissioned Officers with the opportunity of obtaining commissioned rank, is being addressed. This issue is also included in the Defence Forces Modernisation Action Plan agreed under "Towards 2016".  I have also asked the Chief of Staff for his views on the prospect of facilitating suitably qualified enlisted personnel to compete internally for technical/professional posts in the officer ranks in the future.</p>

            <p eId="para_2417">There are a number of educational programmes undertaken in the Defence Forces in relation to International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights Law. The military authorities advise that the position is as follows: Lectures are conducted by legal officers on International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights Law on all basic officers courses in the Military College.  In addition, a day-long seminar on International Humanitarian Law is conducted for the Command and Staff Course (CSC).  Non Commissioned Officers and privates are instructed on the fundamental rules of International Humanitarian Law applicable in armed conflicts regarding the protection of war victims.</p>
            <p eId="para_2418">Since the 1970s, legal and line officers of the Permanent Defence Forces have attended the International Military Course on the Law of Armed Conflict at the International Institute of Humanitarian Law in San Remo in Italy. A number of line officers and many legal officers have now completed this course. Since 1990, the Defence Forces have made PDF legal officers available from time to time to conduct courses provided at this Institute.  All officers and senior NCOs proceeding to overseas peace support missions receive briefings at the United Nations Training School in the Curragh on International Humanitarian Law and human rights.</p>

            <p eId="para_2420">The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity for men and women throughout the Defence Forces and to the full participation by women in all aspects of Defence Forces activities. Female strength in the Permanent Defence Force has increased from 468 at the end of 2001 to 564 at the end of June 2008. This equates to a rise from 4.38% to 5.44% in overall strength in the same period. A detailed breakdown of the numbers of females serving in the Permanent Defence Force and the percentage at all ranks, as at 30 June 2008, is presented in the following Tabular Statement.  Neither the Defence Forces nor my Department maintain comparative data regarding other armies within the EU.</p>
            <p eId="para_2421">Unlike many other national armed forces, the Defence Forces have no restrictions as regards the assignment of men or women to the full range of operational and administrative duties. All promotions and career courses are open to both genders on merit. Nevertheless, I remain anxious to explore all avenues for increasing the numbers of women joining the Defence Forces. In 2006, I reduced the minimum height requirement from 5' 4" to 5' 2". This increases the potential recruitment pool of females from 60% to 90% of female population.</p>
            <p eId="para_2422">In 2007, I received the report of a TNS/MRBI study that I had commissioned, titled "Retention and Recruitment of Women in The Defence Forces". This research was commissioned with a view to identifying areas where action can be taken to maximise the number of women applicants to the Defence Forces, hence increasing the number joining.  The question of retention was also studied.</p>
            <p eId="para_2423">The results of the research were, on balance, positive. Three-quarters of serving females agreed that the Defence Forces are a good place to work.  In addition there was a very high level of satisfaction (70%-80%) expressed as regards the issues of job security, pay and benefits and the variety of work on offer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2424">The recommendations of the report have been implemented and the challenges identified therein continue to be addressed.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_2510">It is always a great honour for me to participate in the commissioning ceremony for new officers of our Defence Forces. This was particularly so on the 19th of June at Casement Aerodrome where two ceremonies were held, commencing with the Commissioning of the 26th Air Corps Cadet Class which was followed by the Presentation of the Distinguished Service Medal, with Honour, posthumously to the crew members of the Dauphin DH 248 who lost their lives on the night of 1st July 1999 while returning from a successful rescue mission.</p>
            <p eId="para_2511">Both ceremonies were attended by members of the immediate family and friends of the new officers and the medal recipients as well as a number of distinguished guests, including the Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces, Lieutenant General Dermot Earley, and the General Secretary of the Department of Defence, Michael Howard, along with public representatives and a wide cross-section of other interested parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_2512">In speaking at the commissioning ceremony I reflected on the special commitment that these eight new officers were making in choosing a career of service to their country that will call for courage, commitment and professionalism as their guiding light. I also recognised the proud record of service to the nation that has been given over the years by the Air Corps and its pilots.  I outlined the ongoing investment programme in the Air Corps, both in aircraft and facilities, which ensures a bright future for the Air Corps. In the second ceremony on the day, we remembered the sacrifice of the four members of the Air Corps arising from the tragic accident that occurred in Tramore, Co. Waterford on 1 July 1999.</p>
            <p eId="para_2513">The four crew members who lost their lives that night were:</p>
            <p eId="para_2514">Captain David O'Flaherty</p>
            <p eId="para_2515">Captain Michael Baker</p>
            <p eId="para_2516">Sergeant Patrick Mooney</p>
            <p eId="para_2517">Corporal Niall Byrne.</p>
            <p eId="para_2518">Having considered the events of the night, a military board recommended to me that the Distinguished Service Medal, with Honour, be awarded posthumously to the four men. I had no hesitation in accepting the recommendation of the board. My only regret being the length of time that it had taken to reach this conclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2519">While I understood that coming to the ceremony in Casement Aerodrome evoked very sad memories for the members of the O'Flaherty, Baker, Mooney and Byrne families in attendance, and for all the members of their families and friends, who lost their loved one so suddenly in such a tragic accident, I expressed the hope that they might take some consolation from the honour that was being accorded to the memory of these four brave young men. I presented a Distinguished Service Medal, with Honour, to:</p>
            <p eId="para_2520">Mr. Vincent and Mrs Anna Byrne parents of the late Corporal Byrne;</p>
            <p eId="para_2521">Mrs Monica Mooney, widow of the late Sgt Mooney and</p>
            <p eId="para_2522">Miss Davina O'Flatherty, daughter of the late Captain O'Flaherty.</p>
            <p eId="para_2523">It is hoped that separate arrangements can be made in the near future to present the Distinguished Service Medal to the parents of the late Capt Baker.</p>

            <p eId="para_2526">I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 239 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2527">As Minister for Defence I am delighted with the level of investment in new equipment for the Air Corps in recent years. The comprehensive investment programme included:</p>
            <p eId="para_2528">The delivery of eight Pilatus training aircraft at a total cost of €60m, inclusive of VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_2529">Two light utility EC 135 helicopters acquired from Eurocopter S.A.S. at a cost of €12.8m, inclusive of VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_2530">Six utility AW 139 helicopters acquired from AgustaWestland, Italy at a cost of €75m inclusive of VAT, the final two of which are scheduled for delivery in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2531">A major mid life upgrade on the two Casa maritime patrol aircraft, at a cost of €16.5m, is underway — work on the first aircraft was completed in 2007, work on the second aircraft will be completed this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2532">The issue of the replacement of the Air Corps Cessna Fleet is under active consideration at present. The question of funding the replacement programme has to be considered in tandem with the overall equipment requirements of the Defence Forces generally and the funding available for this.</p>
            <p eId="para_2533">The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 set out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army as the strength sufficient to meet all foreseeable military requirements for the period comprehended by the White Paper (i.e. up to 2010). This remains the position. It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces. This recruitment will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper.</p>

            <p eId="para_2538">I propose to take Questions Nos. 134, 231, 232 and 235 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2539">Ireland is currently contributing 816 Defence Forces personnel to 13 different missions throughout the world. Full details, including ranks, of all personnel currently serving overseas are listed in the tabular statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2540">The main overseas missions, in which Defence Forces personnel are deployed, are the UN Mandated EU multi-national mission to Chad and the Central African Republic — EUFOR TCHAD/RCA  — with 411 personnel, the NATO-led International Security presence (KFOR) in Kosovo with 286 personnel and EUFOR, the EU-led operation in Bosnia and Herzegovina, with 47 personnel.  Other personnel are serving as monitors and observers with the United Nations, the European Union and the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).  Staff are also deployed at the organisational headquarters of the UN, EU, OSCE and NATO. Members of the Irish Defence Forces serve on peacekeeping missions under Chapter VI and Chapter VII of the UN Charter.   Peacekeeping operations mounted under Chapter VI of the UN Charter e.g. UNIFIL in Lebanon, are of the traditional type, where the UN acts as a monitoring, patrolling and observing force after peace has been established.</p>
            <p eId="para_2541">KFOR, EUFOR (Bosnia and Herzegovina), ISAF and EUFOR TCHAD/RCA operate under Chapter VII of the UN Charter, that is, they are entitled to use force to implement their mandates and to protect themselves and the international civil presence. Peacekeeping operations mounted under this Chapter are commonly known as peace enforcement operations where the consent of the parties is not required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2542">The European Union military mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, EUFOR TCHAD/RCA, established under the authority of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1778 (2007), was formally launched by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on 28 January 2008.    The mission achieved Initial Operational Capability on 15 March 2008. This marked the start date for the 12-month duration of the Operation.  The 97th Inf Battalion has been deployed to Chad and its headquarters are locared at Goz Beida in south east Chad.  Ireland is the second largest contributor to the mission with 411 personnel. The aim of the mission is to protect civilians in danger, particularly refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), facilitate the delivery of humanitarian aid, and protect UN personnel.</p>
            <p eId="para_2543">KFOR was established in June 1999, to support the maintenance of civil law and order within Kosovo, so as to develop a climate of safety and security, which will enable the transfer of increased responsibility to the civil authorities.  Ireland has participated in KFOR since August 1999. The Irish (38th) Infantry Group currently serves in the Multi-National Task Force (Centre). In addition to Ireland, the Task Force also comprises troops from the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Sweden, Finland and Latvia. The Task Force's area of responsibility is generally the Pristina region, covering 7 municipalities with a population of approximately 1 million.</p>
            <p eId="para_2544">The Irish contingent currently comprises an APC Mounted Infantry Group of some 214 personnel, including a number of personnel in staff posts at various KFOR Headquarters. Last August, Ireland assumed the role of Framework Nation for the Multinational Task Force (Centre) in Kosovo for a period of 12 months.  An additional 61 Irish personnel are serving with KFOR in support of the Framework Nation role, bringing Ireland's current total deployment to the force to 286.</p>
            <p eId="para_2545">Ireland has participated in EUFOR in Bosnia and Herzegovina since December 2004, the successor mission to the Stabilisation force (SFOR) in Bosnia and Herzegovina with which Ireland had previously been serving since 1997.  The Irish contingent with EUFOR currently comprises 47 personnel. The role of the Defence Forces personnel currently serving in EUFOR is to provide personnel for the headquarters, the Military Police Unit, Verification Teams and the National Support Element. All Irish personnel are located at Camp Butmir, Sarajevo.</p>
            <p eId="para_2546">Ireland has offered, through the UN Standby Arrangements System (UNSAS), to provide up to 850 military personnel for overseas service at any one time. This figure equates to some 10% of Ireland's standing Army (excluding Reserves) and demonstrates Ireland's commitment to the cause of international peace. This is the maximum sustainable commitment that Ireland can make to overseas peacekeeping operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2547">With regard to future deployments, Ireland receives requests, from time to time, in relation to participation in various missions and these are considered on a case-by-case basis.  However, we are currently fairly close to the limit of our sustainable commitments.  It is appropriate that we keep some level of resources in reserve, should we need to reinforce existing missions or to take on additional missions at short notice.  No other deployments are planned or envisaged at this time.</p>

            <p eId="para_2643">The matter to which the deputy is referring is the case of the killing of Privates Thomas Barrett and Derek Smallhorne, while serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) in 1980 and the efforts to bring the alleged perpetrator of the crime to justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_2644">The question of the measures open to the Irish Authorities to bring the alleged perpetrator of this crime to justice have been examined in detail in the Department of Defence in conjunction with the Department of Foreign Affairs, the Attorney General's Office and the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP).</p>
            <p eId="para_2645">The Attorney General has advised that there are no provisions in Irish law which provide a basis for Ireland to pursue a prosecution against the alleged perpetrator.  The Office of the DPP also examined all the available evidence in the case and concluded that he cannot pursue a prosecution against the alleged perpetrator.</p>
            <p eId="para_2646">While the country with primary jurisdiction in this case is Lebanon, the Department of Defence and the Department of Foreign Affairs are also in contact with the US authorities, where the alleged perpetrator resides as a naturalised US citizen. The US authorities are investigating the circumstances surrounding the deaths of Privates Barrett and Smallhorne to see if there is sufficient evidence which may enable them to take a case against the alleged perpetrator.</p>
            <p eId="para_2647">I can assure the House that this matter has not been forgotten and that we  are continuing with our very best efforts in this case.  It has been over 25 years since this tragic event happened and I will continue to actively pursue the matter so that the families concerned can get the justice they deserve.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2655">The 2003 EU Energy Tax Directive incorporated special derogations which allowed specific excise duty reliefs to be applied in a number of Member States. In the Irish context, these derogations allowed inter alia for reduced rates to apply to fuel used for public transport services which includes school transport services. While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date. However the European Commission, who is the deciding authority, refused such requests.</p>
            <p eId="para_2656">The Finance Act 2008, as the Deputy is aware, provided the legislative changes to withdraw the relief in respect of fuel used for public passenger transport vehicles. The relief will be withdrawn with effect from 1 November 2008 and the appropriate full excise rates will apply from that date. In the circumstances outlined above the question of reconsidering or deferring the withdrawal of the existing relief does not therefore arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_2657">The Department of Transport and other relevant line Departments have, in conjunction with my Department, explored alternative mechanisms that might be used to direct Exchequer resources toward such services from that date, subject of course to compatibility with competition and EU State Aid requirements. While the matter is still being considered it is necessary however to stress, despite the claims being made otherwise, that introducing an alternative suitable mechanism is not a straightforward matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2658">The increase in fuel prices is due to changes in the market and is not tax related.  It is an international phenomenon affecting all countries, and all sectors of the economy and society.  Ireland is indeed one of the lower taxation systems in relation to fuel.  In comparison to our competitors, we are below the average price for the EU 15 and substantially below the UK. Furthermore, the excise rates for both diesel and petrol in Ireland have not been increased in the last four Budgets.</p>
            <p eId="para_2659">The Exchequer yield from excise, as excise is set at a nominal amount, does not increase as the price of fuels increase. On the other hand, the yield from VAT, as VAT is set as a percentage of the price, increases as the price of fuels increase.  In this regard it should however be borne in mind that to the extent that spending in the economy is re-allocated to petrol and other oil products, and away from other VAT liable spending, and to the extent that the overall level of economic activity is reduced by higher oil prices, there may be little or no net gain to the Exchequer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2660">Our overall response to the increase in fuel prices is, as was adopted at the recent Ecofin and European Council meetings, that distortionary fiscal and other policy interventions should be avoided as they prevent the necessary adjustments by economic agents. This means that taxation on oil products should not be reduced.  It would send the wrong signal to consumers and to oil producers.</p>

         the tax a farmer (details supplied) has to pay in particular circumstances; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BrianLenihan" as="#Minister_for_Finance" eId="spk_1016">
            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2662">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that the proposed transfer by a farmer, in the circumstances outlined in the Deputy's query, is treated as a disposal for Capital Gains Tax (CGT) purposes.  CGT is applied to the deemed sale price of property which is being disposed and, in this case, the aggregate market value of the land and milk quota at the date of the transfer is considered to be the deemed saleprice.</p>
            <p eId="para_2663">Relief from CGT is available where an individual aged 55 years or over disposes of all or part of his/her "qualifying assets" In this case, qualifying assets include assets which have been owned by the individual for a period of not less than 10 years at the date of the disposal, where these assets have been used for the purposes of farming by the individual throughout that 10-year period.</p>
            <p eId="para_2664">Where the transfer is from parent to child, relief is withdrawn where the child disposes of the assets within 6 years of the date of transfer. The withdrawn relief is chargeable on the child.</p>
            <p eId="para_2665">For the purpose of both Gift and Inheritance Tax (Capital Acquisitions Tax), the relationship between the person who provides the gift or inheritance (the disponer) and the person who receives the gift or inheritance (the beneficiary), determines the maximum tax-free threshold which is known as the Group Threshold".</p>
            <p eId="para_2666">The Group threshold applying to a gift or inheritance received by a child from his/her parents is the Group A threshold and for 2008 this is €521,208.  Any other gifts/ inheritances that might have been received by the beneficiary from within the same Group A threshold (i.e. from parents) since 5 December 1991 will also be taken into account when applying the threshold for the purpose of calculating the Gift/ Inheritance tax.  Each child is separately entitled to its own Group A tax-free threshold.</p>
            <p eId="para_2667">Where a gift or inheritance consists of agricultural lands, the market value of the agricultural lands (taking into account the value of the milk quota being transferred with the agricultural lands) may be reduced by 90% provided certain conditions are met.  These conditions include a requirement that the land is taken by a "farmer", who is defined in the legislation as an individual in respect of whom not less that 80 per cent of his or her assets, after taking the gift or inheritance, consist of agricultural property.  It is also a requirement that the land is not disposed of for 6 years after the date of the receipt of the gift or inheritance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2668">In general terms, a gift of land attracts a Stamp Duty liability based on the market value of the land transferred.  The value of the milk quota attached to the land is included in the market value of the land.  The non-residential property rates of Stamp Duty apply to gifts of this nature but any Stamp Duty payable is reduced by 50% in the case of a gift from a parent to a child.</p>
            <p eId="para_2669">There is an exemption from Stamp Duty in the case of the transfer of land to a person who is under 35 years of age provided that the person holds specified educational qualifications and they comply with certain other conditions.  However, having regard to the details supplied by the Deputy, this exemption would not apply to the transfer in this case.</p>

            <p eId="para_2672">The categories of buildings provided for as non-rateable under Schedule 4 of the Act would principally include those used for public worship, education and institutions of Art and Science.  While Schedule 4 (relevant property not rateable) does not specifically provide for the exemption of community-based childcare organisations, there may be instances where such enterprises which are operated on a not-for-profit basis are deemed not to be rateable if conducted in a community hall.  The activities of a community hall are exempt from rates under Schedule 4, section 15 of the Act, the exception being the premises of a club registered under the Registration of Clubs Act, 1904.  Within the context of the legislation, a community hall means a hall or similar building, which must not be used primarily for profit or gain and is occupied for use by the inhabitants of the locality generally for purposes that are recreational or otherwise of a social nature.   Therefore, if a community childcare facility operates in a community hall as so defined, it will be treated as non-rateable.</p>
            <p eId="para_2673">Similarly, any building used by a community childcare organisation, whether incorporated as a limited company or not, which operates on a non-profit basis as a registered charitable organisation may be deemed to be exempt depending on the terms and conditions of the organisation's Memorandum and Articles of Association. The exemption in such an instance is provided for under Schedule 4, section 16(a) of the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_2674">The local authority may levy rates on all rateable properties entered in the valuation list in accordance with rating legislation, but does not have authority to levy rates on the exempt categories of property provided for in Schedule 4, including property as defined by sections 15 and 16(a) of the Valuation Act, 2001.</p>

            <p eId="para_2678">I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that one officer is assigned full time to Killybegs port and mobile enforcement staff also cover that port as part of their ongoing patrols.  As there has been no shipping activity in Letterkenny port for a long number of years, no officer has been assigned to that port but several Customs staff are based in Letterkenny town.</p>
            <p eId="para_2679">Customs officers have assessed the risk along the west coast over a number of years, including any small ports and other landing places, and this assessment is being continually updated.  All of the coastline is patrolled by Customs officers on an ongoing basis. Attendance by these officers is selective and targeted and is based on analysis and evaluation of national and international seizure trends, traffic frequency, routes and other risk indicators. Attendance can also be as a result of specific intelligence.  These patrols are kept under constant review in particular to take account of available intelligence and emerging smuggling trends.</p>
            <p eId="para_2680">As well as land-based Customs staff, Revenue has a sea-going vessel, the Customs Cutter, which patrols the coastline.  Where necessary, Revenue can call on assistance from the Naval Service and the Air Corps.</p>

This programme seeks to enlist the help of the public in combating drug smuggling by noting any unusual or suspicious activity and reporting it immediately to a local Customs Drugs Watch Officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2682">The Revenue Commissioners have placed an order for a second cutter which is expected to be operational by late 2009 and this vessel will be of further benefit in the fight against illegal drugs.</p>

            <from>Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_2684">As the Deputy will be aware, the tax take on individual cars comprises VRT and VAT. The standard VAT rate of 21% applies to cars.  The VRT liability for passenger cars ('category A' vehicles) is calculated as a percentage of the Open Market Selling Price (OMSP) of the car concerned. The OMSP is defined in Section 133 of the Finance Act 1992 and is the price, inclusive of all taxes and duties, which a vehicle may reasonably be expected to fetch on a first arm's length sale in the open market in the State by retail.</p>
            <p eId="para_2685">In the years 2006-2007, to which the question relates, the VRT rate was based on the engine size of a car. Cars were divided into 3 subcategories, referred to as A1, A2 and A3; based on the engine capacity of the vehicle. The categories of passenger car and associated VRT charges were:</p>
            <p eId="para_2686">Category A1 — up to 1,400cc — 22.5% of OMSP</p>
            <p eId="para_2687">Category A2 — 1,401 to 1,900cc — 25% of OMSP</p>
            <p eId="para_2688">Category A3 — over 1,900cc — 30% of OMSP</p>
            <p eId="para_2689">The basis of calculating VRT for cars changed on 1 July 2008; and VRT is now charged as a percentage of the OMSP on the basis of a car's Carbon Dioxide emissions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2690">I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the tax take for cars for a range of prices/OMSP between €15,000 and €45,000 as requested,  is set out in the following table.  The tax take is the same for each of the last two years.</p>

            <p eId="para_2852">The VAT yield from Oil Products and Motor Vehicles is estimated, as the information to be furnished on VAT returns does not require the yield from a particular sector or sub-sector of trade to be identified. The figures provided for the VAT yield in 2008 are estimates of the amount of VAT yield that would be generated by the volume of clearances of oil products and the number of cars registered for VRT purposes up to the end of the period in question. Depending on the nature of the registration status of a trader, VAT returns can be made monthly, bi-monthly, quarterly, half yearly or annually and this will dictate the point in time when VAT on sales will actually be paid. It should also be noted that the VAT content of purchases of auto diesel is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2853">In relation to tax revenue from motor insurance, a Stamp Duty levy is charged on most non-life insurance premiums, including motor insurance; but it is not possible to distinguish between the different types of insurance business within the yield from that levy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2854">I am further informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the latest year for which relevant figures are available in respect of benefits-in-kind arising from the provision of cars is 2003 and the yield in that year is estimated at €81.6m. This figure includes income earners whose main source of income is assessable to tax under Schedule D (self-employed) but who also have income from an employment subject to PAYE in respect of which a benefit-in-kind arises. The figure for 2003 is based on returns made by individual PAYE taxpayers. New procedures introduced from 1 January 2004 mean that employers are now required to account for PAYE, PRSI and Health Contributions on the taxable value of certain benefits-in-kind and other non-cash benefits provided by them to their employees. Provision was made for the return of this information in the form P35 for 2004 due for filing by employers in February 2005. However, as details of taxable benefits are required in aggregate form only on the P35 return it is not possible to separately identify different types of benefits.</p>

            <p eId="para_2859">I propose to take Questions Nos. 150 to 153, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2860">As the Deputy will be aware, the tax take on individual cars comprises VRT and VAT. The standard VAT rate of 21% applies to cars.  VRT liability for passenger cars ('category A' vehicles) is calculated as a percentage of the Open Market Selling Price (OMSP) of the car concerned. The OMSP is defined in Section 133 of the Finance Act 1992 and is the price, inclusive of all taxes and duties, which a vehicle may reasonably be expected to fetch on a first arm's length sale in the open market in the State by retail.</p>
            <p eId="para_2861">The basis of calculating VRT for cars changed on 1 July 2008; and from that date VRT is charged as a percentage of the OMSP on the basis of a car's Carbon Dioxide emissions.  I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners that the tax take for cars for a range of prices/OMSP, as requested, for each of the CO2 Emissions Categories, is set out in the following table.</p>

            <p eId="para_2944">Assessments are carried out under Section 8 of the Adoption Act, 1991. The requirement of the assessment is to assess both eligibility and suitability of applicants for adoption. Guidance on the intercountry adoption assessment procedure was developed in 1999 in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders and practitioners. This guidance  establishes five standards which all persons must reach in order to be deemed suitable to adopt. The assessment process begins with a preparation course which provides prospective adopters with a chance to reflect on the issues involved in adoption. Some applicants opt to self-select out of the process at that stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2945">For applicants who continue the process, social workers carry out what is known as the "home study" or "social work report" with prospective adopters. Once complete the social worker is required to make a recommendation regarding the applicant's eligibility and suitability. Each case is then reviewed by an Adoption Committee at local level. The Committee is obliged to consider the recommendation of the social worker and in turn decide whether the evidence adduced supports the recommendation made. If the recommendation is agreed by the Committee, the applicants are informed of the outcome. For cases where the applicants are deemed eligible and suitable, the application is forwarded to the Adoption Board for its consideration with a recommendation for the issuing of a declaration of eligibility and suitability — which is required to adopt a child from abroad. Unsuccessful applicants are advised of the outcome and the case does not proceed further. However, if the applicants are not satisfied with the recommendation, they have an opportunity to submit their case to the Adoption Board for further consideration.</p>
            <p eId="para_2946">The Adoption Board considers every case on its merits and can hear applicants on their application if they have received a negative recommendation. Ultimately, the decision to issue a declaration of eligibility and suitability rests with the Board. The Board must consider whether the evidence advanced  supports the recommendation made, whether that recommendation is positive or negative. I am satisfied that this is a fair set of procedures with good checks and balances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2947">My Office is working continuously to further develop the appropriate legislative, policy and administrative framework which will ensure a well regulated regime of both domestic and intercountry adoption. Our aim is to support and protect prospective parents, and even more importantly,the children for whom adoption services are devised and provided.</p>

            <p eId="para_3046">The Government remains committed to the implementation of the Metro North project which is a critical element of the Transport 21 strategy to transform the public transport system in the Greater Dublin Area.</p>
            <p eId="para_3047">The primary purpose of Metro North is to provide a high quality public transport service for north Dublin.  It will serve a number of important generators of traffic — the Mater Hospital, DCU and Dublin Airport.  More importantly the successful implementation of Fingal County Council's development plan, particularly in the greater Swords area, hinges on the delivery of Metro North.</p>
            <p eId="para_3048">The Metro North project is progressing well- the tender documents were issues to the four PPP bidding consortia in mid May, the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) has held meetings with the consortia recently. The bidders are putting their bids together with a view to submitting them towards the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3049">Detailed planning and design work on the project is ongoing and the RPA expects to lodge an application with An Bórd Pleanála for a railway order in the current year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3050">The target date for completion of the project is 2013.  However, this date will be critically determined by the outcome of both the planning and procurement processes.  These processes will also determine when the main project will commence, when a contractor will be appointed, when the project will be completed and when operations will commence.</p>
            <p eId="para_3051">In January 2008, the Government approved the funding structure for the Metro North PPP, including an Exchequer provision for advance works ahead of the main PPP contract.</p>

            <p eId="para_3067">My Department has not refused Dublin Bus any proposed changes to its Route 37 bus service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3068">Where proposed services by the Company are deemed to be in competition with services that are the subject of a licence held by a private bus operator issued under the Road Transport Act, 1932, Dublin Bus is required to obtain my consent under section 25 of the Transport Act 1958 before the Company can introduce such services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3069">My Department received a proposal from Dublin Bus on 1st May, 2008 for changes to its Route 37, the proposal made no reference to safety issues at the existing terminus. Following an initial examination, which included consultation with Dublin Bus, my Department deemed that the proposal would give rise to competition with an existing licensed service.</p>
            <p eId="para_3070">Accordingly, my Department advised Dublin Bus on 9th June, 2008 that an application in accordance with Section 25 of the Transport Act, 1958 was required should the Company wish to pursue the introduction of the change.  Alternatively, Dublin Bus was also advised that it could review its proposals in order to avoid competition with the licensed operator.  No revised proposal has been received in my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3071">The safety and location of bus stops is a matter for the Garda Síochána and controls on the parking of buses generally are applied under the Road Traffic Acts 1961 to 2007.  It is the responsibility of Dublin Bus to obtain approval from the Garda Síochána under Section 85 of the Road Traffic Act 1961 for all stops on existing routes or stops along proposed routes, including the terminal points.</p>

            <p eId="para_3084">The Programme for Government 2007-2012 contains a commitment that my Department will build on the success thus far of the Rural Transport Initiative (RTI) and extend the Rural Transport Programme nationwide.</p>
            <p eId="para_3085">My Department is giving effect to this commitment through the Rural Transport Programme (RTP), launched in February 2007, which places the former pilot Rural Transport Initiative on a mainstreamed basis with significantly increased funding which in the current year is €11m, an increase of €2m on 2007. Under the Programme, thirty-four community transport groups around the country are being funded to address social exclusion in their rural areas arising from unmet public transport needs. Older people and people with disabilities form the core customer base of the RTP. Earlier this year I was delighted to announce increased funding for the Programme, which is providing for additional services together with expanded area coverage.</p>
            <p eId="para_3086">Pobal, which administers the RTP on behalf of the Department, has commenced a process to extend the Programme on a phased basis with a goal of achieving nation-wide coverage in due course in line with Government policy. It is planned that by end-2008, RTP Groups will be operational in every county and will be working towards maximising coverage in their operational areas. At present, County Louth is the only county without a scheme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3222">The national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive (HSE) payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.  The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full.  Over 290,000 people will benefit from this scheme in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3223">In January 2007, the weekly rate of fuel allowance was increased by €4 from €14 to €18 a week or €21.90 for recipients living in designated smokeless areas.  The income threshold for eligibility for fuel allowance was also increased by €49 from €51 to €100 above the appropriate weekly rate of state pension (contributory).  The duration of payment of fuel allowance was extended to 30 weeks in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3224">According to the Consumer Price Index for May 2008, the overall cost of home heating fuel products has increased by 7.4% in the last 12 months and by 120.3% since the inception of the fuel allowance scheme in 1987. The rate of fuel allowance payment has increased from £5.00 (€6.35) in 1987 to a current value of €18.00, an increase of 183.5%.   The fuel allowance rates and the CPI for home heating fuels since 1987 are shown in the following tabular statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3225">Electricity and gas allowances under the household benefits package, are payable throughout the year to over 355,000 pensioners, people with disabilities, and carer households towards their heating, light and cooking costs at an estimated overall scheme cost of €159m in 2008.  The electricity allowance covers standing charges plus VAT and up to 2,400 units of electricity in each billing period, increased from 1,800 units in January 2007.  The gas allowance covers a cash equivalent amount.</p>
            <p eId="para_3226">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme can also be used to assist people in certain circumstances with specific heating needs due to infirmity or a particular medical condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_3227">The income maintenance needs of those on social welfare payments have been met in recent years through increased primary social welfare rates.  Government policy has focused on significantly increasing social welfare rates to ensure that people can meet their basic living costs, including heating, throughout the year and also achieve an improvement in quality of life.  This is a more costly approach than increasing fuel allowance as the increase is paid for the full year and not just the 30 weeks of the winter heating season. Since December 2001, overall inflation has increased by 27% while energy product prices have increased by over 71.4%.  However, increases in social welfare payments have been between 71% and 88% in the same period.</p>
            <p eId="para_3228">The fuel poverty figure referred to by the Deputy, while from a 2007 report, actually relates to 2001. The report concerned, the "All Ireland policy paper on fuel poverty and health", which was published by The Institute of Public Health acknowledged that there has been an overall decline in fuel poverty over the past decade and that while the fuel and household benefits package has sought to be responsive to the issue of rising fuel prices, putting warmth into thermally inefficient homes is ultimately a bad long-term investment.  A primary contributory factor to fuel poverty has been identified as the energy efficiency of the private and public housing stock.</p>
            <p eId="para_3229">The Department is cooperating with a number of organisations including Sustainable Energy Ireland, Combat Poverty Agency and the Department of the Environment Heritage and Local Government in action research projects on energy efficiency.  Reports on these research projects will help to inform Government policy in relation to fuel poverty.</p>
            <p eId="para_3230">Any improvements to social welfare programmes to assist with heating costs would have considerable cost implications and will be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of resources available for improvements in social welfare payments generally.  The main focus of the Government will be on increasing social welfare payments in real terms to enable social welfare recipients to better meet heating and other needs.</p>

         her plans to review the grant aid available to parents to meet the cost of school clothing and footwear; if her attention has been drawn to the recent Combat Poverty Agency conference highlighting the financial difficulties that families face putting children through school; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3325">The Back to School Clothing and Footwear allowance scheme provides a one-off payment to eligible families to assist with the extra costs when their children start school each autumn. The allowance is not intended to meet the full cost of school clothing and footwear but only to provide assistance towards these costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3326">A person may qualify for payment of an allowance if they are in receipt of a social welfare or Health Service Executive payment, are participating in an approved employment scheme or attending a recognised education and training course and have household income below standard levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_3327">The back to school clothing and footwear allowance scheme is an important support for parents at a time of particular financial strain.  The improvements to the scheme in recent years have provided a major boost to meeting the financial costs associated with return to school for those who are most need assistance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3328">Since 2005, the allowance has been increased from €80 to €200 in respect of qualified children aged from 2 to 11 years and from €150 to €305 for those aged from 12 to 22 years.  These are increases of 150% and 103%, respectively.  In 2006, the income limits for BSCFA were increased by €50 to €100 above the state pension (contributory) rate.</p>
            <p eId="para_3329">The number of children benefiting from the allowance increased from 161,000 in 2006 to over 180,000 in 2007.  The annual expenditure on the scheme has increased from €16.7m in 2005 to €40m in 2007.  Over €46m has been provided for the scheme in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3330">These improvements in BSCFA are very significant when viewed in the context of clothing and footwear price trends.  According to the Consumer Price Index for May 2008, the overall cost of clothing and footwear has fallen by 3.7% over the past twelve months.  The adequacy of back to school clothing and footwear allowance payments will be kept under review.  Any changes to the structure of the scheme, rates of payment, income limits or amendments to the qualifying criteria would have cost implications and would have to be considered in a budgetary context and in the light of resources available for improvements in social welfare payments generally.</p>

            <p eId="para_3332">The national fuel allowance scheme was introduced in 1987 as a result of a Government decision to rationalise the Urban and National Fuel Schemes which existed at that time. The scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive payments, with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season.</p>
            <p eId="para_3333">The smokeless fuel allowance scheme was introduced in Dublin and the surrounding areas in October 1990, and extended later to other parts of the country, in response to smoke control regulations introduced by the Department of the Environment. This allowance is paid in addition to the fuel allowance in areas where the sale of bituminous fuel is banned.</p>

            <p eId="para_3407">The Rural Social Scheme (RSS) was established to provide income support for low income farmers and fisherpersons who are in receipt of certain long-term social welfare payments and to provide certain services of benefit to rural communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_3417">A copy of the application for the EU Single Payment Scheme for the current year, which includes a valid herd number together with a copy of the associated receipt (official proof of postage) or</p>

            <p eId="para_3422">The Rural Social Scheme (RSS) was launched in May 2004 with provision for 2,500 participant places. Since the introduction of the scheme, I have made a number of positive changes for the overall benefit of participants, which are outlined below.</p>
            <p eId="para_3423">With effect from 22nd May 2006, I extended the eligibility criteria for participants:</p>

            <p eId="para_3429">With effect from 8th September 2006, I extended the eligibility criteria for Fisherpersons to include:</p>
            <p eId="para_3430">A self-employed fisherperson whose boat has been issued with a Pot Fishing Licence. The Department of Communication, Marine and Natural Resources introduced this for small fishing boats such as currachs who traditionally have fished for Lobsters and were mainly unlicensed;</p>
            <p eId="para_3431">A self-employed fisherperson who has been issued with a Commercial Eel  Fishing Licence from one of the seven Regional Fisheries Boards;</p>

            <p eId="para_3434">Permit holders for shell fishing issued by a registered Cooperative</p>
            <p eId="para_3435">It should be noted however, that this latter category has not applied to new applicants since 26th July 2007.  The ‘Salmon Hardship Scheme' had not been finalised by the RSS renewal date in 2007 and an exception was made to allow participants holding a Commercial Salmon Fishing Licence at that time to renew their 2007/2008 contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_3436">For those existing participants who have still not received compensation under the "Salmon Hardship Scheme" I am making a further exception for the 2008/2009 contract year by allowing them to renew their contract again provided they satisfy all other conditions. This category is being kept under review and local Implementing Bodies will be able to advise those participants of any further updates.</p>
            <p eId="para_3437">I have also made a number of general improvements to the scheme which include the provision of 100 additional places in September 2006, the introduction of new work measures, the introduction of temporary contracts in order to allow Implementing Bodies to cover those on long-term absences such as Maternity, Carers and Adoptive leave.

            <p eId="para_3444">Category B catered for farmers who made an investment in production capacity in a farming sector for which a direct payment under Livestock Premia and/or Arable Aid schemes would have been payable during the reference period 2000-2002.  Investments could include purchase or long-term lease of land, purchase of suckler and/or ewe quota or other investments.  The application was in respect of the purchase of suckler quota but the person named was deemed ineligible under this category, as he did not purchase any suckler quota.</p>
            <p eId="para_3445">Category D catered for farmers who inherited or purchased land and who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who did not receive direct payments in respect of that scheme year.  The person named commenced farming and received a herd number in July 2000 and therefore he could not be catered for under the New Entrant category of the National Reserve.  An application under the 2002 Area Based Compensatory Allowance Scheme was received from the person named on 8 May 2002.  One of the primary provisions of the 2002 Area Based Compensatory Allowance Scheme was that applicants were required to maintain a minimum stocking density of 0.15 livestock units per forage hectare of the farm for at least four consecutive months.  However, where the holding of an applicant was identified as potentially not meeting this minimum stocking density requirement, the applicant was invited to submit evidence of satisfactory stocking i.e. Flock Register, Horse Passports, or, alternatively, the applicant could submit details of a REPS plan or a Commonage Framework Plan, which provided for a lower stocking level.</p>
            <p eId="para_3446">As the stocking density of the holding of the person named did not appear to meet the minimum required, the person named was written to and invited to submit appropriate evidence of livestock units maintained on the farm. On receipt of this evidence the application was further processed and full payment of €4,126.60 issued to the person named on 10 September 2003. The payable order was cashed on 22 September 2003.</p>

            <p eId="para_3448">The Council of Agriculture Ministers provided for the introduction of a Dairy Premium in 2004 as part of the CAP Mid-Term Review agreement in June 2003. The agreement also provided for the decoupling of the Dairy Premium to become part of the Single Payment Scheme, which was also introduced as part of that agreement. Council Regulation (EC) No. 1782/2003 provided that the Dairy Premium could be decoupled in 2005, 2006 or 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_3449">The Minister for Agriculture and Food decided to decouple the Dairy Premium in Ireland with effect from 2005. Therefore, while the Dairy Premium was paid to eligible applicants as a coupled scheme in 2004, in 2005 an amount equivalent to the Dairy Premium established in March 2005 was incorporated as part of the Single Payment for eligible farmers. The 2006 increase in the Dairy Premium was added to the payment entitlements of those farmers, who benefited from the decoupled premium in respect of 2005.</p>
            <p eId="para_3450">In order to be eligible to benefit under the 2005 decoupled Dairy Premium Scheme a farmer was required, inter alia, to hold a milk quota on 31 March 2005, and deliver milk from his/her holding during the 2004/2005 milk quota year or commence milk deliveries in his/her own right prior to the deadline for application.</p>
            <p eId="para_3451">The provisions governing the transfer of entitlements under the Single Payment Scheme, including entitlements which include a dairy premium element, are contained in Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003. If the holder of these entitlements utilised 80% or more of his entitlements in a scheme year, he or she can permanently transfer the entitlements. Otherwise, he or she can permanently transfer or lease the entitlements with an equivalent number of eligible hectares.</p>
            <p eId="para_3452">The provisions on the transfer of milk quotas upon the sale of the relevant lands are contained in the European Communities (Milk Quota) Regulations, 2000 (S.I. No 94 of 2000), as amended.</p>

            <p eId="para_3458">The current suite of Afforestation Grant and Premium Schemes, along with the various support measures, is the most financially attractive package made available in the history of forestry in Ireland.  The establishment grant covers 100% of the planting costs, while the annual forestry premium is payable to farmers for 20 years. Both the grant and premium rates have been reviewed in recent times and increased in order to make the scheme more attractive.</p>
            <p eId="para_3459">Under the Forest Environment Protection Scheme (FEPS), landowners can receive a premium of up to €200 per hectare, over and above their forestry premium, should they choose to participate in the scheme, which promotes the establishment of high nature value forestry. This scheme was launched as a pilot in 2007, and after some refinements, including reducing the planting level threshold from 8 hectares to 5 hectares, has been adopted into the suite of afforestation schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3460">The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food provides funding to a variety of organisations within the sector to promote new forestry planting, sustainable management of the growing crop and the initiatives  to effectively market the timber produced. We are also undertaking significant promotional activities to encourage further participation in forestry. Radio advertisements aired earlier this year, highlighting the benefits of planting forests, are supplemented by promotion and publicity in other media throughout the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3461">Earlier this year Mr. John Malone completed a review of the factors affecting the rate of afforestation in Ireland. His report outlined a number of recommendations, aimed at furthering the afforestation program, which are currently under review.</p>
            <p eId="para_3462">I believe that the combination of the very attractive financial package available and the significant supporting promotional efforts being undertaken will assist in furthering our afforestation programme in 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_3483">The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support. An SNA may be allocated to meet the care needs of a younger pupil.  For some pupils, as they mature, their care needs may diminish over time. For example, an incontinence difficulty in a 4 year old pupil may be fully addressed by the time the pupil is a teenager.  In such situations, the NCSE will review and adjust the overall level of SNA support in the school concerned.  This may mean that some pupils who had previously been supported by a full time SNA may have their needs met through the shared support of an SNA or perhaps they may have no need of SNA support.</p>

            <p eId="para_3509">As the Deputy may be aware, the National Council for Special Education is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants (SNAs) to schools to support children with special needs. Applications for SNAs may be considered by the NCSE where a pupil has a significant medical need for such assistance, a significant impairment of physical or sensory function or where their behaviour is such that they are a danger to themselves or to other pupils. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.</p>
            <p eId="para_3510">All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_3511">I have arranged for the details supplied by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.</p>

            <p eId="para_3517">In general the arrangements for supporting secretarial and caretaking services in schools mirror those for providing support funding to schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3518">Primary and secondary schools are funded through capitation grants and likewise secretarial and caretaking services are funded by grants that are related to the number of pupils in the school.</p>
            <p eId="para_3519">It is the case that a small number of primary and post-primary schools continue to have caretaker and secretary posts funded under a scheme that was put in place in 1978 but which is being phased out as it has been superseded by the grant scheme that I have mentioned. The original 1978 scheme covered a relatively small number of primary and secondary schools and the decision to phase it out was part of a policy decision to spread the support more widely and ultimately cover all primary and secondary schools with funding for such services.</p>
            <p eId="para_3520">The funding approach adopted for caretaking and secretarial provision in second level schools in the VEC and Community and Comprehensive sectors schools is in line with the funding mechanisms that apply generally in those schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_3521">The amount of funding given to primary and secondary schools is not directly linked to any particular pay rates and furthermore schools have discretion how to apply this funding across their support service needs. My Department does not have a direct role in determining the pay and conditions under which they are engaged. These are matters to be agreed between the staff concerned and the school authorities. However, Boards of Management of individual schools are expected to comply with employment legislation and are advised accordingly in guidance from my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3522">In the context of discussions on the Social Partnership Agreement Towards 2016 an Informal Forum was established in the public sector to explore a number of staffing-related issues arising in companies/bodies operating in the voluntary/community sector that are largely funded from public funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_3523">As part of that informal process my Department has facilitated a number of meetings between the managerial bodies of schools employing secretaries and caretakers and the IMPACT and SIPTU trade unions representing the grades concerned. The most recent meeting took place on 11th March 2008 at which my officials undertook to continue to facilitate those discussions. In addition representatives of the management bodies of schools agreed to meet separately with the trade unions concerned on issues of concern to their members.</p>

            <p eId="para_3530">As the Deputy will be aware, significant investment has been made in Defence Forces equipment in recent years to provide them with the most modern equipment to undertake tasks assigned to them by Government. The equipment issued to the Defence Forces is also in keeping with the most modern requirements from the health and safety perspective. On-going investment in the Defence Forces will ensure that this remains to be the case and will continue to be a key focus for me as Minister for Defence.</p>
            <p eId="para_3531">The equipment provided to Defence Forces personnel serving both at home and on overseas missions ensures that troops are able to carry out their assigned missions, as well as providing the required protection specific to each particular mission.  In the case of the EU mission to Chad and the Central African Republic, the Defence Forces have deployed a full range of Force Protection assets and communication and logistical equipment.  The Force Protection assets include twenty-one Mowag APCs, armoured vehicles and indirect fire capabilities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3532">On-going threat assessments are carried out in mission areas in which Irish troops are serving and a continuous review process on both personal equipment and force assets is in place to ensure that Defence Forces personnel are appropriately equipped to fulfil their role and discharge their mandate on an on-going basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_3535">I propose to take Questions Nos. 229 and 238 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3536">The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 set out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force as the strength sufficient to meet all foreseeable military requirements for the period comprehended by the White Paper (i.e. up to 2010). This remains the position. It is my intention to maintain the established Government policy of ongoing recruitment to the Defence Forces. This recruitment will continue to maintain the strength at the level set out in the White Paper.  A detailed breakdown of the numbers in the Permanent Defence Force by rank as at 30 September 1998 and 31 May 2008 are in the form of the following Tabular Statement.</p>
            <p eId="para_3537">The agreed Programme for Government provides for an additional provision of up to 350 troops to be in training at any given time.  However, due primarily to the requirement to prioritise funding for the Chad mission, it has not been possible to provide funding to activate this provision in 2008. This matter will be further considered in the context of the 2009 Estimates.</p>
            <p eId="para_3538">The White Paper on Defence provides for an allocation of up to 850 Permanent Defence Force personnel to be deployed overseas at any one time. While this may be exceeded for short periods, deployments above this level are not sustainable on an ongoing basis within existing resources.  Any commitments to EU or UN missions will be met within this context.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_3751">The Naval Service provides the maritime element of the Defence Forces and has a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime defence requirements.  In the 2000 White Paper on Defence, the Government decided that the Naval Service would be based on an 8-ship flotilla and committed to a modernisation and replacement strategy to maximise the operational capacity of those 8 vessels consistent with the roles assigned to the Naval Service.  All eight ships are involved in coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State in that part of the seas where State jurisdiction applies such as Internal Waters, Territorial Sea and the Irish Sector of the Exclusive EconomicZone.</p>
            <p eId="para_3752">The Naval Service provides a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  The Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the Exclusive Fishery Limits.  At present, fishery protection activity accounts for roughly 90% of all Naval Service patrol time.  However, as the need arises, Naval Service vessels may be deployed to other duties such as aid to the civil power, search and rescue, drug interdiction operations and assistance with pollution control.  There are no plans for the participation of the Naval Service in international operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_3753">The Government is committed to continuous investment in the equipment needs of the Naval Service to enable it to carry out the roles assigned to it.  The 2000 White Paper on Defence specifically provides that "New vessels will be brought on stream to replace older ones as these fall due for replacement".  Naval Service Vessels are replaced when they have come to the end of their useful life, which is normally around 30 years.  Three ships will fall due for replacement over the next 3 to 5 years — LE Emer, commissioned in 1978, LE Aoife, commissioned in 1979 and LE Aishling, commissioned in 1980.</p>
            <p eId="para_3754">Following a detailed examination of the needs of the Naval Service within my Department a vessel replacement strategy for the Naval Service was put in place to cover the period up to 2012.  The strategy combined with a continuous process of refurbishment will ensure that the operational capability of the Naval Service is maintained at a very high level.</p>
            <p eId="para_3755">Following Government approval in July 2007, notice of a tender competition for the purchase of replacement vessels for the Naval Service was sent to the Official Journal of the European Union on 24 August 2007.  The competition is for the purchase of two Offshore Patrol Vessels with an option of a third and one Extended Patrol Vessel with an option on a second.  The options provide an effective value for money opportunity, at locked in prices, to provide replacements for Naval Service vessels which will reach the end of their service life in the years immediately following the current replacement programme.  The competition uses a Restricted Procedure comprising two stages — the first stage a Request for Proposals and the second stage an Invitation to Tender.</p>
            <p eId="para_3756">The closing date for stage 1 was 26 October 2007.  The evaluation of proposals has now been completed.  Detailed specification development for the vessels is nearing conclusion.  It is expected to issue the invitation to tender for the second stage of the competition for the OPV in August this year.  Tender evaluation will take place in October and it is intended to award a contract in late 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3757">In relation to the larger EPV, my Department intends to undertake further analysis of the proposals in relation to the EPV project before the second stage is initiated.  Once this has been completed, my Department will review the matter with a view to initiating the second stage of the EPV competition, probably later in the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3758">The purchase of the vessels is subject to Government approval on funding.  This matter will be reviewed in detail following the conclusion of the tender competition at which point detailed costings will be available to inform the Government decision.  It is expected that the vessels will be delivered on a phased basis between 2010 and 2012.</p>

            <from>Minister for Defence (Deputy Willie O’Dea)</from>
            <p eId="para_3761">I propose to take Questions Nos. 234 and 237 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_3762">The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 sets out a figure of 10,500 personnel for the Permanent Defence Force, comprising 930 for the Air Corps, 1,144 for the Naval Service and 8,426 for the Army.</p>
            <p eId="para_3763">The Naval Service provides the maritime element of the Defence Forces and has a general responsibility to meet contingent and actual maritime defence requirements. The Naval Service operates eight general purpose patrol ships.  All eight ships are involved in coastal and offshore patrolling and surveillance for the State in that part of the seas where State jurisdiction applies.</p>
            <p eId="para_3764">The Naval Service provides a fishery protection service in accordance with the State's obligations as a member of the European Union.  The Service is tasked with patrolling all Irish waters from the shoreline to the outer limits of the Exclusive Fishery Limits.  At present, fishery protection activity accounts for roughly 90% of all Naval Service patrol time.  However, as the need arises, Naval Service vessels may be deployed to other duties such as aid to the civil power, search and rescue, drug interdiction operations and assistance with pollution control.</p>
            <p eId="para_3765">The current Exclusive Fishery Limits extend to 200 miles offshore and cover an area of 132,000 nautical square miles.  The Naval Service currently patrols the entire 200 mile limit and periodically patrols beyond these limits to protect specific fisheries.  These patrols are carried out on a regular and frequent basis and are directed to all areas of Irish waters as necessary.  The number of Patrol Vessels on patrol in Irish waters at any one time varies between three and seven.  The Naval Service is committed to having at least three vessels on patrol within the Irish Exclusive Economic Zone at any one time.</p>
            <p eId="para_3766">Naval Service patrols are complemented by assistance provided by the Air Corps.  The Air Corps Maritime Squadron carries out aerial surveillance of territorial waters using the two CASA maritime patrol aircraft.</p>
            <p eId="para_3767">The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of maritime Search and Rescue services within the Irish Search and Rescue region.  In accordance with the roles assigned to them by Government in the White Paper on Defence, the Defence Forces are committed to providing support to the civil authorities including in relation to Search and Rescue.  In this regard, the Naval Service and Air Corps provide support to the Coast Guard as the need arises and within their available capability.</p>
            <p eId="para_3768">Responsibility for the prevention of drug trafficking and people trafficking rests primarily with the Revenue Commissioners and An Garda Síochána respectively. However, the White Paper on Defence provides for a security role for the Naval Service and the Air Corps to assist and support the civil authorities in this important work. Government measures to improve law enforcement in relation to drugs, including the establishment in 1993 of a Joint Task Force involving An Garda Síochána, the Customs Service and the Naval Service, have helped to maximise the effective use of Naval Service resources in combating drug trafficking.  The Air Corps provide air support and, on occasion, carry the Customs National Drugs Team in an observational capacity for the purpose of monitoring vessels suspected of drug trafficking and other illegal activities.

            <p eId="para_3799">The European Defence Agency (EDA) was established under a Joint Action of the Council of Ministers on 12 July, 2004 "to support the Member States and the Council in their effort to improve European defence capabilities in the field of crisis management and to sustain the European Security and Defence Policy as it stands now and develops in the future".  The EDA is an Agency of the European Union.  Ireland participates in the framework of the Agency and is represented on the Steering Board by me.</p>
            <p eId="para_3800">The Agency has made significant progress in many areas since 2004, such as the development of the inter-Governmental regime for defence procurement of which Ireland is a member.  The EDA Code of Conduct for defence procurement and a Code of Best Practice in the Supply Chain was developed to ensure transparency in procurement and to create a more competitive European defence equipment market.</p>
            <p eId="para_3801">There are 25 subscribing Member States (including Ireland) to the Code of Conduct.   Under the regime an Electronic Bulletin Board (EBB) has been developed as a single portal for advertising defence equipment contract opportunities and 2007 was the first full year of operation through the Code of Conduct.</p>
            <p eId="para_3802">My Department is obliged to advertise tender competitions for defensive equipment with a value of €1m and over on the EBB.  To date, four tender competitions, including the current tender competition for the provision of Light Tactical Armoured Vehicles to the Defence Forces, have been advertised by the Contracts Branch in my Department on the EBB.  The benefits from advertising on the EBB in the EDA relate directly to the ability to attract tenders from a wide number of companies in the relevant fields leading to a more competitive tendering process.  It is not possible to directly attribute savings to the use of the EBB, but I am confident that the use of the system will assist my Department in obtaining value for money when placing contracts for defensive equipment.</p>

            <p eId="para_3824">Part 11 of the Criminal Justice Act 2006, which provides for civil proceedings in relation to anti-social behaviour by adults, was commenced on 1 January, 2007.  Part 13 of the Act, relating to anti-social behaviour by children, was commenced on 1 March, 2007.  These provisions set out an incremental procedure for addressing anti-social behaviour by adults and children.  With regard to children, these range from a warning from a member of An Garda Síochána, to a good behaviour contract involving the child and his or her parents or guardian, to referral to the Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme and to the making of a behaviour order by the Children's Court.</p>
            <p eId="para_3825">I am informed by the Garda authorities that up to 31 May, 2008, 700 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and 351 to children.  There have been ten formal good behaviour contracts agreed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3826">I am further informed that in 2007, 32 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and 27 to children in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR) South Garda Division, which includes Dublin 24.  One good behaviour contract was agreed.  In 2008, up to 31 May, 12 behaviour warnings were issued to adults and 11 to children.  No civil orders, in the case of adults, or behaviour orders, in the case of children, have been issued to date.</p>
            <p eId="para_3827">In setting up the regime in the Criminal Justice Act 2006, the intention was that these warnings or good behaviour contracts would themselves address the problem behaviour.  It is only if they fail that a court order will be applied for.  In any case, it inevitably takes time to reach the stage where a court order itself might be sought.  No significance therefore should be attached to the fact that the stage has not yet been reached in the process where a court order has been issued.  Where warnings or good behaviour contracts do not succeed in altering a person's behaviour, however, they will culminate in an order being sought by the Garda authorities from the courts.</p>

This commitment to the waste hierarchy has added significance in the context of the requirements of the EU Landfill Directive to divert waste from landfill. Meeting this obligation will entail doubling the existing level of diversion from landfill by 2010 and further increases in diversion in subsequent years. This is a process which will be assisted by the major review of waste policy, also provided for in the Programme, which is now underway and which will address how best to implement waste prevention and minimisation, and the emergence of new technologies in waste management.</p>

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_3881">Two site investigations have been carried out at the steelworks site since 2000. Enviros Aspinwall carried out a desk-top study in 2002 on behalf of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources and a more recent site investigation by White Young Green, in 2005, was organised by Cork County Council on behalf of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_3882">The 2002 study identified a range of issues which would require to be addressed into the future including site security, the disposal of radioactive scrap which at the time was stored on the area known as Rocky Island, the decontamination and demolition of the steelworks buildings and the carrying out of a comprehensive site investigation survey to inform decisions on remediation tailored to future end use of the site.</p>
            <p eId="para_3883">The State, acting through my Department in a co-ordinating role, took over custody of the site from the liquidator in June 2003 as mandated by Government. The mandate required the Department to co-ordinate all legal actions in relation to the site, to cover matters such as site security, ongoing maintenance, and other issues arising, and to enable a site investigation to be carried out to assist in determining the best option, economically and environmentally, for the future use of the site and its remediation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3884">In 2003, the Department appointed Lisney's to sell any remaining plant and machinery at the site. In 2004 a proposal was made to Lisney for the scrapping of the remaining plant and machinery and the metal content of the buildings on site. The final agreement with the successful tenderer was a combined sale of metal content for scrap, netted of the cost of decontaminating the melt shop area of the plant. The decontamination and demolition of the buildings on site is now complete.</p>
            <p eId="para_3885">Following the demolition works large volumes of waste material remained on the site.  Significant quantities of inert construction and demolition (C&amp;D) waste have been re-used on site to fill voids, leaving remaining waste for disposal.  Procurement of a contractor for site surface clearance, back filling of voids and the disposal of the remaining surface wastes was undertaken. This was awarded to Hammond Lane Metal Company Ltd.</p>
            <p eId="para_3886">The current issue relates to the uncovering by a sub-contractor of a sub-surface sludge pit during these surface clearance works. Owing to the potential extent and nature of the waste, the extent of the minimum works required to remove the risk of environmental pollution remaining unclear, and the extent to which there may be a wide range of practical measures which might be necessary to remove the risk of pollution, my Department instructed that excavations of the material should stop.</p>
            <p eId="para_3887">The sub-contractor persisted with unauthorised works and ultimately it became necessary to terminate the contract. My Department's instructions, which were endorsed by the Environmental Protection Agency, were designed to prevent further piecemeal unauthorised works with unknown environmental consequences.</p>
            <p eId="para_3888">The site investigation by White Young Green in 2005 indicated no evidence of any immediate threat to human health or the environment.  My Department has now re-engaged these consultants to carry out an independent and rigorous assessment of site conditions following the unauthorised works. This assessment, which will begin in the coming week, will involve analysis of soil, slag, dust, surface and ground water samples for all likely contaminants, including heavy metals such as chromium, and it will be utilised in determining the best way forward in serving the site from an environmental and health and safety point of view in the short term.</p>
            <p eId="para_3889">I am currently preparing a report to update the Government on the outcome of the extensive site investigations and the interim works carried out since 2004. Decisions by Government on the future use of the site will determine the level and extent of further remediation required.</p>
            <p eId="para_3890">My Department is compiling details of the costs of the previous studies, which will be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_3899">My Department's role in the pilot central heating scheme, which is being administered by Dublin City Council in association with Energy Action Ltd, relates mainly to the recoupment of a percentage of the cost of the works undertaken.  The pilot scheme has operated under the framework of the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme with my Department recouping 80% of the cost of works to Dublin City Council and the authority providing the remaining 20% from its own resources.

            <from>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Deputy John Gormley)</from>
            <p eId="para_3904">The Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2007, which revised earlier regulations, are intended to facilitate the achievement by Ireland of the 60% packaging waste recovery target by end 2011 as set out in Directive 2004/12/EC which amended the original Directive 94/62/EC on packaging and packaging waste.   The principle underlying the Directive and the Regulations is that of Producer Responsibility i.e. that the costs of ensuring the appropriate recovery of packaging materials falls on those who have placed them on the market.</p>
            <p eId="para_3905">Enforcement of the Regulations is primarily a matter for local authorities.  Some €8.9m was allocated to local authorities in 2007 from the Environment Fund to support stepped-up enforcement of waste management legislation generally and a further €10.8m is being allocated for 2008.  Local authorities have been requested to give particular priority to enforcement of the 2007 Packaging Regulations.  The Office of Environmental Enforcement, which is located within the Environmental Protection Agency, has set up a National Enforcement Network  to ensure a consistent standard of enforcement quality and evenness of activity across local authorities in the area of environmental legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3906">The comprehensive structures now in place are delivering a significantly enhanced waste enforcement service and the resources available are sufficient to ensure that no company is placed at a competitive disadvantage by virtue of "free riders" operating within the marketplace.  The allocation of dedicated waste enforcement staff to local authorities, coupled with the efforts of the National Enforcement Network in co-ordinating activities and providing training, means that non-compliance with waste legislation, including the Packaging Regulations, can be tackled in a more targeted and focussed manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_3907">Under the Regulations, all producers placing packaging materials, packaging or packaged products on the Irish market must segregate the packaging waste arising on their own premises into specified waste streams and have it collected by authorised operators for recycling.  In addition, major producers, i.e. those who have an annual turnover in excess of €1 million and who place more than 10 tonnes of packaging on the Irish market, have additional responsibilities with regard to the recovery of packaging waste from their customers, meeting quarterly targets, preparation of implementation plans and annual reports, placing of signage on their premises, advertising take-back, and registration with local authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_3908">The definition of packaging in the legislation includes material used in connection with the transport of products, and therefore would encompass pallets. However, when determining major producer status, account is not taken of "packaging destined for reuse" provided that documentary evidence can be produced by the producer concerned to substantiate the reuse of such packaging.  This exemption may be availed of for pallets where the relevant provisions in the Regulations can be satisfied.</p>
            <p eId="para_3909">Major producers have the option of either complying directly with their producer responsibility obligations (i.e. self-compliance), or alternatively, getting an exemption from those requirements by becoming a member of a packaging waste compliance scheme.  Registration with local authorities is subject to a minimum registration fee of €500 per premises rising by an incremental €15 per tonne of packaging placed on the market up to a maximum fee of no more than €15,000 per premises and applies equally to all producers.</p>
            <p eId="para_3910">Repak Limited — established by Irish industry in 1997 to promote, co-ordinate and finance the collection and recovery of packaging waste with a view to achieving Ireland's packaging waste recovery and recycling targets under the Packaging Directives — is the sole approved compliance scheme for the recovery of packaging waste in Ireland.  The membership fees charged by Repak are modelled on a shared responsibility approach and are, ultimately, a matter for the compliance scheme and its Board of Management. The monument in question is in private ownership, and, accordingly, there is no basis on which I could draw up a conservation plan for it.  However, it is included on the statutory Record of Monuments and Places issued for Tipperary South under reference TS073-007 and is thereby protected under the provisions of the National Monuments Acts, 1930 to 2004.</p>
