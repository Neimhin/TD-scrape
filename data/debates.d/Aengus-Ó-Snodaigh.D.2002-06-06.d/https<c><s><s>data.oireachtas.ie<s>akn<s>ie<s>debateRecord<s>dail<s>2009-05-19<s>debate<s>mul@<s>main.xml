          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_1">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_8">I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, together.  I visited Northern Ireland on 26 March and met with First Minister Peter Robinson and Deputy First Minister Martin McGuinness in Stormont Buildings.  We discussed recent developments, including the attacks by dissident groups, the unified response of the political parties and the excellent co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda and progress on the devolution of policing and justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_9">Later that evening, I addressed the CBI Northern Ireland annual dinner in Belfast.  In the course of my speech, I highlighted the importance of North-South co-operation and the contribution the island economy can make to economic recovery and the co-operation between Government Departments and agencies on both sides of the Border which are actively engaged in attracting foreign investment, on overseas trade missions, building our higher education capacity and training and skills development.  I also reiterated the Government's commitment to investment in infrastructure projects that will benefit everyone on this island.</p>
            <p eId="para_10">I met with Prime Minister Gordon Brown at the European Council meeting in March and I expect to meet him again at the next Council meeting in June.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_2">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_11">It is perfectly obvious that cross-Border unity has been displayed since the murders of British soldiers, Mark Quinsey and Patrick Asimkar, and subsequent murder by the Continuity IRA of PSNI officer, Stephen Carroll.  The Taoiseach will be aware of the Garda Commissioner's statement in January that the threat from dissident republicans should not be underestimated and is a cause for concern for both the Garda Síochána and the PSNI.  He will also be aware that these groups have been engaged in extortion and serious gun crime.  Many of the pipe bombs in the Republic last year were INLA related.  I understand that in 2008 there were 106 incidents involving pipe bombs, grenades and other improvised devices in Dublin alone, an increase of 340% since 2007 when there were 24 such incidents.  From speaking to people who know something about this issue, there should be a real concern about the recruitment into dissident republican groups of vulnerable young men who are led by some daft, romantic notion that this is the thing to do.</p>
            <p eId="para_12">It is necessary for the political process to ensure the Good Friday Agreement is implemented in full and we fully support the Government in its actions in this respect.  It is only in this way, when people understand and see co-operation and the peace process being implemented properly, that communities can live their lives as they should.  The resources needed to deal with this issue must be given to the security forces, that is, the Garda Síochána on this side of the Border and the PSNI on the other side of the Border.</p>
            <p eId="para_13">Based on the reports given to him by the Garda and possibly the Army, what is the Taoiseach's current assessment of the threat posed by dissident republicans?  What additional steps have been taken since the murders at Massereene Barracks to increase monitoring activities along the Border in view of the activities taking place there?  Does the Taoiseach have information as to whether or to what extent republican groups are actively recruiting?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_3">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_14">As Deputy Kenny said, there is full co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda Síochána in relation to dealing with this threat.  The Garda Commissioner has confirmed to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that he is happy with the level of co-operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_15">The intelligence services of the State have kept a close monitoring eye on what is going on. They threaten our democracy for so long as they exist.  They seek to defy the will of the people, North and South, on the basis that the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement constitute the agreed path forward for peace and reconciliation and, from our point of view, ultimately, we hope, unity of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_16">Anyone who is engaged in violent activity or threats or planning of criminal acts — I do not give them the adjective "dissident" at all as these are criminal activities and they do not have any political philosophy that is worth the name — is clearly intent on seeking to defy the will of the vast majority of the people of all traditions, North and South, and the security forces have been successful in deterring them from engaging in violent activities or planning events that would have caused serious harm to people and property.  It is a continuing requirement on our security forces to try to ensure that they do not succeed at any time.</p>
            <p eId="para_17">This threat is something that must be contended with.  The Garda Síochána has been dealing with this sort of threat for decades and has built up a great degree of expertise, and its intelligence services are very effective.  As I stated, level of co-operation levels with the PSNI are strong and that is as it should be.</p>
            <p eId="para_18">I share with the Deputy the need to continue to be vigilant.  There is never any room for complacency.  I assure the House and the country that this is an issue that has the highest priority among our security forces.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_4">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_19">The Government received the 21st report of the Independent Monitoring Commission on 1 May last.  It clearly stated that the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA were particularly active in recruiting and carrying out their activities.  This resulted in a concentrated period of attempts to disrupt the state, North and South, and were it not for the vigilance of the police, both North and South, matters could have been much worse.  The report also notes, as the Taoiseach will be aware, that the dissidents themselves were hoping that from this period of concentrated activity there might well be an overreaction from authorities, North or South, which would play into their hands from a publicity point of view.  Does the Taoiseach have any reflections on the report?</p>
            <p eId="para_20">I happened to be visiting the Border areas in the past few days on other activities in which the Taoiseach was engaged in different places.  It was evident in some of the towns in Leitrim and north Roscommon that many of the retail shops are being wiped out.  I am aware of the impact of the difference between sterling and euro, but what I refer to came about because of the perception that the increase in VAT here and the reduction in VAT by the British Government would lead to real consumer bargains.  If one stands in an electrical shop in Boyle, Manorhamilton or Carrick-on-Shannon,——</p>

            <p eId="para_29">I asked the Taoiseach if he will report on recent developments in Northern Ireland, and if he will make a statement on the matter.  Developments in Northern Ireland are such that the British Government has reduced VAT and many of the retailers do not offer the proper euro-sterling exchange rate.  These have resulted in a wipe-out of business in many of the retail stores south of the Border.</p>
            <p eId="para_30">In the House, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment stated that she intended to introduce legislation to protect consumers and regulate price controls.  In view of this continuing situation and the fact that the Minister for Finance stated that he had made a mistake in raising the level of VAT, has the Taoiseach considered the implications for small retailers south of the Border of the decision made by the Government to increase VAT rates and the failure of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to introduce the legislation?  Hundreds of retail units are now lonely places because no one is going into them.  They cannot compete because the playing field is not level.  The Government can do something about that and, in the context of Northern Ireland and cross-Border economics, I ask that it would.</p>

            <p eId="para_33">In relation to the 21st report of the Independent Monitoring Commission published on 7 May, I welcome that latest report, which clearly highlights the moral bankruptcy of the so-called dissident republican groups.  These groups have no mandate from the people of Ireland, North or South, for their murderous activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_34">Political progress in Northern Ireland is continuing and I am confident that the attempts of dissident groups to drag us back into the past will be futile.  Their activities have rendered all of us more determined to preserve the peace we have won.  I commend the work of An Garda Síochána and the PSNI in continuing to counter dissident terrorists, including the very high level of co-operation between the two police services.</p>
            <p eId="para_35">Regarding economic matters, it is true that, certainly in recent times, we have seen policies being pursued by the British Government that are effectively bringing about a depreciation of sterling <i>vis-à-vis</i> the euro to the extent in recent months of probably more than 15%, taking everything into account.  That differential has exacerbated the situation regarding the equilibrium of trade one would expect in a cross-Border situation.  It is suggested that the 0.5% increase in VAT was the reason for that as against the 15% depreciation, but they are the same percentages and the same mathematics that apply in terms of value.  It is important to point out that, from our point of view, we will continue to do whatever we can to make this economy more competitive, to reduce costs and to ensure that we can get that equilibrium of trade back in our direction in the way it was in the past.</p>

            <p eId="para_45">Last Sunday, 17 May, marked the 35th anniversary of the bombings of Dublin and Monaghan in which 33 people died.  The Taoiseach will recall that the British Government refused to co-operate with a series of Oireachtas investigations into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings and other fatal attacks in this State.  The spectre of collusion was raised in our first report and we now have enough information to be fully satisfied that not only did collusion occur, but that it was widespread.</p>
            <p eId="para_46">The Taoiseach may recall that, in July 2008, the Dáil unanimously passed a resolution calling on the British Government to allow access by independent international judicial figures to all original documents held by it on the atrocity in this jurisdiction.  That request continues to be denied.  What has the Taoiseach done to impress on the British Prime Minister the importance of this matter and the totally unacceptable attitude of his Government and its refusal to act on the request from the Oireachtas?   Has the Taoiseach devoted any time to addressing this issue with the British Prime Minister?</p>
            <p eId="para_47">Has the Taoiseach recently discussed with Mr. Gordon Brown the need to transfer policing and justice powers from London to Belfast as soon as possible, given that this is a very important outworking of the Good Friday Agreement, which is long overdue?</p>

In that respect, progress continues to be made on the devolution of policing and justice.  It is an issue I have discussed with the British Prime Minister on a number of occasions in the past and, indeed, during the course of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_49">Legislation to facilitate devolution was passed at Westminster in March.  Discussions with the British Government on the question of financing are ongoing.  The next step is for the Executive and Assembly to approve the necessary Northern Ireland legislation.  I anticipate significant progress towards this after the election.  I do not think there have been any further developments in respect of the Dublin-Monaghan bombings since those I put on the record of the House on the last occasion this issue was raised.</p>

            <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
            <p eId="para_50">The report of the Independent Monitoring Commission drew attention to the fact that although, to a certain extent, it did not see the Real IRA or the Continuity IRA posing a fundamental threat at this time, it noted both groups were heavily involved in crime.  It listed crimes such as drug dealing, tiger kidnapping, robbery, extortion, smuggling, fuel laundering and, specifically in the case of the Continuity IRA, running brothels.</p>
            <p eId="para_51">The Taoiseach knows working class parts of Dublin, in particular, and the outer reaches of Dublin are under assault from criminal gangs.  We have so many murders it is difficult to keep up with them all, including the horrific one reported this morning on RTE.  Does the Taoiseach see the Criminal Assets Bureau, or some organisation like it, having a role on an all-Ireland basis?  Money is the fuel that allows these people to continue what they are doing.  The difficulty is that the problem is not just along the Border, where there have been horrific murders, including the murder suffered by young Paul Quinn and the aftermath for his family, and also what has happened in Crossmaglen.</p>
            <p eId="para_52">There are working-class communities suffering the tortures of the damned because of the crime links to dissident organisations. One can put what has happened with dissident organisations together with the crime wave the west and north-west side of Dublin, and my own constituency and that of Deputies Pat Carey and Shortall, are enduring.  Is the Taoiseach sure it is realistic to say that the Garda is satisfied with how it is containing these people?  They may not be very active in Northern Ireland but are wreaking havoc in the Republic.</p>
            <p eId="para_53">On the reference by the Independent Monitoring Commission to running brothels, such an activity, as the Taoiseach probably knows, is now heavily associated in this Republic with people trafficking and the horrendous consequences involved with that.  Does the Government have a strategy to address that part of the IMC report?</p>

          <speech by="#BrianCowen" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_28">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_54">A detailed question in respect of any particular aspect of the IMC report would be best directed to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern, who has the front line political role in respect of the security matters and criminal issues arising.  Those people have shown a degree of moral bankruptcy that is breathtaking, not only in respect of their subversive activities through misguided political thinking, but also the fact that many of them are associated with or involved in simple criminality.  I am not giving any hierarchy of respectability to those groups in terms of calling them "dissident republican" groups.  I do not regard them as anything other than criminal elements who are trying to engage in mayhem and murder at any opportunity to try to destabilise the democratic structures that have been painstakingly built and constructed in the context of the divided society that is Northern Ireland and in the interests of trying to promote peace and reconciliation on the island of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_55">On the question of a North-South body similar to the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, which has been a strong and effective mechanism in seeking to hurt those people where it matters, namely, in terms of the ill-gained assets and wealth they have built up in respect of their nefarious activities, there is a similar type of body in Northern Ireland that draws from that experience.  I understand there is good co-operation between both agencies and there is no reason to be unhappy with the level of co-operation that exists.</p>
            <p eId="para_56">In terms of providing sufficient resources and powers to the Garda to deal with this serious threat to the stability of our society in the immediate term, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has indicated his intention to bring forward legislation that will seek in judicial terms to give an opportunity for people to be tried under a legal framework similar to that with which subversives had to contend in terms of the Special Criminal Court and non-jury courts, given that we have seen not only the intimidation of witnesses but jurors as a result of the efforts by criminals to undermine the basic democratic structures of the State, including the independence of the Judiciary and the effectiveness and effective working of the criminal justice system.  Additional legislative proposals are to be brought forward to assist the Garda further in that respect.  Continuing expertise is available within the intelligence services regarding so-called subversive activities, and within the Garda Síochána there is the serious crime squad and the people who are monitoring and committed to bringing to justice those involved in gangland activity, both those who are associated with subversive groups and those who are not.  The same determined effort is being made and will continue to be made because we are all agreed on the serious threat posed by those people.</p>

            <p eId="para_57">The crime that the north and west side of Dublin in particular is experiencing is beyond parallel, as the murders are savage and violent.  People believe there are strong links with dissident republican groups.  The Independent Monitoring Commission stated in its report that the Continuity IRA and the Real IRA are heavily involved in all the crimes I listed, the crimes that specifically torture decent law-abiding communities so that people live in fear.  I accept it is helpful that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is bringing forward legislation to deal with criminal gangs.  However, does the Taoiseach agree that in addition to putting some of those people behind bars, we must take the oxygen of money away from those groups?  If it is the case that, as is described, they are heavily involved in running brothels — the sex trade in this country——</p>

            <p eId="para_62">At the meeting of the North-South Ministerial Council at the end of January, a decision was apparently made to establish two working groups to look at the issue of the North-South parliamentary body<b> </b>that was proposed in the Good Friday Agreement.  Has a deadline been set for the two groups?  What sort of timeframe is envisaged?</p>
            <p eId="para_63">Like Deputy Kenny, I was in Boyle yesterday and I visited Dundalk a couple of weeks ago.  The retail trade is suffering terribly.  Would a North-South parliamentary body not offer a useful mechanism for the alignment — in a Border sense — of economic policies between the two parts of the island?  I know that the SDLP recently ran a successful conference about an all-island economy.  To be honest, I do not think there are many other solutions to restoring stability to trade on both sides of the Border.  I have been in the empty shops and have spoken to the traders as well.  They are lucky now if five people per day purchase their messages in their shops.  It has gone that bad.  People can go to ASDA in Enniskillen, where the car parking is free, but if they do their shopping in Sligo town centre, the parking is not free.  There is a range of issues we must address and this North-South parliamentary body could be a useful mechanism to do this.  Does the Taoiseach have a timeframe for its establishment?</p>

            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_64">Any joint parliamentary forum is a matter for the Northern Ireland Assembly and Dáil Éireann.  Following discussions between the Speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly and the Ceann Comhairle, two working groups were established to develop proposals for such a body, one in the Assembly chaired by the Speaker, and the other in the Oireachtas chaired by the Ceann Comhairle.  The work of these groups is under way and their proposals will be considered by the Assembly and the Oireachtas in due course.  I am pleased to see that progress is being made on that important initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_65">I also understand there has been a fuller representation across the Unionist political family in respect of the British-Irish Parliamentary Assembly in recent times, which is very welcome.  I hope those bodies help to provide a forum for trust and confidence, and that better relationships can be established between parliamentarians, and by extension, between both sides of the island.  When I was on the original British-Irish parliamentary forum in the late 1980s, there were many misgivings and misunderstandings on all sides about the role and capacity of others to see issues in a broader perspective.  That forum played its own minor but important role in bringing along a process of engagement which ultimately led us to where we are today.  All the institutional bodies envisaged in the Good Friday Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement should be up and running and used to their full potential, in order to carry out that limited but important role in helping to provide a good foundation for further political progress.</p>
            <p eId="para_66">Trying to find economic and fiscal parity between both sides of the island is an ongoing task and is one that can best be undertaken by the engagement through these North-South bodies, as they would help people understand the full picture and the mutual benefit involved.  However, the hand of the Treasury<b> </b>is very strong on these matters in Northern Ireland.  The party leaders and the leaders of the Northern Ireland Executive are engaged in discussions with the Prime Minister and Chancellor of the Exchequer about the level of funding they can expect in the years ahead from their central administration.  The Treasury has not, it claims, much room for manoeuvre, a debate which is in the first instance internal to the Executive, the Assembly, the British Government and Westminster Parliament.  What derives out of that relationship will determine what will emerge.</p>
            <p eId="para_67">The business community has put questions in regard to similar corporation tax rates to the authorities concerned.  The Prime Minister has responded, not in terms of agreeing that is the solution but by suggesting there are other variants he could propose.  That is an ongoing issue for the future.  From my point of view, it is important, arising out of this turbulence, financial and economic, we achieve stability in terms of exchange rate policy that will enable people to invest with a greater degree of security than the recent changes in the exchange rate have allowed for.  That is an important issue.  It is hoped the exchange rate issue will stabilise as soon as possible in the interests of both sides.</p>

It was also agreed that a number of other concerns of the Irish people, which I spelled out at the Council meeting, would be addressed satisfactorily, including by way of appropriate legal guarantees.  On the basis of this agreement at the European Council, and on the condition of our being able to agree the satisfactory texts of legal guarantees in the coming months, I have said I would be prepared to return to the people with a new package and to seek their approval of it in a referendum.</p>
            <p eId="para_76">The other potential referendum is in the area of children's rights.  In this regard, Deputies will be aware that the second interim report of the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children on absolute or strict liability in respect of sexual offences against or in connection with children was published recently.  On the central issue, that of a constitutional amendment to re-instate absolute liability in the wake of the CC case, the report states, "Two distinct views emerge" and that, "The Committee has not been able to reconcile these views and, accordingly, is unable to make an agreed recommendation on the issue".  The different views emerging from the committee's report will now be examined and proposals will be brought to the Government in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_77">Deputies also asked about the recommendations of the All-Party Committee on the Constitution and its successor, the Joint Committee on the Constitution.  I would like it put on the record again that neither I nor my Department are solely responsible for the implementation of all the recommendations of these committees.  The fine work of the current committee and its predecessors has produced 12 reports which form a very useful repository of informed work on various aspects of the Constitution.  However, the committee does not report to me.  The reports are published and the recommendations are made for all.  As issues arise they will be dealt with appropriately and the valuable information contained in these reports will be availed of.</p>

            <p eId="para_79">I would like, if I may, to ask three questions to the Taoiseach.  Ireland has been bad-mouthed around Europe owing to the decision of the Irish people in respect of the Lisbon treaty.  I hope the treaty is approved at the next referendum.  Fine Gael will lead a strong campaign in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_80">Does the Taoiseach expect the legislation giving effect to the Lisbon treaty referendum to be passed by the House prior to the summer recess?  He will be aware of the necessity for such legislation to be in place for 30 days before the people can be advised of a referendum.  In that context, does the Taoiseach expect the referendum to be held at the end of September or during the month of October?  It is time the Taoiseach set out clearly the position in this regard.  We must get on with dealing with this important and fundamental issue.  I take this opportunity to reiterate that the Taoiseach keeps Opposition parties informed of ongoing developments, as discussed last December.</p>
            <p eId="para_81">With regard to the question of children's rights, it was not possible to get agreement on this issue because Government members of the committee have changed their minds.  The programme for Government, which the Taoiseach drafted and of which he was a chief negotiator, contains a very clear reference to having a referendum on children's rights.  Is that to be a victim of the review to be carried out now?  This party believes that it is urgent and appropriate to hold a constitutional referendum to allow the electorate to decide whether the Oireachtas should enact new legislation to reinstate the criminal offence of statutory rape for the protection of children.  That there was a divergent view at the committee does not mean the Government should go back to the commitment to a referendum in the programme for Government, which was driven by the Taoiseach's party.</p>
            <p eId="para_82">The Constitution declares: "The publication or utterance of blasphemous... matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law."  The Taoiseach will be aware that the Defamation Act 1961 provided that "every person who composes, prints or publishes any blasphemous or obscene libel" is guilty of such an offence.  Blasphemy is not defined in the Constitution nor is it defined in any Act of the Oireachtas.  It is impossible to say what the offence consists of.  State-sponsored bodies have made their position clear.  In 1991, the Law Reform Commission stated that "there was no place for blasphemous libel in a society which respects freedom of speech".  In 1996, the Constitution Review Group commented that the retention of the current constitutional offence of blasphemy was not appropriate.  In July 2008, the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Constitution noted the redundant nature of blasphemy in Irish law and concluded that "the deletion of the reference to ‘blasphemy' from the Constitution might be advisable".  In view of that body of opinion, why is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform proceeding with something that is not defined in law?  Is it his intention to proceed with a referendum on this matter?</p>

            <p eId="para_85">I ask the Taoiseach about the report in today's newspapers that other EU states are requesting Ireland to set a date for the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  Does the Taoiseach have a date in mind?  Other European states are quoted as having asked us to have a date identified by the European Council meeting in June.  Has the Taoiseach decided on a date and what will be the timeframe?  Has Fianna Fáil and its coalition partner, the Green Party, reached agreement on the approach to the European Defence Agency?  The Green Party has stated that it is unhappy with that proposal and wants it addressed in the context of the Lisbon treaty referendum.  Have the two parties reached agreement on the matter?</p>

            <p eId="para_86">It would be the intention to have legislation on the referendum before the summer recess if we have a successful outcome.  At this point I cannot anticipate whether the legal guarantees that are being worked on will provide us with the outcome we desire based on the December Council conclusions.  However, if we get those and if they are what are required, then of course that enables us, as I said in my primary reply, to go the people with a new package based on that detailed work being conducted and a decision of the European Council being made at the June Council meeting.</p>
            <p eId="para_87">In respect of any EU states that are seeking a date for a referendum, I refer them to the conclusions of the December Council meeting, which were agreed by all the member states.  They clearly set out the areas upon which further work is being conducted.  On the basis of a successful outcome we will be in a position, having obtained the decision of the European Council, to indicate when we will hold a referendum.   We have to approach this step by step.  It would not be appropriate to give an indication of that detailed work in advance of it being completed and agreed by a formal decision of the European Council because that would be anticipating an outcome that we cannot predict at present.  As matters stand, we must be mindful of the decision of the people and until such time as we complete the current process we should avoid coming to a conclusion on that because otherwise one would be anticipating an outcome without completing the work.</p>
            <p eId="para_88">The questions put to me pertained to referendums.  One of the issues raised will be subject to further discussion this week by the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.  This issue is referred to in the Constitution and the question that arises is whether to address it through a referendum or by way legislation.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform can discuss the issue in some detail and he addressed it with a great deal of clarity in a newspaper article published on 1 May.  Unfortunately, he is misrepresented as being motivated by other reasons, which is certainly not the case.  It is a question of dealing with the issue in the interest of proceeding with the Defamation Bill 2006 while respecting the Constitution's provisions on freedom of expression.  The Government is holding discussions with the EU's legal services on all these matters and hopes to reach a conclusion by June.</p>

        <b>Deputy Leo Varadkar</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
         her views on the impact of the Obama Administration’s recently announced tax reform on foreign direct investment here; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_90">As the proposed tax changes outlined by the US Administration on 4 May were proposals rather than detailed draft legislation, it is not possible to definitively state what the effect will be for US foreign direct investment in Ireland.  However, the stated intention of the Obama Administration is primarily to target US companies which invest in countries widely considered to be tax havens.  Ireland, of course, is not a tax haven nor is it considered as such by the US Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_91">The Minister for Finance and I have already briefed our Cabinet colleagues on the proposed changes.  Given that more than 450 American companies have already invested more than $55 billion in Ireland, we are acutely aware of the importance of potential changes to the US tax code on American investment abroad.  I recently met the US Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Timothy Geithner, and several members of the US Administration.  The Government is committed to maintaining contact with the US Administration in the time ahead.</p>
            <p eId="para_92">The Government has maintained a monitoring system for developments in the US international tax code for a number of years.  In addition, a contact group comprising senior officials from my Department, the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs, the IDA and the Revenue Commissioners has been meeting to monitor ongoing developments.  We will continue to engage with the US Administration and Congress as this issue develops and the initial proposal evolves into legislation.  To this end, the IDA has deployed a senior executive to the Irish embassy in Washington as a point person to monitor and engage with this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_97">I am delighted to hear that.</p>
            <p eId="para_98">As the Tánaiste noted, multinational investments, particularly by US-owned corporations, are extremely important to Ireland.  These corporations employ approximately 100,000 people.  A number of large investments have been made in my constituency of Dublin West by firms such as IBM and eBay.  I agree with the Minister that Ireland is not a tax haven but I am concerned that only four countries or territories were named in the document released by the White House — Ireland, the Netherlands, the Cayman Islands and Bermuda.  Ireland is called a low tax jurisdiction, not a tax haven, in the document.   In her discussions with Mr. Geithner, Secretary of the Treasury, did she express her concern that Ireland was put in the same group as the Cayman Islands and Bermuda?</p>
            <p eId="para_99">I hope the Minister will not drop the ball on this potentially important matter.  She intervened much too late in the process at Dell and SR Technics to have an effect.  If she and the Government are to have influence, it is important they become involved with the US Congress and Administration to lobby them regarding these tax proposals.  Will the job that is to be done through the embassy also be done through the IDA?  Will there be a focus on lobbying the Irish-American caucus in Congress, which, while not as strong as it was in the past, should still be briefed about our interests and asked to support them?</p>

            <p eId="para_100">I am glad the Deputy appreciates there is FDI investment in his constituency.  He will, therefore, be acutely aware of the implications this decision has for his constituency, not to mention Ireland.  On the occasion of the Taoiseach's visit to the US, he mentioned this issue to President Obama.  I met Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Geithner and we had a 35-minute discussion on a number of issues but this was the primary reason I met him.  I also met my opposite number in the Department of Labor and Ron Kirk to discuss these issues.  I then took the opportunity over a day to meet a number of the key leaders in the US Senate and Congress and members of the ways and means committee, which will make the final determination on Capitol Hill.</p>
            <p eId="para_101">I, along with all my ministerial colleagues who travel to the US, will continue to raise this issue.  I also met representatives of a number of corporations on my two visits to the US and we are working with them in the US and in Ireland.  We have always had the number one tax experts in the US.  They have worked with the IDA and will continue to do so and we have redeployed a senior executive from the IDA to work exclusively on this.</p>
            <p eId="para_102">This is a hugely important issue and we will continue to use every avenue available through corporate America, through our corporate presence here and the platform we have here and at political level.  A congressional delegation will travel to Ireland in the summer and it was my clear intention in speaking with Congressman Neal that we would have a further opportunity to develop the issue and I am sure Members will do likewise.</p>

            <p eId="para_103">I appreciate the Minister's response but I would like specific answers to my questions.  Did she raise with Timothy Geithner the fact that Ireland was one of only four territories named in the report?  One of the specific examples given related to the US wanting to end the system whereby companies investing in an unnamed country with a 12.5% tax rate are able to offset the cost of building facilities against their tax liability in the US.  Did the Minister mention to Mr. Geithner that she was unimpressed Ireland was named among the four territories?</p>
            <p eId="para_104">I am glad Ministers and officials will raise this issue with members of Congress at every opportunity but that is not good enough.  A concerted lobbying campaign of Congress members is needed.  Is a strategy in place to do so or will an <i>ad hoc</i> arrangement be adopted every time there is a visit back and forth?</p>

            <p eId="para_105">I discussed the tax haven issue with Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Geithner.  Two taxation Bills have been introduced in the US Senate — one contains a list of 34 countries in which Ireland is not included and the other is based on a report prepared for the US Congress and released in December by the US Government Accountability Office, GAO.  The GAO's determination is based on figures from the 1980s.  The Irish ambassador to the US has written to the Department of the Treasury on our behalf expressing concerns about the matter of our inclusion in the report.  We feel the inclusion is unjustified and we have set down the reasons for that.  However, I took the opportunity to express the Government's view to the secretary on it.</p>
            <p eId="para_106">This is not an <i>ad hoc </i>matter and a group in my Department is working on it.  The ambassador, as our representative in the US, along with senior executives in the IDA will work <i>ad infinitum</i> to deal with this issue.  The IDA’s role is to work with companies who are also lobbying in the context of this legislation.</p>

        <b>Deputy Willie Penrose</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
         if she has conducted an economic analysis of the impact on the Irish food industry of moves by a retailer (details supplied) to source branded goods from the United Kingdom and the introduction of UK plannograms which would appear to indicate a reduction in the amount of space available for Irish brands by between 40% and 60%; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_108">The relationships between suppliers and retailers and the contractual agreements entered into by them, as with any other parties entering contracts, is essentially a matter for the contracting parties themselves.  Retailers, including the retailer referred to in the Deputy's question, have for some time maintained that the costs of sourcing goods in Ireland is significantly greater than the costs of sourcing such goods in Northern Ireland and the UK and that the current structure of the wholesale and distribution cost base in Ireland is preventing the benefits of the euro's appreciation in value over sterling from being passed on to consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_109">The retailer concerned has publicly stated that it changed the manner in which it sources certain internationally branded products as international suppliers were treating its operations in this country significantly differently from how they treated its operations in other jurisdictions such as the UK and that the direct consequence of these changes has been a significant reduction in its prices to consumers.  The retailer has advised that notwithstanding the introduction of new internationally sourced products, it has retained its comprehensive range of familiar Irish products and brands.</p>
            <p eId="para_110">The Deputy will be aware that I requested the Competition Authority to carry out a study of the retail import-distribution sector as to how competition is working in the sector and whether any practices or methods of competition are affecting the supply of goods and services in that sector.  I received the authority's report on 30 April and I am examining its findings.  I will publish the report shortly.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_111">I thank the Minister but that was a bureaucratic reply written by bureaucrats.  On 5 May Tesco reopened 11 stores in the north east using international brands sourced from UK rather than Irish suppliers and UK plannograms were put in place.  Tesco claimed 12,500 prices would be reduced across the 11 stores by an average of 22% but a document, which <i> The Irish Times</i> acquired through good investigative journalism and which was quoted by Philip Boucher-Hayes on RTE Radio 1 last Thursday evening as I drove home from the House, indicates the reduction in a basket of frequently purchased goods is much closer to 8% than 22%.</p>
            <p eId="para_112">Is the Minister aware the same documentation indicated that Tesco made a profit of 9.3% in Ireland in 2008, which is projected to increase to 9.5% this year, as opposed to a profit of more than 6% in the UK and 6.5% for its parent company?  Its profits are 50% higher here than elsewhere.  The Minister stated in the House previously that she was monitoring Tesco's decision to source international brands from the UK and to implement a new formula at the 11 stores I mentioned, thus reducing the space available for Irish brands.  Is she aware that Tesco is making such profits, which have long been a closely guarded secret, in Ireland and that, despite these super profits, the company is looking for Irish suppliers to take a cut of least 20%?  Is that not a cause for concern?</p>
            <p eId="para_113">Job losses were announced last week.  According to a number of unions, two Irish suppliers are experiencing difficulties, while according to Philip Boucher-Hayes on whom I rely and to whom I listen carefully, a number of Irish suppliers were told unilaterally without so much as a letter or a telephone call that their shelf space would be reduced overnight without negotiation or explanation.  I am concerned about this.  Is that good enough in the current climate for our 230,000 food producers?  Many of them may lose their place.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_114">We have had a great deal of discussion in the House over the past year on the prices consumers have to pay.  We continued through the National Consumer Agency, NCA, to conduct comparative analysis, North and South.  My view and that of many other Deputies, including Deputy Penrose, was that hedging could not be accepted as a method by which people had shown prices, and that we needed good value for our consumers.  Given that the buying and spending power of consumers has been reduced, people naturally expect better value for money.  As a former Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, I am aware that must be balanced with a sustainable Irish food sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_115">It has been brought to my attention anecdotally that there are concerns about access to supermarket shelves.  I met with Tesco representatives prior to the announcement of a reduction in prices in Border areas.  They reassured me that they would continue to have Irish products available.  Meanwhile, suppliers have indicated that they are finding it more difficult to sustain their activities.  Moreover, it is important to say that any retail sector company, if it is making a profit and can sustain its business, should grant price reductions to consumers as well as giving a fair return to suppliers.</p>
            <p eId="para_116">Forfás has evaluated the cost of doing business and I have given my views on that.  The Competition Authority has undertaken work on my behalf on the costs from suppliers to the supermarket shelf.  We must have a balance — I appreciate the Deputy is trying to do so — between the need for a vibrant food industry and providing value for money to consumers.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_117">Shelf space means availability for people's products.  If that is reduced or they are pushed into the background, it means some people will go out of business.  Does the Tánaiste agree with that?  Strong companies will wipe out many of the weak ones.  Is the Tánaiste aware that some major Irish products are no longer finding shelf space?  Is she also aware that there is a strike ballot at Tesco and that the company is reducing people's working week by nine or ten hours?  They are also talking about cutting out the Christmas bonus for those workers.  How much more profit does Tesco want to make from ordinary workers, some of whom will find it very hard to pay their mortgages or car loans?  I have met those workers who are not even allowed to speak to the media.</p>

His committee could have a role in the context of both reports that will now be made available — the first on the cost of doing business and the second by the Competition Authority.  I would welcome further investigative work by the Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which would be complementary to the work I am carrying out.

        <b>Deputy Leo Varadkar</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
         her views on a code of conduct for suppliers and retailers to ensure that consumers are protected and retailers cannot abuse a dominant market position; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_57" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_121">The relationships between businesses and the contracts entered into by them are essentially matters for agreement between the parties themselves and I have no direct function in the negotiation of such contracts.  It is the case, however, that there are specific provisions in competition law which extend to business relationships, including relationships between suppliers and retailers.  These provisions essentially prohibit undertakings from engaging in certain anti-competitive practices including price-fixing; applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties, thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage; making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other party of supplementary obligations which, by their nature or according to commercial usage, have no connections with the subject of such contracts; abusing a dominant position; requesting "Hello money"; and imposing resale price maintenance.</p>
            <p eId="para_122">As I have said on previous occasions, I would urge anyone who considers that he or she is being treated in an anti-competitive manner to bring his or her complaint to the attention of the Competition Authority, which is the independent statutory agency responsible for the enforcement of competition law in the State.  Alternatively, a supplier can bring a private action to the courts either for breach of the Competition Acts or for breach of contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_123">In so far as the issue of a code of practice is concerned, I am aware of suggestions that have been made by a number of commentators that consideration should be given to introducing a code of practice to regulate the relationship between suppliers and retailers, and this is being examined by me at present.</p>
            <p eId="para_124">The Deputy will be aware that my Department carried out a review of the existing competition law framework in the course of 2008.  Legislation is currently being prepared to give effect to a number of changes to competition law arising from that review.  While I would have no objection in principle to considering any concrete proposals on the way competition law impacts on the relationships between businesses, any such proposals would need to address how any new regulations would be enforced in practice.</p>

            <p eId="para_127">I wish to echo some of his comments about the position of employees in Tesco.  That company is making substantial profits in this country, probably in the region of €200 million per annum, although we do not know for certain.  There is a strong case for the company to introduce a profit-sharing mechanism as an alternative to the traditional system of national wage agreements, which has now largely fallen apart.</p>
            <p eId="para_128">We all understand the background to this question, in that huge numbers of people are travelling to the North to buy cheaper consumer goods there.  Anything we do must recognise that.  I welcome the fact that consumer prices are now starting to fall in shops across Ireland, but there must also be a degree of fair trade as well.  In a free market there must be access for everyone.  We cannot have a situation whereby suppliers are denied fair access to that free market.  Suppliers and distributors will have to reduce their costs but most of the costs that disadvantage them are imposed by Government policies on rates and energy charges.  Most of those high costs are created by Government policy.  Aside from Government action to cut costs, due consideration must be given to introducing a code of conduct similar to what exists in the United Kingdom.  That could ensure that, at the very least, Irish suppliers would get fair access to the market.  In the meantime, we need to bring down those costs.  That is the real issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_131">Work is ongoing on reducing energy and labour costs, as well as reducing the administrative burdens in doing business.  We have seen some reductions but we will continue to strive for further reductions in the cost of doing business.  I listened to the quip and I cannot resist the temptation to remind Deputy Varadkar that all but five local authorities have Fine Gael-Labour majorities, so it is in the hands of those elected representatives to deal with rates.  The Deputy should consider that.  When it comes to the local elections, if people want change perhaps they should be voting for Fianna Fáil, which is acutely aware of the needs of small businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_132">Having said that, a balance must be struck between the sustainability of the food sector and value for money for consumers.  We should not have massive variations in retail sector profit margins, which are not in the best interests either of retailers, suppliers or consumers.  If we want to continue to have a vibrant retail sector, such balance will be required.  Other retailers are doing their utmost to ensure we have Irish products available.  My personal view is that Irish products comprise one of the attractions and while we must take the necessary decisions, that cannot be done in a vacuum.  Striking a balance in all those issues will sustain a valuable retail food sector, as well as ensuring that we still have value for money.</p>

            <p eId="para_133">I appreciate that some work is being done by the Competition Authority in this regard but the end point will have to involve some code of conduct to which both retailers and suppliers can refer.  Can the Tánaiste not begin the process now of bringing suppliers and retailers together with a view to drawing up such a code of conduct so that there can be fair access to the marketplace?</p>

            <p eId="para_134">I wish to advise the Deputy that the preliminary work has been done and I will continue to bring that matter to a finality.  However, I believe in the role of the Oireachtas and, as I have indicated, I take the view that the Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment has a valuable role in pursuing these issues further.  The outcomes of those deliberations will enhance the discussions that are taking place publically.</p>

         the action she is taking to protect and support small business; her views on the continued lack of credit available to viable businesses; the effect she estimates the credit shortage will have on small business; the further action she will take to deal with the problem of credit flows and small business; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_136">A properly functioning banking sector is an essential element for the maintenance and development of enterprises, especially SMEs.  Government focus has been on creating a fit for purpose banking system as is evidenced by the bank guarantee scheme, the recapitalisation scheme, the nationalisation of Anglo Irish and the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency.  Substantial guarantees and funding have been committed to the banking sector in order to keep the banks functioning to support the broader economy.</p>
            <p eId="para_137">A key principle of all these actions is the recognition of the importance of business lending particularly to SMEs.  Small and medium-sized enterprises are central to our economy and the provision of bank credit to the sector is a primary target of all these initiatives.  The banks' recapitalisation package contains a range of initiatives to assist directly our enterprise sector, including that the recapitalised banks have committed to increasing their lending capacity to SMEs by 10% over 2008, which should ensure that sound businesses will receive support from their banks; and a €100 million environmental and clean energy innovation fund is also being established by each bank, as well as a further €15 million each to new or existing seed capital funds.  Much of this funding will flow to small and medium-sized enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_138">SMEs are also covered by the code of conduct on business lending to SMEs.  This code, which was published by the Financial Regulator, came into effect on 13 March 2009.  The application of the code will promote fairness and transparency in the treatment of SMEs by the banks and should facilitate access to credit.</p>
            <p eId="para_139">The recapitalised banks have also agreed to pay for and co-operate with the carrying out of an independent review of bank lending to SMEs.  Additional banks have now agreed to participate in this review.</p>
            <p eId="para_140">Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland and Ulster Bank will also provide funding for SMEs on foot of a €300 million facility provided by the European Investment Bank to assist developing SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_141">The banks have undertaken public campaigns to actively promote their lending to SMEs.  Recently, they have used recent press and television advertisements and announcements, together with information sessions with businesses, to demonstrate this commitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_142">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_143">I fully accept that the banks have a responsibility to provide credit facilities to support sound and viable enterprises and I would be concerned if they were not meeting their commitments under the recapitalisation package.  Banks do, however, need to be prudent about the projects they support and their assessment of viability.</p>
            <p eId="para_144">My colleague, the Minister for Finance, has responsibility for the banking system and I am in regular contact with him on the matter, as are officials of both Departments.  In addition, I have met with the business representative bodies, the banks and the enterprise support agencies to ensure that all sides have a common understanding of the issues and a common commitment to support viable businesses.  I will continue with these contacts.</p>
            <p eId="para_145">The recapitalisation package makes reference to a clearing group made up of representatives of government, banks, business interests and State agencies to identify patterns of events where the flow of credit to viable projects appears to be blocked and to seek to identify credit supply solutions.  This group is being chaired by my Department and will work to provide a clear picture of any emerging lending patterns while facilitating direct discussion by all the relevant interests in addressing problems.</p>
            <p eId="para_146">Separate to the banking issues, my Department's continuous support for enterprises arises through maintaining a positive business environment and through particular interventions from the State development agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, FÁS and the county and city enterprise boards.  The significant allocations in my Department's Estimates for 2009 for the development agencies ensures that we can continue to build on this strategy for the future.</p>

            <from>Deputy Deirdre Clune</from>
            <p eId="para_147">How does the Tánaiste's answer square with last week's ISME survey, which found that 58% of companies have been refused credit by banks, an increase from what was found in a previous survey?  The survey also found that 83% of SMEs feel the banks are making it difficult for them to access credit and that European Investment Bank loans have not been marketed to SMEs.  Following the banks' recapitalisation and last September's guarantee scheme, funding is still not flowing to small and medium-sized enterprises and many of them are finding it extremely difficult to operate in the current financial circumstances.  These are not fledgling businesses; they have been established for ten years or more and have a sound profitable base.  Many of them have to let staff go and others fear for their future.</p>
            <p eId="para_148">Will the Tánaiste outline how European Investment Bank loans will be channelled to small businesses?  Many candidates in the European elections, particularly those in the Tánaiste's party, have commented on how valuable these will be for small and medium-sized enterprises, yet surveys and feedback to Members of this House tell us that this is not happening.  It is a constant source of concern.</p>

            <p eId="para_149">I am aware that there are concerns and that is why a considerable period of time ago we set up a round table forum.  Today, I will announce the establishment of a clearing group that will include the Minister for Finance and I.  It will be chaired by my Department and the Department of Finance and will include the Irish Banking Federation, AIB, Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank, National Irish Bank, Bank of Scotland Ireland, Anglo Irish Bank, representatives of ISME, the Small Firms Association, SFA, Chambers Ireland, the IFA, Forfás, Enterprise Ireland, the IDA and Fáilte Ireland.  This is the framework in which we will assess and analyse lending capacity and what is happening.</p>
            <p eId="para_150">I agree that there are significant issues for small and medium-sized enterprises.  I want to be able to ascertain in a serious way the specific pattern of events that are happening and, most particularly, to identify some of the credit supply solutions that need to be provided to address the concerns that every Member of the House has raised.</p>
            <p eId="para_151">We have seen that access to working capital is difficult.  We have also seen difficulties with other capital mechanisms such as overdrafts and the methods by which stock is purchased.  One must also appreciate that there will be clearer thinking on how people will lend and on the difficult issue of the availability of cash.  We will use the clearing group as a method by which we can address many of the concerns raised.</p>

            <p eId="para_152">Has the Tánaiste considered providing a State-backed Government-guaranteed loan scheme specifically for SMEs, similar to that which operates successfully in the UK?  This would be of benefit.  It has worked to facilitate loans directly to SMEs in the UK.</p>

            <p eId="para_155">Yes, they are and they have worked, contrary to Deputy Clune's opinion.  These mechanisms are available and part of the recapitalisation programme is to ensure that more capital is made available to these companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_156">I also want to advise the House that the method by which grant aid is provided by Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, Údarás na Gaeltachta and Shannon Development is a tripartite approach between the agency, the bank and the client, which never happened before.  This is to assure the client that, when grant aid is available and due diligence is done, it will stand up from a banking perspective.  I am not saying it is easy to get access to finance; some of the rules have changed.  However, the criteria for lending have also changed.  That being said, it is my clear intention to use the round table forum and the clearing house to pursue this matter vigorously on behalf of the people that I must represent, namely, the business sectors.</p>

            <p eId="para_158">The issue of competitiveness is key to my response to business needs, especially for the SME sector.  Ireland has consistently been an economy in which it is easy to do business, and it has seen the growth of a large number of successful new enterprises, many of them SMEs.</p>
            <p eId="para_159">Ireland is a leader in having the lowest cost for setting up a business and is lightly regulated, which in itself lowers costs for business.  Ireland also has the third lowest rate in the EU of corporation tax, which lightens the tax burden on businesses and gives them an advantage over competitor countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_160">Current trading conditions for companies are difficult and challenging because of various issues such as the devaluation of sterling, energy and wage costs, tough competition and the decline in exports.  Some issues are outside the control of the Government as a whole, but where possible and appropriate, we can address some key areas, for example, energy and local charges.  We are addressing our cost competitiveness as an essential element of our economic recovery.  Nothing should come in the way of these firms to inhibit or stop them from growing their businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_161">I am conscious that energy costs for businesses in Ireland are a source of concern, particularly as businesses are attempting to cut costs to remain competitive in the current economic environment.  However, in recent months, the trend of energy prices has been downward.  In response to this trend, the Commission for Energy Regulation lowered electricity prices for residents and SMEs by 10% from 1 May.  Gas prices were reduced by an average of 12%.  According to the latest published Eurostat comparisons, smaller SMEs are paying 1% below the average EU 27 price.  Approximately 60% of ESB's SME customers are in this category.</p>
            <p eId="para_162">On 8 May, the Government launched the national energy efficiency plan.  This reiterates that the best method for businesses to cut energy costs is through energy efficiency.  The new plan includes advice and mentoring for SMEs on how best they can reduce these costs.  In addition, we have provided incentives to business to purchase energy efficient equipment and we will continue to promote energy efficient best practice.  Sustainable Energy Ireland also offers a broad range of assistance to enterprises in achieving significant cost savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_163">The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, and I have impressed on local authority managers the concerns of Government about costs for enterprise, including local authority charges, and asked them to consider measures to support new or existing enterprises in their area by, for example, reduced development contribution rates, or deferral of payments.</p>
            <p eId="para_164">The Government has also implemented an 8% reduction in professional fees for public service bodies from 1 March of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_166">Recently published indicators are in our favour with inflation, commodity and other prices falling.  The consumer price index figures released last week are an indication of falling Irish prices in a number of areas, with Ireland showing the highest cut in prices.  This brings Ireland closer in line with average EU prices, going some way towards restoring our overall cost competitiveness.  Through our overall tax and regulatory structures, we are committed to continuing our efforts to sustain our existing pro-enterprise and pro-business economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_167">The Minister referred to energy, wages and local authority charges, which are the bugbear of many small and medium enterprises.  This country has extremely high energy costs; they are the second highest in Europe.  These costs could be controlled through a different approach to our regulatory model.  Labour costs are very high.  Already this year the retail sector will be obliged to introduce a 2.5% increase in October, due to joint labour committees, JLCs.  This is out of employers' control and they must implement it.  The same thing happened in the hospitality sector.  What plans does the Minister have to address wage costs?  Does she believe the minimum wage should be reduced?</p>

            <p eId="para_168">With regard to JLCs and employment regulation orders, EROs, I noted the discussion that took place in the House on the Employment Law Compliance Bill.  There was a variety of views and perspectives and I look forward to bringing that legislation to a conclusion.  How we will manage that I do not know, but with such a variety of views it will be difficult to anticipate how the final legislation will look.</p>

            <p eId="para_170">There is an issue with the JLCs in the catering, hotel and tourism sectors.  When Deputy Billy Kelleher was in the Department he finalised the amalgamation of two of the JLCs and was dealing with the issue of Sunday working hours.  The new Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, is pursuing the issue and will bring it to finality.  I will introduce new legislation very soon dealing with the issue of EROs and I look forward to the response of Opposition Members to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_171">With regard to the minimum wage, it is important that we have a framework on wage policy.  We must not deal with it in isolation.  On that basis the minimum wage issue is being evaluated.  The work and research on the issue is ongoing and the minimum wage will be taken into consideration in the context of overall wage structures and wage policy.

Has the Minister held consultations on this issue with local authorities and county and city managers?  It is an enormous cost burden on small businesses but, having been a member of a local authority, I am aware that it can be a soft touch for local authorities at budget time.  Has the Minister conveyed her views?  Does she have concerns about this?  Has she conveyed the views of small and medium enterprises?</p>

            <p eId="para_173">I have met the local authority managers and discussed this matter with them.  I indicated that businesses are of the view that they must reduce their costs.  As a former local authority member as well, I appreciate that financing local government is difficult but rates are a huge issue for businesses and their sustainability.  The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, indicated last year that there should be no increase in rates for businesses.  Unfortunately, not every local authority abided by that.</p>

        <b>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment</b>
         if she has full confidence in her Department to meet the challenges of rising unemployment; if current or former members of the Government have expressed concerns to her over the Government’s employment strategy; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_84" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_179">I have full confidence that the Government and my Department will continue to do everything in their power to meet and respond effectively to the challenge of rising unemployment.  As a result of the global economic crisis, rising unemployment is a problem that is affecting all economies but it is a priority issue for both myself and my Department.  As such I have already taken considerable measures to respond to this pressing challenge.</p>
            <p eId="para_180">This includes doubling the capacity of the job search supports system provided by FÁS employment services and the partnership-based local employment service to 150,000 places per year for referrals under the national employment action plan.  In addition, as a result of efficiencies and a redeployment of resources announced in the supplementary budget, my Department is now funding approximately 128,000 activation training and work experience places through FÁS.  This is a substantial increase on the 66,000 places which were available at the end of last year. Part of this increase in provision has been achieved as FÁS has re-aligned its focus to provide a more flexible delivery of training interventions for individuals to include on-line, evening and blended learning training options in addition to the more traditional mix of course offerings.  The aim of these additional training places is to offer increased flexibility and flexible learning options to enable the unemployed to further develop their skill sets and competencies to secure employment as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_181">Key to these developments has been the co-ordinated and integrated approach to activation between my Department, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Education and Science.  This has allowed us to produce a range of measures to expand services to the unemployed and to promote a flexible learning environment tailored to the specific needs of the individual.  As a result of this joint approach the Government announced in the supplementary budget that €128 million was being redeployed to the activation area, which is resulting in the creation of 23,435 training and education activation places across my Department, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Education and Science.</p>
            <p eId="para_182">Included in the supplementary budget are specific new innovative measures such as a work experience scheme, which will provide 2,000 six-month places to individuals who are unemployed, and it will include the placement of graduates.  A new training programme of 277 places at a cost of €1 million is being introduced for sustaining vulnerable employment.  Under this programme 277 workers who are on a three-day week and receiving social welfare payments for the days they are not working will receive two days training a week for a period of a year.  We are also introducing a part-time third level scheme whereby 1,500 third level places will be provided to enable persons who are unemployed to pursue third level certificate or degree programmes at levels 6, 7, and 8 on a part-time basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_183">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_184">The Government has also prioritised investment in the most productive sectors of our economy and has invested in the creation of jobs by cementing the foundations for export led recovery and growth.  Through the supplementary budget the Government has made provision for more than €500 million for capital investment in enterprise through various Government initiatives administered by IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland, the county and city enterprise boards and Science Foundation Ireland, which is a clear statement of our priorities.  The clear message it sends out to the world is that Ireland is open for business, open for investment and open for job creation by both indigenous enterprise and through attracting foreign direct investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_185">In a relatively short timescale and in response to the challenge of rising unemployment, my Department has significantly expanded its provision of supports and training places to the unemployed.  I am determined that both my Department and I will continue in this regard as we examine new initiatives and new methods to allow us to continue to respond to the needs of the unemployed.</p>

            <p eId="para_191">This question is about the capacity of the Department to deal with the challenges before it, and it is interesting that the official who wrote the reply did not answer that question.  This also relates to the comments made by the former Minister of State, Deputy John McGuinness, and the views expressed by other members of Fianna Fáil about the Department.  Does the Minister honestly believe the Department has the capacity to understand fully the problems in the real economy and to take the necessary measures to act on them?  It does not appear from what has been done to date that the Department or the Minister are able to respond adequately to the crisis confronting us.</p>

            <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_192">I totally refute that comment.  There is a fabulous team in the Department made up of myself, the Ministers of State, the Secretary General, assistant secretaries and all who support the Department, including Forfás, Enterprise Ireland, the IDA, county enterprise boards, the training agency, FÁS, and a host of other agencies which provide for the needs of business and those who are unemployed in this country.  I firmly believe that, due to our electoral system, each Member of this House is acutely aware of what is happening in the world, regardless of their politics.  It is wrong to claim that I and the team that is elected to represent the Department are not aware of the issues and challenges that exist.  We have adequate resources although, of course, like any other Department we could spend more.</p>
            <p eId="para_193">We have completely refocused the way the programmes are delivered by the Department.  The focus is on supporting small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs.  I introduced a stabilisation fund to focus on the stability and sustainability of business and where there are new opportunities in the markets.  That is the reason two of my colleagues are abroad on my behalf, one in Bahrain and the other in Russia.  They are examining the new opportunities there for our SMEs.  We will continue to refocus on and evaluate the needs of the business sector and the unemployed.  The target in FÁS is to refocus available resources towards the unemployed.</p>

            <from>Deputy Willie Penrose</from>
            <p eId="para_194">Everybody is acutely aware of unemployment.  However, is it worthwhile for Members on this side of the House to make suggestions?  We have been encouraged to make suggestions.  They are constructive.  There is no gain for us other than to try and get people off the live register.  Is consideration being given to a redrawing of the national development plan to prioritise labour intensive projects?  For example, €600 million could be front-loaded to the schools building programme, thus providing jobs for many of the workers who have been made redundant in the construction sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_195">What is the Department doing to incentivise job creation?  My party has suggested a two-year PRSI holiday for employers who recruit persons who have been unemployed for four to six months or more.  Every job lost costs the Exchequer €20,000 in terms of welfare benefits and tax forgone, without taking account of the statutory redundancy due to any person who has been in his or her employment for more than two years.  It makes good economic sense to front-load the national development plan with labour intensive projects that would provide employment for construction workers, engineers, architects and others who are losing their jobs on a daily basis.  This is only one initiative in terms of incentivising job creation.  Fine Gael, Sinn Féin and others have also put forward proposals to ensure people are taken off the dole and allowed to make a productive contribution to the economy.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_93" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Mary Coughlan</from>
            <p eId="para_196">I am pleased to consider proposals from all parties and have already taken on board some of the views expressed in the House in regard to activation measures.  We are working on those proposals and we hope they will be successful, particularly in the case of the graduate placement programme.  Some initial progress has already been achieved in regard to graduate placement in the public and private sectors.  People who lose their jobs want to maintain and enhance their skills.  An issue that has been raised repeatedly for many years is the difficulties people may encounter in obtaining employment because they have no experience.  We hope these initiatives will afford experience and opportunities to people.</p>
            <p eId="para_197">We are also working closely in the area of new technologies.  This is parallel to the work being done by the Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, on our skills needs.  A new chairman has been appointed to a working group to oversee an analysis of skills needs in various sectors and to evaluate how resources should be targeted.  The reality is that we must do more for less and that a targeted response is required.  That is what we must strive towards.</p>
            <p eId="para_198">When I was Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Penrose, as his party's spokesman, made the case that persons who are made redundant should be entitled automatically to return to education.  That entitlement is now in place, as well as an entitlement to participate in the back to work enterprise allowance scheme.  The latest Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, GEM, report indicates that some 2,800 new entrepreneurships are established every month in the State.  That is as it should be.  It is through small and medium-sized enterprises that we can target export potential.  We are spending €500 million this year on enterprise support.  However, we must take a categoric decision as to where resources are targeted.  The role of education will be vital.  We must encourage young people entering first year in secondary schools to take up sciences, mathematics and languages.  The jobs of the future will require those skills.  We will continue to strive towards that.</p>

         the number of regulatory impact assessments carried out on new legislation by her since she came to office; her views on whether reform of the regulatory impact assessment process is required; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#ConorLenihan" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_94">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Conor Lenihan)</from>
            <p eId="para_200">Since 2005, all Departments have been required to conduct regulatory impact analyses, RIAs, in respect of all primary legislation, significant secondary legislation, EU directives and significant EU regulations.  In addition, policy review groups charged with examining legislative proposals are also required to undertake an RIA.  Since May 2008, my Department has carried out four screening RIAs in line with the established guidelines prepared by the Department of the Taoiseach.  In addition, my Department is currently conducting several further assessments.</p>
            <p eId="para_201">Under the Towards 2016 social partnership agreement, there was a commitment to review the RIA process in 2007.  This review was carried out by the Department of the Taoiseach and published in July 2008.  Several recommendations were made in regard to the changes required to the RIA process and the implementation of these recommendations is ongoing.  They include the need for increased publication of RIAs; an improvement in the quality of some RIAs, with an increased emphasis on the measurement of costs and benefits; and specific guidance on the measurement of potential administrative and compliance costs, especially on business.</p>
            <p eId="para_202">Revised RIA guidelines which take account of these and other issues raised in the context of the review are being finalised by the Department of the Taoiseach and will be published shortly.  I understand the revised guidelines will advise all Departments to measure administrative burdens as part of their RIAs in future, in order to ensure the RIA process complements the targeted administrative burden reduction programme, dealing with existing legislation, which my Department is leading.  This process should ensure the minimum administrative burden is imposed on business by new legislation.  In addition, the RIA training course, operated in conjunction with the Civil Service training and development centre, has been revised to take account of the review findings and now contains a specific module on RIA and the so-called business perspective.</p>
            <p eId="para_203">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_204">Regulatory impact analysis is an important tool which helps to support the development of proportionate, effective and targeted legislation.  It is essential that each Department adheres to the requirements of the RIA process and ensures RIAs are published in a timely and accessible fashion.  In this regard, my officials will continue to work with the RIA network and the better regulation unit in the Department of the Taoiseach in order to continue to refine the approach we take when developing new legislation.  This will ensure that legislative proposals continue to be proportionate, striking the right balance between the often competing rights of workers, consumers and individual enterprises on the one hand and, on the other, freedom for business to take quick decisions to adjust to global market competition.</p>

          <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_95">
            <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
            <p eId="para_205">My concern regarding the regulatory impact assessments that have been done to date is that they tend not to include any figures on savings achieved.  One would assume such assessments would include a calculation as to costs rather than the type of box analysis that has taken place.  No regulatory impact assessment was undertaken in respect of the Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008.  It was screened for it but a decision was made by the Department not to do a full RIA.  The idea that legislation such as this would not have a regulatory cost for business is absurd.  It provides additional powers to the authorities and creates 23 new offences for employers.  How can this not have a regulatory cost for business?  I am not convinced the Department is serious about the agenda of regulatory reform.</p>

            <from>Deputy Conor Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_206">The Deputy's comments in regard to cost are well timed.  It is important to remember that the high level group that was appointed in July 2008 has so far identified €20 million in savings from the conduct of these regulatory impact analyses.  That is a significant beginning to the process of evaluating costs.  However, I agree with the Deputy that we must put numbers behind the savings.  It is not enough to talk entirely about the process of regulatory impact analysis.  This group, which is expected to report in the summer, will offer those numbers in its annual report to the Tánaiste on the savings being made through the RIA process.</p>
            <p eId="para_207">In addition, we are also rolling out the standard cost model across all Departments.  This will allow Opposition Deputies and the public to conduct a proper comparative analysis as to how we are performing in comparison with other European Union countries.</p>

            <p eId="para_214">The Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment has completed a study on the situation of small businesses in towns in the Dublin commuter belt.  That report, including 12 recommendations, will be submitted to the Tánaiste next week.  We hope those recommendations will be implemented.  One of the greatest obstacles and sources of frustration for small businesses is the perceived level of regulation and bureaucracy.  Many owners told us their businesses were being strangled by it.  Is there any way that a single, simple, unified form can be introduced that would facilitate persons in meeting all regulatory requirements, including in regard to tax, submissions to the Chief State Solicitor's office and so on.  The latter sends out forms every month that must be filled.  Small businesses employing only one or two staff are obliged to employ a bookkeeper for half a day per week to deal with all the regulation requirements.  I agree with the Tánaiste that it is small and medium-sized enterprises that will drive a recovery in the economy in the next three to five years.  However, such enterprises will not thrive if they are strangled at birth through the imposition of excessive regulation.</p>

          <speech by="#ConorLenihan" eId="spk_103" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment">
            <from>Deputy Conor Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_215">In overarching terms, an issue on which the Government is working closely, one which has arisen time and again at Cabinet level and in other discussions, is the possibility of having a unique business indicator or number to enable businesses to transact business with the State as an individual.  I hope such a development would assist small businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_216">I concur with Deputy Penrose that red tape is the curse of small business.  This issue arose recently at a Competitiveness Council meeting I attended in Prague in place of the Tánaiste.  Governments throughout the world are struggling with the question of how to eliminate the red tape and bureaucracy we impose on small to medium-sized enterprises which account for 65% of all businesses in the European Union.  This is a unique and distinct problem for the Continent of Europe, including Ireland.  The burden of bureaucracy is greater here because our businesses tend to be smaller than elsewhere in Europe.  Relatively large companies qualify as small businesses in Europe when considered in the context of the structure and status of Irish businesses.</p>
            <p eId="para_217">It is important that regulatory impact analyses are conducted well and published.  The Department publishes these analyses on its website and it is open to members of the public to judge the Government on its actions and its decisions not to proceed to legislation.  The quantity of legislation we produce in the House must be reduced.</p>

            <from>Deputy Conor Lenihan</from>
            <p eId="para_223">Science, technology and innovation are critical to the future competitiveness of our enterprise sector and Ireland must produce the talented students and graduates to drive a knowledge-based economy.  The Government's Strategy for Science, Technology and Innovation, SSTI, 2006-2013, aims to ensure that "Ireland by 2013 will be internationally renowned for the excellence of its research, and will be to the forefront in generating and using new knowledge for economic and social progress, within an innovation driven culture".  The Government is committed to making this vision a reality and making Ireland a key location for leading edge research and development, and a location for high quality jobs that are underpinned by knowledge and high skill levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_224">The targets within the strategy for science, technology and innovation, which relate to the increased promotion of interest in science and technology among students and businesses, include increased participation in the sciences by young people; a significant increase in the numbers of people with advanced qualifications in science and engineering; and transformational change in the quality and quantity of research undertaken by enterprise both directly and in co-operation with third level institutions.</p>
            <p eId="para_225">The first report on the implementation of the strategy for science, technology and innovation was published in December last and is available at <i>www.entemp.ie</i>.  The report confirms that substantial progress has been made in achieving these objectives.  Both reports provide evidence that the Government’s integrated strategy is working, as seen in the following internationally comparable key indicators.  Total research and development spending has almost trebled over ten years and Ireland’s total expenditure on research and development had risen to 1.56% of GNP at the end of 2006.  Total research and development spending across all sectors of the economy is expected to climb to €2.6 billion or 1.66% of gross national product in 2008.  Business expenditure on research and development, BERD, increased to an estimated €1.68 billion or 1.08% of GNP in 2008.  Higher education research and development spending has almost quadrupled in current terms over ten years and is now at the European Union and OECD average levels.  This increased investment in the higher education sector is having a significant impact in terms of human capital development, feeding through to attraction of foreign direct investment and commercialisation.  The number of research personnel employed in research and development activities across the business sector in Ireland rose to 13,861 in head count terms in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_226">Early estimates of research and development activity levels point to sharp increases in the number of firms performing significant research and development — expenditure of more than €2 million — with 164 significant research and development performers in 2007 compared to 118 in 2005.  There also appears to be evidence of firms which were smaller performers of research and development in 2005 stepping up activity to become larger performers in 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_227">Additional information not given on the floor of the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_228">Science Foundation Ireland, SFI, strongly encourages outreach by SFI-funded researchers to advance public understanding of science and engineering through supporting a number of education and outreach activities.  These are designed to promote and provide information on the exciting and ground breaking research that Science Foundation Ireland funds.  These programmes play an important role in encouraging the next generation of researchers, namely, our young people, to consider a career in science and engineering research.  The initiatives supported by Science Foundation Ireland include programmes such as UREKA sites, the SFI-Dell Young Women in Engineering Scholarship and Speakers for Schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_229">In addition, as part of their funding, all Science Foundation Ireland centres for science engineering and technology are required to undertake extensive education and outreach programmes.  These programmes are aimed at keeping the public aware of exciting new research findings and encouraging young people to study and take up careers in research.  The activities include computer games, websites, visitor programmes, videos, teaching packs, as well as public debates and fora.</p>
            <p eId="para_230">The discover science and engineering programme aims to raise the general level of awareness of the physical sciences and raise the level of student uptake of the physical sciences at second and third level.  The programme is administered by Forfás on behalf of my Department.  An evaluation carried out by an international panel of experts in 2008 concluded that the programme represents very good value for money and is playing an important role in encouraging young people to study science and technology and in enhancing general science awareness.  The panel outlined a number of recommendations to improve the strength and efficacy of the programme in delivering its objectives.  A key finding was that the remit of the programme should continue to focus on the physical sciences and engineering and be extended to comprehend the promotion of maths literacy to encourage the increased take up of higher level maths at second level and to promote career opportunities which require a high level of maths competency.</p>
            <p eId="para_231">Since the programme was established, funding has been increased from €1.5 million in 2004 to €2.685 million in 2009.  For the remainder of this year, the programme will focus on delivering its key strategic objectives of promoting study in the priority areas of science, engineering and technology.  Within resource constraints, the programme team is gearing up to replicate at second level the success it had with programmes such as Discover Primary Science at primary level and is extending its remit to promote maths as a key underpinning discipline.</p>
            <p eId="para_232">The Government is committed to investing in Ireland's science base as one of the key cornerstones underpinning future jobs in Ireland and the lynchpin of our transformation to the smart economy.  The challenge for the immediate future will be to effectively manage the  implementation of the Government's strategy for science, technology and innovation in a much tighter resource environment.</p>

            <p eId="para_233">I recently asked the Tánaiste a question about the discover science and engineering programme, for which funding has been halved from €5.25 million in 2008 to €2.68 million this year.  In her reply, she recognised that the programme provides very good value for money and plays an important role in encouraging young people to study science and technology.  Given its importance for future economic development, why has funding for the programme been cut?</p>

This is an inevitable part of the adjustment the country, economy and society are making.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for science, technology and innovation, I hope we will emerge from our current problems sooner rather than later.  However, the expenditure reduction in this area is inevitable given the extent to which public spending must be pared back in the current climate.</p>

          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_243">This morning, I listened carefully to the chairman of the Bank of Ireland, who has announced his resignation, state that accountability for losses must be taken at the top.  While I am not a fan of bankers whose irresponsibility has threatened everything that hard-working people in this country built up over the years, at least Mr. Burrows was willing to accept responsibility and take accountability to its conclusion by tendering his resignation.  He is not the only individual to have done so.  By resigning, his industry colleagues in Allied Irish Banks, Anglo Irish Bank, Irish Life &amp; Permanent and Irish Nationwide, as well as the Financial Regulator, have all accepted responsibility for their actions and seen to it that accountability is taken at the top.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">On the other hand, the Taoiseach appears to be the last person to do this.  While he says he accepts responsibility for his actions and collectively of those of the Government during its years in office, he will not see this through to accountability.  As Minister for Finance, he presided over a regime which put banks and developers before people and under which we have gone from a surplus of €9 billion to a deficit of €20 billion.  His regime spent €60 million of taxpayers' money on useless voting machines and €200 million on a failed computer system for the health system, removed medical cards from people aged over 70 years and intends to remove teachers from children with special needs.  The Taoiseach says he accepts responsibility but there is no accountability in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">People are faced with job losses and massive reductions in income.  The lack of confidence coming from the Government is causing frustration and a loss of morale.  I stood in the kitchen of a household where the husband and wife have lost their jobs and three of their sons are unemployed.  This is replicated in thousands of homes across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">The Taoiseach accepts responsibility for a situation in which a budget was introduced with no fiscal stimulus for job creation.  I put it to him that just as the shareholders in Bank of Ireland had their say this morning, so the shareholders in Ireland Inc. will have their say on 5 June.  If they proceed to vote as they are talking and they vote no confidence in the Government, will the Taoiseach accept that responsibility and will he take that accountability to the top and seek a fresh mandate for his Government from the people who see this regime as nothing other than Fianna Fáil dictatorship?</p>

          <p eId="para_273">The Government's programme has condemned every family in the country to having levered on top of them a mortgage of up to €45,000, which will deal with the bank crisis, which the Taoiseach allowed to happen despite warnings, not only from this party but also from a range of independent organisations dealing with financial direction and financial rectitude.  That is what the Taoiseach has allowed to happen.  The Government will impose €45,000 on every family if it proceeds with the establishment of the National Asset Management Agency.  The agency has already been torpedoed below the waterline by the chief executive of the National Treasury Management Agency who, as one of the foremost public officials in the country, stated that he has no idea whether it will work.  He went on to state that we have not found any solutions, and the fact that he reads more about this in the newspapers than he does from Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_274">Despite the fact that the Taoiseach takes the view that we on this side of the House pontificate all of the time, I put it to him that the proposal from the Fine Gael Party to evolve out of the banks clean banks and fund those through a wholesale bank capitalised from the European Central Bank will not expose the taxpayer to a potentially devastating economic crucifixion of €90 billion assessed increase on the national debt.  That is where the Taoiseach is proceeding.  The chief executive of the NTMA stated that the lawyers will have a generation of field days in the courts out of the way the Government is proceeding.</p>
          <p eId="para_275">If he is interested in alternative views that will not expose the taxpayer to that crippling debt, is the Taoiseach prepared discuss with me the Fine Gael proposal, which will not involve crucifying the taxpayer in this regard, which will free up credit to businesses in a short period with clean trustworthy banks where there is integrity?  This would ensure that those who caused the problems with the banks in the first place will have to pay for their difficulties, following which we can then proceed to restore some confidence to business where credit begins to flow and where there is a system that will not involve the taxpayer being exposed to a potential €90 billion debt.</p>

          <p eId="para_278">The Fine Gael plan appears to rely heavily on allowing the financial system to default on certain bonds or loans that have been issued or availed of.  That has been clearly stated.  In deciding whether the State can allow the financial system to default on such loans I would take account of an expert in this field, Mr. John Corrigan, director of the National Pensions Reserve Fund who, in his evidence on 14 May last to the Committee of Public Accounts, stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_279">There is a close relationship in terms of how the capital markets view the bonds outstanding in respect of the banks and how they view Ireland as a sovereign borrower.  Walking away from the bank debts and allowing them to default on the bonds, in effect their senior debt, would have a very negative read across for Ireland Inc.  I have little doubt that the cost of borrowing to the State would hugely increase if that approach were to be adopted.</p>

          <p eId="para_331">The Government published a briefing document on the night of the budget.  It stated: "This is a priority for Government."  We still do not have the legislation and no idea as to when it will be published.  The briefing document stated: "It is proposed to establish the NAMA on a statutory basis".  Since then, the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance have said that they intend to establish NAMA on a non-statutory basis initially.  The Labour Party has pointed out that this cannot be done, in that NAMA would not be able to do anything about anything because it would not have statutory authority to discount loans, carry out evaluations and so on as it is supposed to.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">Six weeks ago, the Minister for Finance stated that NAMA would be established under the auspices of the NTMA.  Last Thursday, the NTMA's chief executive appeared before the Committee of Public Accounts, but he did not appear to know a great deal about NAMA and did not seem enthusiastic about the idea.  He told the committee that the NTMA had neither the staff nor resources to establish NAMA and that it would eventually become bogged down in the courts, resulting in what he described as a bonanza for lawyers.  He stated: "The implications are enormous."  What is the Government doing about this issue?</p>
          <p eId="para_333">I have a number of specific questions.  When will we get the details?  When will legislation be published and enacted to establish NAMA?  When will it be set up exactly?  When will it start work exactly?  Is it being delayed, as one newspaper reported at the weekend, because the Government is planning a second wave of bailouts, this time for the big developers?

It is necessary in the interests of trying to restore the sort of credit in the system that we need to see and to get businesses back up and running.</p>

          <p eId="para_347">Obviously, we have a steering group in place.  It includes the representatives of the Department of Finance, the Office of the Attorney General and the NTMA, including Brendan McDonagh, who unfortunately was unable to attend the committee meeting in question due to a family bereavement.  All of that work is taking place as part of the work to prepare the legislation, which is being proceeded with and which we hope to publish this summer before we break up.  A lot of work is taking place and it is well under way.  The heads of the Bill should be brought to Government next month.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">As Deputy Gilmore said, in tandem with the work on the legislation, the practical preparations are being progressed.  As the Deputy knows, Brendan McDonagh of the NTMA has been appointed as interim managing director.  The Minister for Finance has directed the NTMA's chief executive to provide the necessary resources to support the work of the interim managing director in preparation for NAMA.  We know that, as it currently is, the NTMA does not have the staff and expertise in this matter.  It will recruit, as it has done in respect of every task it has been asked to take on.  It has done so very professionally and well.  The Minister will soon appoint an advisory committee, which will provide a range of expert advice both to him and to the interim managing director.  We are engaged with the EU Commission with a view to ensuring that the final structure of the National Asset Management Agency is consistent with EU guidelines on asset purchase schemes and State aid rules.</p>
          <p eId="para_349">On the appointment of expert advisers, as is being currently proceeded with by NAMA through the aegis of the NTMA, substantive work will begin on the analysis of eligible assets, valuation methodology, management of engagement with the financial institutions and identifying how one goes ahead with a viability review in line with EU Commission requirements.  All of that practical work will go on in tandem with the preparation of legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_350">Yes, it is a complex area.  Yes, it is an arduous task.  It is a necessary task that has been undertaken in the way that has been outlined by the Minister for Finance.  Of course, it is important to get it right and that is precisely the task that we are undertaking currently.</p>

          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_522">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_523">I am pleased to address the House on the taking of Second Stage of this Bill.  The principle upon which we meet health care costs as a society is that the young support the old, the healthy support the sick, and the better off support the less well off.  These principles are most easily integrated and implemented in taxation-based funding of health care, the predominant means of health funding in our country, at just under 80% of total health spending.  However, since voluntary health insurance has had a long history as an integral part of providing for the cost of health care in this country, successive Governments have sought to implement these principles in the realm of health insurance, particularly those principles of the young supporting the old and the healthy supporting the sick.</p>
          <p eId="para_524">All insurance is a matter of pooling risk, and thus a sharing of the overall cost.  Within an insurance pool, the price of an individual's policy can vary according to his or her claims experience and the risk of that person making future claims, as is the case with motor insurance.  Therefore, while there remains risk pooling and cost sharing, the contribution of each person to the pool rises with his or her risk profile.  When this risk rating is applied to health insurance pools, the inevitable result is that older people and sicker people have to pay substantially more for the same cover.  In recognition of this, successive Governments and the Oireachtas have been committed since 1994 to maintaining the principle of community rating rather than risk rating of health insurance.  The purpose always has been that the price of a policy should reflect the risks and costs of the entire pool of insured persons in the community, rather than the risks and costs on a person by person basis, or even the persons within each separate policy.  Only in this way can solidarity and cost sharing be effectively implemented between the generations who hold insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_525">The Health Insurance Acts 1994 to 2007 provide the statutory basis for the regulation of the health insurance market in the interests of this common good.  The pricing of risk across the community of insured persons clearly requires robust mechanisms to share costs when there are a number of companies in the market.  The risk equalisation scheme, which was affirmed by the House in 2003 and approved of by the European Commission that same year, provided a mechanism for sharing the costs of providing necessary care among the insurers.  While all political parties and most academics and professional bodies, including the Society of Actuaries, supported the risk equalisation scheme, that scheme and its supporting regulatory regime were challenged in the courts by BUPA Ireland.  These challenges were rejected by the European Court of First Instance and by the High Court in Ireland. However, they ultimately succeeded when the Supreme Court found the risk equalisation scheme to be <i>ultra vires  </i>in July 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_526">It is important for the House to note that the Supreme Court decision did not strike down the principles of community rating, open enrolment and lifetime cover, nor indeed the principle of risk equalisation.  The court found the scheme to be <i>ultra vires </i>because the legislation did not provide for an explicit link between community rating and the specific mechanism provided in the 2003 regulations.  The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court subsequently clarified that the decision which found the 2003 scheme to be <i>ultra vires </i> was not an obstacle to the Government bringing forward a new scheme.  The Supreme Court decision focussed in particular on the issue of whether the legislation provided for risk equalisation applying across the entire market, given the definition of community rating contained in the 1994 Act.  It concluded that the definition of community rating did not allow this interpretation and, therefore, that the scheme that equalised risk on the basis of community rating across the market was <i>ultra vires.</i>
                    </p>
          <p eId="para_527">Following this decision in July 2008, there was a need for a prompt response to ensure confidence in the market, and to ensure that market fragmentation due to the introduction of plans aimed at younger, healthier lives did not take place.  Some interim scheme is required to ensure this does not take place, while a longer term solution is developed and put in place.  I came to the conclusion that there was a need for an interim scheme in order to prevent a risk-rated market developing in a manner that would make it impossible to revert to an effective community rated market.</p>
          <p eId="para_528">There was also a need to ensure the protection of older people, many of whom had been paying private health insurance for many years, and who were now — at the point where they needed such insurance most — facing the prospect of no longer being able to afford appropriate cover due to the real danger of re-pricing and the re-design of policies.  Actuarial evidence indicates that it is from the age of 50 upwards that the cost of an insured person increases to above the market average, and increases by multiples of the market average by the time the insured person is 70 years of age.  The additional cost risk to the insurance provider for older people is an actuarially measurable risk, clearly set out in the reports of the Health Insurance Authority, and action was required to ensure this risk was not translated into age specific products with associated differential prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">It is also true that, although the most readily identifiable group with regard to measurable risk consists of those people of 50 years of age and older, the principle of community rating protects all persons suffering ill health, irrespective of age.  This is because, under a community-rated system, prices for products are the same to all persons, irrespective of age and health status.  However, the reality is that in the absence of an immediate mechanism to support intergenerational solidarity, there are incentives for insurers to design products that are attractive only to healthier lives, thereby undermining intergenerational solidarity and the common good protections.  The market is then open to fragmentation and intergenerational solidarity is at risk of being weakened or eliminated.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">In the aftermath of the July 2008 Supreme Court decision, there were very real indications in the private health insurance market that this risk rating fragmentation could occur.  In the absence of an appropriate response, it would be in the interests of all insurers to focus on products that would be particularly attractive to healthier lives and to minimise features in their products that would be attractive to older people and people with ill health, in the knowledge that there was nothing in the regulatory framework that would counteract the advantages to be gained from pursuing this strategy.  This would have conflicted with the common good principles of community rated health insurance and intergenerational solidarity that underlie the regulation of the private health insurance market, and there was a very real danger that private health insurance would cease to be affordable for older people and those with poorer health.</p>
          <p eId="para_531">It is for this reason that I instructed officials from my Department to work with the Health Insurance Authority and legal and actuarial experts, as well as considering submissions from the market stakeholders, that is, the three health insurance providers in the Irish market; Hibernian AVIV A, Quinn Insurance and VHI, to develop an interim scheme which could be put in place promptly to stabilise the market while a longer term solution was developed.  It is this interim scheme that is provided for in the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">There are three main companies currently active in the private health insurance market in Ireland.  There are three restricted membership undertakings operating for members of the Garda Síochána, prison officers and employees of the Electricity Supply Board.  However, as these undertakings do not operate in the open market, they are not included in this scheme.  In the case of both Quinn Healthcare and Hibernian AVIVA, health insurance is just one product in a range offered by their parent groups.  VHI is currently involved only in the provision of private health insurance and related products.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">Approximately 52% of the Irish population currently hold private health insurance.  The value of the market is estimated currently to be in the region of €1.6 billion.  The customer survey of the health insurance market published in May 2008 by the Health Insurance Authority showed the market share of VHI continuing to fall and that of Quinn Healthcare and Hibernian, formerly known as VIVAS, continuing to rise.  At that point, VHI Healthcare's market share was 70%, down from 76% in 2005.  Quinn Healthcare had around 20% of the market, up from 17% in 2005, while VIVAS Health, which entered the market in 2004, had a 6% share.  The restricted membership undertakings constituted 4% of the market.  More recent data indicate that the market share of VHI has fallen to 66%, while the share of Quinn Healthcare is now at 22% and Hibernian AVIVA has reached 9%.  VHI continues to have, by some way, the highest number and proportion of members over 50 years of age.  While Quinn Healthcare's customer profile is changing, that company and especially Hibernian AVIVA continue to have a significantly younger age profile than the overall market.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">Current legislation allows for the introduction of lifetime community rating, which takes into account the age at which an individual commences private health insurance cover and provides for a community-rated loading to be applied to individuals based on their age when entering the market.  This encourages younger people to continue to take out health insurance.  I intend to bring forth regulations, as provided for under Section 7 A of the main Act, with the intention of commencing lifetime community rating by the end of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_535">I wish to outline the details of the interim scheme provided for in the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008 and I will then go into more detail on the Bill itself.  The interim scheme consists of two elements, namely, age related tax reliefs granted to individuals who hold private health insurance, and a levy charged on private health insurance companies to be used to finance the age-related tax reliefs.  The details of the relief are as follows:</p>

          <p eId="para_551">The existing tax relief at source of 20%, which will continue to apply, will relate to the gross premium paid net of the new credit being introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">Each private health insurance company will be required to pay an annual levy to the Revenue Commissioners.  The levy will be remitted to the Exchequer and will form part of overall Exchequer funding.  It will be charged on all adult insured lives at a level of €160.  Apart from a reduction to one third of this amount, €53, for insured lives under age 18, to reflect the fact that insurance premiums for under 18s are on average one third of the adult premium, there will be no differentiation on the basis of age.  The age-related private health insurance relief and the levy will be subject to annual review to take account of medical inflation and the impact of an aging population.</p>
          <p eId="para_553">I take this opportunity to provide clarification on three points.  First, the levy is being placed on the health insurance companies in respect of each insured life and not on individual subscribers.  It is a matter for the companies whether to pass this levy on to their customers.  Neither I nor my Department has any role to play in the settling of premia prices by any of the private health insurance companies, including the VHI.  The levy is to be paid to the Revenue Commissioners on 30 September in each of the years 2009, 2010 and 2011.</p>
          <p eId="para_554">Second, the additional tax relief under the scheme is being granted at source to the insurer as tax relief at source, TRS.  it is granted on the basis that the insurer must charge the same net premium to all persons covered by a plan.  Operation of the medical insurance relief outside the income tax system means that the relief is available to all persons, including those whose taxable income would be insufficient to avail of the tax relief.  Under the TRS scheme, a person who pays no tax, will pay the same reduced premium as a taxpayer.  This will be reflected in the fact that each person will pay the same net premium.  Third, the tax relief being made available under the interim scheme is a fixed sum tax relief.  The amount of relief given is fixed, irrespective of the plan held by the insured person and, accordingly, there will not be higher amounts of relief available for more expensive plans.</p>
          <p eId="para_555">I should point out at this stage that the age-related tax relief and the levy will apply only to the commercial insurers operating in the market.  As I stated earlier, they will not apply to the restricted membership undertakings, RMUs, for the ESB, Garda and prison officers.  The option given to the restricted membership undertakings to choose to be included in the original risk equalisation scheme has been identified as a legal weakness in the regulatory framework.  The members of RMUs are not fully part of the health insurance market and there would be an obvious anomaly in having the customers of the companies operating in the open market contributing towards payments which might be made towards the care costs of members of restricted schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">I would like now to deal with some of the specific measures in the Bill.  The main objects of the Bill are to affirm that the purposes of the Health Insurance Acts include, <i>inter alia</i>, ensuring that access to health insurance cover is available to all consumers without differentiation in respect of age and health status; strengthening the legislative provisions to achieve this purpose; securing intergenerational solidarity and community rated health insurance and providing for the implementation of related measures to achieve these objects.</p>
          <p eId="para_557">Section 3 provides that the principal objective of the Minister and the Health Insurance Authority, in performing their functions under the Act, is to ensure in the interests of the common good that access to health insurance cover is available to all, with no differentiation based on age and health status.  Section 4<b> </b>includes key definitions of terms such as “community rated health insurance contract” and “community rating”, which encompasses measures that support the achievement of the principal objective.  In keeping with the change of emphasis with regard to community rating, namely, that this will be achieved at net premia, the term “net premium” is also defined.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">Section 6 substitutes a new section for section of 7 of the Act, with changes aimed at ensuring that community rated health insurance contracts are made available without differentiation, irrespective of age or health status.  Section 7(1 )(<i>a</i>) requires insurers to offer any particular contract for a period of not less than 31 days.  Section 7(1)(<i>b</i>), instructs insurers to charge all persons the same net premium.  Section<b> </b>7 amends section 7A of the principal Act and provides for a reduction from 35 to 30 in the age at which late entry loadings can be applied.<b> </b> Section 8<b> </b>provides that private health insurers are to submit new contracts to the Health Insurance Authority 20 working days in advance of their being offered for sale to potential customers.  This section also provides for the authority to establish a register of health insurance contracts.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">Section 9<b> </b>inserts into the principal Act a new section to provide for the necessary data returns to be made to the Health Insurance Authority to allow monitoring of this scheme.  This section also provides for the use of data returned.  Section 10 amends section 12A of the principal Act.  This amendment provides for the use of data returns made in the calculation of the age-related tax credit and the amount of the levy payable.  Section 11<b> </b>replaces section 13 of the principal Act which contained limited provisions around advertising and promotion of health insurance business.  This new section includes provisions with an emphasis on enhancing the position of the consumer in relation to information and advertisements.  It also provides that certain information should accompany advertisements where it is in the interests of policy holders or potential policy holders.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">Section 12<b> </b>amends section 14 of the principal Act.  This amendment prevents the establishment of new restricted membership undertakings offering health insurance.<b> </b>Section 13<b> </b>inserts a new part into the principal Act enabling the Health Insurance Authority to pursue enforcement of provisions where it is of the opinion that an insurer is contravening a provision or is likely to do so again.  The section sets out a process whereby the authority may take a number of steps to have any contravention remedied, including making an application to the High Court seeking compliance.  Provision is also made in this section for an insurer to make an application to the High Court to have an enforcement notice cancelled, confirmed or varied and for consideration by the Supreme Court on a question of law.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">Section 14<b> </b>provides for the amendment and substitution of section 21(1) of the principal Act which deals with the functions of the authority and enhances the functions and powers of the authority in line with the provisions of this Bill particularly in terms of the rights of consumers.<b> </b> Sections 15 to 21<b> </b>amend the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 to provide for a new age-related tax credit in respect of payment of private health insurance premiums due on or after 1 January 2009 and before 1 January 2012 in respect of persons aged 50 years and over.  These sections relate directly to the tax relief elements of the interim scheme I outlined earlier.  Section<b> </b>22 inserts a new section 125A into the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 to provide for the collection of the annual levy on health insurance companies based on the number of lives covered by policies underwritten by them.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">I will be bringing forward amendments on Committee Stage.  These include drafting amendments, amendments to address the concerns of the Information Commissioner on the protection of personal information, amendments to the principal Act to facilitate the introduction of lifetime community rating and amendments to expand on the evaluation and analysis that the HIA is to undertake under section 9.  I will also be bringing forward amendments having regard to concerns raised by the industry since publication of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">The terms of the scheme, as provided for in the Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008, were notified to the European Commission as a potential state aid in November 2008.  Initial indications were that the Commission would give its decision on the notification in mid-February.  I indicated at the time that I would not seek to move Second Stage of the Bill until the Commission had given its approval to the scheme.  However the process of scrutinising the proposal has proven to be more protracted than originally thought.  The Commission has sought a considerable amount of additional information on the operation of the scheme.  All of the information sought has now been provided and I expect that the formal decision will be notified to us in early June.  Given that this new scheme involves the same principles as the scheme approved by the Commission in 2003 and is designed to have a similar common good effect on the market I would hope that the Commission would come to the same conclusion.  If the Commission's decision requires any changes to be made to the scheme I will bring forth appropriate amendments on Committee or Report Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">As the Bill deals with the regulatory framework for the provision of health insurance, I take this opportunity to signal a review of the minimum levels of benefits insurers are obliged to provide in the health insurance contracts offered by them.  The current prescribed minimum levels of benefits have been largely unchanged since 1996.  I will be asking the Health Insurance Authority to engage in a consultation process with a view to enhancing the minimum levels of cover that insurers will be obliged to provide.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">The combination of measures in the Bill is designed to preserve and sustain the key elements of the regulatory framework for the health insurance market which have had the support of successive Governments.  These need to be put in place while a more permanent replacement for the 2003 risk equalisation scheme is designed.  Initial work has already commenced on the replacement scheme.  While that continues over the next two to three years the Government must ensure that market segmentation through the development of niche products directed at attractive segments of the population does not undermine community-rated health insurance.  There is also a requirement to ensure that the market operates in a more transparent manner and that the powers of the Health Insurance Authority allow it to effectively intervene in the market if circumstances demand such intervention.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_570">Such is Deputy Woods's reputation that I shrank in fear up at the back.</p>
          <p eId="para_571">I wish to comment on some of the issues the Minister raised in her contribution.  She said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_572">The court found the [risk equalisation] scheme to be <i>ultra</i>
                        <i>vires</i> because the legislation did not provide for an explicit link between community rating and the specific mechanism provided in the 2003 regulations.  The Chief Justice subsequently clarified that the decision finding the 2003 scheme to be <i>ultra vires</i> was not an obstacle to the Government bringing forward a new scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_573">That certainly is the case.  I wonder why the Government does not take the opportunity to introduce an entirely new scheme and appoint a regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_574">The Minister also stated:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_575">However the reality of the situation is that in the absence of an immediate mechanism to support intergenerational solidarity there are incentives for insurers to design products that are attractive only to healthier lives undermining intergenerational solidarity and the common good protections.  The market is then open to fragmentation and intergenerational solidarity is at risk of being weakened or eliminated.</p>
          <p eId="para_576">That could be addressed by a strong regulator as is done in Holland.</p>
          <p eId="para_577">The Minister continued:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_578">There were very real indications in the private health insurance market that this risk rating fragmentation could occur.  In the absence of an appropriate response, it would be in the interests of all insurers to focus on products that would be particularly attractive to healthier lives and to minimise features in their products that would be attractive to older people and people with ill health in the knowledge that there was nothing in the regulatory framework that would counteract the advantages to be gained from pursuing this strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">Is that not still the case?  We have spoken on the matter before and I have tabled questions to the Minister on it.  On 25 November in reply to a parliamentary question she said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_580">The effect of the measures on the premiums charged for particular policies by individual companies is a commercial decision for the companies themselves, as they set both policy benefits and pricing at the same time.  However, they should not in themselves lead to an overall increase in the approximately €1.5 billion in private health insurance premiums paid, as the levy will yield approximately the same amount as the cost of the tax relief at source.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">Yet we now know that is not the case.  We now know that VHI increased its premiums by 23% and that Quinn Healthcare and Hibernian Aviva followed suit.  Although not quite to the same level, they were forced to increase their premia to recoup the levy.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">On 16 December 2008 in response to another question on the same issue the Minister said:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_583">Anyone inclined to cancel their insurance now should consider carefully that they may have to pay a higher premium to re-enter the market at a later date.  In introducing the measures announced on 19 November, the Government had to choose between allowing older people to be forced out of the market and trying to maintain the key principle of intergenerational solidarity whereby the young support the old.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">I would like to particularly focus on the phrase "allowing older people to be forced out of the market".  The reality is that many people have been forced out of the market.  I have been in contact with the insurance companies which are recording many people not renewing their subscriptions and dropping from higher benefit categories to lower ones, for example from plans D and E to plans B and C.  Some might say that is good or bad, but clearly in many cases it is a question of affordability.  Clearly younger people in particular faced with paying their mortgages and faced with Government levies are finding themselves in serious difficulty.  Many of them have lost their jobs or one member of the household has lost his or her job and they are looking at the increase in their insurance premium and letting it go.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">The move has been counterproductive.  It has not achieved what it set out to achieve.  As I have already alluded to, it could have been achieved through the different mechanism of strong regulation, which has been sorely lacking particularly in our financial institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">The Bill allows the new levy to be applied retrospectively from January 2009.  The levy applies a charge of €160 to all adults and €53 to all children.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">All insurers have increased their premia by more than the average annual medical inflation rate of 10% to reflect the new levy, thereby making health insurance unaffordable and pushing families out of the market.  The Government is still awaiting approval from the European Commission on the introduction of this levy.  Hibernian Aviva Health and Quinn Healthcare claim they have increased their premia purely because the cost and retrospective nature of the levy automatically put VHI's competitors into a loss making position.  VHI has increased premia by 23%, Quinn Healthcare by 16% and Hibernian Aviva by 22%.  The latter has stated it intends to keep the moneys made from this increase in a separate account and will refund customers if the Commission does not approve the levy.  Presumably that will also be done if the Minister in her wisdom decides to deal with the matter by regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">Although VHI is a net beneficiary of the levy in that it receives a substantial increase on tax relief at source on payments for those over 50 years of age, it nonetheless increased its prices by an average of 23% within two weeks of the levy's announcement.  This is typical of the dominant player in the market.  It was able to do so because it knew its competitors would have to increase their prices to cover the cost of the levy.  VHI's competitors argue that in the absence of the levy, the company would probably have made the more usual annual increase of between 8% and 10% to reflect medical inflation.  Hibernian Aviva Health argues that we are already seeing the effect of the lack of competitive pressure and that VHI lacks an incentive to lower premia or improve its efficiency.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The levy has unnecessarily increased the price of health insurance for all consumers at a time when other prices are falling.  Many observers believe the levy is propping up VHI because it appears to be the sole beneficiary.  The levy is clearly not benefitting consumers, VHI's competitors or health services.  VHI remains unregulated as an insurer and enjoys significant privileges as a result.  It was allowed an extension to the deadline for an insolvency ratio of 40%, which is uncompetitive, and it is not subject to the Financial Regulator's guidelines on asset management and investment funds.  This may in part explain last year's fall of 20% in the company's solvency ratio.  It was ordered to seek authorisation by 31 December 2008 but the deadline was extended to 31 March 2009.  When it also missed the second deadline, the Minister was forced to sign an order to change the date to 1 September.  This raises questions about the company's unfair competitive advantage given that it is not subject to the same scrutiny as other health insurers.  The Minister will understand why people believe one rule applies to VHI and another to everybody else.  It will be interesting to learn Europe's response to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">Due to the crude nature of the levy, health insurers cannot trade into it.  If they agree a contract and premium with a customer on 30 December 2008 they cannot adjust the price to cover the cost of the levy, which applies retrospectively from 1 January 2009 until the contract expires 12 months later.  In some cases, the new renewal prices which reflect the levy will not come into effect until December 2009.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">The Minister claimed that VHI premia would increase by 60% for old people.  Given the existence of community rating, how could that happen?</p>

          <from>Deputy James Reilly</from>
          <p eId="para_593">If the Minister is concerned about niche products, all she has to do is establish a real regulator who could rule on the content of standard packages and add-ons.  Given that the HSE has put the arm on VHI for €50 million up-front for next year, perhaps this is a revenue gather exercise on the part of the Government as much as anything else.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">She also claimed that the levy would not lead to an overall increase in health insurance premia but we know what actually happened.  VHI's 23% increase will probably reap it €230 million net.  She accused certain insurers of tailoring their plans to suit younger people.  Insurers must provide minimum benefits under each plan, including cataracts and hip replacements.  If she is genuinely concerned about the level of protection offered under minimum benefits, she would have revised the requirements rather than introduce a levy which increases the cost of health insurance.  Many of these issues could have been addressed by a regulator at no cost to those who pay for insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">VHI is increasing the cost of its core plans, which generally include a larger cohort of older people, as opposed to its company plans, which include more younger people.  Applying higher premia to older people is in breach of the principle of community rating and is contrary to what the Minister was supposedly trying to prevent.  Perhaps she will investigate this issue and revert to the House on it.  I would like to see the facts that would prove these allegations wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">Community rating is provided for in section 5 of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2001.  Insurers are required to charge the same rate for the a product regardless of a customer's age, sex, health status or sexual orientation.  The Bill before us does not improve the definition of community rating but merely amends it to reflect the tax credit and the Minister's health insurance levy.  This legislative change is unnecessary to strengthen the definition of community rating or reinforce inter-generational solidarity.  That has been upheld by the courts and I do not think any Member of this House would undermine community rating.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">The Government needs to clarify whether the levy is being ring-fenced for health purposes rather than accruing to the Exchequer.</p>

          <p eId="para_601">We would like to see it ring-fenced for health services.</p>
          <p eId="para_602">The Minister is propping up the VHI's dominant market share.  Her actions are anti-competitive and anti-consumer and reflect an ideology which was not associated with her in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_603">It is feared that the levy will make private health insurance unaffordable and will result in a contraction of the market by at least 10%, or 200,000 people.  In a contracting economy with rapidly increasing unemployment, it stands to reason that the contraction may be even larger as people prioritise what is most important to them.  Family premia are due to rise by an average of 20% on typical plans, which will result in a relative increase of more than 32% on cheaper family plans.  Families on the cheapest plans tend to be the most price sensitive in the market, in particular under current economic pressures.  It is projected that in excess of 200,000 persons in this lower end of the market will exit the market and be left with no option but to revert to the public health system, which is creaking under the strain of poor management with 500 beds removed from the system last year, 600 beds to be removed this year and not a sign of a single one of the 1,000 co-located hospital beds.  This week a HSE report highlights a 49% increase in delayed discharges between 2007 and 2009 from 514 a week to 757 a week so far this year.  The net effect is similar to taking St. James's Hospital out of the system for a year and this is why, particularly in the Dublin area, many people lie on trolleys for 24, 48 and 72 hours at a time and longer.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">The Minister is shaking her head and she can dispute the INO's figures while I can dispute her figures from the HSE.  However, the INO's figures are comparable week on week and a few weeks ago the number lying on trolleys hit 398.  A sick lady was referred from my surgery to a Dublin hospital at 9.30 a.m. last Tuesday.  She was left sitting on a chair between then and 4 p.m. on Wednesday at which point she was transferred to a trolley, on which she lay for another 24 hours.  This is no way to run a health service following ten years of a boom.  The Minister can spin all she wants and use all the figures she likes.  She can allude to the NTPF, which states 2.6 months is the average wait for a patient from the time the fund takes on the patient, which totally ignores the minimum three months patients must wait before they are taken on in the first place.  Many patients must wait six months and, therefore, they must wait up to nine months or longer.  In addition, patients must wait for up to two years for a colonoscopy in Tallaght hospital.</p>

          <p eId="para_606">Others must wait six or seven years to see a consultant to get on a waiting list.  People are not fools and while the Minister can fool some of the people all of the time, she cannot fool all of the people all of the time.  That is why people have woken up to the fact that under the Government the future will remain extremely bleak economically and in our health service and education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_607">I refer again to the levy having a disproportionate impact on families and students.  A number of players in the market currently operate tiered discount pricing for children and students, for example, the fourth child free or child pricing for students as set out in the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2007 for 18 to 20 year olds.  However, the levy is calculated at a flat rate of €53 per child, regardless of the cost of the premium.  Even though a child may be free, therefore, he or she will incur a tax of €53.  In addition, the levy does not differentiate between students and adults, although students are on discounted premia, as set out in the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2007.  All students will incur an additional cost of €160 each.  The Government has increased the registration fee and the Minister wants to whack the parents of students who have insurance with another charge of €160.  People are hurting and they will hurt all the more because of this unwise move.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">The levy will also significantly increase the cost of employee benefits to companies.  A number of large multinational companies, particularly from the US, provide private health insurance as part of their standard employee benefit package, which should be encouraged.  The levy will further increase the costs for such packages, thereby increasing the cost for companies to trade in Ireland at a time they face severe economic challenges.  They have not been helped either by several local authorities increasing rates just to rub the salt in.</p>

It is important for them to offer a quality health insurance benefit to remain competitive on benefits as well as to attract high calibre staff.  In addition, small and medium-sized enterprises that also purchase health insurance for their employees will be faced with significantly increased charges to provide this benefit.  The levy amounts to an increase of €12,800 for a company with 100 employees and this cost will clearly be considerably higher for larger companies.  The levy will cost a medium-sized enterprise employing 50 staff an additional €6,400 annually at a time every company is seeking to cut costs and struggling to survive and we are trying to protect jobs.  The Government's mantra is "Jobs, Jobs, Jobs", but its policies involve taxes on jobs and further costs for employers, which makes it difficult for them to retain jobs let alone create more.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">The market competition implications of this move are significant.  The levy is anti-competitive and it is a means to prop up the State dominant player.  VHI remains super dominant in the health insurance market.  The Minister stated the company's market share has reduced to 66%, down from 70% according to the most recent figures I have.  The VHI's declared profits last year were €112 million without having received any risk equalisation funds.  I have been accused of opposing risk equalisation.  I have not opposed the concept but the timing and the quantum have always been of considerable concern, particularly at a time the VHI generates such large profits and holds such a dominant position in the market.  There are questions about why it was necessary to introduce this levy and with such speed when there was no instability in the market.  It was anticipatory.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">Community rating, which all parties fully support and which has been prescribed in legislation, prevents companies from charging a higher premia to older members.  If market segmentation was viewed as a danger in the market, it could have been prevented through the amendment of the supervisory powers of the regulator and increasing the levels of minimum benefit required in regulation.  This is what happens in Holland.  The regulator regulates and monitors the market.  He or she is directly responsible to the Minister and the parliament.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">I am also bothered that the levy is not ring-fenced and, therefore, the VHI can use the proceeds for any purpose it chooses, particularly in expanding business.  We must remember that the VHI remains unregulated and does not require funding to reach solvency.  It is said to be seeking to expand its commercial mandate into other business lines and jurisdictions, and needs funding to accomplish this.  The VHI will receive in excess of €30 million from the levy in year one, yet it can use that money to compete in primary care in its joint activities with the SwiftCare clinics.  In addition, it can use the money to buy private hospitals and enter the life insurance and pension markets.</p>

Even within that context, it is not properly regulated and does not have to play by the rules under which other insurers must operate.  This is grossly uncompetitive in my view.</p>

          <p eId="para_628">We could end up with a situation, not just with our banks, but where the VHI could decide to become expansionist — it clearly intends to be — and go on a little adventure which could cost us €100 million and, whack, the taxpayer is caught again to bail it out because money, which was supposedly put aside for health, was used in a misadventure elsewhere.  I do not believe the taxpayer or the health service is getting proper protection.  This money should at least be ring-fenced for health.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">There are grave concerns about the impact the levy will have on consumers, businesses and the wider market.  According to research conducted by the regulator, price still remains the primary reason for switching on the market.  With the introduction of this levy, there will be a harmonisation of pricing thus reducing consumer choices and bringing about a stagnation of market share and a reduction of competition in the market.  That would seem to be the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_635">There might be a little bit of movement there but, by and large, the number in the market is shrinking.  The levy will create an even larger barrier to entry for any new players.  Unlike the previous risk equalisation, there are no exemptions to allow smaller, new players to establish themselves.  With such barriers to entry and harmonisation of pricing, there will be less scope to compete in this market, resulting in the delivery of less choice and less innovation.  Ultimately, it will result in poorer value to private health insurance customers.  The Minister and I know that with fewer players there is less likelihood of competition and less choice of product.  In the past, the VHI operated in a manner that controlled demand by limiting supply.  The entry of the two new players into the market has gone some way to reduce that method of operation, but we need more insurers in the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">Fine Gael's "Fair Care" document is based on the Dutch model.  Under that system, they have 20 different insurers in a market for 16 million people, which is highly regulated.  With that sort of regulation in place, they have managed to insist on a standard package which accounts for all of people's care, except for long-term care.  Through a risk equalisation fund, they have managed to make the elderly, chronically ill and diabetics more attractive to insurers who have gone after that market.  There is no reason we should not be doing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">I would not commend this Bill to the House.  I oppose it vehemently and believe it is ill advised.  It is anti-competitive and is driving families out of the insurance market.  It will put more pressure on our already pressurised health service.  On all counts it is destined to be a disaster.  We will regret the measure and, in fact, many people who have had to give up their private health insurance are already regretting it.  In a new paradigm with a new Fair Care deal, if Fine Gael is in power after the next election, which I hope will not be too far away, everybody will be insured and everybody will have timely access to hospital.  They will also have a free GP-care package and medication.</p>

          <p eId="para_646">I wish to begin where Deputy Reilly finished.  It is vital that we get the regulation of health insurance right, including the underpinning of community rating.  It will be one of the main building blocks of a fair and equitable health system for the future.  All the evidence, including opinion polls and what we are hearing on the doorsteps, suggests that the current Government will be out of office pretty soon.  The most likely replacement will be a Labour-Fine Gael Government and that opportunity will come sooner rather than later.  If that is the case, and I think it will be, we will be introducing a fair and equitable one-tier health system based on universal health insurance.  That has been the Labour Party's policy since 2002 and it is the policy of the Fine Gael Party as enunciated in its recent document.  We will have a one-tier, universal health insurance system under the next Government.  Even the Minister has decided to establish a group to examine the matter, even though she is not planning to have it report for quite some time.  By then, however, the new Government will presumably be in office.</p>

        <speech by="#JanOSullivan" eId="spk_409">
          <from>Deputy Jan O’Sullivan</from>
          <p eId="para_648">I am not necessarily talking about the Dutch model because there are elements of what Labour and Fine Gael are proposing which are not necessarily exactly in line with that.  However, we both subscribe to the core universal, single-tier model based on all the population being insured, with the State subsidising those who cannot afford to pay, and those who can afford to pay paying most of their costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">I wish to go back to the cost issue, which was being debated a second ago.  When Labour published its policy document in 2002, we estimated that a fair and equitable one-tier system based on universal health insurance could be implemented by raising spending on health from €5 billion to €7 billion.  Even allowing for inflation, the current bill of approximately €16 billion in public money and €4 billion in private money is way ahead of what we proposed at that time.  We did cost it and got some experts to examine the figures.  The Adelaide Society has costed what it calls a Rolls Royce model at not a hugely significant extra cost to what is being spent at the moment.  It can be done, so one must question what we have been doing for the past ten or 12 years and particularly since 2002 when our scheme was costed.  We are now up to €16 billion in health spending, yet there is very little improvement to show for it.  In fact, there is widespread public dissatisfaction with the health service.  Despite the Minister declaring that accident and emergency was a national crisis a couple of years ago, accident and emergency departments are as packed as ever.  The Minister has an aspiration to transfer more activity to primary care but it is just an aspiration and has not happened.  Yesterday, members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children went to see a lovely model in Mitchelstown, but there are very few of those up and running around the country.  In fact, the transfer to primary care has not happened to any great extent.  Unfortunately, the Minister's own privatisation agenda has made the two-tier system even more unbalanced than it was when the Labour Party published its proposals back in 2002.  It is imperative that reform comes as soon as possible because it is clear that spending more money in a bad system cannot be allowed to continue, especially in the current economic climate where we have swingeing cuts throughout the health services.  For that reason the legislation we are discussing today and the legislation the Minister plans to introduce subsequently to reform the original scheme are very important; we must ensure that we properly regulate the private health insurance market in the context of what I believe will be changes for the better in the health service in the very near future.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">One of the ways that needs to be done is to ensure that the Health Insurance Authority does its job well, that we have proper regulation of the market and that we get this right.  With regard to the Bill, the Supreme Court judgment stated that the Minister had misinterpreted the Act when designing the scheme and that was why it was <i>ultra vires</i> and void.  Rather than introducing this very cumbersome mechanism with a levy and so on it would have been better to simply change the original Act to accommodate a scheme that by and large people were happy with prior to the judgment of the Supreme Court.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">I know that this was meant to be temporary and that it was meant to be introduced a couple of months ago because we expected the EU Commission to make a decision in mid-February, which it still has not done.  Was it not possible to introduce what would be the eventual scheme rather than having this very cumbersome interim scheme?  People have many doubts about it.  To quote from the Bills digest document that we received from the Library:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_652">Although the Supreme Court struck down the Risk Equalisation Scheme of 2003, the Chief Justice stated in subsequent proceedings related to the judgment that this would not prohibit the Minister proceeding with risk equalisation in any statutory form she wished.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">It was not necessary to introduce the type of scheme we have before us today.</p>

          <p eId="para_663">Perhaps the Minister can clarify it at the end.  However, if she could give us a clear declaration, which has been called for by both of us who have spoken, that the levy will be used within the health insurance market, it would go some way towards providing assurances in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">I want to refer to the number of people who have private health insurance, which is 52% at present.  We are going through a process of economic change and with people finding it harder and harder to afford private health insurance it is inevitable that some will drop it because they will not have the money to pay for it.  I welcome the fact that with the new consultants' contract we have public-only consultants.  Last week, the Committee of Public Accounts heard that there is a difficulty with the estimated €50 million whereby these public consultants admit patients with private health insurance but there is no mechanism for charging that money to the private health insurers.  I would welcome the Minister's comments on that because it is an issue of concern to the public purse.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">The Minister also told us, in the context of the consultants' contract, that there will be a one-tier waiting list for certain procedures, including diagnostics and colonoscopies.  I welcome this very much because the Labour Party wants a one-tier system for everybody.  Will this mean that fewer people will feel the need to have private health insurance?  There is always the dilemma that if one makes the public system better — and we must make the public system better — people will wonder why they have private health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">We have a messy hybrid system with all sorts of perverse incentives; in primary care one is incentivised not to go to the doctor because one must pay if one does not have a medical card and in the hospital system the incentives are the opposite.  It is such a mixed system that it is a mess in comparison to most other countries which have straightforward systems, whether it be the NHS in Britain, the system in Holland that is the preferred option for Fine Gael, or systems of social health insurance in countries such as France or Canada.  I know there is a mix of public and private in all countries but we seem to have the most messy mix of any country.</p>

          <p eId="para_675">In any case, the point I am making is that at some stage we will have to say that the current system does not work.  I would like the Minister to comment on the consultants' contract and public-only consultants because they are measures she introduced.  I welcome many elements of what she is doing but would it make more sense to have a one-tier system where everybody is treated fairly whether that be through multiple insurers or a social insurance fund?</p>
          <p eId="para_676">Much of the division of the system was meant to be based on co-located hospitals and many elements of the consultants' contract were designed to facilitate the co-location system; private patients would be admitted to the private hospital and public patients would be admitted by public-only consultants to the public hospital.  The Labour Party abhors this because it is apartheid in health.  It appears that those co-located hospitals will not go ahead — and I hope they will not — and that we will have a system with different types of consultants operating in the same hospital with different rules for different types of patients.  The entire system is very confused.  Will the Minister comment on whether she thinks fewer people will take out private health insurance?  Will fewer people be able to afford it?</p>
          <p eId="para_677">Will the Minister explain further what she stated in her speech on reviewing the minimum level of benefits?  It is important that we know what exactly she means by that.  Will it have an implication on the cost of private health insurance?  I do not know whether the Minister will review it up, down or sideways.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">Deputy Reilly referred to the significant increases in costs that occurred around the time the legislation was published at the end of 2008, particularly for the VHI.  It has meant that many people cannot afford private health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The Minister also said she intends to ensure that the full cost of private patients in public beds is repaid and that the rules providing that in public hospitals 20% of beds are for private patients and 80% for public patients will be implemented through the clinical directors.  That is the right thing to do.  Private patients in beds they should not occupy should not be subsidised by the public system.  However, the fact that 55% of the population has private health insurance suggests that this will be difficult.  Many questions regarding the issue of health insurance that will arise in the next few years will affect the cost of insurance for members of the public and ultimately will change how the money available in the system is spent.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">Another issue is the mechanism and the concerns of smaller insurers.  One of the concerns is that the levy is unfair because it is applied across the board.  Colin Morgan of Quinn Healthcare stated in an article in the <i>Sunday Business Post</i>:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_681">Our main concern relates to the €160 levy per member.  This levy is due per member irrespective of the level of cover a member has (ie a 50 per cent levy on lower plans and only 8 per cent on high level plans).  This ultimately means that less well-off people on lower plans are subsidising those better off who can afford premium plans.  This is totally unfair.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">It appears to be unfair to impose this levy across the system, irrespective of the plan a person has.  I share Deputy Reilly's concerns about students.  The Minister said she will propose amendments to the legislation so perhaps she would indicate if she will address these issues in those amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">The Minister referred to other schemes and said it will not cover the smaller, controlled schemes for specific people.  She mentioned the schemes for the Garda, prison officers and ESB employees.  How does the Supreme Court decision affect those schemes or does it affect them?  Can community rating still be implemented through risk equalisation within those schemes?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that because we must ensure that those schemes are fair to their members.  In that context, when the Labour Party proposed its universal health insurance system it envisaged that it would encourage mutual or non-profit insurers to come into the market; for example, the trade union movement could provide an insurance scheme for its members.  It would be somewhat similar to the schemes available for certain workers.  Ideally, in providing for competition in the market, we would prefer that it would not simply allow private companies to cream off their portion of the money but that it would encourage,  in terms of the insurance market and the providers of health care, non-profit organisations for the mutual benefit of the people who subscribe to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">How would the Minister envisage that working in the context of this legislation and the legislation she is working on for the long term?  It is preferable to having a raft of private insurers all trying to make a profit  because, unless it is extremely well regulated, there is a danger that it will result in higher costs.  The American market is a fine example of that.  The health service in the United States is very costly and the private system is not appropriately regulated.  Practitioners end up ordering all kinds of unnecessary tests.  As it is such a free unregulated market it is very costly, not effective and not inclusive of many members of the American public.  Apparently it is about to be reformed by the current President.</p>

          <p eId="para_692">My overall concern with the legislation is that it is not well designed and is very cumbersome.  Using a levy system to implement community rating and risk equalisation is not ideal and even the Minister admits it is an interim measure to fill a gap following the decision of the Supreme Court.  Obviously, it will affect people who have health insurance and there is a concern that it will cause increases in premia, which will cause particular hardship for the unfortunate people who are being hit by practically everything at present, including the levies introduced in the budget.  People who are above the income guidelines to qualify for medical cards find it very difficult to pay for private health insurance but feel they must have it because of the difficulty in accessing the public system.  Patients are being told every day by general practitioners that if they pay for a treatment privately, they will get it in a week but otherwise they will have to wait for months on the waiting list.  Despite the National Treatment Purchase Fund's comments about waiting lists, much of the waiting time is about getting a referral from the general practitioner.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelKitt" eId="spk_439">
          <from>Deputy Michael P. Kitt</from>
          <p eId="para_698">I welcome the Minister's comments on this legislation.  The explanatory memorandum refers to the common good in regard to the health insurance market.  In particular, I am struck by the phrase "intergenerational solidarity between all insured persons" and the acknowledgment of the importance of community rated health insurance.  There has been widespread concern that older people might face a substantial hike in their health insurance costs upon renewal next year.  The Bill takes steps to deal with that issue.  As the Minister explained, it provides for a levy on every individual who pays health insurance as well as for a refund according to age.  The effect of these provisions is such that younger people will pay more in levy than they receive in refund while the opposite will be true for older people.  This represents a good attempt by the Minister to deal with this issue, notwithstanding her indication that she intends to introduce amendments on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">The Bill seeks to ensure a degree of subsidisation for older people who avail of health insurance in the wake of the Supreme Court decision last July whereby the risk equalisation scheme was ruled illegal.  That decision obliges us to ensure a means of providing subsidy for those who would find it difficult to pay high premia.  Health insurance plans can be tailored for older and younger people at totally different prices.  The analogy that was made in regard to motor insurance companies is a good one.  As we all know, young people pay far more than older, more experienced drivers for car insurance.  In the context of health insurance, the concern has been that the opposite would be the case, with older people facing far higher premia than younger people.  This legislation will allow health insurance companies to focus on the quality of cover they provide and the provision of additional services to consumers rather than the risk selection which would cause major difficulties for older customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">We are all concerned that there should not be an intolerable expense for people in ensuring they are covered for any operations they may require, such as hip replacements, cardiac procedures or cataract removal.  Such procedures are more likely to be required by older people.  The various insurance companies can now offer different types of plans.  For example, young people may be interested in benefits relating to sports injuries.  Unlike older people, they are generally not concerned with hip replacements and cardiac care.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">The Bill sets out the various levies and subsidies applicable to those under 50, over 50 and over 80 years of age.  These are interim measures, applicable for three years, to stabilise the market.  The community rating levies applicable to insurance companies have been set at €160 for each adult and €53 for each child insured.  The Bill provides an incentive for people to take out insurance earlier in life via the inclusion of lifetime community rating provisions.  For the longer term, the Government is working on a new risk equalisation scheme that will meet all the legal requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">In various professions and sectors, group schemes are offered to entice people to take out health insurance.  In my former life as a teacher, I was aware of the operation of such schemes through the teachers' unions, the INTO, TUI and ASTI.  There was encouragement for members to enter the private health insurance market via the special group rates available to those who applied through these types of group schemes. People have long been aware of the tax relief available to them, although not everyone has been able to avail of it.  In this debate on health insurance legislation it is good to note that many people took out health insurance at a relatively young age.  In that context, the proposal regarding lifetime community rating is welcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">On the topic of older people, I raise again the decision to move to Dublin the processing of medical card applications for those aged over 70 years.  Given the increase in the number of people employed to deal with rising unemployment and the consequent increase in the number of people seeking social welfare benefits, one would also expect the number of people working in the Department's medical card section, whether in Galway, Cork, Dublin or elsewhere, to increase.  I am disappointed, therefore, that staffing levels in the medical card section in Dublin have not increased.  I hope action will be taken to address the problems encountered by those seeking to contact a member of staff in the section by telephone.</p>
          <p eId="para_704">People want to discuss medical cards and medical cover with officials who work in their locality.  This is difficult when it is necessary to deal with an office in Dublin and the number of staff dealing with medical cards appears to have declined.  I am aware of a proposal, albeit one which may not materialise, to reduce the number of such staff from 300 to 100.  If that is the case, people will find it very difficult to determine the status of their application for a medical card.</p>
          <p eId="para_705">People are not clear about how the appeals system for medical cards works.  The mechanism for dealing with appeals was always clear in Galway.  I am able to follow a paper trail from the community welfare officer through to my local office in Galway city and, from there, through to the appeals office in Ballinasloe.  This is no longer true in the case of those aged over 70 years who apply for medical cards because the personal service available to people in the regions is to be withdrawn.  I make this point in passing because it is important to provide a good service and a proper office which people can contact.</p>

          <p eId="para_707">I am interested in what effect the measures in the Bill will have on health insurance prices, an issue raised by Deputy O'Sullivan.  I hope the Minister will address this issue in her reply.  Prices must be affordable, particularly for those aged 50 years or more.  A major issue has arisen regarding how the health insurance companies will price their insurance plans.  I have cited examples of niche markets these companies may create, whether by offering sports medicine or maternity services for younger people or cardiac care and hip operations for an older market.  A question also arises regarding additional tax relief for older customers, particularly in the case of people who do not pay tax.  I understand that in such circumstances the companies will benefit from the tax break rather than it being passed on to older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">People will shop around for health insurance.  The imposition of restrictions or waiting times on those who seek to switch policy should be addressed.  I hope individuals have an opportunity to switch policy.  In this respect, it is important that health insurance customers are informed that they wait for a set period before being able to move to a higher plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">My experience of dealing primarily with the VHI is that the company's services are good and it responds well to its customers.  Competition in the market means the various companies offer a good range of services.  Many of them have indicated that they are not being given an opportunity to market their different policies.  I hope the position in this regard will improve.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">During my investigation into this matter, I noted interesting variations in the cost of claims between age groups.  For example, claim costs for people aged more than 60 years are twice as high as those aged in their 30s, while claim costs for those aged 80 years or more are four times as high as the average for 40 year olds.  Without action by the Minister, costs could double and for this reason, I applaud the Minister's decision to introduce this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">I hope companies will inform us about their activities because consumers are keen to ascertain what changes in insurance policies will be introduced and when they will take effect.  I do not know how much notice is given concerning changes to terms and conditions but a number of days' notice should be given before the date for renewal.  This is an important issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Tax relief is granted to health insurance companies for all policies at the standard rate of 20%.  I hope the position will not change and people will continue to benefit from tax relief.  As matters stand, health insurance policy holders are not required to submit a receipt but must simply notify the Revenue Commissioners that they are a members of a particular insurance company.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">I welcome the Minister's contribution and this timely legislation.  The Minister indicated she will introduce further changes where necessary and noted the role of the European Commission in this matter.  I look forward to her contribution and the introduction of amendments on Committee Stage.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanNeville" eId="spk_442">
          <from>Deputy Dan Neville</from>
          <p eId="para_714">The Health Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will apply retrospectively from 1 January 2009, places a levy of €160 on all adults and €53 on all children.  To reflect these new levies all health insurers have increased their premiums over and above the annual rate of medical inflation, which has averaged 10% in recent years.  As a result, health insurance is becoming unaffordable with families being pushed out of the market.  Many policy holders can no longer afford the cost of their policy.  There will be a dropping-off of subscribers to the various health insurance providers because of loss of employment and other financial difficulties due to the reduction in income arising from the various levies.  The increases of 23% by VHI, 16% by Quinn Healthcare and 22% by Hibernian Aviva Health will further impact on the opportunity for people to continue with their health insurance and there will be a considerable drop-off in the number of people who can be covered by insurance.  That is a concern for people because of the lack of confidence in the public health service.  Many who had what they saw as the protection of private health insurance will now not have such available to them, and these increases are partly, though of course not solely, the cause of this.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">I understand the Government is still awaiting approval from the European Commission on the introduction of the levy.  I understand the permission has not yet been received, but perhaps the Minister will confirm when she expects such permission from the European Commission to come through.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">The insurance companies have been forced to raise their premiums.  Hibernian Aviva Health and Quinn Healthcare have stated they have increased their premiums purely to cover the costs of the levy as the cost and retrospective nature of the levy would automatically make competitors to VHI loss-making.  Although VHI is the net beneficiary of the levy, the company increased its prices by an average of 23% within two weeks of the levy being announced.  This is typical of the dominant player.  It is typical of the attitude of the VHI over the years to its dominance of the market.  VHI was able to do this because the company knew its competitors would have to increase their prices to cover the cost of the levy.  VHI's competitors argue that without the levy being announced VHI would not have increased its prices by 23%.  I refer to my figure for the annual usual increase of between 8% and 10%.  Competitors such as Hibernian Aviva Health argue that it is already seeing the effect of there being no competitive pressure to engage in price restrictions but there is no incentive for VHI to lower premiums or become more efficient, quite the opposite.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">The only beneficiary of this levy is VHI, the organisation.  This does not benefit any of the other stakeholders, including VHI members who incurred the significant price increases already stated immediately following the levy's introduction, yet VHI remains unregulated as an insurer and enjoys privilege as a result.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">Also, VHI is not subject to the Financial Regulator's guidelines on assessment management which might go some way towards explaining why its solvency ratio fell by 20% last year due to the investment losses.  VHI was ordered to seek authorisation by 31 December 2008 but this deadline was extended to 31 March 2009.  I understand VHI also missed this deadline and that the Minister has put out that date until 1 September.  This raises the question of the unfair competitive advantage of VHI, which has not been subject to the minimum solvency requirements or the same scrutiny as the other health insurers.  The Minister is one of those so keen on competition in all aspects of the economy.  This, surely, is an area in which we must ensure there is competition allowing the customers, those who are insured, to get the best value for money.  Competition will create that and the dominant player should have equal status with the other players.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">Due to the crude nature of the levy introduced, health insurers cannot trade into it.  If they agreed a contract and premium with a customer on 30 March 2008, they cannot adjust the price to cover the cost of the levy, which applies retrospectively to 1 January 2009, until the contract expires 12 months later.  It will be December 2009 before new renewal prices come into effect for some policies.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">The Minister claimed that VHI premiums were to increase by 60% for older persons.  This could not happen under community rating.  She claimed that the levy would not lead to an overall increase in the approximately €1.5 billion in private health insurance premiums.  The VHI premium, as I stated already, increased by 23% and will earn the company an additional €230 million.  Quinn Healthcare has passed on the levy, which has increased prices by 16% for that organisation.  The Minister claimed that certain insurers are guilty of tailoring their plans to suit younger people.  I put it to her that under each plan insurers must provide minimum benefits that include minimum cover, including cataracts or hip replacements.  If the Minister was genuinely concerned about the level of protection offered under minimum benefits, she would have revised these as opposed to introducing a levy which increases the cost of health insurance.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">VHI is charging this increase to persons on its core plans that generally include greater numbers of older people, not its company plans which generally include more younger people.  High prices are being applied to older persons which is in breach of the principle of community rating and is contrary to what the Minister is supposedly trying to do, namely, prevent high premiums for older persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">Community rating is already provided for in legislation, set out in section 5 of the Health Insurance (Amendment) Act 2001.  This means that one must charge the same rate for the same service regardless of age, sex, health status, sexual orientation, etc.  The Bill does not improve the definition of community rating, but only amends or redrafts it to reflect the tax credit and the Minister's insurance levy.  The legislative change is not necessary to strengthen the definition of community rating or to reinforce integration solidarity.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">It is not clear whether the health insurance levy is ring-fenced for health insurance or whether it will be used to make money for the Exchequer.  The Government needs to provide clarity on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">The reality is the Minister is propping up VHI's dominance and VHI's market share, which is still anti-competitive and anti-customer.  The levy will make private health insurance unaffordable, as I stated already, and will result in a contraction of the market by an estimated 10% or 200,000 persons.  Family premiums are due to rise on average by 20% on typical plans.  For cheaper family plans this will result in a relative premium increase of over 32%.  Families on the cheapest plans tend to be those that are most price sensitive in the market, in particular under current economic pressures.  It is projected that in excess of 200,000 persons at this lower end of the market will exit the market and will be left with no option but to revert to the public system.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">This levy has a disproportionate impact on families and students within the market.  A number of players in the market currently operate tiered discounting pricing for children and students, however the levy is calculated at a flat rate of €53 per child regardless of the cost of the premium.  Therefore, even though a child may be free, he or she will incur a tax of €53.  In addition, the levy does not differentiate between students and adults, although the former are on discount premiums, as set out in the Insurance Act.  Such students will incur an additional charge of €160.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">The levy will significantly increase the cost of employee benefits for companies.  A number of large multinationals provide private health insurance as part of their standard employee benefits package.  This levy will further increase the cost of trading at a time when companies are facing severe economic challenges.  To remain competitive on benefits and to attract a high calibre of staff, it is important that they be able to give a quality health insurance benefit.  Small and medium-sized enterprises that purchase health insurance for their employees will face significantly increased charges to provide that benefit to their workers.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">The levy amounts to an increase of €12,800 for a company with 100 employees and will clearly be considerably higher for larger companies.  For small to medium-sized enterprises of 50 employees, the impact will be €6,400.  If companies can no longer afford to offer health insurance to employees, it will further contribute to market shrinkage and increase the projected drop-off of 200,000 people at the lower end of the market.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">The levy is anti-competitive and means to prop up the State's dominant player.  The VHI remains super dominant in the health insurance market with in excess of 70% of market share.  In 2008, it declared profits of €112 million without ever having received any risk equalisation funds.  Why was it necessary to introduce the levy with such speed when there was no instability in the market?  Market segmentation and community rating prevent any company from charging higher premiums to older members.  If the former was viewed as a danger in the market, it could have been prevented by an amendment of the supervisory powers of the regulator and an increase in the levels of minimum benefit required under regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">The levy is not ring-fenced.  As such, the VHI can use the levy's proceeds for any purpose it may choose, for example, expanding its business.  The VHI remains unregulated, but requires funding to reach solvency as required under regulation and so that Ireland might avoid charges of infringement by the European Commission.  The VHI has stated that it is seeking to expand its commercial mandate into other business lines and jurisdictions.  It needs funding to accomplish this.  It will receive in excess of €30 million from the levy in the first year, which will only contribute to its profit margins.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">There are grave concerns about the levy's impact on consumers, businesses and the wider market.  According to research conducted by the regulator, price remains the primary reason for switching.  With the introduction of the levy, there will be a harmonisation of pricing, which will reduce customers' choices, a stagnation of market shares and a reduction in competition.  The levy will also create an even larger barrier to entry by new players.  Unlike the previous risk equalisation measure, there will be no exceptions to allow small, new players to establish themselves.  In other countries, dozens of players in the health insurance market create healthy competition.  This proposal will prevent companies from examining the Irish market with a view to creating further competition and, therefore, better value for those seeking health insurance.  With such barriers to entry and given the harmonisation of pricing, there will be less scope to compete in the market, resulting in the delivery of less choice innovation and poorer value to private health insurance customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The previous Fine Gael contributor, Deputy Reilly, mentioned our party's policy, which was complimented by Deputy Jan O'Sullivan.  I congratulate Deputy Reilly on his work in this area.  It is a comprehensive and detailed plan.  If and when we are in government, our policy will significantly change the delivery of health——</p>

          <from>Deputy Charles Flanagan</from>
          <p eId="para_764">I am pleased to introduce, on behalf of Fine Gael, the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (Protection of Debtors) Bill 2009 to the House today, which is designed to regulate debt collection businesses and imposes a burden on persons engaged in the collection of money and debt to register.  By so registering, this will introduce a system of vetting by the Garda Síochána before such persons can operate as debt collectors to ensure the business of collecting money is regulated in an acceptable way in a democratic country.  It is an important and necessary piece of legislation and a Bill which places the protection of the citizen on a priority footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">For some time I have endeavoured to convince the Government, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Brian Lenihan, Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Dermot Ahern and the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Mary Coughlan, that it was necessary to take appropriate action to regulate debt collection in order to protect vulnerable debtors.  People have visited my clinic, having been threatened by known criminals engaged in the debt collection business.  People have described how their property has been vandalised and they have been assaulted.  People are afraid and vulnerable.  They are fearful to make a complaint to the Gardaí Síochána.  They have been let down by the Government which has turned a blind eye to their plight.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">We have no system of regulation of debt collectors.  A comparative analysis with our UK counterparts shows we are somewhat alone in this regard.  In the UK debt collectors are licensed by the director general of fair trading under the Consumer Credit Act 1974.  In the US debt collection agencies are regulated by state and federal government, and the latter is catered for in the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act.  The absence of any regulation in this State means anyone can set up a debt collection agency and there are no rules as to how these people can operate.  Debts can also be sold, sometimes without the creditor's knowledge.  With more people owing more money, thanks to the economic collapse which has been presided over by the Government, debt collection will become a more profitable business for some.  We are seeing that in anecdotal evidence on a weekly basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">I do not have a problem with saying individuals and citizens should honour their debt obligations; of course they should.  However, debtors, citizens and members of the public should be protected by law from debt collection methods that overstep the bounds of acceptable pressure and duress, which is what we are currently seeing.  A reasonable person might expect a Government to do everything it should to make it difficult for criminals to go about their business, while at the same time doing all in its power to protect and uphold the common good.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">This Government seems to take the opposite approach.  It is as if its core constituency, whose rights it seeks to vindicate, are the minority criminal fraternity, rather than the law-abiding majority of the citizenry.  We have a situation where almost 90% of gangland gun murderers remain at large and where a handful of gangland criminals in prisons continue to run their empires from behind bars with an assortment of mobile phones and other advanced technological devices at their disposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">We have a situation where paramilitary criminals in Portlaoise dine on the finest of food while unemployed professionals queue for care packages on Church Street, not 200 m from the prison.  We have a situation where known drug dealers escape prosecution and have little trouble getting passports and haulage licenses, while legitimate entrepreneurs are choked by regulation and red tape.  We have a situation where criminal debt collectors are neither vetted nor monitored, but can set up a business with ease and threaten, intimidate, vandalise and assault debtors to extract money from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">We would like to see a rebalancing of the justice system in favour of the law-abiding citizen.  It is essential that there be a programme of vetting for those engaged in the debt collection business.  Debt collectors have a most responsible role.  They come to people who are at a low ebb and are very vulnerable.  Debtors are often easy to intimidate and exploit as they are under a lot of stress, not only themselves but their families.  I know this.  I have had these people come to my clinics and tell me first-hand about the terror they endured at the hands of criminal debt collectors and how they were afraid to go to report the matter to the authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">This problem has worsened significantly since the economic downturn.  Well known builders have been assaulted.  There were 276 people jailed last year for failing to repay loans to banks and other financial institutions, comprising 256 men and 20 women.  The average sentence was 27 days, but one person was forced to spend 90 days inside our prisons.  In comparison, 194 were jailed for failing to repay debts in 2006.  We can see a graph quite plainly, it is rising and very little is being done about it.  It is estimated loan defaulters account for 3% of all offenders imprisoned each year.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">In recent months, the debt collection sector has grown, with eastern European mafia getting involved in what is now considered a lucrative field for criminals, where felons and shadowy characters are able to take up to 25% of the money they squeeze out of people, which is known as commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">One particularly well known criminal drug trafficker — I am reluctant to name names when people are not here, but I refer to Martin Foley — glories in his criminal connections.  He has used his criminal moniker as part of his debt collection company's title.  He has his white van and travels up to people's doors, sometimes at night.  He parks the van in such a way that people see the livery on the side of the van, which reads Viper Debt Recovery and Repossession Service Limited, and in case anybody might not recognise him or know who he is, he asks, "Do you not know who I am?  There is my van.  Look at my name.  Now do you know who I am?"</p>
          <p eId="para_774">There have been widespread reports about the "Viper's" debt collection activities in the midlands and south east, yet the authorities are doing little to relieve the burden and stress on the individuals who have had occasion to meet this man in recent times.  I have drafted a Bill which is aimed at protecting debtors from people like the "Viper".  Before elaborating on the contents of that Bill, I ask that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law give his views on reports that one in three bouncers and private security personnel, all of whom are supposed to be vetted, have slipped under the radar.  That amounts to approximately 7,500 people licensed to work in these jobs who have not been vetted by the Garda in spite of legislation passed in this House in recent years.  In the case of foreign security checks being produced, what action is being taken to verify their authenticity?  There is little point in having a vetting procedure in place and then allowing it to become dysfunctional or not used.  Constant monitoring of the service is required to ensure it does what it was designed to do and to ensure that criminals are not working in the security industry in the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">As has occurred in the area of private security companies, regulation of the debt collection industry will reconcile any ambiguities within this developing industry and will ensure the transparent, fair and efficient operation of debt collection agencies.  The Private Security Authority has sought to licence an estimated 20,000 individuals from a previously unregulated environment and in so doing also requires that individuals undergo training and must submit their details for criminal record checking.  In 2007, it revoked four licences and suspended two persons.  It made 11 prosecutions against unlicensed contractors and in one case a company was fined €25,000.  Notwithstanding the loophole that has emerged in respect of foreign police vetting certificates, the PSA's work has been very important and should be built upon.  At the same time it should be reviewed given the type of loophole that is beginning to emerge where persons are working in the industry without being vetted.  There is a difficulty in regard to vetting that needs to be examined with a view to improving matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_776">Recently, a constituent sought a vetting clearance to apply for a job in the security industry in the United Kingdom.  He was required under law to produce an appropriate vetting certificate but he could not get one.  He had to proceed by way of affidavit that he had never been involved in any criminal activity, which is a form of self-regulation that has its problems and should not be encouraged.  In this case the individual had no choice but to produce an affidavit or he would not have even got an interview.  That issue needs to be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_777">The allocation to the PSA from the justice Vote in 2007 was €2.7 million.  The PSA generated €2.3 million in licence fees, and the amount was credited as appropriations-in-aid to the justice Vote.  That is a system that is clearly capable of paying for itself, which is another incentive to broaden the remit of the PSA to ensure we do not have the type of loopholes that are emerging.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">I wish to outline the provisions of this Bill.  The purpose of the Bill is to regulate debt collectors so they must register with the Financial Regulator and be vetted by the Garda Síochána before they can operate in Ireland as a licensee retrieving both consumer and commercial debt.  Ireland has no system of regulation for debt collectors, unlike many European Union countries.  As a result, anyone can set up a debt collection agency and there are no rules as to how they should operate.  Debts can be sold on without a creditor's knowledge.  With more people owing money, debt collection will become a more profitable business.  Members of the public should be protected by law from debt collection methods that overstep the bounds of acceptable pressure.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">The Bill will establish a regulatory framework in which a debt collection regulator under the remit of the Financial Regulator will reconcile any ambiguities within this developing industry and will ensure the transparent and efficient operation of debt collection agencies.  The main function of the debt collection regulator is to issue licences to suitable applicants once they have supplied all relevant documentation, including a certificate of clearance from the Garda Síochána and a tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.  A licence will issue on a two yearly basis.  It is the right of the regulator to refuse, revoke or suspend a licence at any time if deemed fit and for good reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">The Bill also obliges licensees by law to notify a debtor and the regulator in writing if a debt is to be sold, transferred or assigned for value.  Debt collection can, unfortunately, involve the exertion of pressure on the debtor.  There have been media reports on collection tactics employed by some debt collectors to retrieve funds due and owing.  There is also evidence that persons with criminal backgrounds are operating in this industry.  Debtors feel intimidated, harassed and threatened.  The Bill provides for complaints by debtors, made in good faith, to be investigated by the regulator against a licensee.  If the complaint is upheld the licensee may have his or her licence suspended or revoked.  A licensee must notify the regulator if he or she is convicted of an offence or if there are proceedings for an offence pending if charges have been brought.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">Only persons of good and sound character and repute may engage in the debt collection business.  I have met persons in the industry who have been engaged in this work for many years.  They have nothing to fear.  They are supportive of the legislation because they feel the type of regulation envisaged is in line with best international practice.  They feel the business in which they have been engaged for many years has become sullied and tarnished by the activities of a few in recent times.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">Section 1 provides that the Act shall be known as the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (Protection of Debtors) Act 2009.  Section 2 is the interpretation section.  Section 3 provides for the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas for any regulations made by the Minister under the Bill.  Section 4 is a technical amendment which provides that the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority — now the Financial Regulator — shall encompass the office created by the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_783">Section 5 amends the Central Bank Act to provide for the establishment of the regulator of debt collectors under the auspices of the Financial Regulator.  This section employs a similar structure to the Registrar of Credit Unions under the same office and provides that the regulator has the power to issue licences to persons, partnerships or companies that are planning to operate as debt collectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">Section 6 provides for the system of application to the regulator for a licence to operate as a debt collector.  This section provides that the regulator may request certain background information, including Garda Síochána vetting, to establish that the applicant is a fit and proper person to operate as a debt collector.  If the person is not deemed fit a licence will not be granted.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">Section 7 provides for the grant, refusal or revocation of a licence to an applicant by the regulator.  A licence shall remain in force for a period of two years before it needs to be renewed.  The regulator may refuse to grant a licence in circumstances where he or she believes that to grant the licence, or allow an existing licence to continue to be in force, would be contrary to the safety and welfare of a person.  Section 8 provides for the renewal of licences.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">Section 9 provides that an applicant for a licence under this Bill must produce a current tax clearance certificate before a licence can be issued and the tax clearance certificate must remain valid, or be replaced by a new certificate, for the term of the licence.  Section 10 provides that certain documents must accompany the application for a licence.  Section 11 provides that an applicant for a licence, or a holder of a licence, must notify the regulator of any prior conviction or any conviction they accrue while in possession of the licence.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">Section 12 provides that the regulator may seek information from the Garda Síochána in respect of any applicant or holder of a licence.  Section 13 provides for the revocation or temporary suspension of a licence in circumstances where the licensee is found to have supplied misleading information to the regulator or is, in the opinion of the regulator, no longer a fit person to hold a licence.  Section 14 provides that the regulator must notify the applicant or holder of a licence of any refusal, suspension or revocation of a licence and prescribes the form for such notification.  Section 15 provides for appeals of a decision of the Regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">Section 16 prohibits the sale, transfer or assignment of a debt without the prior written consent of the debtor.  This is designed to enhance transparency and to ensure debtors have full knowledge of who owns their debt, and to whom they are ultimately indebted.  A debtor may not unreasonably withhold his or her consent.  This is very important in the context of the "Viper" Foley and his cohorts, and of people who can buy debt in pubs for a slice of the debt that is ultimately collected.  People can have no idea of the person or group with whom they are engaged in the transaction, and privity of contract appears to have no place in such an arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_789">Section 17 provides that the regulator must be notified where a debt is sold, transferred or assigned.  Failure to do so is an offence under section 19.  Section 18 provides that a person may make a complaint to the regulator about the conduct of a debt collector.  This provides an additional layer of protection for a debtor who may not wish to go to the Garda Síochána or who feels otherwise intimidated.  The regulator can then conduct an investigation into the complaint, including power of entry and inspection of the debt collector's premises, and can impose certain sanctions on the debt collector.</p>
          <p eId="para_790">Section 19 deals with offences committed under the Act.  There is a scale with three levels of offences that can be committed under the Bill.  The first level is administrative offences, and the Bill makes it an offence to operate as a debt collector without a licence, or to fail to provide the regulator with the requisite documents or notifications under the Act.  The second level of offences deals with misrepresentations made by a debt collector to a debtor.  This is very important because many debtors may have limited information about court processes and legal systems and this should not be exploited by debt collectors.  As such, it is an offence to suggest that a document is a legal document or has some official capacity which it does not have, in order to coerce the debtor to discharge the debt more quickly.  I have recently seen some good impressions of documents purporting to be from the court, some of which even bear a harp and the stamp of the High Court, but which are issued from premises that have absolutely no relationship with the courts or any agency of the State.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">I ask the Minister of State to allow the Bill proceed to Committee Stage.  I am not holding my breath, because the record of the Government is not very good in this respect, but if the Government feels there are defects that might be important or there are improvements that can be made, we can thrash them out on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">The absence of a vetting system for debt collectors is a weakness in our justice system.  It is a gap that is overlooked by the Government, and turning a blind eye plays straight into the hands of those shady debt collectors who are criminals.  Inaction on this lets down the people that the Government should be anxious to help, such as the vulnerable who have fallen into debt through the collapse of their businesses or unemployment and who are being buffeted violently by the stormy winds of the recession.  The Bill is straightforward and proposes a system that would fit in easily to existing mechanisms and is likely to generate enough income to be self-financing.  Most importantly, our proposed vetting system will help keep communities safer.  I hope all parties in this House, particularly the Government parties, will see the merit of these proposals.  I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TomSheahan" eId="spk_473">
          <from>Deputy Tom Sheahan</from>
          <p eId="para_793">I ask the Minister of State to support this Bill and let it go forward, because if the Government does not do so, it would equate to the recent scenario where a drug trafficker was awarded a haulage licence.  Some of the people who have got involved in debt collection have awarded themselves fancy names, such as "debt collection services".  The idea that they consider themselves service providers is quite scary.  Some businesses are using this to get back the money they are owed.  This creates a full circle of pressure, whereby the businessman owed the money is under pressure and feels he must exert pressure above and beyond what is needed.  This is why he might use people like the "Viper".  There are many other individuals who may not be as forward as the "Viper", but who might still use tougher measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">These debt collectors are taking anything between 15% and 20%.  I have had people in my constituency office owing relatively small sums of maybe €1,000 or €2,000, yet the pressure put on them affects their entire family.  They are just not in a position to pay.  They would do so if they could enter negotiations and pay the debt over an agreed length of time, but things seem to be getting more underhand and more violent.  I had a lady in my office recently who borrowed €1,000 for a first holy communion celebration.  After a few weeks, a total of €1,500 was due and the debt collectors were calling to her house.  First, they kicked in the door and left.  They came back a week later, following a few threatening phone calls, and they broke the windows in the house.  This woman is a lone parent and she is in a frantic state.  She is afraid in her own home.  That criminals are describing themselves as "service providers" in order to collect debt is what kills me.</p>
          <p eId="para_795">The chairman of the Irish Human Rights Commission, Mr. Maurice Manning, recently warned that imprisonment over debt is likely to increase.  We all understand and accept that, because people are under financial pressure and money is owed.  The UN called on the Government last year to ensure its laws are not used to imprison a person for the inability to fulfil a contractual obligation.  That is quite ironic, because no member of the Cabinet is currently fulfilling his or her contractual obligations, as the Government has cut back 17% on some agricultural schemes and 8% on other schemes.  I am sure the Government will ensure the law is not used to imprison people owing to their inability to fulfil a contractual obligation.</p>
          <p eId="para_796">Debt collection is a seedy business.  I support what my colleague, Deputy Charles Flanagan, is trying to do.  Such businesses should come under the auspices of the Financial Regulator and, more important, should be regulated by the Garda Síochána.  That is a must and I ask the Minister of State to consider that proposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">The Bill also deals with the issue of complaints made in good faith.  I referred earlier to the woman who visited my constituency office this week and who told me her door had been kicked in and that, following several threatening telephone calls, her windows had been broken.  Debt is a serious issue for many people in Ireland.  While I am not aware of the up-to-date figure, the Central Bank in 2007 noted that of all countries in the euro region Ireland had the second largest ratio of personal sector debt to gross domestic product and the largest ratio of personal sector credit to gross national product, which is shocking.  The biggest issue facing the State and the people of this country during this time of recession is personal debt.  It is not necessary for me to speak of the situation in which young couples with mortgages of €300,000 find themselves as that is evident to everyone.  That percentage of personal debt is causing great hurt.  People are finding it difficult to deal with their debt.  The repercussions of the level of debt held by families and households will result in social, personal and health problems in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">I believe everyone should honour their debts.  In 2008, 276 people were imprisoned for failure to repay debt.  On average, they received sentences of 27 days of which they served an average of 20 days.  Also, on release from prison, the debt remained to be paid.  Imprisonment does not make economic sense.  Not alone does the debt remain to be paid when the debtor is released from prison but the cost to the State far outweighs the benefits that result.  At a cost of almost €2,000 a week, it is more expensive to imprison a person than to put him or her up in a swanky hotel in Dublin for a week.  What benefit is this to our already struggling Exchequer?</p>
          <p eId="para_799">There is chronic overcrowding in many of our prisons.  In April 2009, just short of 4,000 prisoners were in custody.  The bed capacity of our prisons is 3,600.  This represents an occupancy level of 106%.  Overcrowding in prisons creates tension and makes prisoner violence more likely.  Also, it severely hinders the capacity of the prison system to rehabilitate serious offenders.  Some 12 of our 15 State prisons are packed beyond capacity.  This is not, as some might believe, a matter of prisoner comfort levels but of ensuring we have safe and functioning prisons.  The role of prison is partly to rehabilitate inmates.  Currently, this is not happening as almost half the number of offenders are returned to prison within four years of release.  Is prison, at a cost to the Exchequer of €2,000 per prisoner per week, the correct place to send people who owe money bearing in mind the debt remains to be paid by the offender on release from prison?  This does not lie well me.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">Often, there are threats of physical violence and damage to personal property.  I am aware of a couple of incidents which were reported to me in my constituency office.  This type of activity is happening not alone in Dublin or in the cities, it is happening in my constituency.  "Enforcers", which is what I would call these debt collectors, are being sent to houses to extract money owed.  As the economy worsens and businesses encounter financial difficulties, there are disturbing reports of threats, intimidation, destruction of property and physical assaults not alone on people owing substantial debts but on people who owe as little as €1,000 or €2,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">Late last year, shots were fired over the house of a developer in County Offaly who owed money to a business associate.  Also, a Galway builder had a brick put through the windscreen of his car when he refused to co-operate with a debt collector.  Many of these debts relate to the construction industry and to young people with mortgages of up to €300,000 who are unable to pay any of their other bills.  I ask the Minister of State to take on board what is happening, not alone in our cities and urban areas but in areas like mine.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">I will outline to the House another sad incident reported to me in my constituency office.  A person in business for more than 30 years and who has an excellent track record recently fell on tough times.  As turnover and cash flow were causing him major problems, he was finding it difficult to pay his suppliers.  His primary concern was to pay his staff — the number of which had been greatly reduced — on Fridays and to then give a portion of the profits, of what continues to be a profitable business, to his creditors.  While he was having difficulty trying to carve up his reducing profits, he was keeping his debts at bay and the business remained profitable.  Eventually, one of his suppliers became heavy handed.  Not alone did the supplier send people to his home after several threatening telephone calls but — I could hardly believe this — when his wife was in town with their children the debt collectors approached her and took from her what money she had in her purse under the guise of debt collection services.  For these people to say they are providing a service strikes a chord with me.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">I applaud Deputy Flanagan for bringing forth this Bill.  I have outlined for the Minister of State some of the stories told to me in my constituency office not from people who owe hundreds of thousands or millions of euro but from people who owe as little as €1,000 or €2,000.  I hope the Minister of State will support this Bill and let it go forward.  It is needed to protect people who, through no fault of their own, find themselves with cash flow problems.  Many of these people believe these heavy handed criminals and debt collectors are on par with our banks.</p>

          <from>Deputy Barry Andrews</from>
          <p eId="para_806">I would like to respond on behalf of the Government to Deputy Charles Flanagan's proposed Private Members' Bill.  I commend the Deputy on the efforts involved in bringing forward this proposal.  The motivation behind the Deputy's proposal is understandable.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">Many people have been significantly affected by the difficult economic situation this country is now experiencing.  This has manifested itself in difficulties in making repayments for goods and services, for mortgages or in fulfilling contractual obligations.  This adverse situation has, for many, occurred very quickly.  It could not have been reasonably anticipated when people undertook financial commitments.  Clearly, I would join colleagues on both sides of the House in expressing our concern for persons who now find they are experiencing debt-related issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">We are all very aware of the pressures of modern society and of the fallout from the difficult economic circumstances in which many people now find themselves.  This has been exacerbated by what was, by reference to Irish historical circumstances, an extraordinary availability of consumer credit in recent years.  Unfortunately, many are now experiencing the down side of over-extending their borrowing arrangements or there has been a change in personal circumstances, such as loss of employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">The proposal put forward this evening by Deputy Flanagan is an interesting one and is a topic worthy of debate.  He has proposed a Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (Protection of Debtors) Bill 2009.  The stated purpose of the Bill is to provide for the issuing of licenses to conduct debt collection activities.  Such persons, companies or organisations seeking to recover a civil or commercial debt would be required to register with the Financial Regulator and be vetted by the Garda Síochána before they can operate in Ireland as a licensee retrieving debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">The Bill proposes that the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority, which is a constituent part of the Central Bank, would regulate debt collection as a financial service.  It would establish a regulatory framework in which a debt collection regulator, under the remit of the Financial Regulator, would deal with this service and seek to ensure the transparent and efficient operation of debt collection agencies.  It is proposed that a debt collection regulator would issue licences to suitable applicants once they have supplied all the relevant documents including certificate of clearance from the Garda Síochána and a tax clearance certificate from the Revenue Commissioners.  A licence would issue on a two-yearly basis.  The Bill provides that the regulator may refuse, revoke or suspend a licence at any time.  The regulator would be obliged to investigate complaints made by a debtor against a licensee.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">However, interestingly, among the criteria for the award of a licence, there is no specific mention of previous convictions of the applicant.  The Bill includes a section on offences, some of them regulatory type offences, but would also provide for false representation and harassment.  Unfortunately, the Bill as drafted would do little to address the issue it claims it would address.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">All functions relating to consumer credit have been the responsibility of the Financial Regulator since 2003.  There are two minor exceptions to this, pawnbrokers and credit intermediaries which are the responsibility of the National Consumer Agency.  Consumer credit covers the content of consumer credit contracts, the calculation of the APR and information and advertising in connection with consumer credit.  The main primary legislation on this matter is the Consumer Credit Act 1995, as amended.  In the first instance, my colleague, the Minister for Finance is opposed to providing for a statutory regulator of debt collectors, either on a stand-alone basis or within the Financial Regulator structure.  He is of the view that the collection of debts as an activity is not necessarily comprehended in respect of the provision of financial services.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">The role of the Financial Regulator is confined to financial services.  The functions of the regulator are to help consumers make informed and responsible decisions on their financial affairs in a safe and fair market and to foster sound and solvent financial institutions which give depositors and other consumers of financial products confidence that their deposits and investments are safe.  Accordingly, it is not the role of the regulator to regulate the collection of debts arising from commercial or other activities.  Assigning a debt regulation function to the Financial Regulator would dilute the core function of the regulator and would have an impact on its resources and expertise.  Debt collection is an activity which takes place throughout the country and the enforcement of licensing requirements would need to be carried out at a local level and would result in the regulator having to take on an enhanced role throughout the country and require it to obtain additional expertise in enforcement methods.  Deputy Flanagan's proposal would thus require very significant financial and staffing resources for the Financial Regulator and for the Garda Síochána in terms of potential vetting of applicants.  In the context of scarce resources available to the Government at this time, this would not represent the best use of such resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">There is a particularly serious flaw in the approach set out in Deputy Flanagan's proposal.  Critically, I can find nowhere in his text an explicit provision that a person or company operating on their own account to collect debts owing to them would be exempt from his proposal.  If the Bill were to be enacted, as it is currently drafted, it would require every person and company engaged in a business activity, be it the sale of goods or services, to have to seek licensing as a debt collector, before they could seek to recover moneys owing to them in the normal course of business.  This would apply, for example, to the ESB, the local corner shop, the plumber, etc.  Is this seriously what the Deputy has in mind, because that would appear to be the main consequence of his proposal?  If so, it would appear to be a somewhat bizarre, cumbersome and very bureaucratic approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">Related to my previous point, the Deputy does not define a "debt collector" in his Bill.  This is a serious deficiency because we cannot be sure of the scope that is intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">Much of the public concern with respect to the operation of debt collectors relates to mortgage debt.  There are arrangements in place to deal with this issue.  For example, the recapitalisation programme announced in February 2009 includes a new code of conduct for mortgage arrears, which has been issued by the Financial Regulator and came into force on the 27 February 2009.  The new code applies to the recovery of debt with respect to the mortgage lending activities to consumers in respect of their principal private residence in the State.  It is mandatory for all mortgage lenders registered with the Financial Regulator including so-called "sub-prime lenders".  Under the code, where a borrower is in difficulty the lender shall make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule; consideration should be given on a case-by-case basis to alternatives such as deferral of payments, extending the term of the mortgage, changing type of mortgage, or capitalising arrears and interest; and lenders will not commence legal action for repossession until after six months from the time arrears first arise.  In addition, as part of their recapitalisation scheme, AIB and Bank of Ireland have agreed not commence court proceedings for repossession of a principal private residence until after 12 months of arrears appearing where the customer continues to co-operate.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">It also might be appropriate here to say a few words about court proceedings in cases of mortgage arrears where orders for possession or sale of the mortgaged property are being sought by lending institutions.  It has become apparent in recent times that some lending institutions are routinely applying in the High Court for repossession orders which could have been obtained in the Circuit Court.  During Committee Stage discussions on the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2006 recently, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform expressed concern that the additional costs and inconvenience of entering a defence in High Court proceedings may have the effect of discouraging borrowers who are in arrears with repayment from defending proceedings.  Existing statutory provisions relating to court jurisdiction have been designed to encourage applicants for court orders to apply at the Circuit Court level where appropriate.  This is reflected in section 17 of the Courts Act 1981 which provides for the awarding of Circuit Court costs in cases which could have been taken in that court but were taken instead, for whatever reason, in the High Court.  From what I have already said, this would appear not to be a sufficient deterrent to commencing repossession proceedings in the High Court and I understand the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform intends to deal with the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">Part 10 of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Bill 2006 updates the law relating to mortgages, including the obligations, powers and rights of lending institutions.  The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform intends to table a Report Stage amendment to that Bill which will, when enacted, require that all repossession or sale proceedings on housing loan mortgages be taken in the Circuit Court.  His objective in bringing forward this change is to reduce the costs and inconvenience involved in making a court appearance and, thereby, encourage borrowers who are in arrears to enter a defence in such proceedings.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">Section 16 of Deputy Flanagan's Bill refers to an assignment of a debt.  A debt cannot be assigned without the prior written consent of the debtor, which consent cannot be unreasonably withheld.  It is doubtful as to what real benefit this provides, as anyone receiving the debt would have to hold a licence under the earlier provisions of this Bill.  Section 17 goes on to state that licensees must notify the sale, purchase or assignment of a debt to the regulator of debt collectors.  Again, if all of the undertakings are licensed under the Bill and presumably conduct themselves with the same standard of behaviour, this provision would appear to be superfluous.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">Debt collection and recovery services are a legitimate part of the normal activities of practically any business in dealing with its clients and customers.  It is, of course, of particular relevance to the consumer credit industry.  Many businesses use the services of debt collection agencies to collect money owed from a credit arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">I am aware that Deputy Flanagan has previously expressed concerns that unscrupulous or criminal elements have or will become involved in debt collection activities.  These concerns underline the very laudable intentions motivating the Deputy's proposal.  We would all share those concerns.  These concerns have been highlighted in recent media reports of alleged intimidation of persons owing money in various circumstances by "criminal" debt collectors.  The reports claimed that people have been threatened, intimidated and physically assaulted and that property has been damaged by debt collectors.  The name of one notorious person, with gangland connections, has been much mentioned.  However, we should be careful about relying on what is to some degree anecdotal or hearsay evidence in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">The alleged intimidation and threatening behaviour of debt collectors, or by any other person, appears to come within the scope of the provisions of the Non-Fatal Offences against the Person Act 1997.  I am surprised that the Deputy seeks to create a new offence in section 19 of the Bill of harassment specifically in regard to debt collection because he will no doubt be aware that the 1997 Act already deals with assault, intimidation and demanding money with menaces.  Section 11 of that Act provides that it is an offence to demand payment of debts with any criminal aspect, including intimidation or false statements.  As the Bill before us makes no reference to this provision, it would create confusion between that criminal law provision and the proposal to regulate debt collection.  I emphasise, as I am sure would the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, that any person who feels that he or she has been threatened or harassed in the context of the recovery of a debt allegedly owed to contact the Garda.  It is not lawful for a creditor to seek to recover moneys owed in such a fashion.  There are well defined procedures, both judicial and non-judicial, for the recovery of debt.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">It might be fanciful to suggest, as Deputy Flanagan seems to do, that persons who employ threatening or abusive techniques or act in an illegal manner would seek to be licensed as debt collectors.  I suspect those of a criminal inclination or background would conclude rationally that they would have little or no chance of being licensed.  The intended targets of this proposal would thus likely escape its remit.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">The Government is supportive of efforts to find alternative non-judicial approaches to the resolution of debt problems.  Civil debt issues are based on individual circumstances and in most genuine cases would probably lend themselves to some form of mediation or conciliation process.  The Government is supportive of alternative non-judicial approaches to the resolution of debt problems.  We support and encourage the work of the money advice and budgeting service, MABS, of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  That service's approach, which is based primarily on the willingness of the debtor to attempt to manage his or her situation, offers significant prospects of a successful resolution of the credit problem.  The attitude of credit institutions and utility companies has been co-operative in working with MABS on behalf of its clients.  MABS provides a crucial service for people who require help and advice in making their way out of serious debt.  The Government continues to make significant financial resources available to the service.  The approach it adopts offers a better way of achieving a result acceptable to both creditor and debtor.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">I understand that District Court judges recognise the work of MABS and in some instances they recommend that people who are before the courts avail of it.  However, it is often difficult to persuade persons in debt to engage in the process.  Sadly, some people leave their debts until they reach the point, having been the subject of a court process, where imprisonment looms.  The willingness of a debtor to manage his or her case is crucial and seeking expert advice is the best way of achieving a successful resolution to the problem of indebtedness.  This voluntary approach is preferable to seeking to impose on the State the role of managing a debt collection and recovery process, especially one as cumbersome as that envisaged in the Fine Gael Private Members' Bill.  Issues relating to debt come before the courts in many guises, for example, family law maintenance agreements, hire purchase agreements, creditor loans and failures to pay loan repayments to financial institutions, including credit unions.  Generally, the courts take the view that where possible disputes are best resolved through mediation between the parties involved, avoiding court intervention unless absolutely necessary.  However, we must recognise that circumstances arise, undesirable as they may be, where it is necessary for people to rely on the courts to enforce the terms of a contract.  I do not concur with the view that we should legislate to make accessing these rights more difficult because Ireland would be put in a most unfavourable light internationally if our law prevented people from exercising their contractual rights.  Deputies will agree these matters must be kept within the rule of law and as far away as possible from criminal elements.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">Current legislation in regard to enforcement of court orders is long-standing and upholds contractual rights with specific safeguards.  Despite what certain media and other commentators might claim, a person cannot be imprisoned merely on the grounds of inability to fulfil a contractual obligation.  Committal orders are granted where a person fails to comply with a court order.  The law provides that the judge shall only make a committal order where the debtor shows that the failure to pay was due to his or her wilful refusal or culpable neglect.  This provision is intended to ensure that if a debtor is genuinely unable to meet the repayments under an instalment order, steps can be taken to ensure that he or she is not deprived of his or her liberty.  Court instalment orders involve a statutory procedure to require the examination of a debtor's means by a court which will then consider fixing a periodic instalment to be paid to discharge the debt, taking into account the income and outgoings of the person concerned.  If the person against whom the order is made fails to meet periodic payments, an application may be made for arrest and committal to prison, but this requires a further hearing by the judge under section 18 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1926, as amended by section 6 of the Enforcement of Court Orders Act 1940.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">The Law Reform Commission in its report on contempt in 1994 considered that the case for abolition of the sanction of imprisonment had not been established in regard to civil contempt.  The commission felt that the powers of the court in this regard were coercive rather than punitive.  It is an appropriate remedy only where the desired result cannot be achieved by other means and the defendant's active co-operation is a vital ingredient.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">The relevant legislation on court enforcement procedures and personal bankruptcy will be kept under review, although there are no proposals in the current Government legislative programme.  We are awaiting the publication by the Law Reform Commission later this year of a consultative report on debt enforcement and securing interests over personal property.  This project will include an examination of alternatives to court based procedures to debt enforcement as well as existing court based arrangements, such as the instalment order procedure.  It will also examine the attachment of security interests to personal property.  As the commission will be consulting with interested parties, it would be unwise to act precipitously in regard to any legislative initiative in advance of the publication of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_829">Only 20% of debtors appear at court hearings.  This is unfortunate because they lose a critical opportunity to take part in a significant process.  I am not convinced by the argument that if the process in the courts is changed to an alternative form, 100% compliance will somehow ensue.  Without the eventual prospect of a court sanction, debtors may believe it is easier to disengage with an alternative process than to comply.  There is a responsibility on each person with debt issues to inform him or herself about the legal processes involved.  The Courts Service website contains excellent material in this regard.  I appreciate, however, that the procedures and documents involved can be legalistic and be difficult to understand.</p>
          <p eId="para_830">At this time of pressure on all businesses, we need to be cautious in constructing a vast regulatory edifice which would not achieve its real target while increasing the cost of doing business for legitimate enterprises.  This could have a knock-on detrimental effect on employment and business activity.  I commend Deputy Flanagan on the humane considerations which underline his proposal.  These considerations are shared by all Members of this House.  However, the Government has a duty to ensure that legislative proposals are well founded and drafted.  Unfortunately, the proposal from the Deputy does not fulfil those criteria.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Deputy Martin Mansergh)</from>
          <p eId="para_831">Fine Gael's Private Members' Bill proposes that a debt collector regulator be appointed under the remit of the Financial Regulator.  The various initiatives taken by the Government in respect of people who have fallen into arrears with their mortgage repayments are relevant to the discussion.  The Government supports efforts to find alternative non-judicial approaches to the resolution of debt problems, in particular, the work of the money advice and budgeting service of the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs.  MABS's approach, which is based primarily on the willingness of a debtor to attempt to manage his or her situation, offers significant prospects for a successful resolution of the credit problem.  The banks and their umbrella body, the IBF, are also aware of the problems relating to debt and have co-operated with various initiatives to cope with the unfortunate increases in debt problems in these difficult times.</p>
          <p eId="para_832">As regards the proposal that a debt collector regulator be appointed under the remit of the Financial Regulator, even if it were decided that a formal regulator of debt collectors was to be set up, putting him or her in the Financial Regulator structure would not be the best option.  The collection of debts involves more than collecting debts in respect of the provision of financial services, whereas the role of the Financial Regulator is confined to such services.  The functions of the regulator include helping consumers to make informed and responsible decisions on their financial affairs in a safe and fair market and fostering sound and solvent financial institutions which give depositors and other consumers of financial products confidence that their deposits and investments are safe.  It is not the role of the Financial Regulator to regulate the collection of debts arising from commercial or other activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">Giving the debt regulation function to the Financial Regulator would dilute its core function and would have an impact on its resources and expertise.  Debt collection is an activity that takes place throughout the country.  The enforcement of licensing requirements would need to be carried out at a local level and this would also result in the Financial Regulator having to take on an enhanced role throughout the country.  The financial services industry is rather more centralised than the debt collection process and it would be required to obtain additional expertise in enforcement methods.  In addition, consideration would need to be given to the funding of a new debt collector regulator, as the Financial Regulator is funded by levies imposed on those whom it regulates and not by the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">I respect the initiatives the Government has taken in respect of people who have fallen into arrears with their mortgage repayments.  The House well understands this is a major area of indebtedness and I would like to outline the arrangements in place to deal with this issue.  With regard of support for payment of mortgages, the mortgage interest supplement administered by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive on behalf of the Department of Social and Family Affairs provides assistance where the mortgage relates to a person's sole place of residence.  People in debt or in danger of falling into debt can also avail of the services of the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS.  This is a national, free, confidential and independent service.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">The recapitalisation programme announced in February 2009 includes a new code of conduct for mortgage arrears, which was issued by the Financial Regulator and came into force on 27 February 2009.  The new code applies to the recovery of debt in relation to mortgage lending activities to consumers, in respect of their principal private residence in the State.  It is mandatory for all mortgage lenders registered with the Financial Regulator, including so-called sub-prime lenders.  Under the code, where a borrower is in difficulty, the lender shall make every reasonable effort to agree an alternative repayment schedule; consideration should be given on a case-by-case basis to alternatives such as deferral of payments, extending the term of the mortgage, changing type of mortgage or capitalising arrears and interest; and lenders will not commence legal action for repossession until after six months from the time arrears first arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">In addition, as part of their recapitalisation scheme, AIB and Bank of Ireland have agreed not to commence court proceedings for repossession of a principal private residence until after 12 months of arrears appearing, where the customer continues to co-operate.  While the efforts of Fine Gael to address the problem are well intentioned and praiseworthy, the proposed Bill is not the best way forward.</p>

The fact he has come racing in to underpin the code worked out with the banks by his colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, means there must be a great dearth of willingness on the Government benches to condemn Deputy Charles Flanagan's Bill.  Having begun softly by sympathising with Deputy Flanagan highlighting the plight of vulnerable debtors who, in some cases, are being subjected to heavy handed pressure, harassment and even intimidation, the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, went on to deny the problem exists.  He went further by saying that if the problem exists, the place to deal with it is not in the financial regulatory structure and concluded that it would not be a good idea to construct "a vast regulatory edifice".  I did not hear anybody proposing to build such an edifice but I do not say I fail to appreciate the Government coming around to the recognition in its 12th and dying year that constructing vast edifices is not always necessarily a good thing but mar a deir an seanfhocal, "Is fearr déanach ná ró-dhéanach", and I welcome that latter day conversion.</p>
          <p eId="para_839">Deputy Flanagan has raised a real issue.  Sadly, this is a growth industry in the times in which we live.  People find themselves indebted for whatever reason and, in some cases, they are extremely vulnerable, stressed and unable to discharge debts not because of recklessness on their part but because of the economic circumstances in which they find themselves.  Only a small number of debtors plunge themselves knowingly and recklessly into these circumstances.  In so far as recklessness is involved, it is not merely involved on the side of the consumer, it is frequently shared by the lender where moneys were recklessly lent in circumstances where questions might reasonably have been raised about ability to repay.  Honest, decent, law abiding citizens find themselves in these circumstances and one has heard the case being made that they are being subjected to debt collection methods of which the House could not approve.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">Is this jurisdiction out of step with similar and neighbouring jurisdictions within the European Union?  Is debt collecting regulated in other countries?  My understanding is it is in many countries yet no such regulation is in place here.  Anybody, notwithstanding his or her track record, background or reputation, can set up a debt collection service in Ireland.  I do not mean to say someone who found himself in difficulty with the law in relatively minor circumstances should forever be disbarred from this or any other type of work.  I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, had remained in the House to inform us where is his Spent Convictions Bill 2007.  I would like this relatively minor Bill disposed of.  I am puzzled, since we dealt with Second Stage many months ago, about why it cannot be progressed to Committee Stage but we have not reverted to it and we ought to.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">It is an entirely different matter, however, for the House to hear allegations that somebody with a serious criminal record can engage in this business with impunity.  Judging by his script, the attitude of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform seems to be either that the problem does not exist, that it would be wrong to handle it as the Fine Gael Bill suggests or that it would be too expensive to deal with it.  He seems to be saying that it is a fact of life in the circumstances in which we are living and he is afraid that we must pass over it.</p>
          <p eId="para_842">The Minister of State came into the House to corroborate the Minister's position and draws our attention again to the code worked out with the banks as a result of them getting €7 billion of taxpayers' money.  The Bill's proponents may hold a different view but I do not think that the commercial banks or financial institutions are really at the heart of what is being aimed at here.  I do not think mortgage institutions or the collection of mortgage debt is the type of thing that freelance collection agencies of dubious repute are concerned with.  Generally speaking, a different route is taken by mortgage lenders.  Most reputable mortgage lenders do not engage in heavy handed, oppressive or intimidating tactics in the way that other debts are being pursued.</p>
          <p eId="para_843">The Minister of State says he agrees that the financial regulatory structure is not the place to include some kind of regulator of debt collection agencies.  He says the purpose of the Financial Regulator is to foster sound and solvent financial institutions, which give depositors and other consumers of financial products confidence that their deposits and investments are safe.  The Minister of State is right to say that was the intention, but that is not exactly the way it has worked out.  Men of means, like the Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, are very worried about their few bob in the banks, and certainly very worried about the conduct of the regulator in ensuring prudential supervision of the financial institutions.  The aspiration was there and now he thinks it would be imposing on the Financial Regulator to repose this responsibility with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">In so far as I can see, it is true that Deputy Charles Flanagan omitted to define debt collectors in the Bill and that would have to be put right, but it is a very minor matter.  This Government seems to have made a habit of deploying all the resources available to it in order to pick holes in Private Members' Bills.  Depending on how the wind is blowing later, however, they come in with the same legislation as if it was their own.  The most recent example was the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Bill dealing with covert surveillance.  When the original Bill was published by the Labour Party there were extraordinary holes in it, according to the Government.  According to the Minister, it would be in danger of alerting criminals to Garda investigative techniques.  After a couple of terrible tragedies in Limerick, however, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, came around to the notion that it was his idea and he was in favour of it all along.  It was then republished and rebranded.  I suspect therefore that the issue raised by Deputy Flanagan about the necessity to regulate the debt collection agency system will come back to this House because we are heading into the kind of times where, unfortunately, resorting to debt collectors is likely to be more frequent.</p>
          <p eId="para_845">Deputy Flanagan dealt with a small percentage of people who end up in prison for non-payment of debts or being unable to discharge fines.  That is a real issue, especially on a night when the Minister announced that the Thornton Hall project is not proceeding because the preferred bidder has withdrawn or because negotiations with the preferred bidder have broken down.  I do not know how many times in this House I have pursued with the Minister whether he was satisfied with the capacity of the preferred bidder to deliver the Thornton Hall project.  The Minister got up on his high horse, as he frequently does, and piously lectured us about the outrageous imputation that he, above any Member of this House, would be seen even on the same side of the street as a developer.  It is a very odd thing for him to say, given that he was the former Taoiseach's preferred emissary to London to find out anything he could about developers there, and a thing or two about developers in Dundalk as well, as Monarch Properties will tell one.  However, the Minister thought it was a terrible imputation.  I do not mind talking to developers at all.  I do not see what the Minister thought was wrong with it, but clearly he did not satisfy himself about the capacity of this particular developer to deliver.  After spending €41.5 million on farm land at an unsuitable location — that was purchased for approximately five times its value at the instruction of the former Minister, Michael McDowell and then Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen — we have now been plunged into a situation where the project has collapsed.  We need to address the issue of incarcerating people for non-violent crimes otherwise we will have a serious overcrowding problem in our prisons.</p>
          <p eId="para_846">Deputy Flanagan has highlighted the necessity to regulate debt collectors and protect vulnerable people from their methods, which is a real issue.  One must come from a very cosseted section of society to suggest what the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, did in his script.  He said he wanted to emphasise clearly that any person who feels he or she has been threatened or harassed by anyone in the context of recovery of a debt allegedly owed by him or her, should contact the Garda.  I represent a constituency where debt collection by moneylenders is a pretty regular feature of life every Saturday.  To some extent, as a result of the Consumer Credit Act, which I introduced, we have regulated the sector so that moneylenders operating outside the law's remit are the exception nowadays.  However, to tell people that they should advise the Garda in those circumstances misunderstands the facts of life in large tracts of urban Ireland, and I presume some tracts of rural Ireland.  I can understand that out in Blackrock one may get a speedier response from <i>les gendarmes</i> than in certain other parts of the city.  The Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, may feel safe in his bed at night but unfortunately in large tracts of urban Ireland people do not feel so safe.  They certainly do not feel that it is an escape from heavy-handed tactics by people seeking to recover debts to telephone the Garda and that everything will be all right.</p>
          <p eId="para_847">This is a real issue.  I do not see any need for an elaborate edifice.  Reposing it in the consumer side of the financial regulatory structure seems to be as good a place as anywhere else but, quite frankly, I do not mind where it is so long as we do something to ensure the service is regulated.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_848">I thank Deputy Rabbitte for permitting me to bring whatever reinforcement elements I still possess to his aid and I thank him and the Labour Party for sharing time with me.  I recognise the depth and nature of the problems this Bill seeks to address and my party, like many others, is appalled by and opposed to the activities of debt collection agencies that bully and threaten businesses and their owners and, in many cases, families in debt and the heads of those impoverished households.</p>
          <p eId="para_849">Like many other Deputies, I have read and watched recent news reports on the issue and I acknowledge the concern these reports create.  It is also important to recognise that there is a pressing need to act on the problem of unregulated debt collection.  However worthy the Bill presented is, its genesis and structure highlight and perpetuate the very flaws that the proposed legislation seeks to address, including the question of regulation generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">In recent years, the Government and, to some extent, the larger Opposition parties have taken a Jekyll and Hyde approach to the question of regulation.  Without much analysis or consideration, areas were deemed to have too much regulation and we, like many other States, mimicked the Thatcher mantra and deregulated our financial markets, the stock exchange and our banking sector.  Not content with that, we opened up a second front of deregulation by selling off State-run enterprises and letting a self-regulating private sector provide vital goods and services.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">In both cases, the Irish experience has been a massive failure.  The lack of effective regulation and controls has given us the basket cases of Eircom and the entire Irish banking sector.  A chief driver in this failure of deregulation was the creation of ineffective and toothless regulators.  The best example of this was the twin roles played by the Central Bank and the Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority in recent months.  This was a Mr. Hyde angle.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">In the past decade, we started a small industry of regulation creation, many of which were needed desperately but very few of which operated effectively or efficiently.  The endemic failures of these supposed regulators are why we are where we are.  Proposing a Bill that builds on failure does not make sense to me.  However, what does make sense is to tackle the wider issue of financial regulation, an important pillar of which is controlling debt collection.  Just as important and just as overlooked is the need to ban household moneylending altogether.  We must begin again on the question of financial regulation in Ireland; it is an imperative.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">Why do we not save the time we could spend on this Bill and immediately direct the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service to investigate international best practice and financial regulation?  We could take a leaf from the book of one of the few positive consensus-driven exercises ever undertaken in this House, which was the DIRT inquiry.  That was the first ignored warning bell that something was very rotten in our banking institutions.  The work of the committee would be to find out what went wrong with financial regulation in Ireland and, perhaps more importantly, how to begin again with systems that work.  It should be given powers of investigation similar to the DIRT inquiry with a time limit, perhaps to report by 1 September, with feasible options for future regulatory institutions and draft legislation proposed to a public sitting of both Houses of the Oireachtas not later than Tuesday, 8 September.  We could implement the Bill alongside it.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">However, to support the Bill without addressing the wider issues of an absence of accountable financial regulation in the State would be a mistake.  We would merely create another Government agency, albeit well-meaning, without enough public oversight and accountability and with powers that might be better off exercised elsewhere.  It might never be more than another quango with an expensive logo, a long name and little real effectiveness.  That is not what anyone wants.</p>
          <p eId="para_855">The financial crisis has exposed how we do government in Ireland and many of the serious shortcomings associated with it.  Governments need to govern and not hide their failures behind the battery of regulators forced to take responsibility for legislative gaps.  We need to stop plugging every hole in the dyke with a regulator.  The ongoing problems in the taxi sector highlight the needless merry-go-round experienced by an industry caught between a Minister and a regulator.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">We need to take stock of all the regulatory agencies we have created in the post-Thatcher, post-monetarist world and ask ourselves in whose interest they were created.  In the financial sector it was clear that it was the banks and their executives that were in the driving seat.  In many other cases, it was a lazy Government that did not govern but instead farmed out the difficult work and then complained when it was done badly.</p>
          <p eId="para_857">Could not the core tenets of the Bill be dealt with by ministerial order?  To work in debt collection, one would have to have a licence from the Department of Finance, not have a criminal record and have to have a tax clearance certificate.  Perhaps this work could be done by a practising solicitor.  Is this not a more suitable and efficient route to do our business?</p>
          <p eId="para_858">I am a little concerned that the Bill is reflective.  There has been considerable media comment on the issue and rightly so but we have a long "to do" list and the Bill's purpose might not be at the top of it.  Unscrupulous and illegal moneylending is just as big a problem as unscrupulous debt collection and often involves the same people.  However, because it is not on the RTE news or in the news media spotlight, we regularly overlook it.  We must legislate by priority and not by headline.</p>

          <p eId="para_861">Yes, it is.  In the straitened times we are in with the lack of finance going to small and medium enterprises, very viable businesses are going to the wall simply because they cannot get the cash.  In many cases, those viable businesses are owed money from customers for goods and services they have provided.  The publication of the Small Claims (Protection of Small Businesses) Bill is a very welcome opportunity to deal with a pressing need.  From speaking to many business organisations and many individuals in businesses, I know that trying to collect debt they are owed is a major problem.  It is worth quoting the first paragraph of the explanatory memorandum of the Bill:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_862">The purpose of this Bill is to provide an efficient and inexpensive mechanism for small business to recover small debts from purchasers.  Delayed payments and bad cheques are threatening the survival of many small and medium enterprises and forcing others into insolvency.  This is particularly the case where a small firm has supplied goods, or installed services, which cannot be removed or which have a short shelf life.</p>
          <p eId="para_863">We know that businesses in the food service sector have been very badly hit by the lack of a reasonably cost-effective debt collection mechanism.  I look forward to the Bill being moved through the House at the earliest opportunity.</p>

            <p eId="para_864">I welcome the opportunity to speak on the closure of wards at Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin.  The decision to close the wards is totally misguided.  The only outcome of the decision will be unnecessary pain and suffering for children, who will be put on the waiting list, and incredible stress for their parents.  I am sure the Minister of State, like all other Members, has received the e-mails on this issue.  If these e-mails are anything by which to judge, there is a huge level of anger and frustration.  In my experience it is matched only by the reaction to the removal of the medical card from people over 70.  There is huge annoyance at this decision on the part of parents not just in Dublin — as Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children is in my constituency I have a particular interest in it — but throughout the country, as the e-mails have made clear.</p>
            <p eId="para_865">Closing the wards and reducing front line services make no sense.  Over the past few years significant amounts of money have been invested in the hospital and various aspects of its service have been upgraded.  What sense or logic is there in closing wards after recently investing substantially in the hospital?  The consequence of closing the wards is that the sick children will either be forced into overcrowded wards or put on an extended waiting list, each of which is extremely unsatisfactory and most unfair.</p>
            <p eId="para_866">The decision is yet another example of the right hand of the HSE not knowing what the left hand is doing.  The HSE will probably argue that critically ill children will get the service and treatment they require.  That is most welcome and one would hope nothing other than that would happen.  However, it is not good enough for the small children and patients who suffer from illnesses such as scoliosis.  I am sure all Members will have received e-mails on that issue as well.  It is heart-rending to hear of the impact on and consequences for children if treatment is not put in place in a timely manner.  Saying that critically ill children will get the treatment they need is another way of saying that many children who are ill will not get the treatment they require.</p>
            <p eId="para_867">Everybody accepts that the HSE is facing serious budgetary problems but it is most inappropriate that the front line services being challenged are the ones that affect children.  This should really be the last resort and not the first option, as it appears to be.  The revelation today that the HSE spent almost €17 million on spin doctors and management consultants last year indicates that maintaining front line services falls well down on the list of priorities when allocating resources.  The spend on public relations is totally unacceptable, particularly in the current climate and against a background of the closure of wards for the provision of services for sick children.</p>
            <p eId="para_868">The details supplied by parents about the effects of the closure on their children are graphic and, in many cases, are clearly causing them huge distress.  The fear factor alone is enough to prompt them to contact every Deputy to have the decision reversed.  The loss of the service to the children is clearly the priority but there is also concern in my constituency about the secondary effect of job losses.  This is also important, and people are very concerned about that risk.  I urge the Minister for Health and Children to engage with Professor Drumm and the management of Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, to reverse the decision.  I will not list the possible areas where savings could be made, as there are many and it is not important now that these are identified.  What is important is that the decision to close the wards is reversed straight away.  The hospital must be given the go-ahead to reopen these wards and to provide for the sick children of this country.</p>

          <speech by="#AineBrady" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_the_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_483">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Health and Children (Deputy Áine Brady)</from>
            <p eId="para_869">I am replying on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney.  Hospital care for children is provided in Dublin at three hospitals: Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin; Temple Street Children's University Hospital and the National Children's Hospital, Tallaght.  Between the three, funding of over €250 million is provided for a national service for sick children.</p>
            <p eId="para_870">The way to provide the best possible tertiary care most cost effectively involves the creation of one single national paediatric hospital, alongside a major teaching hospital, bringing together all the medical and nursing expertise for complex conditions.  The concept of bringing together all three existing services is widely accepted.  It is, therefore, entirely appropriate that we should now move towards that model of care in terms of closer integration and co-operation in the medical areas and in the most cost-effective use of resources.  The Minister understands that significant cost savings are achievable if services and practices are more closely integrated, even before the building of a new paediatric hospital has been completed.  For these reasons, to focus on each of these three hospitals providing paediatric services one by one, in isolation from the other two, will miss the full picture of paediatric services and the full potential for the level of services that could be provided within the resources being made available by taxpayers.</p>
            <p eId="para_871">The facts relating to the budget for Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children are as follows.  The 2009 allocation to the hospital is €139.6 million.  The allocation has increased by over €38 million or 39% since 2004.  In line with budgetary constraints across the system, the 2009 allocation is 3% below the 2008 allocation of €143.8 million.  The employment ceiling at the hospital is 1,550.  At the end of March the HSE reports that the hospital employed 1,650 whole time equivalents, WTEs, which is 100 above its employment ceiling, and therefore contributing to the current financial difficulties.</p>
            <p eId="para_872">In terms of activity, in the first three months of this year there were 2,745 treatments for children as inpatients and 3,841 treatments as day cases at the hospital.  This represents an increase of 244 over the same period in 2008.  There were also 21,252 attendances in the outpatients' department, an increase of 1,041 over the same period last year.  The HSE has advised that, based on the financial performance for the first quarter of 2009, the hospital should achieve a break even position at year end.  This assessment takes account of cost saving measures totalling €6.5 million which have been agreed with the hospital and which are to be implemented over the remainder of the year.  Much of the focus of the discussions between hospital management and the HSE has been on ensuring that all areas of non-pay expenditure are critically examined and that costs are reduced where possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_873">It has proven necessary for Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin, to take measures to stay within budget, including the closure of a theatre and a ward from this month.  However, the hospital has confirmed that it is committed to delivering on the full level of its service plan commitments for 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_874">The funding and provision of the best standard of complex hospital care for children will continue to be a priority for the Government.  Hospitals can work more effectively together, and hospitals will deliver a sustainable and constantly improving service for children by managing costs so that they stay within budget.  Our strategic plan to integrate services at one new hospital is most important to achieve best outcomes for children.</p>

            <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
            <p eId="para_875">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for affording me time to discuss this important matter, namely, the need for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism to explain why application forms for funding under the national lottery sports grants programme for 2009 have not yet been made available to clubs and when he envisages grants being paid.  I am asking not only when the grants will be paid, but if it will be in the foreseeable future.  There is major concern throughout the country about the delay in issuing application forms and awarding funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">I first submitted this matter for debate on 23 March and have submitted it each week since then.  It has finally been selected for debate two months later.  I wonder why it has been sidelined for so long.  I am from a strong sporting family and many members of my family have been associated with the GAA and, indeed, other sports over the years.  Like county groups throughout the country, Longford-Westmeath sporting organisations have made numerous representations to me about sports grants for 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">Although we are faced with tight budgetary constraints, national lottery funding is separate from budgetary allocation and, as such, should not be radically affected.  While spending on lottery tickets may be reduced as a consequence of the economic downturn, considerable moneys will nevertheless continue to be generated.  If some of this fund is not allocated to sport, will the Minister explain how it is being allocated?  If the national lottery money previously earmarked for sporting organisations is not to be disbursed to those groups, we can only assume it will be lost in another bottomless pit by a Government that has failed the people.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">The apparent complete abandonment of sports capital funding represents a major blow to the sporting clubs and associations that play a valuable role in their communities.  This is a crying shame.  Sport is the bedrock of every community in every country.  It binds together local groups and provides an outlet for young people who might otherwise be drawn into drugs, crime and associated activities.  An issue of particular concern is the uncertainty regarding the continuation of Government funding for GAA inter-county players.  The Gaelic Players Association has indicated its members are prepared to take a cut in funding in line with other sports as a consequence of the current economic crisis.  The protection of this funding is critical to the future of the GAA as it affords parity with other elite athletics.  This is extremely important for those engaged in our national games.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">Numerous parliamentary questions have been tabled to the Minister recently on the question of funding for sports.  Sports clubs and organisations are falling victim to a passing of the ball between the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism and the Department of Finance.  In these times of economic recession and job losses, it is more important than ever that public morale is lifted by sporting endeavours.  I take this opportunity to congratulate Shane Lowry on his fine achievement in winning the Irish Open at Baltray last weekend.  I am familiar with that golf course and the area in which it is located because I knew the former manager well.</p>
            <p eId="para_880">I hope the Minister of State, Deputy Áine Brady, will have good news for us today.  I received a telephone call only today from my own parish club, which is in great need of funding.  At least 23 clubs throughout County Longford are awaiting an allocation from the national lottery fund.  A similar number in County Westmeath are crying out for support.  Will the Minister of State indicate when this funding will be delivered?</p>

            <from>Deputy Áine Brady</from>
            <p eId="para_881">I thank the Deputy for raising this issue, which I am taking on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy Cullen.  Given the benefits associated with sporting activities, the Government regards expenditure on sport as important for the social and economic development of the State.  These benefits arise in a broad range of areas, including health and well-being, social and cultural development, education, personal development, tourism and the economy.  Irish sporting successes lift the spirits of the nation and improve our image on the international stage.</p>
            <p eId="para_882">The sports capital programme, which is part funded from the proceeds of the national lottery, is the primary means of granting Government support for the provision of sports facilities at national, regional and local level.  It is, however, a common misunderstanding that the proceeds of the lottery come directly to the Department.  Rather, they are delivered to the Exchequer.  Under the sports capital programme, the Department provides funding to voluntary, sporting and community organisations for the provision of sports and recreational facilities.  More than 7,400 projects have benefited from such funding since 1998, bringing the total allocation in that time to more than €725 million.  In 2008, more than €50 million was allocated to 685 separate sports facility and equipment projects.  The programme has, in the past ten years, transformed the sporting landscape of the State, with improvements in the quality and quantity of sporting facilities in virtually every village, town and city.  The facilities funded range from the smallest clubs to national centres of sporting excellence.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">The aims and objectives of the programme are to foster an integrated and planned approach to the development of sports and physical recreation facilities throughout the State; to assist voluntary and community organisations to develop high-quality, safe, well-designed, accessible and sustainable facilities in appropriate locations in order to maximise participation in sport and physical recreation; to prioritise the needs of disadvantaged areas in the provision of sports facilities; and to encourage the multi-purpose use of local, regional and national sports facilities by clubs, community organisations and national governing bodies of sport.</p>
            <p eId="para_884">The programme has supported the provision or improvement of landmark national and regional stadia such as Thomond Park, home to twice European rugby champions, Munster, and Semple Stadium, the home of hurling for many.  Such facilities provide a platform for our most talented athletes to perform, which in turn inspires new generations of young people to aspire to match the sporting prowess of their heroes.  They are also an important support to our tourism industry as they draw visitors from Britain, Europe and further afield who come to Ireland to see their teams in action.</p>
            <p eId="para_885">All Members are aware of the many benefits that derive from the programme in their localities.  They have no doubt witnessed the value of the programme in assisting local clubs in meeting the sporting needs of their areas.  In recent years, the programme has targeted clubs in areas of social disadvantage.  In this way, the Government is supporting the provision of facilities where there may be little prospect of such facilities being provided by the communities acting alone.  These facilities provide an opportunity for participation in sport which leads to healthier lifestyles and a reduced likelihood of younger people drifting into anti-social behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_886">It is prudent, however, to pause and take stock on occasion, regardless of the merits of any programme.  It is essential to review areas of expenditure to determine whether particular schemes represent the optimal use of the resources available.  Accordingly, no decision has yet been made about the timing of further rounds of the sports capital programme.  My Department is currently finalising a five-year strategic plan to inform the future development of necessary sporting facilities throughout the State.  The aim of the strategy is to provide high-level policy direction for future investment and grant assistance at national, regional and local level.  It is intended to identify the requirement for sports facilities in order that participation at reasonable cost is feasible for those who wish to engage in sport, at either amateur or elite level.  It aims to prioritise areas for future investment and to ensure continued improvements in the relevant areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_887">In the interim, it is business as usual for those that were allocated grants under previous rounds of the programme.  There is no question of rowing back on allocations already made.  The current position remains that €56 million has been provided in the Department's Vote in the 2009 Estimates to cover payments to be made from the Cl subhead, out of which grants are paid for the provision of sports and recreation facilities.  While we are in difficult times, we must also recognise that more than 1,000 payments will be made to projects being undertaken this year throughout the State.  These projects will allow clubs to drain pitches, erect flood lighting, build changing rooms and sports halls and generally increase the opportunities for people to engage in sports at all levels.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">As I have said, no decision has been taken on the timing of the next round of the programme.  I am taking this opportunity to ensure sporting facilities are fairly balanced in each region of the State.  A national audit of sports facilities is currently being finalised.  The results of this audit will inform a more strategic approach over the next five years, as we decide how to use the sports capital programme to continue to benefit all areas.  As more than 7,400 projects have been already funded under the programme, it is fair to say it has been a great success.  Now we must take a step back and consider the recommendations of the national sports facilities strategy and the results of the audit.  We must refocus and ensure we continue to invest our scarce resources as effectively as possible in order to meet the dual objectives of increasing participation and improving performance.</p>

          <from>Deputy Tom Sheahan</from>
          <p eId="para_894">I, more than anyone, want dung removed from roads in Killarney National Park for the benefit of parents, children and other visitors to the site.  However, the Minister and his representatives in the National Parks and Wildlife Service in Killarney are taking a heavy-handed approach to the issue.  Mr. David Muir who recently travelled from England was introduced as an equine expert but stated himself that he was an equine consultant as opposed to expert.  No one is better placed to judge this issue than the experts who have been driving horses in Killarney National Park for up to 46 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">Equine sanitary devices, otherwise known as dung catchers and nappies, have been used in other countries on four-wheel carriages but will not work on a two-wheel trap or side car.  I suggest Mr. Muir, who introduced these devices to jarveys in Killarney, has a conflict of interest because he designed and produces them.  Moreover, by his own admission, these devices only have an 80% success rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_896">The National Parks and Wildlife Service has two sweepers in Muckross House in Killarney National Park.  If their services were used more regularly than heretofore, the use of equine sanitary devices would not be necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_897">I ask the Minister to reconsider his decision in this matter.  I will accept the expertise of those who have been driving horses for as many as 46 years before accepting the opinions of the Minister's staff in the National Parks and Wildlife Service who have probably never been on a horse.  I have seen horses bolt.  The devices, which are attached to the trap and tied to the breeches of the horse, will not work in the undulating topography of Killarney National Park and could interfere with the braking system on a two-wheel car.</p>
          <p eId="para_898">I ask the Minister to refrain from taking a heavy-handed approach and not to lock out jarveys if they do not have equine sanitary devices attached on 8 June.  Jarveys and horse drawn carriages have been used in Killarney National Park since 1929.  Other issues pertaining to the Minister's portfolio need to be addressed with greater urgency than the matter we are discussing.  While I want horse dung to be removed from the roads of Killarney National Park, this objective could be achieved if the park's management deployed its staff for sweeping duties on a regular basis rather than intermittently, as is the case at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_899">I cannot stand idly by while the Minister seeks to introduce regulations, probably by means of ministerial order, to lock out jarveys who have been operating in Killarney National Park for 80 years.  Men who have been driving horses for up to 46 years have informed me that equine sanitary devices could interfere with the braking system of a car.  If a horse were to bolt, the safety of passengers, the driver and pedestrians in the national park would be placed in jeopardy.  This issue can be addressed by using brushes fixed to the back of a tractor.</p>

        <speech by="#AineBrady" eId="spk_492">
          <from>Deputy Áine Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_900">I thank the Deputy for the opportunity to discuss this important issue in the House.  Killarney National Park is managed by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government through its National Parks and Wildlife Service, NPWS.  The national park is internationally renowned for its beauty and its richness in wildlife.  It is protected under European Union directives and has UNESCO biosphere reserve designation.  The park attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors each year, some of whom are in the Visitors Gallery, and can be truly classed as one of Ireland's crown jewels.  All of this demands that the National Parks and Wildlife Service manages the site to the highest standards.  The Department devotes considerable time, energy and resources to achieving these standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_901">One of the enduring features associated with the area is the jaunting cars which provide popular horse-drawn tours throughout Killarney town and its environs.  In the national park up to 45 jarveys operating 66 jaunting cars ply their trade under licence from the National Parks and Wildlife Service across a network of some 15 km of internal roads.  An unfortunate consequence of so many horses frequenting the park is that the roadways are consistently fouled with horse dung.  The presence of this untreated dung in the park has long been a concern from the point of view of aesthetic, environmental, tourism and health and safety grounds.  While the jarveys can add to the visitor experience, the soiling of roads in the park is no longer acceptable.  Moreover, it should be noted that the roads are maintained and cleaned by the National Parks and Wildlife Service at taxpayers' expense.</p>
          <p eId="para_902">The  National Parks and Wildlife Service has been engaged in a lengthy consultation process with the jarveys since the end of 2007 to consider how best to deal with the issue.  As part of this process, it carried out trials with a mechanical sweeper and dung catchers.  The dung catcher option, preferred notably on cost, effectiveness and noise grounds, was also the subject of tests by a leading United Kingdom based equine expert as well as a leading veterinary consultant.  The outcome, including as a result of practice trials and consultations with experts, is that dung catchers work effectively, work in various terrains, are easy to operate and do not compromise animal health or welfare.  The National Parks and Wildlife Service has continued to meet the jarveys and sought to allay any concerns regarding usage and animal welfare through demonstration of the device.  It has also offered to provide the dung catchers free of charge.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">The Minister is confident that the dung catcher device is the way forward.  These devices are already in widespread use in many European cities.  After more than a year of consultations, the National Parks and Wildlife Service had hoped to have them in use in the national park for the start of the main 2009 season.  It is not unreasonable that the service should proceed with the date selected for their introduction, namely, 8 June.  From this date, jarvey licences will have a new condition added which requires that equine sanitary devices be used.</p>
          <p eId="para_904">While the dung catcher requirement is to apply to the national park only, the Minister is hopeful that Killarney Town Council will follow this example and introduce similar controls for the town where the soiling of streets is also a problem.  He asks all jarveys to support the new arrangement which will raise the high standards of Killarney National Park even further.  This objective can be achieved at negligible cost and disruption to the jarveys themselves.</p>

          <from>Deputy Denis Naughten</from>
          <p eId="para_907">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me an opportunity to raise this issue in the House and congratulate an Aire Stáit on her appointment.  While the Minister of State is a capable individual, she is acting this evening on behalf of the Departments of Health and Children, Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Education and Science.  It is a disgrace that the responsible Ministers did not believe it to be worthwhile to come before the House to listen to the points being made by Members.  Of the three Ministers in the Department of Education and Science, not one believed it was worthwhile to listen to me raise an issue which affects many children in Roscommon town and throughout my constituency.  The treatment Deputies have received this evening is an insult to the House.  In fairness to the Minister of State, she has not given an explanation for the failure of the four relevant Ministers to turn up this evening.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">Currently, 855 pupils attend primary schools in the four schools in the parish of Roscommon.  In addition, many more pupils are attending schools outside the parish because of the waiting list for schools placement in the parish.  Three of the four schools have submitted applications to the Department's primary building unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_909">Both Scoil Mhuire and Kilteevan national school have a band 2.4 rating.  They have been described by the Department as having a deficit of mainstream accommodation, but it is not extensive or critical.  I believe the band rating for both of those schools is wrong because refurbishment of a sizeable proportion of their accommodation is required to bring them up to standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">The third school is Gaelscoil de hÍde which has a band rating of 2.2.  The Department believes that the deficit of mainstream accommodation constitutes a substantial and significant proportion of the school's accommodation needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">Two of the schools have waiting lists for enrolment.  The Gaelscoil has closed its enrolment for the next couple of years.  Scoil Mhuire has 27 children on the waiting list for 1 September next year, that is, a full class for which the school cannot cater.  These children are living in Roscommon town and going to schools in the town's hinterland in areas such as Kilteevan, Cloverhill and Athleague, which is creating additional challenges for those schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">Scoil Mhuire has the land on which to build the extension.  The board of management wants to ensure a high standard of education for all the children and it is not prepared to increase the class sizes from 28 pupils until it has a guarantee that the funding will be provided for the extension.  The Department of Education and Science states that a school is full when it has an average pupil-teacher ratio of 28.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">Most of Scoil Mhuire's classrooms were built in 1902.  They are far too small to house the number of children in the school.  It is not acceptable that we are housing children in schools that are over 100 years old.</p>
          <p eId="para_914">The Gaelscoil is in a temporary building and requires a permanent site.  I understand that the OPW has looked at a site of approximately three acres but no progress has been made in that regard.  It continues to rent a building but provides no additional capacity to cater for the demand for the school.</p>
          <p eId="para_915">Kilteevan national school requires an additional classroom, wheelchair accessible toilets, a staff room and an office.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">Scoil Mhuire made an application for seven additional classrooms and, as I stated, it has an available site.  To compound the current problem, the Department, based on its estimates for the 2008 to 2014 period, predicts that an additional five classrooms will be required to deal with the demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">Not only is it causing considerable problems and anxiety for the parents who are trying to get placements for their children in the schools within the parish, it is also having a spill-over effect on the other schools.  For example, I raised the case on 16 December last of 11 pupils from Roscommon town who cannot avail of school transport to Cloverhill national school even though they live the required distance from the school because the Department claims they are not attending the nearest schools to them.  However, their nearest school and the next nearest school do not have the capacity to cater for them.  Surely they should be entitled to school transport when the Department is not prepared to get its act together to provide the funding urgently required for the three schools within the Roscommon parish.  We should be trying to ensure that every child has the opportunity to attend his or her local school.  Given that children must be transported distances outside the town, they are missing classes because the parents may not have transport available to them and no public transport is available.</p>

        <speech by="#AineBrady" eId="spk_496">
          <from>Deputy Áine Brady</from>
          <p eId="para_918">I am replying to this Adjournment matter on behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">At the outset I thank the Deputy for raising the matter as it affords me the opportunity to outline to the Dáil the process being utilised to ensure that there will be adequate accommodation in schools at primary and post-primary level in all parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">The forward planning section of the Department of Education and Science is in the process of identifying the areas where significant additional accommodation will be required at primary and post-primary levels for future school years.  Factors under consideration include population growth, demographic trends, current and projected enrolments, recent and planned housing developments and the capacity of existing schools to meet the demand for places.  Having considered these factors decisions will be taken on the means by which emerging needs will be met within an area.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">The forward planning section utilises the latest in geographical information system, GIS, technology to assist in planning school requirements in the future. The GIS contains information on all schools in the country, at primary and post-primary levels, geo-coded to their location.  The information is then linked to the relevant demographic information for those areas — typically, the demographic information will be from the Central Statistics Office, the General Registrar of Births, the Department of Social and Family Affairs, An Post's geo-directory and information supplied by local authorities through development plans.  Growth projection figures are applied to existing population with a view to assessing future requirements at primary and post-primary levels.  As a matter of course, there is ongoing liaison between the Department and local authorities to establish the location, scale and pace of any major proposed developments and their possible implications for school provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_922">Applications from primary schools in the area referred to are being considered in the context of the Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">It should also be noted in this context that a review of the procedures for the establishment of new primary schools is currently being undertaken by the Commission on School Accommodation.  A technical working group, under the direction of the chairman of the commission, has been established for this purpose.  This working group has commenced its work and it is expected that it will be completed and recommendations made to the Minister before the end of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">In the interim it is not proposed to recognise any new schools except in areas where the increases in pupil numbers cannot be catered for in existing schools and which require the provision of new schools.  This means that new schools will not be established for reasons not related to demographic growth in areas where there is already sufficient school accommodation or where increases can be catered for by extending existing school accommodation.  It is proposed that locations where new schools are required for the coming years will be identified by the Department of Education and Science and the details circulated to all existing patron bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">This review does not mean that there will be a complete cessation of the school building programme outside areas of rapid growth.  This year alone, almost €614 million will be spent on the school building programme.  In addition to the establishment of new schools in areas of rapid population growth, the normal building programme of modernising, replacing or extending existing schools will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">The forward planning section will continue to monitor planned developments and population growth in the Roscommon town area to ensure that school accommodation needs are provided in a timely manner.  I thank the Deputy once again for raising this matter.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_930">I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 66 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_931">For convenience, I set out below two Tables containing the statistical information sought.  Table 1 sets out the number of statutory redundancies for years 2002 to 2008 and details for 2009 which are provisional figures (up to the end of April).  These figures show the number of employees who actually qualified for statutory redundancy lump sum payments.  They do not reflect those who lost their jobs with less than two years service in employment.  I am unable to provide a projection of the final number of projected redundancies in 2009.  However, it is clear from the figures that I am making available that there were almost 28,000 notified redundancies in the first four months of this year i.e. to end April.  This already represents around 69% of the total for the full year in 2008 — when we received 40,607 claims over the 12 month period.  For comparison, the total number of claims received in 2007 was 25,459, so the increase in 2008 over 2007 was around 159%.</p>
            <p eId="para_932">Table 2 shows the amount of monies paid out of the Social Insurance Fund in respect of redundancy claims for the years 2002 — 2008 up to and including the end of April 2009.  It should be noted that the figures provided for 2008 and to date in 2009 are provisional figures.  It is not possible to project the figure for 2009 given that this will hinge on a number of variables including the number of claims received, the length of service of the claimants etc.  However, it is clear from the figures that payments so far this year amounted to €73.6 million compared to a total last year of €183.2 million.  Therefore, in the first four months of this year, we have made payments which are equivalent to 40% of the total amount that was paid last year over the 12 month period.</p>
            <p eId="para_933">I can include in the Official Report for Deputies, if they wish, all the figures relating to the number and value of redundancy claims for each of the last 8 years.  However, this information has already been given to the House on many occasions in recent weeks in the form of responses to written questions.</p>

            <p eId="para_970">I visited the West Coast of the United States for five days in April on a marketing programme organised by IDA Ireland.  Immediately following that visit, senior officials of my Department and I visited Washington where we held discussions with the Obama administration.</p>
            <p eId="para_971">The IDA sponsored programme involved meeting Chairpersons, CEOs and other senior executives of leading companies in the Globally Traded Business, Clean Technology and Information &amp; Communications Technology sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_972">While no specific commitments were made in regard to new investment projects during my visit, I am not surprised at this as most major FDI projects can involve a lengthy evaluation and decision making process.  It is often the case following such visits that a considerable number of meetings and discussions will take place between the company and IDA Ireland before the company makes a final decision on location.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">However, I am optimistic that new investments and jobs will follow in time, particularly given the positive views expressed to me about Ireland and the high standing in which Ireland is viewed as a business location by leading global companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">While my visit to Washington was in April, prior to the U.S. Administration's announcement of its proposals to reform its tax code, I did raise taxation issues in my meetings with the Obama Administration.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Taoiseach raised similar concerns on their recent visits to Washington D.C.  This is part of an ongoing dialogue we will continue with the U.S. Administration as these tax change proposals evolve.</p>

            <p eId="para_985">I am very aware of the impact on Xilinx employees and their families following the company's decision to reduce its workforce in Ireland.  The company has announced that there will be 130 redundancies.  I understand that the redundancies will take place between June and December this year with 15-20 jobs to be lost by June.  In many cases, such company announcements are as a result of global conditions and/or global decisions, over which we have little influence.  In this case the proposed redundancies are in the Manufacturing and Test operations whichare being transferred to Asia.  Xilinx has said that it has based its decision on cost competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_986">The remaining 220 positions are to remain in Dublin.  These jobs are in R&amp;D, Engineering, IT and other corporate and customer facing activities.  I understand that the job outputs in these cases are of significant higher value and are seen by Xilinx's management as a base for future growth.  The company has confirmed that Ireland will remain its European HQ and that there is a corporate commitment to all other activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_987">Xilinx has entered into a full consultative process with its employees, where details of redundancy and options for employees will be outlined.  The State development agencies under the aegis of my Department have adopted a co-ordinated approach in response to the announced job losses, which includes relevant interventions from all of the agencies, including FÁS, which will offer its full range of services to workers being made redundant.</p>
            <p eId="para_988">IDA is conscious of the implications of job losses in the economy as a whole and in this respect the Agency's main focus is on securing investment from new and existing clients in the areas of High End Manufacturing, Global Services (including Financial Services) and Research, Development and Innovation. Within these areas the key sectors IDA focuses on are Life Sciences (Pharmaceutical, Biopharmaceutical and Medical Technologies), Information Communications Technology (ICT), Engineering, Professional Services, Digital Media, Consumer Brands and International Services. New opportunities are emerging in areas such as Clean Technology, Convergence and Services Innovation.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_990">I am conscious that energy costs for businesses in Ireland are a source of concern, particularly as businesses are attempting to cut costs to remain competitive in the current economic environment.  However, in recent months, the trend of energy prices has been downward.  In response to this trend, the Commission for Energy Regulation lowered electricity prices for residents and Small and Medium Enterprises by 10% from 1 May.  Gas prices were reduced by an average of 12%.  Large industrial users of electricity are in an unregulated market and market players are free to compete on price, with large companies able to switch to lower cost suppliers.</p>
            <p eId="para_991">According to the latest published Eurostat comparisons, smaller SMEs are paying 1% below the average EU 27 price — approximately 60% of ESB's SME customers are in this category.</p>
            <p eId="para_992">Greater competition will enhance current downward pressures on energy prices.  New market entrants, both in electricity generation and in supply will support this trend. Recent entrants to the residential and SME market include Airtricity and Bord Gáis.  They are offering discounts of between 10 and 14% on current ESB tariffs.  Already, over 120,000 customers have transferred their electricity accounts to Bord Gáis Electricity.  The Government recently approved the construction of an East-West electricity interconnector that will further enhance competition.  The Single Electricity Market, in operation since November 2007, has ensured a more reliable network, improving competition and increasing downward pressure on prices.</p>
            <p eId="para_993">On 8 May the Government launched the National Energy Efficiency Plan.  This reiterates that the best method for businesses to cut energy costs is through energy efficiency.  The new Plan includes advice and mentoring for Small and Medium Enterprises on how best they can reduce their energy costs.  In addition, the Government has provided incentives to business to purchase energy efficient equipment and we will continue to promote energy efficient best practice. Sustainable Energy Ireland also offers a broad range of assistance to enterprises in achieving significant savings.</p>
            <p eId="para_994">My Department and the Agencies of my Department work closely with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Commission for Energy Regulation on an ongoing basis.  Together with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I have given the highest priority to the issue of energy prices at Cabinet level.</p>
            <p eId="para_995">We are working towards possible mechanisms to promote downward pressure on price and enhance competition in the market.  This includes the commitment in the Framework document, Building Ireland's Smart Economy, published last December, to undertake a fundamental review of energy prices and tariff methodologies used by the Commission for Energy Regulation.  This will take account of the needs of all energy consumers, including the vital need to support competitiveness.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_997">I presume that the Deputy is referring to the recent initiative by the retailer concerned to change the way in which it sources certain internationally branded products.  The Deputy will appreciate that the negotiation of commercial contracts is essentially a matter for the contracting parties themselves and that I have no direct function in relation to such negotiations.</p>
            <p eId="para_998">Undoubtedly in these difficult economic times, businesses and consumers are finding it more and more challenging to manage their expenditure and costs.  For businesses, there is an imperative to reduce costs and streamline operations. This has been the reality for manufacturing firms in Ireland and elsewhere for some considerable time and has brought undoubted benefits to consumers in terms of lower prices for manufactured goods.</p>
            <p eId="para_999">The relationships between suppliers and retailers are complex.  The Deputy will be aware that I have for some time been engaged in discussions with all the various elements of the retail trade to bring greater clarity as to the reasons for the current differential in North-South retail prices, given the impact that this differential is having on employment, business activity, revenue to the exchequer and consumer confidence.  As part of this engagement I requested the Competition Authority to carry out a study of the retail import/distribution sector as to how competition is working in the sector and whether any practices or methods of competition are affecting the supply of goods and services in that sector.  I received the Authority's report on the 30th April and I am examining its findings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1000">Whilst recent reductions in consumer prices are indeed welcome, I am mindful of the concerns that have been expressed in relation to the possible implications for employment in Ireland particularly if changes in supply chain arrangements reduce the level of purchases by retailers from Irish producers.  It is essential, therefore, that the focus of all those in the sector, whether they be suppliers, manufacturers, distributors or retailers, is on ensuring that the sector delivers in terms of providing the best value for money for consumers whilst also minimising the negative impact of the current trading conditions on employment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1002">On 14 April 2009, the European Commission approved a scheme for Ireland, under its Temporary Framework on State aid.  The Temporary Framework, which was introduced in response to the current economic crisis, gives EU Member States increased flexibility to give assistance to companies in a variety of forms e.g. grants, subsidised loans.</p>
            <p eId="para_1003">The approved scheme is based on the provision in the Framework that allows aid up to €500,000 to be given per company.  It is a condition of the Temporary Framework that the scheme can only apply to companies which were not in difficulties on 1 July 2008, that is before the advent of the global economic crisis. The scheme is limited in time to 2009 and 2010.</p>

The Fund will provide targeted support for internationally trading companies; particular attention is being paid to supporting viable small and medium sized enterprises engaged in exporting.

            <p eId="para_1006">On 1 January 2006 responsibility for the Social Economy Programme transferred to the Department of Community, Rural &amp; Gaeltacht Affairs and it has been re-named as the Community Services Programme.  FÁS as an agency of my Department operates Job Initiative (JI).</p>
            <p eId="para_1007">The Job Initiative Programme (JI) was launched in July 1996 and provides full time employment for people who are 35 years of age or over, unemployed for 5 years or more, and in receipt of Social Welfare payments over that period.</p>
            <p eId="para_1008">The main purpose of the programme is to assist long-term unemployed people to prepare for work opportunities by providing participants with work experience, training and development opportunities.  The programme is sponsored by voluntary organisations and public bodies involved in not-for-profit activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1009">Following changes introduced on 10 November 2004 by Minister Micheál Martin no new entrants have been admitted onto the Job Initiative Schemes.  However, contracts for existing participants are renewed and CE participants to support the service being provided may replace those who leave voluntarily.</p>
            <p eId="para_1010">This Government will continue to support the positive role of FÁS Employment Schemes in meeting the needs of long-term unemployed persons while at the same time providing essential services to communities.

            <p eId="para_1012">As I have said in response to a similar question on this matter it is important to recognize that the ISEQ Combined Code on Corporate Governance, which is considered in the Review, is of most direct relevance only to those companies which are listed PLCs.  This category of company represents, numerically, an extremely small proportion of the overall total, with some 40 PLCs listed and traded on the main index out of a total of just over 184,000 companies registered in the State as at 31 December 2008.  It is very important, therefore, to view any comments made by the Review in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1013">The code operates on a "comply or explain" principle which recognises that circumstances may preclude a company from compliance with all requirements at a particular time and so requires an explanation for the non-compliance.  In this regard 97% of companies reviewed were either fully compliant or provided explanations as to why they were not compliant.</p>
            <p eId="para_1014">I understand that a review of the Code is being undertaken by the Financial Reporting Council in the UK and I look forward to the outcome of that review.</p>

         the action she proposes to take to improve the competitiveness in the manufacturing and service sectors with particular reference to the need to improve the position of Irish exports on world markets and enable the home based service sectors to compete more aggressively thereby facilitating economic revival; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
        [19876/09]

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_507">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1016">We have an open pro-enterprise and pro-business economy.  Our manufacturing and services sectors are very successful on global export markets.  Indeed, contrary to the impression given by some commentators, Ireland's export performance has been very impressive even during the current economic difficulties.  Final data for last year — 2008, showed that Ireland's merchandise exports totalled €86.2bn (down 3% on the previous year) and our services exports were €67.6bn (up 3%).  The country's total exports were therefore €153.8bn; a fall of less than 1% on 2007 and our trade surplus was a very healthy €21.4bn.</p>
            <p eId="para_1017">This was a very impressive performance, when account is taken of the global recession and the adverse exchange rate between the Euro and both the US Dollar and Sterling, as the US and Britain are our two largest export markets.  In addition we have achieved considerable success in developing new markets, with significant export growth achieved to China (up 22%), Malaysia (up 53%), Saudi Arabia (up 10%), UAE (up 14%), Brazil (up 13%) and some of the new EU Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1018">Eurostat data shows that Ireland's share of EU exports increased from 2.2% for the quarter Nov. 07 — Jan. 08 to 2.5% for the same period a year later and in January 2009 it stands at 2.7%.  A notable statistic is that the level of exports from the EU as a whole, actually fell significantly — down 23.9% in the quarter Dec 08-Feb 09, so our performance is even more remarkable in that context.</p>
            <p eId="para_1019">However, current trading conditions for companies are difficult and challenging because of various issues such as the devaluation of sterling, tough competition, and the global recession.  Some issues are outside the control of Government as a whole, but where possible and appropriate, we can address some key areas.  We are addressing Ireland's cost competitiveness as an essential element of our economic recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_1020">Recently published indicators are in our favour with inflation, commodity and other prices falling.  The Consumer Price Index figures released last week are an indication of falling Irish prices in a number of areas, with Ireland showing the highest cut in prices.  This brings Ireland closer into line with average EU prices, going some way towards restoring our overall cost competitiveness, but there is still a distance to go.</p>
            <p eId="para_1021">Under the Framework for Economic Renewal we are taking a number of measures across Government to address competitiveness objectives.  A key element of the Government's current strategy to develop the enterprise sector is to encourage increased levels of investment in research, using more technology in product development and encouraging more innovation.  "Building Ireland's Smart Economy" sets a clear agenda to help manage this change and build Ireland's comparative advantage for future economic growth in knowledge-intensive goods and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1022">It is my intention to establish a Manufacturing Forum in the near future, in line with the recommendations of the "Report of the High Level Group on Manufacturing", launched in 2008.  Furthermore, implementation of the recommendations of the Services Strategy Group's report "Catching the Wave: A Services Strategy for Ireland", will enable Irish service companies to exploit new and exciting opportunities, such as eLearning, business and financial services, professional and consultancy services and others.  Some of these are already being acted on by the Enterprise Agencies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1023">The Government is focused on the factors that will drive our long-term competitiveness.  Our policies to improve competitiveness have a long term strategic objective which will restore confidence to the business community and continue to improve the capabilities of the manufacturing and services sectors competing on both domestic and world markets, so that they are well positioned to take advantage of the global upturn.</p>

            <p eId="para_1025">There are fourteen Agencies operating under the aegis of my Department, each of which is responsible for the delivery and implementation of a range of policies on behalf of my Department.  Their purpose is to implement policy in accordance with their mandates, in areas such as enterprise development, science technology and innovation promotion, labour force development, commercial, industrial, competition or consumer regulation, and personal injury compensation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1026">For example, Forfás was established as the national policy and advisory body for enterprise, trade, science, technology and innovation, and as such, it conducts research or engages in consultation with relevant stakeholders and sectoral interests in order to provide me with advice on matters relating to the development of industry and enterprise in the State.  On the other hand, the Personal Injuries Assessment Board's role extends to the provision of an independent assessment of personal injury compensation for victims of workplace, motor and public liability accidents but does not encompass a policy formulation or advisory function per se.</p>
            <p eId="para_1027">Our configuration of Agencies supporting the Department has been designed to allow individual Agencies grow a dedicated workforce with specialist skills that enables it to deal efficiently and effectively with policy implementation within their respective remits.  However, my Department, on the basis of inputs from these Agencies, as well as from a wide range of other stakeholders — Government Departments, the Social Partners, representative organisations and individual stakeholders — remains responsible for developing the strategic perspective which forms the basis for policy advice to, and decision-making by, me as Minister and by Government collectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1028">I remain satisfied that there is clarity in relation to the policy formulation role of my Department on the one hand, and the policy advisory and implementation functions of our Agencies, on the other.  Nonetheless, I can assure the Deputy that I and my Department keep the appropriateness of the configuration of our Agency structure under review, on a case-by-case basis, such that we make adjustments, as appropriate, to the roles and structures of the Agencies where the case for such is well founded.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1030">Due to recent difficulties being experienced by some companies seeking Export Credit Insurance, I asked Forfás and Enterprise Ireland, working with my Department, to undertake an analysis of the issue, as outlined in my reply to the earlier Parliamentary Question that was referred to by the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_1031">The preliminary analysis which was conducted was considered by the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Economic Renewal last month.  The Committee decided that a State Export Credit Insurance Scheme, as sought by business and exporting interests, may not be the best solution to the current difficulties being experienced by many companies.  The Cabinet Committee agreed that the difficulties in obtaining commercial export credit insurance are closely related to the wider problem of credit availability for business generally.  This latter issue is being pursued as part of the Review of Bank Lending, being undertaken (with assistance from Mazars consultants) as part of the banks recapitalisation programme, and the issue of trade finance is also covered by the terms of reference.  I understand from my colleague, the Minister for Finance, that this review is due to be finalised by the end of June.</p>
            <p eId="para_1032">Nevertheless, in light of further pressures on business and exporters, along with the fact that other Member States (notably Luxembourg, the UK and Denmark) have recently taken steps to introduce short-term State-backed credit insurance schemes, I have now requested that the subject of export credit insurance be further examined.  Forfás, in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and my Department, are in discussion with the three principal operators in the export credit insurance business, and are currently working to assess further options. These options are to be presented to me as a matter of urgency and I intend to then bring the matter back to the Cabinet Committee for further consideration, within the next two weeks.  Issues such as default risk, exchequer exposure to costs and the impact of any such scheme on business would be part of that assessment.</p>

            <p eId="para_1034">The 35 County and City Enterprise Boards (CEBs) were set up in 1993 to provide support for micro-enterprises in the start-up and expansion phases, to promote and develop indigenous micro-enterprise potential and to stimulate economic activity and entrepreneurship at local level.  The CEBs deliver a series of Programmes to underpin this role and they can provide both financial and non-financial assistance to a project promoter.</p>
            <p eId="para_1035">In the current economic climate, entrepreneurship, and the growth and development of small Irish businesses, is central to economic recovery and it is essential that Irish enterprises continue to be supported.  The CEBs play a key role in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_1036">I have secured a Capital Allocation of €20.2m for provision of supports via the CEBs to micro-enterprise for 2009.  During this year the Boards will continue to be actively involved in the area of economic development and will ensure that available funds are targeted to maximise entrepreneurial development.  This will be done not just by direct grant aid to businesses and project promoters but also through the provision of a range of other important business supports such as mentoring, business training and business advice all of which help to stimulate indigenous enterprise creation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1037">My Department, in association with the CEB Central Coordination Unit within Enterprise Ireland (CCU), and with the CEB network, will continue to monitor the level of funding and range of support services offered by the CEBs to the micro-enterprise sector, particularly in the light of the current economic climate.</p>

         the steps she is taking, in view of the further increase in the number of people on the live register, published on 29 April 2009, to stem the number of job losses; her plans to provide new training opportunities for those who have lost their jobs and to encourage the creation of new employment opportunities; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_511">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1039">The total number of people on the Live Register for April 2009 was 384,448, an increase of 188,850 or 96.6% in the 12-month period.  Last month's Live Register figures shows that the month on month increase continues to slow, with 13,000 people signing on the Live Register compared with 36,500 in January.  In addition, despite the increase in the Live Register figures for April it should also be noted that last month approximately 11,000 people signed off as they had found employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1040">Employment and unemployment are measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey and published by the Central Statistics Office.  In the fourth quarter of 2008, the most recent quarter for which data is available, employment decreased 86,900 or 4.1% over 12 months to a total of 2,052,800.  Unemployment increased by 69,600 or 68.8% in the same period to 170,600. The unemployment rate for this period was 7.7%.</p>
            <p eId="para_1041">In response to the rising numbers of unemployed the Government has already taken a number of actions, including doubling the capacity of the job search supports system provided by FÁS Employment Services and the partnership-based Local Employment Service to 150,000 places per year for referrals under the National Employment Action Plan.</p>
            <p eId="para_1042">In addition, my Department is now funding approximately 128,000 activation training and work experience places through FÁS.  This is a substantial increase on the 66,000 places, which were available at the end of last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1043">Key to these developments has been the coordinated and integrated approach to activation between my Department, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Education and Science.  As a result of this joint approach the Government announced in the Supplementary Budget that €128 million was being redeployed to the activation area, which is resulting in the creation of 23,435 training and education activation places across my Department, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Education and Science.</p>
            <p eId="para_1044">Included in these places are specific new innovative measures such as a work experience scheme, which will provide 2,000 six-month places to individuals who are unemployed and it will include the placement of graduates.  A new training programme of 277 places at a cost of €1 million is being introduced for sustaining vulnerable employment.  Under this programme 277 workers who are on a three-day week and receiving social welfare payments for the days they are not working will receive 2 days training a week for a period of 52 weeks.  And 1,500 places to enable the unemployed participate in third level education on a part-time basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1045">The Government is also assisting redundant apprentices complete their apprenticeships.  I announced on 14th May 2009 that over 3600 redundant apprentices will be able to progress their training towards qualification through a number of special measures this year including the employer based rotation scheme, which will assist up to 500 individuals, the agreement between ESB Networks and FÁS to provide training opportunities to up to 400 redundant electrical apprentices.</p>
            <p eId="para_1046">The interim changes introduced by FÁS to enable 2,000 redundant apprentices progress to their next off-the-job phase without having completed the previous on-the-job phases.  The Institutes of Technology are providing 700 places for those who have completed their Phase 4 training but where an on or off-the-job training opportunity is not available.</p>
            <p eId="para_1047">The Government remains intent on achieving greater capacity within existing resources to meet the on-going challenges in the labour market.  In this context we will continue to bring forward further measures to make training and education services available to a greater number of unemployed persons.</p>
            <p eId="para_1048">While activation measures will assist individuals in securing employment and enhancing their skills, the key to addressing our unemployment problem is the creation of more jobs.  That is why the Government remains strongly focussed on supporting and promoting enterprise development to create new jobs.  In this regard the Enterprise Development Agencies of my Department, including IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland, are working to ensure that we continue to grow the economy and jobs even in the current more challenging climate.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1051">I propose to take Questions Nos. 78 and 127 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1052">I am aware of the concerns that have been expressed in relation to the possible impact of certain recent changes in the supply chain in the retail sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1053">The changes essentially relate to the decision by the retailer concerned to alter the nature of its contracts with certain international suppliers.  The retailer concerned has stated that it changed the manner in which it sources certain internationally branded products as international suppliers were treating its operations in this country significantly differently than they treated its operations in other jurisdictions such as the UK and that the direct consequence of these changes has been a significant reduction in its prices to consumers.  The retailer has advised that notwithstanding the introduction of new internationally sourced products, it has retained its comprehensive range of familiar Irish products and brands.  The retailer met with my officials and my colleague Minister Kelleher to outline the detail of the changes arising from the changes to its supply chain.</p>
            <p eId="para_1054">The relationships between suppliers and retailers and the contractual agreements entered into by them, as with any other parties entering contracts, is essentially a matter for the contracting parties themselves.  It is clear that there are considerably different views as to the likely impact of the changes in sourcing arrangements implemented by the retailer concerned.  Undoubtedly the relationships between suppliers and retailers are complex.  The Deputies will be aware that I requested the Competition Authority to carry out a study of the retail import/distribution sector as to how competition is working in the sector and whether any practices or methods of competition are affecting the supply of goods and services in that sector.  I received the Authority's report on the 30th April and I am examining its findings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1055">Undoubtedly in these difficult economic times, businesses and consumers are finding it more and more challenging to manage their expenditure and costs.  For businesses, there is an imperative to reduce costs and streamline operations. This has been the reality for businesses in Ireland and elsewhere for some considerable time and has brought undoubted benefits to consumers in terms of lower prices for manufactured goods.  Whilst the Government welcomes recent initiatives to reduce prices to consumers, it is mindful of the concerns that have been expressed in relation to the possible implications for employment in Ireland particularly if changes in supply chain arrangements reduce the level of purchases by retailers from Irish producers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1056">The future viability and success of the retail sector, including all its constituent parts, is vitally important to the national economy.  It is essential, therefore, that the focus of all those in the sector, whether they be suppliers, manufacturers, distributors or retailers, is on ensuring that the sector delivers in terms of providing the best value for money for consumers whilst also minimising the negative impact of the current trading conditions on employment.</p>

         her views on whether the economy here is competitive; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_513">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1058">Competitiveness has a number of dimensions and is a very broad policy area.</p>
            <p eId="para_1059">The National Competitiveness Council Annual Report for 2008 (published January 2009) Volume 1 — Benchmarking Ireland's Progress — gives an overview of Ireland's competitiveness compared to a wide range of competing economies using over 140 indicators taken from a number of competitiveness monitoring sources.  While clearly there are areas where we need to improve our position, there are many areas where Ireland performs strongly in relation to our competitors, such as business investment in enterprise, exports, the percentage of firms engaged in innovative activity, quality of life and levels of educational attainment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1060">The most objective indicator of a competitive economy is the rate of investment by the FDI sector in our country.  Last year despite the global turmoil, 2008 saw Ireland win a total of 130 foreign direct investment projects (60% of which will be located outside of Dublin), worth circa €2 billion and also saw the creation of over 8,800 new jobs during the year.  The IBM Global Location Trends Annual Report 2008 in October 2008, ranks Ireland as one of the top performers at 3rd place for attracting R&amp;D investment.  The Lisbon Council's "European Jobs and Growth" Monitor ranks Ireland the 2nd most competitive economy in Europe for 2008.  Educational attainment in Ireland has improved significantly in recent years and Ireland is also making substantial progress in strengthening its research and development capabilities.  We also have a substantial and sustained focus on our targeted capital investment programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1061">However, it is accepted that Ireland, in common with other countries, is facing the most challenging set of economic circumstances in a generation.  Because of this we are taking exceptional measures to shore up our economy for the benefit of enterprise and jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1062">Our immediate policy objectives with regard to competitiveness are to restore confidence and stability in our economy, provide supports to the enterprise sector, restore cost competitiveness, safeguard the significant achievements of recent years and ensure a return to sustainable export growth.  Under the Framework for Economic Renewal we are taking a number of measures across Government to address these objectives.  At this time I think it is also important to point out that Ireland made significant progress over the past decade in transforming our economy and building fundamental strengths, and so we enter this period of uncertainty from a strong base.</p>
            <p eId="para_1063">To help business cope with the current difficulties we have taken determined action to address the fundamental issue of access to finance for business, by way of the new code of practice for banks linked to the re-capitalisation scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1064">Cost competitiveness is also a particular focus of action.  Already there are indicators in our favour with inflation, commodity and other prices falling.  The Consumer Price Index figures released last week are an indication of falling Irish prices in a number of areas, with Ireland showing the highest cut in prices.  This brings Ireland closer in line with average EU prices, going some way towards restoring our overall cost competitiveness, but there is still a distance to go.  Price reductions of 10% and 12% respectively in electricity and gas implemented on May 1st will result in further savings for businesses, particularly in the SME sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1065">We are committed to maintain low business taxes and a favourable regulatory environment, and will ensure that our policies keep pace with the way business is changing.</p>
            <p eId="para_1066">Ireland has a track record of adaptability and flexibility.  We have made significant strides in the development of a modern 21st Century infrastructure whilst also positioning ourselves for the next stage of development as a knowledge economy.  Implementation of the actions included in the Smart Economy framework will continue to enhance and improve our competitiveness in this respect, so that we are well positioned to take advantage of the global upturn.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1069">I propose to take Questions Nos. 80 and 108 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1070">The Social Partnership Agreement ‘Towards 2016' committed to greater co-ordination between organisations concerned with employment rights compliance, with a view to realising the considerable potential for synergy that exists in this area.  In particular, the Agreement provided that authorised officers of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) would join with officers of the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Revenue Commissioners to work together to address non-compliance with employment rights legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1071">A joint investigation approach between the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA), the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners has been operational since 2007.</p>
            <p eId="para_1072">The Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2007, which came into operation on 30th March, 2007, provides for the disclosure of relevant employment data between the Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment/NERA.</p>
            <p eId="para_1073">Since the enactment of the Social Welfare and Pensions Act, 2007, exchange of information activity and joint investigation activity have taken place between the bodies in a number of specific cases.  In 2007, joint investigation activity, involving NERA for the first time, took place during the Construction Industry Campaign in May-July 2007.  In 2008, joint investigation activity was undertaken in a number of sectors including the catering, the hotel and the haulage sector.  In 2009, joint investigation activity has continued through both the exchange of information and joint inspections.</p>
            <p eId="para_1074">The three bodies are proactively promoting and encouraging joint activity at a central and local level.  I understand that a series of regional meetings were held late last year involving the relevant inspectors in those regions.  These meetings have ensured that all officers understand their respective roles and potential synergies arising from working together within the parameters set out in the legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1075">In relation to the number of inspectors, NERA currently has in place a team of 77 Inspectors.  Recruitment competitions were held to bring the number of Inspectors from the original level of 31 Inspectors up to the level of 90 committed to under Towards 2016.  60 inspectors were assigned to NERA from these competitions.  All NERA inspectors were recruited by way of competitive procedures, including internal competition within the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, competition among staff of other Government Departments and a selection process undertaken by the Public Appointments Service to recruit ten inspectors with language skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1076">14 Inspectors have left NERA over the past year as a result of promotion or internal and external Departmental transfers and re-assignments.  As a result, the total number of NERA Inspectors currently stands at 77.  Of the 77 inspectors, 2 are currently on maternity leave and are not, therefore, available for inspections and associated duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1077">All new Inspectors are required to complete the NERA Inspection Services Introductory Training Programme and to undertake further training, including on-the-job training with experienced inspectors.  This involves working with experienced Inspectors in carrying out inspections and other associated enquiries at places of work with a view to determining compliance with certain employment rights legislation.  All Inspectors have completed the Introductory Training Programme and are fully operational.</p>
            <p eId="para_1078">The Minister for Finance recently introduced a moratorium on the filling of vacancies in the Public Service until the end of 2010, which will impact on NERA in common with all other public bodies.</p>

The total allocation to my Department in the Revised Estimates is €1.938 billion gross, made up of €1.557 billion in Exchequer funding and €381 million from the National Training Fund.

            <p eId="para_1085">The Innovation Fund Ireland concept is a Department of An Taoiseach initiative and Enterprise Ireland and the NTMA have provided advice to the Department of An Taoiseach at its request on how the concept might be developed, given the experience of both agencies in the area of venture investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1086">A meeting of the Department of An Taoiseach, Department of Finance, Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Enterprise Ireland and the National Treasury Management Agency with responsibility for the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NTMA/NPRF) on 13 March 2009 agreed that Enterprise Ireland and NTMA/NPRF would collaborate to produce a workable model of the Fund for inclusion in the Department of An Taoiseach's proposal to Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1087">Separately, Enterprise Ireland continues to work with Venture Capital Funds, Business Angels and other institutions to ensure a continual flow of seed funding.

A further two Funds have received commitments and are currently fundraising. The agency remains focused on the establishment of Innovative High Potential Start Up companies and on the commercialisation of state funded research, in particular on increasing the number of spin out companies in the economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1089">Provision of monies by the Development agencies under the aegis of my Department towards job creation throughout the country is a day to day operational matter for the agencies.  I do not have any role in the day to day operational matters of these agencies.  Notwithstanding this, the agencies are aware that balanced regional development is the aim of the Government.  Over the years, every effort has been made and, indeed, continues to be made to attract industry and jobs to the Border, Midlands and West (BMW) region as well as to the rest of the country.  However, the ultimate decision as to where particular projects locate rests with the promoters of those projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_1090">The establishment of InterTradeIreland ten years ago has been of considerable assistance to the border counties.  InterTradeIreland is the North/South implementation body charged with enhancing the competitiveness of the all-island economy through the creation of trade and business development programmes and networks.  The suite of programmes on offer to companies from InterTradeIreland includes science, technology and innovation programmes, technology transfer, sales and marketing, and equity networks.  Since its establishment, over 90 companies from the border counties of Ireland, and over 110 companies from the Northern border counties, have participated in InterTradeIreland's programmes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1091">I am satisfied that the pro-enterprise strategies which we are pursuing will address the jobs situation in the border counties and in the rest of the country particularly as Ireland is currently rated as one of the most entrepreneurial countries in the EU.</p>

            <p eId="para_1095">I recently visited the West Coast of the United States from 13th to 18th April 2009 on a marketing programme organized by IDA Ireland.  IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of Foreign Direct Investment to Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_1096">The primary objective of my visit was to market Ireland as an ideal business location for US companies wishing to invest or increase their investment overseas.  It was also an opportunity to further enhance and develop the relationships Ireland has with US companies who already operate here.</p>
            <p eId="para_1097">The programme involved meeting Chairpersons, CEOs and other senior executives of leading companies in the Globally Traded Business, Clean Technology and Information &amp; Communications Technology sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1098">While many of the companies involved already have substantial and valuable activities in Ireland, I also met with companies who are considering major investments here for the first time.  The feedback from these meetings confirmed to me the high standing in which Ireland is viewed as a business location by leading global companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1099">The meetings also underlined to me the importance of steps taken by Ireland to strengthen research, education capabilities and infrastructure.</p>
            <p eId="para_1100">While no specific commitments were made in regard to new investment projects during my visit, I am not surprised at this as most major FDI projects can involve a lengthy evaluation and decision-making process.  It is often the case following such visits that a considerable number of meetings and discussions will take place between the company and IDA Ireland before the company makes a final decision on location.</p>
            <p eId="para_1101">However, I am optimistic that new investments and jobs will follow in time, particularly given the positive views expressed to me about Ireland and the high standing in which Ireland is viewed as a business location by leading global companies.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1103">As the State's Training and Employment Authority, FÁS is charged with the sole responsibility for the overall management of the Community Employment (CE) programme on a national basis.  Launched in 1994, the main objective of CE can be summarised as providing project-based work experience and personalised training for long-term unemployed and socially excluded persons in order to progress them into employment.  It has a secondary benefit in providing economic and social benefits to local communities.  It is the largest single human resource intervention undertaken by FÁS.</p>
            <p eId="para_1104">CE is operated as an active labour market programme designed to provide eligible long term unemployed people and other disadvantaged persons (including those with a disability) with an opportunity to engage in useful work within their communities on a fixed-term basis.  The programme is structured to help unemployed people to re-enter the active workforce by breaking their experience of unemployment through a return to work routine and to assist them to enhance/develop both their technical and personal skills.</p>
            <p eId="para_1105">FÁS has very successfully run this programme since its inception in 1994, assisting tens of thousands of clients into gainful employment or further training/education over this period. FÁS has built up considerable expertise in this field and has been continually improving the systems around the programme, such as the introduction of the Individual Learner Plan system for all participants in 2006.  Training modules on CE are now certified and on the National Framework of Qualifications.  For many participants this represents a major milestone in their personal development and/or skills acquisition as it is the first time they will have received any formal recognition for their learning.</p>
            <p eId="para_1106">The operational aspects of the CE programme are managed by the 8 FÁS Regions, with an overall policy-making arm covering the formulation of national policies/procedures regarding the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1107">I have no plans to transfer the CE function to the Local Authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1108">With regard to reform of FÁS structures and activities, the situation is kept under review to ensure FÁS can respond to the economic challenges facing the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_1109">I am confident that FÁS is capable of responding to the unemployment crisis we are currently facing.  To date it has been fully responsive and progressive in adapting the new activation measures I have announced since the start of the year.  For instance as a result of efficiencies and a redeployment of resources announced in the Supplementary Budget, my Department is now funding approximately 128,000 activation training and work experience places through FÁS.  This is a substantial increase on the 66,000 places, which were available at the end of last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1110">Part of this increase in provision has been achieved as FÁS has re-aligned its focus to provide a more flexible delivery of training interventions for individuals to include online, evening and blended learning training options in addition to the more traditional mix of course offerings.  The aim of these additional training places is to offer increased flexibility and flexible learning options to enable the unemployed to further develop their skill-sets and competencies to secure employment as soon as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_1111">In total in the Supplementary Budget €128m was redeployed to the activation area, which is resulting in the creation of 23,435 training and education activation places across my Department, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Education and Science.</p>
            <p eId="para_1112">Included in the Supplementary Budget are specific new innovative measures such as a work experience scheme, which will provide 2,000 six-month places to individuals who are unemployed, and it will include the placement of graduates.  A new training programme of 277 places at a cost of €1m is being introduced for sustaining vulnerable employment — under this programme 277 workers who are on a three-day week and receiving social welfare payments for the days they are not working will receive 2 days training a week for a period of a year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1113">My Department has established a Working Group consisting of the relevant Government Departments and State Agencies including FÁS to oversee the implementation of these schemes.  FÁS has played a positive and active role in these discussions and will continue to do so in relation to our response to the unemployment challenge.</p>

            <p eId="para_1118">The Government's Framework for Economic Renewal (Building Ireland's Smart Economy) incorporates a wide variety of actions to address the current economic challenges and also to focus on a return to sustainable economic growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1119">The Cabinet Committee for Economic Renewal is driving implementation and co-ordination of the overall framework, and was specifically set up for this purpose.  Across Government, we are continuing to implement the policies identified that will build on our previous achievements and address our immediate economic difficulties to restore confidence and maximise economic activity and employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1120">Within my own Department I am driving implementation of almost 100 actions identified in the Smart Economy publication falling under my responsibility, covering enterprise, labour, research and innovation and competitiveness issues.</p>
            <p eId="para_1121">The clear priorities of my Department are:</p>
            <p eId="para_1122">Measures to assist those who have lost their jobs;</p>
            <p eId="para_1123">Training and retraining;</p>
            <p eId="para_1124">Providing assistance for the enterprise sector;</p>
            <p eId="para_1125">A continued focus on pro-business and pro- enterprise policies;</p>
            <p eId="para_1126">Restoring cost competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1127">The timelines required for each action are currently being examined and will be reported to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Renewal as part of the overall SMART Economy reporting framework within the coming weeks.  It is not possible to allocate a budget for each individual action point as many actions involve other Ministers and Departments acting jointly.  The expenditure already voted for my department will be used to support the priorities outlined above.</p>
            <p eId="para_1128">We have prioritised and re-allocated the resources needed to achieve these actions.  I believe that if we are careful in using the experience of our previous successes, and continue to have a long-term strategic focus then we can once again transform Ireland back to a strong, R&amp;D driven, innovative and competitive economy.  We are committed to ensuring that the conditions are right to capitalise on opportunities which will arise when global recovery begins.</p>

         the number of vacancies which are expected to arise by the end of 2009 which will remain unfilled as a result of the circular issued by the Department of Finance on 27 March 2009 in respect of her Department and each of the State agencies or boards for which she has responsibility.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1134">It is not possible to accurately predict the number of vacancies expected to arise in my Department by the end of 2009, which will remain unfilled as a result of the circular issued by the Department of Finance on 27 March 2009, which placed a moratorium on the filling of vacancies in the Public Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1135">The only area where predictions can be made relate to those staff who will retire in accordance with the compulsory retirement scheme.  Since 27 March 2009 three staff members have retired from the Department with a further five to retire before the end of 2009.  Consequential vacancies will not be filled.</p>
            <p eId="para_1136">Additional vacancies will be created as a result of the following incentives introduced by the Minister for Finance in recent days:</p>
            <p eId="para_1137">Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement (Circular 12/09), whereby employees of 50 years of age and over who have already accrued entitlement to preserved superannuation benefits under a public service scheme, and who have not yet reached normal preserved pension age can apply for early retirement. The Scheme is open to applications from 1 May 2009 until 1 September 2009 after which the scheme will be reviewed in the context of Budget 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1138">Special Civil Service Incentive Career Break Scheme 2009 (Circular 13/2009) whereby staff can avail of applying for a three year career break and will be paid an incentive payment of a third of gross basic pay to a maximum of €12,500, per year, payable quarterly in arrears, for each year of the 3 year period of the career break incentive scheme (this figure is based on staff who work full time).</p>
            <p eId="para_1139">Both schemes will result in some staff retirements and career breaks with consequential vacancies, however at this early stage it is not possible to predict what the take up will be in relation to these schemes.</p>
            <p eId="para_1140">IAASA</p>
            <p eId="para_1141">There are currently three vacancies in IAASA which, further to the aforementioned circular, IAASA is not permitted to fill.</p>
            <p eId="para_1142">Competition Authority</p>
            <p eId="para_1143">At this moment in time, the Competition Authority can give no clear indication of the number of vacancies that might arise in 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1144">FÁS</p>
            <p eId="para_1145">The number of vacancies that are expected to arise by the end of 2009 and that will remain unfilled is 190.6 (full-time equivalent posts).</p>

            <p eId="para_1153">The number of vacancies in IDA Ireland that are expected to arise by the end of 2009 which will remain unfilled as a result of the circular will be 13 posts.</p>

            <p eId="para_1157">Shannon Development has a staff complement of 128.5.  At present there are 7 vacancies for which there can be no external recruitment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1158">A total of 3 contract staff will exit the company and not have their contacts renewed before the end of 2009.  At this point in time, it is very difficult to anticipate what additional vacancies may arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1159">Forfás</p>
            <p eId="para_1160">Forfás had 8 vacancies at the date of the Moratorium letter. 3 further vacancies have arisen since that date. A further 6 known vacancies will arise by the end of 2009.  At this point in time, it is very difficult to anticipate what additional vacancies may arise.</p>
            <p eId="para_1161">National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI)</p>

            <p eId="para_1279">I understand the Deputy is referring to legislative measures in the context of regulating the relationship between suppliers in the food sector and retailers.  While the purpose of such legislation is to control the business relationship, I am aware of concerns that an imbalance in the relationship could have a negative impact on the Irish food sector and on workers in the sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1280">In general, contract law, enforceable in the Courts, governs the terms and conditions entered into by contracting parties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1281">In so far as competition law has an effect on business relationships, this is in the form of a prohibition on anti-competitive practices including price-fixing, applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage, making the conclusion of contracts subject to acceptance by the other party of supplementary obligations which by their nature or according to commercial usage have no connections with the subject of such contracts, abusing a dominant position, requesting "hello" money and imposing resale price maintenance.</p>
            <p eId="para_1282">I am aware anecdotally of complaints against retailers abusing their relationship with suppliers and I am also aware that suppliers are reluctant to bring a formal complaint for fear of being de-listed.  I urge any supplier who considers that he or she is being treated in an anti-competitive manner to bring his or her complaint to the attention of the Competition Authority, the independent statutory agency responsible for the enforcement of competition law in the State.  Alternatively, a supplier can bring a private action to the Courts either for breach of the Competition Acts or for breach of contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_1283">In the absence of a solid complaint backed by evidence, neither the Competition Authority or the Courts, can enforce existing legislative provisions or contracts.</p>

        <b>Deputy Brian O’Shea</b>

         if her attention has been drawn to warnings from the Construction Industry Federation that some 55,000 construction jobs could be lost by the end of 2010; her views on the accuracy of the forecast; the steps she will take to try to prevent such job losses; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1285">The accuracy of forecasts, nationally and internationally, remain uncertain due to the rapidly changing economic environment.  It is however the case that there has been a significant downturn in construction related activity since the beginning of 2008.  The number of people in employment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey and published by the Central Statistics Office on a quarterly basis only.  In the fourth quarter of 2008 (September to November 2008), the most recent quarter for which data is available, there was an annual decrease in employment in the construction sector of 45,900 over the year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1286">My Department through FÁS, the National Training and Employment Authority, is currently developing a number of responses to the current slowdown in the economy as a whole, including the construction sector.  To further assist individuals through the provision of education and training opportunities FÁS are now providing a total of 128,000 training and activation places for the unemployed in 2009.  Some of these courses have been specifically developed to meet the emerging need for qualified construction workers in Sustainable Energy Technologies. There are also some courses in development, which relate to this sector such as Micro Electricity Generation, Intelligent Building Systems Control, Thermal Insulation and Passive Housing and Air Permeability Testing of Buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1287">In addition the Government has also established a training fund to provide a timely response to identified training and re-training needs for low skilled and redundant craft workers from the construction sector.  This will enable individuals to secure a speedy return to work, or where this cannot be secured, to provide relevant upskilling opportunities in order that job seekers can secure employment in alternative sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1288">My Department and FÁS are also focusing on providing retraining opportunities for redundant construction workers aimed specifically at helping redundant apprentices gain the necessary on-the-job experience, which they require in order to complete their apprenticeship.  We have initiated several measures, which will see over 3,600 redundant apprentices being able to progress their apprenticeships this year. The measures to assist redundant apprentices include the employer based rotation scheme, which will assist up to 500 individuals, the agreement between ESB Networks and FÁS to provide training opportunities to up to 400 redundant electrical apprentices and the interim changes introduced by FÁS to enable 2,000 redundant apprentices progress to their next off-the-job phase without having completed the previous on-the-job phases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1289">Finally, my Department and FÁS will also continue to work in close collaboration with the Construction Industry Federation and other key stakeholders to encourage redundant construction workers to seek re-training in skills which are in short supply in the economy.</p>

            <p eId="para_1291">The proposed tax changes outlined by the U.S. Administration on 4 May were proposals and not detailed draft legislation so it is not possible to definitively state what the effect will be for U.S. foreign direct investment in Ireland.  However, the stated intention of the Obama Administration is to target tax havens. Ireland is not a tax haven, nor is it considered as such by the U.S. Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_1292">The Minister for Finance and myself have already briefed our Cabinet colleagues on the proposed changes.  With over 450 American companies having invested over $55 billion in Ireland, we are acutely aware of the importance of any potential changes to the U.S. tax code on investment abroad.</p>
            <p eId="para_1293">A monitoring system for developments in relation to the US international tax code has been in place for a number of years. In addition, a contact group of senior officials from my Department, the Departments of Finance and Foreign Affairs, the IDA, and Revenue has been meeting to monitor ongoing developments.</p>
            <p eId="para_1294">We will continue to engage with the US Administration and with Congress as this issue develops and the initial proposal evolves into something more formal. To this end, the IDA has deployed a senior executive to the Embassy in Washington as a point person to monitor and engage with this issue.</p>

            <p eId="para_1296">Deputies will be aware that the evolution of trade union and industrial relations law in Ireland has been influenced by the provisions of our Constitution. The relevant provision is Article 40.6.1° (iii), in which "the State guarantees liberty for the exercise of. . . . the right of the citizens to form associations and unions". This guarantee, usually referred to as the freedom of association, is exercisable under the Constitution "subject to public order and morality" and, under the same Article, the Oireachtas can enact laws "for the regulation and control in the public interest" of the right.</p>
            <p eId="para_1297">The freedom of association is also guaranteed in a number of international instruments, which the State has ratified, and which it is, therefore, bound to uphold under international law. Ireland is, accordingly, bound by international obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, the European Social Charter and by Convention no 87 on Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise and Convention no 98 on the Right to Organise and to Bargain Collectively of the International Labour Organisation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1298">Ireland's system of industrial relations is based on a voluntary approach with terms and conditions of employment being determined in the main by a process of voluntary collective bargaining between the parties, without the intervention of the State. The collective bargaining process can cover the entire range of issues arising from the employment relationship. Trade unions holding a negotiating licence are free to engage in collective bargaining on wages and conditions of employment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1299">The State has sought to facilitate the voluntary process of collective bargaining through establishing, by legislation, a number of agencies to assist in the resolution of disputes, including the Labour Relations Commission / Rights Commissioner Service and the Labour Court. There are also statutory provisions designed to back up the voluntary process in areas where collective bargaining does not operate effectively. The most important provisions are those concerning Joint Labour Committees and Registered Employment Agreements.  In addition, the 2004 Enhanced Code of Practice on Voluntary Dispute Resolution and the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001, as amended by the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004, provide mechanisms for the resolution of disputes in situations where collective bargaining does not occur and where the internal dispute resolution procedures that are normally used fail to resolve the dispute.</p>
            <p eId="para_1300">The Towards 2016 Review and Transitional Agreement 2008-2009 provides for the establishment of a review process which would consider the legal and other steps necessary to enable the mechanisms that had been established under previous agreements — and in the foregoing legislation — to operate as they had been intended. A Review Group on Employee Representation has been established involving the social partners and relevant Government Departments. The Group is chaired by the Department of the Taoiseach and will hold its first meeting shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_1302">The Health and Safety Authority is responsible for the administration and enforcement of the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act 2005 and associated statutory provisions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1303">There have been 10 workplace deaths reported to the Authority to date in 2009 (as at 13.05.09). The numbers of workplace deaths reported to the Authority for the years 2002-2008 are as follows — 57 in 2008; 67 in 2007; 51 in 2006; 74 in 2005; 50 in 2004; 68 in 2003 and 61 in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1304">Non-fatal accidents, resulting in an absence of more than three days from normal work following the accident, are required to be reported to the Authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_1305">There have been 2,728 non-fatal work related accidents reported to the Authority to date in 2009 (as at 13.05.09). There were 6,998 in 2008, 7,816 in 2007, 7,844 in 2006, 8,104 in 2005, 8,453 in 2004, 6,622 in 2003, and 7,746 in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_1306">While it is not possible to be satisfied that all accidents at workplaces are reported, I am not aware that the Authority has come across evidence that suggests underreporting of workplace accidents resulting in fatalities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1307">The Health and Safety Authority's 2009 Programme of Work, which was  launched on the 3  February last, sets out a comprehensive range of activities to make workplaces safer and it contains a good balance between prevention, advice and enforcement.</p>
            <p eId="para_1308">The Authority in 2009 intends to continue to focus on the high-risk sectors of agriculture and construction, which have seen the highest proportions of fatalities in the last four years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1309">Of the 57 workplace fatalities reported to the Authority last year, the highest number (21) was in the agriculture sector, the second highest was in construction (15).</p>
            <p eId="para_1310">Day to day responsibility for workplace safety rests with those in the workplace — employers and employees and safe workplaces can ultimately only be delivered by those who control and work in them. The Health and Safety Authority is proactive in encouraging safety in all workplaces and when carrying out its inspection function, the Authority devotes a lot of its time advising as to safety at work and safe systems of work. In general, this advice is well received and it is only where there is a failure to comply with advice or a real and immediate threat to health and safety does the Authority commence enforcement procedures.</p>
            <p eId="para_1311">The Authority publishes guidelines, codes of practice and other advice on safety on a regular basis as well as organising sectoral seminars or conferences to promote the occupational safety and health message, as part of its advocacy role. These activities, together with the information on the Authority's website, are of critical importance to all those in the workplace if Ireland's safety record is to be improved.</p>

            <p eId="para_1313">There is currently a Budget provision of over €500 million for capital investment in enterprise.  This is a clear statement of our priorities on the jobs front and the investment will be aimed at the most productive sectors of our economy in relation to both indigenous industry and foreign direct investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1314">Assistance also needs to be available to companies that are basically viable but may need some additional supports.  In this regard, I recently announced a €100m Enterprise Stabilisation Fund which will enable internationally trading companies survive the current global downturn by supporting their drive to reduce costs and gain sales in overseas markets. Sustainable economic recovery will be driven by enterprises focused on increasing their exports of innovative products and services in global markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1315">Furthermore, Enterprise Ireland and the County and City Enterprise Boards are focused on supporting entrepreneurs and encouraging entrepreneurship in Ireland.  The development of Irish businesses is central to our economic recovery.  Enterprise Ireland, in recognising the significant changes in the current economy both in Ireland and globally, has prepared a new recovery strategy to identify the actions that will be undertaken to help clients in 2009. The agency has refocused its efforts on strengthening and sustaining companies of strategic importance through a range of initiatives focused on the needs of their client base and has developed a series of proposals which deal with access to finance, winning new sales, encouraging competitiveness, continuous innovation and R&amp;D, and development of entrepreneurship.</p>
            <p eId="para_1316">The level of foreign direct investment in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, is one of the highest in the world.  There are almost 1,000 companies from overseas employing approximately 136,000 people.  Even in these difficult economic times, there is still investment from abroad to be won.  While IDA Ireland's focus is on securing investment from new and existing clients in the areas of High End Manufacturing, Global Services (including Financial Services) and Research, Development and Innovation, there are three new sectors that are also being targeted — Convergence, Cleantech and Innovation/Services.  In an effort to increase investments in Ireland, the agency has expanded its personnel in the United States and has recently set up offices in India and China and continues to explore options in other economies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1317">I am confident that the pro-enterprise strategies being pursued will address the jobs situation particularly as Ireland is currently rated as one of the most entrepreneurial countries in the EU.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1320">I propose to take Questions Nos. 96 and 99 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1321">In 2008, the National Employment Rights Authority, (NERA) conducted nearly twice as many workplace inspections, as the 2007 level — almost 28,000 workplace inspections in 2008 as against just fewer than 14,500 in 2007.  This increased level of inspection activity is of course reflective of the greater level of Inspectorate resources available to NERA, which currently stand at 77 inspectors as opposed to the original level of 31 inspectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_1322">Since it commenced operations on an interim basis in 2007, NERA has had considerable success in ensuring that abuses of workers rights and entitlements do not go unchecked.  Early in 2008, NERA undertook a nationwide information and awareness campaign, which has been instrumental in bringing about a much greater level of awareness both by employers and by employees of their respective rights and obligations under employment law.  This information and awareness role continues to play a significant part in NERA's employment rights compliance and information strategy and is one that I believe will prove to be more beneficial in the longer term in bringing about a greater compliance culture.</p>
            <p eId="para_1323">NERA has carried out a total of 6,572 calls visits and inspections up to the 8th of May 2009.  This compares with 6,395 for the corresponding period in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1324">As regards the total level of breaches detected in 2008, which are reported at 4,629 in NERA's 2008 annual review, this represented a virtual doubling of the level detected in 2007 i.e. 2,344 and there is a correlation between the increase in the level of inspections undertaken and the level of breaches detected.  It must be recalled that, where breaches are detected, NERA's primary objective is to seek compliance with the relevant legislation and rectification of any breaches identified, including redress for the individual(s) concerned and payment of any arrears due to employees.</p>
            <p eId="para_1325">The Government committed in Part 2 of the 10 Year Framework Social Partnership Agreement, Towards 2016, to a series of measures to greatly increase public confidence in the system of employment law compliance.  The Employment Law Compliance Bill 2008, which has undergone its Second Stage reading in this House with further stages of the Bill in both Houses to follow shortly, is designed to give effect to those commitments upon enactment.</p>

The role of the Task Force, amongst others, is to assess the particular impact on the wider regional economy of the decision to close certain parts of the Dell plant in Limerick and associated job losses in other companies and also to carry out an analysis of the potential impact of the current economic downturn on the Mid-West Region.  As part of its analysis, the task force is meeting with and obtaining inputs from all the relevant State Development Agencies, including the IDA.  I have asked the Task Force to provide me with an interim report on their findings and this is likely to be completed shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_1508">It is also important to point out that IDA has been working diligently to secure new investments for the Region and over the last year companies like Vistakon, Zimmer, Cook, DTS and Microsemi have had announcements in the Region.  The Agency currently has a pipeline of projects under consideration. These potential investments are being pursued and IDA Ireland will do everything possible to speed up the investment decisions in Limerick's favour.</p>

            <p eId="para_1510">I met with Commissioner Kroes on 6 May 2009 and we had a very useful exchange on state aid rules.  I thanked the Commissioner for the early approval, granted by the Commission on 14 April, of an Irish scheme submitted under the Commission's Temporary Framework on State Aid.  The Framework, which was introduced in response to the global economic crisis, gives Member States increased possibilities to aid companies in a variety of forms e.g. grants, subsidised  loans.</p>
            <p eId="para_1511">The approved scheme is based on the provision in the Framework that allows aid not exceeding €500,000 to be given to companies that were not in difficulty before 1 July 2008 i.e. before the current economic crisis. The  approval of the scheme paved the way for Enterprise Ireland to provide support to companies under the Enterprise Stabilisation Fund, which is a national initiative.  The Fund will provide an additional €100m in assistance to companies to strengthen their business base.  The Fund will provide targeted support for internationally trading companies; particular attention is being  paid to supporting  viable small and medium sized enterprises engaged in exporting.  Funding will be provided primarily in repayable form.</p>

         if her attention has been drawn to the announcement of the loss of 330 jobs at a plant (details supplied) in County Kerry; the discussions she has had with the industrial development agencies with a view to securing replacement jobs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1523">On Friday 24th April, Amann announced that its plant in Tralee is to close with the loss of 215 jobs.  I am keenly aware of the impact on the employees of Amann and their families in the light of this announcement.  In many cases, such company announcements are as a result of global conditions and/or global decisions, over which we have less influence.</p>
            <p eId="para_1524">The closure announcement by the company follows the announcement in January 2009 of the loss of 120 jobs in the dyeing operations with their transfer to a new production plant in Romania.  These job losses are underway with 50 jobs lost and the remainder to go by September this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1525">The remaining labour intensive spinning and twisting operations are to cease in June and will transfer to the company's China facility over the period September 2009 to September 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_1526">I am advised that this decision is part of an overall restructuring and consolidation of the Amann operations to reduce manufacturing costs in light of the significant decline in its business due to the weakening global economy and dramatic downturn in the automotive industry.  The textile industry is extremely competitive and cost sensitive. The decline in sales is having a significant impact on its business, which relies on high volume and economies of scale to ensure its viability.</p>
            <p eId="para_1527">Amann will no longer spin in-house and will replace this with material sourced from suppliers at low cost.  The labour intensive, low value added operations of twisting and spinning can no longer be sustained in Tralee and significant cost savings are envisaged in the transfer of these operations to its facilities in lower cost countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1528">IDA has worked closely with the company to assess opportunities to sustain the plant which was highly regarded as a productive and efficient plant within the Group and met with both local and German management.  However given the cost pressures and weak demand, the company felt that it had no option but to restructure its operations to sustain the Amann group.</p>
            <p eId="para_1529">The role of FÁS, the Industrial Training agency, is particularly important in assisting those who lose their jobs.  Following the internal company consultation process, which has just commenced, FÁS have met with Amann management and staff representatives, and have formulated a plan of action to deliver the full range of FÁS services to all staff being made redundant in 2009/2010.  These services will include;</p>
            <p eId="para_1530">On-site presentations to all staff</p>
            <p eId="para_1531">Advice on setting up a resource centre, in house, i.e. to facilitate staff in career guidance needs and job search activities.</p>
            <p eId="para_1532">Provision of a range of pre-redundancy and where necessary post-redundancy training courses to assist all staff in achieving relevant skills updating, which, in turn will enable them to competitively compete in the labour market.</p>
            <p eId="para_1533">The State development agencies, including IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Shannon Development and the county Enterprise Board will continue to work, where appropriate in liaison with the local Institute of Technology, to support existing jobs and to endeavour to secure new jobs in the Tralee area.</p>

            <p eId="para_1535">My Department through FÁS, the National Training and Employment Authority, is actively working to ensure increased accessibility to the range of services and supports for all jobseekers including those who are under 20 years of age.  In light of the increase in unemployment FÁS has significantly increased the number of front-line staff, through an internal redeployment of resources, to provide direct support to jobseekers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1536">In the supplementary Budget of 7 April last I announced a number of specific activation measures including a Work Experience Scheme aimed at providing 2000 six-month work experience placements for young people, graduates and other unemployed persons who have just left college or have very limited experience of the workplace.  Discussions are ongoing between my Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs and it is expected that these discussions will be finalised in the very near future when further details will be available pertaining to this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1537">The Government is also determined to assist redundant apprentices complete their apprenticeships, many of which are under 20 years of age. We have initiated several measures, which will see over 3,600 redundant apprentices being able to progress their apprenticeships this year. The measures to assist redundant apprentices include the employer based rotation scheme, which will assist up to 500 individuals, the agreement between ESB Networks and FÁS to provide training opportunities to up to 400 redundant electrical apprentices and the interim changes introduced by FÁS to enable 2,000 redundant apprentices progress to their next off-the-job phase without having completed the previous on-the-job phases.</p>
            <p eId="para_1538">Under the Youthreach Programme FÁS also delivers 2,300 places through its Community Training Centres.  The programme is directed unemployed young early school leavers aged 15-20 who are offered the opportunity to identify and pursue viable options within adult life, and provides them with opportunities to acquire certification.</p>
            <p eId="para_1539">The Government remains intent on achieving greater capacity within existing resources to meet the on-going challenges in the labour market.  In this context we will continue to bring forward further measures to make training and education services available to a greater number of job-seekers, including those under 20 years of age, to ensure timely and comprehensive access to the full range of services provided by FÁS.</p>

            <p eId="para_1543">I am aware of suggestions that have been made by a number of commentators that amendments should be made to competition law which would allow for the introduction of a code of practice to regulate the relationship between retailers and suppliers.

            <p eId="para_1545">A properly functioning banking sector is an essential element for the maintenance and development of enterprises, especially SMEs.  A key principle of the Government actions to restore stability to the banking sector has been the recognition of the importance of business lending particularly in relation to SMEs.  Such stability will ensure that the financial institutions can actively contribute to our economic activity and particularly support our enterprise sector, thereby maintaining employment particularly employment in the SME sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_1546">The Banks' Recapitalisation Package contains a range of initiatives to directly assist our enterprise sector, including the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_1547">The recapitalised banks have committed to increasing their lending capacity to SMEs by 10% over 2008.  This should ensure that sound businesses will receive support from their banks.</p>
            <p eId="para_1548">A €100m environmental and clean energy innovation fund is also being established by each bank as well as a further €15m each to new or existing seed capital funds. Much of this funding will flow to small and medium enterprises.</p>
            <p eId="para_1549">SMEs are also covered by the Code of Conduct on Business Lending to SMEs.  This Code which was published by the Financial Regulator came into effect from 13 March 2009.  The Code lays down, inter alia, how applications for credit are to be handled, requires that each application is to be considered on its own merits, provides that collateral and personal guarantee requirements should not be unreasonable, sets out what is to happen when banks are declining or withdrawing credit, confirms what information is to be provided to customers and establishes a written complaints procedure for customers to follow when dealing with their bank.  The application of the Code will promote fairness and transparency in the treatment of SMEs by the banks and should facilitate access to credit for sustainable and productive business propositions.</p>
            <p eId="para_1550">The recapitalised banks have also agreed to pay for and co-operate with the carrying out of an Independent Review of Bank Lending to SMEs.

         her views on the Forfás report published in December 2008, which found that while retail costs are higher here, this differential could not account for the significantly higher prices being charged for many key consumer goods in the Republic of Ireland; and if she will make a statement on the matter. 
        [19840/09]

          </question>
          <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_540">
            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1557">The issue of the differentials in prices between this jurisdiction and other jurisdictions such as Northern Ireland and the UK has been a matter of concern for some time. These concerns stem from the widespread belief, particularly amongst consumers, that the benefits of the Euro's appreciation in value against Sterling are not being passed on by way of lower prices in the shops.</p>
            <p eId="para_1558">In the light of these concerns, I initiated an engagement with the retail sector to ascertain the reasons why the benefits of the Euro's appreciation were not being passed on to consumers. In the course of this ongoing engagement, I have met with the various links in the retail chain including retailers, suppliers, distributors and manufacturers. Different and indeed conflicting reasons have been proffered as to why prices in this jurisdiction are higher than in Northern Ireland and the UK. Prominent among these reasons was that the cost of doing business in Ireland was significantly higher than the cost of operating in the UK. Accordingly, I requested Forfás to carry out an analysis of the relative cost of doing business in a number of locations in the Republic, Northern Ireland and the UK.  Forfás' analysis, which was published late last year, found that whilst the cost of doing business was indeed higher in this jurisdiction, the extent of this additional cost would only justify a differential of 5-6% in prices between the south and the north. It is clear, therefore, that operating costs, whilst somewhat higher in this jurisdiction, do not account for the current level of price differentials.</p>
            <p eId="para_1559">Aside from operating cost considerations, there is considerable disagreement among the different elements of the retail chain as to reasons for the north south price differentials. In my meetings with retailers, they have strongly contended that the costs to retailers of sourcing goods in Ireland is significantly greater than the costs of sourcing such goods in Northern Ireland and the UK and that the current structure of the wholesale and distribution cost base in Ireland is preventing the benefits of the Euro's appreciation in value from being passed on to consumers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1560">Suppliers and distributors on the other hand have contended that there is a significant imbalance in the relationship between retailers and suppliers which is giving rise to suppliers being squeezed by the increasingly difficult demands being made by retailers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1561">In this regard, I recently requested the Competition Authority to carry out a study of the retail import/distribution sector as to how competition is working in the sector and whether any practices or methods of competition are affecting the supply of goods and services in that sector. I received the Authority's report on the 30th April and I am examining its findings.</p>
            <p eId="para_1562">The Government for its part is strongly of the view that it is incumbent upon all links in the retail chain to play their part in ensuring that there is the greatest degree of transparency possible as to the reasons why Irish consumers continue to pay significantly higher prices for certain consumer goods, particularly given the possible impact of these price differentials on the national economy in terms of loss of employment, loss of trade, loss of revenue to the exchequer and loss of value to the consumer.</p>

            <p eId="para_1580">To respond to the rising numbers of unemployed I have increased the capacity of the job search services within FÁS from 6,500 to 12,250 persons per month. This brings the total number of places for referrals by the Department of Social and Family Affairs to 150,000 per year.</p>
            <p eId="para_1581">My Department has through the significant redeployment of resources substantially increased the number of activation training and work experience places it funds through FÁS to 128,000.

As a result of the redeployed resources contained within the Supplementary Budget an additional 12,000 ten week and 1,800 twenty week training courses are now being provided. This means this year FÁS will have the capacity to provide 92,000 training places on their short courses. These extra places are designed to build upon the existing training and development work already undertaken by FÁS in developing new skills and competencies for the unemployed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1583">In addition in the supplementary Budget an additional 400 extra places will be provided on the Community Employment Scheme bringing the total number of places on Community Employment Scheme to 22,700.</p>

            <p eId="para_1585">The new Work Experience Scheme will provide 2,000 six-month work experience places for the unemployed and includes the placement of graduates. It is expected that participants on the Scheme will be able to keep their social welfare entitlements.</p>
            <p eId="para_1586">1,500 third level places will be provided for under the Part-Time Third Level Scheme, which will allow the unemployed participate in third level education on a part time basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_1587">277 places will be created for those in vulnerable employment. Under this Scheme workers who are on a 3 day week and receiving social welfare payments for the 2 days they are not working will receive 2 days training a week for those days.</p>
            <p eId="para_1588">The provision of a new certified training programme in the Institutes of Technology will allow an additional 700 redundant apprentices progress to other higher education training programmes or to complete their apprenticeship at a later stage.</p>

            <p eId="para_1591">I am aware anecdotally of complaints against retailers alleging abuse in their dealings with suppliers.  The business relationship between retailers and suppliers is subject to general contract law, enforceable by the Courts.  The Competition Acts 2002 to 2006 are also relevant in that they contain specific provisions prohibiting retailers from engaging in certain anti-competitive practices in their dealings with suppliers.</p>
            <p eId="para_1592">Section 4 of the Competition Act 2002 prohibits agreements, decisions and concerted practices that have as their object or effect the prevention, restriction or distortion of competition.  Anti-competitive practices such as price fixing, limiting or controlling production and markets, market sharing, applying dissimilar conditions to equivalent transactions with other trading parties (thereby placing them at a competitive disadvantage) and making the conclusion of contracts subject to the acceptance of supplementary obligations are specifically excluded.</p>
            <p eId="para_1593">However certain agreements or concerted practices entered into between two or more undertakings operating at different levels of the production or distribution chain, which relate to the conditions under which the parties may purchase, sell or resell certain goods or services within the State may fall outside the scope of section 4.  For example, non-exclusive distribution agreements whereby the supplier agrees with the buyer to supply the contract goods or services to the buyer for a certain territory but without any restriction on supplying other buyers within that territory are deemed to be outside the scope of section 4.  Certain agreements and practices can avail of a block exemption from competition rules, others require assessment on a case by case basis while hard-core anti-competitive practices e.g. price fixing is always prohibited.</p>
            <p eId="para_1594">Section 5 of the 2002 Act prohibits abuse of a dominant position.  The creation or existence of a dominant position does not breach the Competition Acts, rather it is the abuse of that position that constitutes the breach.</p>
            <p eId="para_1595">The Competition (Amendment) Act 2006 strengthens the provisions of the 2002 Act by prohibiting:</p>
            <p eId="para_1596">the imposition of resale price maintenance in regard to the supply of grocery goods (resale price maintenance is the practice whereby manufacturers or suppliers specify the minimum prices at which their goods may be resold);</p>
            <p eId="para_1597">unfair discrimination in regard to the supply of grocery goods. This is a reference to a supplier offering preferential terms to one buyer over another even though the transactions involved are equivalent in nature;</p>
            <p eId="para_1598">retailers or wholesalers of grocery goods from compelling or coercing suppliers into payment of advertising allowances (eg. where a retailer seeks payment from a supplier in order to advertise the supplier's goods as a means of attracting customers to the retailer's premises);</p>
            <p eId="para_1599">retailers from compelling or coercing suppliers into payment of ‘hello' money (i.e. where a retailer demands a payment from a supplier before agreeing to stock that supplier's products). The circumstances in which the practice will be prohibited include on the opening of a new store, an extension to an existing store or a change of ownership of a store.</p>
            <p eId="para_1600">The legislation provides for the investigation of a breach by the Competition Authority and for prosecution on indictment by the DPP.  Alternatively, aggrieved suppliers may take a private action for relief by way of injunction, declaration or damages including exemplary damages.  Should the Deputy have any evidence of undertakings in the retail sector engaging in prohibited practices, I would urge him to bring such evidence to the attention of the Competition Authority in order that it may be investigated fully.</p>

            <p eId="para_1602">There are currently a total of eight EU Directives due to be transposed by my Department up to 2012.  Two of these Directives are currently overdue, namely Directive 2006/43/EC on statutory audits of annual and consolidated accounts and Directive 2006/46/EC on company reporting.  My Department aims to transpose these Directives by 31 May and 30 June 2009 respectively.</p>
            <p eId="para_1603">Full details on the state of play of all current EU Directives due for transposition are maintained on the Department's website, www.entemp.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_1604">My Department has received 25 Reasoned Opinions from the European Commission relating to Directives since 2002. All but one of the outstanding issues have been settled satisfactorily.  The remaining issue concerns overdue Directive 2006/43/EC, which, as I have already stated, my Department is aiming to transpose by the end of May 2009.</p>
            <p eId="para_1605">The transposition of EU Directives is an ongoing priority in my Department and is reported to the Management Board on a regular basis.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1610">I propose to take Questions Nos. 114 and 138 to 140, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_1611">In the course of my recent Trade Mission to Riyadh and Jeddah in Saudi Arabia and to Doha in Qatar, on which I led 64 Irish companies, I officiated at a range of events and high level meetings to strengthen relationships with key contacts in the Saudi Arabian and Qatari markets and to raise the profile of Ireland as a source of quality innovative goods and services.</p>
            <p eId="para_1612">In addition, Enterprise Ireland organised about 1,500 one-to-one and sectoral group meetings with existing and potential customers for these companies. The majority of these were in the engineering, project management and environmental services sectors and many of the Irish companies also subsequently held follow-on meetings. A number of companies and organisations made announcements of agreements reached during the Mission and further progress will be made in the near future as further contracts are secured.</p>
            <p eId="para_1613">This Mission was particularly significant as many economies in the Gulf region are very vibrant, with substantial opportunities for our internationally traded services companies. The Governments of Saudi Arabia and Qatar are investing heavily in their economies in many sectors where Irish companies have innovative solutions and can provide value added expertise, products and services, with built-in flexibility and, above all, value for money. The issue of cost, per se, was not the focus of attention.</p>
            <p eId="para_1614">The Irish companies were recognised as being well positioned to compete on these markets on the basis of highly differentiated products and services that offer unquestionable value for money.</p>
            <p eId="para_1615">I am very confident that the work undertaken on this trade mission will lead to the further expansion of Irish exports to this region.</p>
            <p eId="para_1616">The main purpose of the mission was to identify and secure business opportunities for Irish exporters to the Gulf. Nevertheless, I took the opportunity to raise awareness in these emerging markets that Ireland is an attractive location for foreign investors. In fact, I found that there was a high level of awareness of our track record in securing major investments from many of the world leading multi-nationals, over many years.</p>
            <p eId="para_1617">In relation to the position of Irish exports on world markets, I welcome this opportunity to set out the factual position. Contrary to what is claimed by some commentators, Ireland's Export performance has been very impressive in recent times.  Data for 2008 shows that our total exports were €153.8bn; a fall of less than 1% on 2007 and our trade surplus was a very healthy €21.4bn. This was a very noteworthy performance, when account is taken of the global recession and the strength of the Euro against both the US Dollar and Sterling, as the US and Britain are our two largest export markets. In addition, we have achieved considerable success in developing new markets, with significant export growth achieved to China, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Brazil and some of the new EU Member States.</p>
            <p eId="para_1618">Further evidence of Ireland's strong performance is illustrated by the fact that Ireland's share of EU exports increased from 2.2% for the quarter Nov. 07 — Jan. 08 to 2.5% for the same period a year later and in January 2009 it stood at 2.7%. The level of exports from the EU as a whole, actually fell significantly — down 23.9% in the quarter December 2008 — February 2009, so our performance is even more remarkable in that context.</p>

            <p eId="para_1683">The economic downturn has seen a huge acceleration in the number of companies forced to take measures to cut staff costs including that of making staff redundant.  This in turn has placed unprecedented demands on the Redundancy Payment Section of the Department in that, in the first four months of 2009 alone, the number of new claims lodged exceeds the equivalent of that lodged for the full year 2007 i.e. 27,983 new claims lodged in the period to end April as against 25,459 for the whole of 2007.  The number of claims received is averaging 1,600 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_1684">I am acutely aware of the difficulties which the inability to deliver an acceptable turnaround of redundancy rebate payments is giving rise to for both individual employees and the business community and am taking steps to address the issues.  Since the start of 2009, I have allocated 19 new staff members to the Redundancy Payments Section of my Department.  In addition, I have made arrangements that the information centre of the National Employment Rights Authority (NERA) will take all redundancy-specific calls to enable the staff in the Redundancy Payments Unit to concentrate on and prioritise the processing of redundancy payment claims.</p>
            <p eId="para_1685">Currently the Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is dealing with rebate claims submitted on-line in December 2008 and those submitted manually in November 2008.  Correctly completed lump sums applications received together with the required supporting documentation i.e audited accounts, current statement of affairs and confirmation from the company accountant that the company is insolvent are being processed within six-eight weeks of receipt.</p>
            <p eId="para_1686">I can assure the Deputy that this matter is under constant review in my Department and that every effort is being made to deal with an increasing backlog in an attempt to ensure that claimants get the best possible service at, what is for them, a very difficult time.</p>

            <p eId="para_1706">There is currently a budget provision of over €500 million for capital investment in enterprise.  This is a clear statement of our priorities in relation to job creation and employment sustainability and the investment will be aimed at the most productive sectors of our economy in relation to both indigenous industry and foreign direct investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_1707">Assistance also needs to be available to companies that are basically viable but may need some additional supports in order to sustain employment.  In this regard, I recently announced a €100 million Enterprise Stabilisation Fund which will enable internationally trading companies survive the current global downturn by supporting their drive to reduce costs and gain sales in overseas markets.  Sustainable economic recovery will be driven by enterprises focused on increasing their exports of innovative products and services in global markets.</p>
            <p eId="para_1708">Furthermore, Enterprise Ireland and the County and City Enterprise Boards are focused on supporting entrepreneurs and encouraging entrepreneurship in Ireland.  The development of Irish businesses is central to our economic recovery.  Enterprise Ireland, in recognising the significant changes in the current economy both in Ireland and globally, has prepared a new recovery strategy to identify the actions that will be undertaken to help clients in 2009.  The agency has refocused its efforts on strengthening and sustaining companies of strategic importance through a range of initiatives focused on the needs of their client base and has developed a series of proposals which deal with access to finance, winning new sales, encouraging competitiveness, continuous innovation and R&amp;D, and development of entrepreneurship.</p>
            <p eId="para_1709">The level of foreign direct investment in Ireland, relative to the size of the economy, is one of the highest in the world.  There are almost 1,000 companies from overseas employing approximately 136,000 people.  Even in these difficult economic times, there is still investment from abroad to be won.  While IDA Ireland's focus is on securing investment from new and existing clients in the areas of High End Manufacturing, Global Services (including Financial Services) and Research, Development and Innovation, there are three new sectors that are also being targeted — Convergence, Cleantech and Innovation/Services.  In an effort to increase investments in Ireland, the agency has expanded its personnel in the United States and has recently set up offices in India and China and continues to explore options in other economies.</p>

            <p eId="para_1712">Data on the cost of average industrial job creation is not available.  However, the Forfás annual employment survey calculates the cost per job sustained in respect of both Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland.  The figure is calculated by taking into account all agency expenditure to all firms. Only jobs created during and sustained to the end of each seven-year period are credited in the calculations.  In the case of Enterprise Ireland, the estimated average cost per job sustained for the period 2002-2008 was €8,235.  The estimated cost per job sustained in IDA supported companies for the same period was €13,202. This represents an overall average of €10,569.</p>
            <p eId="para_1713">A different system is used by the City and County Enterprise Boards (CEBs) to calculate cost per job data.  The estimated overall average cost per net job created in companies assisted by these boards, since their inception in 1993 to end 2008, is €5,949.00.</p>
            <p eId="para_1714">It is not possible to produce meaningful data to compare cost per job across different countries, as public spending on factors such as infrastructure or education, costs such as energy or wage costs, as well as the skills base of the workers, are all factors contributing to overall competitiveness which in turn determines the number of jobs in the internationally traded sector in each country.</p>

            <p eId="para_1716">As a small, open, export-led economy, our best response to the realities of globalisation is to ensure that Ireland remains attractive for investment and enterprise growth.  Our enterprise support policies have consistently evolved to meet the needs of both foreign direct investment (FDI) and growth-orientated indigenous firms.</p>
            <p eId="para_1717">We have ensured that Ireland can offer the skills, education, research and innovation capabilities that modern mobile and indigenous firms need to be competitive in world markets.  In recent years, Ireland has undergone a transformation from a low wage-low cost economy towards a high value and knowledge-based one.  Arising from this transformation, the nature of FDI has changed and Ireland is now successfully competing for premium mobile investments against the most advanced countries in the world.</p>
            <p eId="para_1718">Ireland continues to be one of the most attractive places in the world as a location for global business.  Low wage costs are no longer an enticement but have been replaced by other attractions such as a benign tax and regulatory environment, a highly educated workforce, an improving infrastructure and a commitment to world-class standards of research, development and innovation.  These, combined with our can-do, responsive and open attitude, ensure that we remain a location of choice.  By utilising these competitive strengths, our policies have been successful as many foreign companies continue to make significant investment in Ireland and in the skills of our labour force.</p>
            <p eId="para_1719">The most objective indicator of a competitive economy is the rate of investment by the FDI sector in our country.  We have a firm focus on ensuring that we win for Ireland the leading companies that are at the forefront of global products and services.  Last year despite the global turmoil, 2008 saw Ireland win a total of 130 foreign direct investment projects (60% of which will be located outside of Dublin), worth circa €2 billion and also saw the creation of over 8,800 new jobs.</p>
            <p eId="para_1720">The IBM Global Location Trends Annual Report 2008 in October 2008, ranks Ireland as one of the top performers at third place for attracting R&amp;D investment.  The Lisbon Council's "European Jobs and Growth" Monitor ranks Ireland the second most competitive economy in Europe for 2008.  Educational attainment in Ireland has increased significantly in recent years and Ireland is also making substantial progress in strengthening its research and development capabilities.  We also have a substantial and sustained focus on our targeted capital investment programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1721">Given the changes taking place in world trade and the opportunities arising from more open markets, the essential conditions which we are focused on for competitive advantage are constant skill development, innovation and ensuring that Ireland is an attractive place to conduct business.</p>
            <p eId="para_1722">Growth rates in Irish labour costs slowed significantly in 2008 and were lower than the EU average, with average wage inflation falling significantly across all sectors (excluding utilities) during the year.  Indeed, there has been a rapid adjustment of wage and price levels.  Public service wage rates reduced by 7.5% on average in February.  Private sector pay rates are also declining.  According to EU projections, unit labour costs will fall by 4% this year, compared with a 3% increase in the EU on average.  That translates into a significant improvement in competitiveness and is positioning the economy for future growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1723">Ireland has a track record of adjusting and showing its flexibility.  We have made significant strides in the development of a modern 21st century infrastructure whilst also positioning ourselves for the next stage of development as a knowledge economy.  Implementation of the actions included in the Smart Economy framework will continue to enhance and improve our competitiveness in this respect.</p>

         the extent to which she has studied the level of imports from low cost economies; the degree to which this has resulted in displacement of Irish jobs; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1725">Ireland's imports from the larger trading economies in Asia have actually fallen considerably in the last year.  During the period 2007-2008, merchandise imports from the key Asian lower cost economies of China, India, Taiwan, Singapore and Malaysia have fallen overall by 21% from €7.2 Billion in 2007 to €5.7 Billion in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_1726">Many of the job losses in the economy in recent months are related to weakening in demand at global level and other factors.  Maintaining Ireland's attractiveness as a competitive and profitable European location from which to do business is a key priority for the Government and my Department's enterprise support policies clearly reflect this commitment.  Ireland still remains an attractive location for high-end, skill-intensive manufacturing and services operations.</p>
            <p eId="para_1727">Our policies have led us to develop new competitive strengths and advantages.  Improving our standard of living and competitiveness requires a focus on contemporary economic strengths, moving up the value-chain and attracting high-grade investment that rewards a highly educated workforce with commensurate attractive incomes.  We have placed a high priority on ensuring that Ireland aligns its business supports and competitive characteristics to the requirements of doing business here.</p>
            <p eId="para_1728">It is to be expected that, in a small open economy such as ours, sections of the Irish enterprise base will face competition on the domestic market from overseas competition.  My Department and its agencies are acutely aware of the imperative to help build firms of both scale and importance in higher value added sectors of global trade.  Our focus is firmly concentrated on implementing the best possible blend of policies to strengthen both national and firm level competitiveness.  Our response to this challenge is strategic yet reflects the business needs of companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1729">The challenge for Ireland is to attract and retain the high end, higher value added operations that are typified by higher output, improved productivity and greater returns to labour.  These operations will ultimately provide longer lasting and higher quality jobs.  In all of the measures which we have already undertaken, or are in the process of bringing to the point of delivery, the key concern of Government is to protect businesses, sustain employment and to support those who have lost their jobs through retraining and other supports.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Mary Coughlan)</from>
            <p eId="para_1731">Ireland has consistently been ranked higher as an economy in which it is easy to do business.  This has seen the growth of a large number of successful new exporting companies.</p>
            <p eId="para_1732">According to the World Bank, Ireland is a leader in having the lowest cost for setting up a business.  Ireland is also perceived as lightly regulated, which in itself, lowers costs for business.  Ireland also has the third lowest rate in the EU of corporation tax, which lightens the tax burden on business and gives them an advantage over competitor countries.</p>
            <p eId="para_1733">We have an open, pro-enterprise and pro-business economy.  However, current trading conditions for companies are difficult and challenging due to a number of factors including the devaluation of sterling, tough competition, and the global recession.  Some issues are outside the control of Government as a whole, but where possible we are addressing Ireland's cost competitiveness as an essential element of our economic recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_1734">Recently published indicators are in our favour with inflation, commodity and other prices falling.  The Consumer Price Index figures released last week are an indication of falling Irish prices in a number of areas, with Ireland showing the highest cut in prices.  This brings Ireland closer into line with average EU prices, going some way towards restoring our overall cost competitiveness.</p>
            <p eId="para_1735">Growth rates in Irish labour costs slowed significantly in 2008 and were lower than the EU average, with average wage inflation falling significantly across all sectors (excluding utilities) during the year.  Indeed, there has been a rapid adjustment of wage and price levels.  Public service wage rates reduced by 7.5% on average in February.  Private sector pay rates are also declining.  According to EU projections, unit labour costs will fall by 4% this year, compared with a 3% increase in the EU on average.  That translates into a significant improvement in competitiveness and is positioning the economy for future growth.</p>
            <p eId="para_1736">In relation to the position of Irish exports on world markets, I welcome this opportunity to set out the factual position.  Our manufacturing and services sectors are very successful on global export markets.  Indeed, contrary to the impression given by some commentators, Ireland's export performance has been very impressive even during the current economic difficulties.  Data for 2008 shows that our total exports were €153.8 billion; a fall of less than 1% on 2007 and our trade surplus was a very healthy €21.4 billion.  This was a very noteworthy performance, when account is taken of the global recession and the adverse exchange rate between the Euro and both the US dollar and sterling, as the US and Britain are our two largest export markets.  In addition, we have achieved considerable success in developing new markets, with significant export growth achieved to China, Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Brazil and some of the new EU member states.</p>
            <p eId="para_1737">Further evidence of Ireland's strong performance is illustrated by the fact that Ireland's share of EU exports increased from 2.2% for the quarter November 2007-January 2008 to 2.5% for the same period a year later and in January 2009 it stood at 2.7%.  The level of exports from the EU as whole, actually fell significantly — down 23.9% in the quarter December 2008-February 2009, so our performance is even more remarkable in that context.</p>

            <p eId="para_1739">The number of people in employment is measured by the Quarterly National Household Survey or QNHS and published by the Central Statistics Office on a quarterly basis only.  In the fourth quarter of 2008, the most recent quarter for which data is available, there was an annual decrease in employment of 86,900 or 4.1% while unemployment increased by 69,600 over the same period.</p>

            <p eId="para_1774">Since the announcement by SR Technics on 12 February this year IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland have worked with SR Technics in order to find the best possible solution.  IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland established a team to market the operation internationally through their overseas office network and received over 16 expressions of interest in the facility.  The team contacted the companies to evaluate their level of interest in the operation and to encourage them to put forward investment proposals to take over all or part of the operation.</p>
            <p eId="para_1775">In all, SR Technics received over 30 expressions of interest in the operation and received five bids from interested parties for parts of the business and carried out their assessment on those bids.  It was intended that, following the assessment process, SR Technics would select a successful bidder following which the State agencies, IDA Ireland or Enterprise Ireland, would evaluate the proposal to ascertain if the agencies could support the proposal submitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1776">I will continue to work with the IDA, Enterprise Ireland and the Dublin Airport Authority as well as the remaining bidders and any other interested parties to maximise the employment opportunities at the plant in addition to the 250 plus jobs which will remain in line maintenance and design.</p>

            <p eId="para_1778">An application in respect of the above named was received in the Employment Permits Section on 2 December 2008.  This application was refused on the grounds that there was insufficient evidence that the position could not be filled from within the EEA.  In this regard, the required newspaper advertisements for three days in both local and national newspapers were not submitted in support of the application.</p>
            <p eId="para_1779">The applicant was notified of this decision in writing by letter dated 9 January 2009 and of their right to appeal within 21 days.  No such appeal was received in the Employment Permits Section.  Should the prospective employer or employee wish to make a new application for a work permit, it will be considered on its merits.</p>

         if he will investigate, through the Office of Public works, the risk of flooding to residents at Frederick Street, Clara, County Offaly, whose houses are in close proximity to the River Brosna; if, in conjunction with other State agencies, an emergency flood alert telephone number will be made available; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_1932">The River Brosna at Clara forms part of the Brosna Catchment Drainage Scheme, which is maintained by the Office of Public Works under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945.  The OPW monitor the condition of the channel, and maintenance work is carried out as required.  The OPW is not aware of flooding at the location referred to that was caused by this channel.</p>
            <p eId="para_1933">The OPW understands that there was a recent incident of pluvial flooding, due to failure of the surface water system.  Responding to such incidents and addressing the cause would primarily be a matter for the local authority.  However, if details of the problem are provided, the OPW will consult with Offaly County Council with a view to having the matter investigated further.</p>
            <p eId="para_1934">OPW, in conjunction with local authorities and other State bodies, is currently undertaking a programme of catchment flood risk assessment and management studies that will, by 2015, identify areas of the country at risk from flooding and will, where the risk is significant, set out mitigating measures, including flood warning systems where appropriate.  Emergency response would be a matter for the local authority.</p>

The terms of reference of the Commission on Taxation are broadly defined, far reaching and allow for consideration of all aspects of the Irish taxation system.  As part of its terms of reference, and as I mentioned in my supplementary budget speech on 7 April last, the Commission is examining various aspects of pension tax treatment, including the treatment of retirement lump sum payments.  I am not aware of the particular options being considered by the Commission in this regard but I expect to be dealing with its recommendations in this and other matters in the 2010 budget in December next.</p>

            <p eId="para_1938">Public servants who are members of public service pension schemes or are entitled to a benefit under such a scheme or receive a payment in lieu of membership in such a scheme are liable to pay the pension-related deduction legislated for in the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009.  Any questions on the precise details of an employee's superannuation terms and conditions can be raised with the individual's  employer.</p>
            <p eId="para_1939">In some areas of the public service employees outside the pension scheme receive a gratuity or other payment.  Those public servants are in receipt of a payment in lieu of membership of a pension scheme and as such would be liable.</p>
            <p eId="para_1940">I would add that section 6 of the Act provides for a refund of the deduction in certain circumstances.  This should reassure those on short-term non-renewable contracts who may be concerned about accruing no pension benefit at the expiry of their contract due to insufficient service.  A deduction refund may be payable provided that the departing employee has accrued no benefits under any public service pension scheme, has not received a payment in lieu of scheme membership and has not transferred the service to another public service pension scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_1941">Under section 7 of the Act, no additional pension benefit is conferred by the deduction and no option to join a scheme arises under the Act.</p>
            <p eId="para_1942">The pension-related deduction is required at a time of great pressure on the public finances and takes account of the valuable pension benefits available to public servants.  In light of all the above factors, I am satisfied that it is fair and appropriate that public servants are subject to the pension-related deduction.  In order to ameliorate the impact of the deduction (with a partial offset by an increase on earnings above €60,000) I announced, in the supplementary budget of 7 April 2009, a change to the structure of the deduction which exempts the first €15,000 of earnings.</p>

            <p eId="para_1966">Introduction</p>
            <p eId="para_1967">This Office Notice sets out OPW policy in relation to the accepting or giving of gifts. These local rules have been drafted by the OPW Partnership Committee. This Office Notice does not purport to be a legal interpretation of the relevant legislation or Official Circulars. Clarification of any point may be obtained from Personnel &amp; Development Division.</p>
            <p eId="para_1968">Current Position</p>
            <p eId="para_1969">The general rules and guidelines are contained in Department of Finance Circular 15/79: Official Secrecy and Integrity (which basically restated the legislative position set out in the Prevention of Corruption Acts, 1889 to 1916) and the Ethics in Public Office Act, 1995. More recently, within the context of the major modernisation programme which the civil service is currently undergoing under the Strategic Management Initiative, a Civil Service Code of Standards and Behaviour has been drafted to consolidate and clarify the existing rules governing the behaviour of civil servants along with addressing more recent challenges which have arisen as a result of the changing environment in which civil servants work. Among the issues which need to be addressed are the offer of gifts and hospitality. There will be consultation with the civil service unions on the content of the draft Code and it will also be considered by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_1970">Against this background and conscious of the OPW's increasingly commercial role as outlined below, the Board has decided that the following rules shall apply to all OPW staff with immediate effect. It should be noted that these local rules are formulated within the framework of the existing general guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_1971">OPW POLICY</p>
            <p eId="para_1972">Special Position of OPW</p>
            <p eId="para_1973">While it is essential that all civil and public servants should adhere to the highest possible ethical standards and integrity in the performance of their official duties, it is considered that there is an even greater onus on OPW — because of its increasingly commercial role as a major player in the property, construction and procurement markets — to be seen to operate to the highest standards of administrative transparency, integrity, impartiality and fairness in all its business dealings with outside parties and customers. More than most other civil service Departments and Offices, OPW is involved in decisions with regard to purchasing goods, commodities or services, awarding contracts and selecting vendors and contractors. For this reason, all OPW staff have an even greater responsibility to be seen to conduct themselves, in the course of their duties, in a manner which will hold the respect, trust and confidence of the public. Each member of staff should declare in writing to the Board any potential conflict of interest that might affect their impartiality in carrying out their duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1974">Acceptance of Gifts, Favours and Hospitality</p>
            <p eId="para_1975">It should be noted that, under the Prevention of Corruption Acts 1889-1916 as amended by the Ethics in Public Office Act 1995, the corrupt giving of gifts to, or receipt of gifts by, civil servants is a criminal offence punishable by imprisonment or fine or both. The Acts provide that money, gifts or other consideration received by a civil servant from a person holding or seeking to obtain a contract from a Government Department is deemed to have been received corruptly unless the contrary is proved.</p>
            <p eId="para_1976">A member of staff should not accept, or agree to accept, for themselves or any other person, or have accepted on their behalf, any gift, favour, service, or any thing of value which might create the impression that it was given or offered for the purpose of influencing them in the discharge of their official duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_1977">Gifts of cash or cash vouchers may not be accepted regardless of the amount.</p>
            <p eId="para_1978">Invitations by suppliers or contractors to lunch, dinner or other hospitality shall not be accepted unless the OPW officer is discussing or representing a specific OPW interest. So as to allow interaction with suppliers and contractors at major annual events where OPW interests are not paramount, such as the annual dinners of professional bodies like the C.I.F., Master Builders, Irish Property &amp; Facilities Managers Association, R.I.C.S. etc., the Board will fund an OPW table at the function. OPW staff should decline invitations to be guests at the table of a specific company or firm. However, OPW personnel may accept invitations by the professional body or association hosting the annual dinner to be guests at the top table.</p>
            <p eId="para_1979">Invitations to receptions may be accepted where the reception is being hosted by a national or representative body or where there are genuine grounds for believing that the OPW may have a possible business interest or professional advantage in attending the reception.</p>
            <p eId="para_1980">OPW staff who participate at a conference, convention, symposium, forum, dinner or similar event, as a speaker or panel participant representing OPW interests, must surrender any fee received to OPW. Likewise, any expenses received for transportation or travel to the event must also be surrendered to OPW and a claim for standard civil service expenses submitted.</p>
            <p eId="para_1981">Invitations by suppliers or contractors to sporting/entertainment events should be declined.</p>
            <p eId="para_1982">Hospitality involving travel or holidays should be declined.</p>
            <p eId="para_1983">If in any doubt about an offer of hospitality, the officer to whom the offer is made should report the offer to the Head of his/her Division for direction.</p>
            <p eId="para_1984">All gifts, favours, services, or any thing of value received as an OPW employee must be returned by the member of staff concerned to the donor or should be handed over to the Office or given to an appropriate charity and the donor so informed.</p>
            <p eId="para_1985">Unsolicited gifts of nominal value (i.e. complimentary articles of a promotional nature offered to the public in general e.g. calendars, diaries, pens and other similar articles) may be retained by the member of staff or the Office for general use provided it does not create a perception of a conflict of interest. Example: an appearance of a conflict of interest may be created in the eyes of outside parties if an OPW officer whose duties include the assessment and selection of tenders uses a pocket diary conspicuously marked with the name of a company which tenders for OPW business or displays a wall calendar from a vendor thereby creating the impression of an endorsement (if in any doubt, Personnel should be consulted).</p>

            <p eId="para_2037">I propose to take Questions Nos. 165, 228 and 236 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2038">The Health Service Executive is fully aware of the financial challenges being faced by Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin and is involved in ongoing discussions with hospital management regarding its 2009 financial allocation and Service Plan.  The priority is to ensure that services are maintained at an optimum level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2039">Each hospital funded by the HSE is required to deliver services within the financial allocation provided.  The 2009 allocation to Our Lady's Children's Hospital is €139.6m.  The allocation has increased by over €38m or 39% since 2004. In line with budgetary constraints across the system, the 2009 allocation is 3% below the 2008 allocation of €143.8m.</p>
            <p eId="para_2040">In the first three months of this year there were 2,745 treatments for children as in-patients and 3,841 treatments for children as day cases in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  This represents 244 more treatments for children than during the same period in 2008.  There were also 21,252 attendances in the Out Patients' Department, an increase of 1041 over the same period last year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2041">The HSE has advised that, based on the financial performance for the first quarter of 2009, the hospital should achieve a break even position at year end. This assessment takes account of cost saving measures totalling €6.5m which have been agreed with the hospital, and which are to be implemented over the remainder of the year.  Much of the focus of the discussions between hospital management and the HSE has been on ensuring that all areas of non-pay expenditure are critically examined and that costs are reduced where possible.  It has also proven necessary to take measures to reduce activity, including the closure of a theatre and a ward from this month.  However, the hospital has confirmed that it is committed to delivering on the full level of its service plan commitments for 2009.</p>

A public consultation on this proposal was held by my Department in 2008.  Heads of a Bill are being prepared for consideration by Government to regulate the use of sunbeds, in particular prohibiting their use by those under eighteen years.  The proposals also provide for the placing of warning notices in sunbed salons and other places where sunbeds are available for use by the public.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Deputy Barry Andrews)</from>
            <p eId="para_2055">As the Deputy is aware, the National Children's Strategy, published November 2000, is intended to bring a better focus and greater impact to Government activity in relation to children through stronger leadership and co-ordination.</p>
            <p eId="para_2056">The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs (OMCYA) has the lead role in monitoring the implementation of the National Children's Strategy.  Monitoring mechanisms continue to evolve since the publication of the strategy in 2000.  Monitoring takes the form of reports prepared for the National Children's Advisory Council (NCAC), regular updates on ‘Towards 2016' commitments to the Social Partners, commitments under international conventions such as the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and other ad hoc reporting, as required.  The establishment of the National Children's Strategy Implementation Group (NCSIG) is also relevant in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2057">This Group, chaired by the OMCYA, will support the implementation of the National Children's Strategy as underpinned in the Social Partnership Agreement — ‘Towards 2016'.  The NCSIG will represent the national level implementation and monitoring structure that will support the multi-agency Children's Services Committees (CSCs) that are being established within each of the City/County Development Boards.  It is also intended that the NCSIG will participate in the development of a second National Children's Strategy in the light of experience gained from the first Strategy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2058">The National Children's Advisory Council (NCAC) was initially established in May, 2001, as one of the new structures under the National Children's Strategy, 2000–2010.  Its primary functions, among other things, as set out in the Strategy, include contributing to the monitoring and evaluation of the implementation of the Strategy at national and local level.</p>
            <p eId="para_2059">A mid-term review of progress made on implementing the Strategy was carried out by the National Children's Advisory Council in 2006.  This review indicated that, while there had been significant progress made on many aspects of the Strategy, a renewed impetus was required on implementing other areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2060">Following the completion of this review, the Council expressed its opinion that the mechanisms and the reports generated were not sufficiently interactive to allow for a constructive debate on topics of importance.  The Council was further of the view that a new means of engagement with Departments and Agencies was required in order to fully appreciate the scope of challenges and opportunities that were presenting.</p>
            <p eId="para_2061">In 2008, a new monitoring mechanism of the NCAC — a face-to-face dialogue on key issues with relevant Government Departments and Agencies — was introduced.  Bilateral meetings were held on identified key themes with the Departments of Education and Science; Justice, Equality and Law Reform, and Social and Family Affairs.  Details of these meetings are to be found in the Council's "End of Term 2005–2008" report, supplied to the Deputy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2062">The term of the most recent NCAC expired in mid-2008.  I have approved, in principle, the re-constitution of the NCAC — subject to a small number of matters being resolved.  I anticipate appointing a new Council shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_2064">As the Deputy will be aware I have responsibility for the National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP) and for the recently-announced scheme to provide a free pre-school year in early childhood care and education (ECCE).</p>
            <p eId="para_2065">By the end of 2007, almost 40,000 new childcare places had been created under the Exchequer/EU co-funded Equal Opportunities Childcare Programme (EOCP).  The National Childcare Investment Programme 2006-2010 (NCIP), the successor Programme to the NCIP, was introduced in 2006.  The NCIP was designed to build on the EOCP investment, with its main objective being to increase the number of childcare places by a further 50,000.</p>
            <p eId="para_2066">By the end of 2008, approximately €180m of the NCIP's capital allocation of €358m had been committed.  In light of the current economic climate, no further capital commitments are being entered into.  It is anticipated that by 2010 capital expenditure under the NCIP will have resulted in the creation of 25,000 additional childcare places.  More than 10,000 of these places are for pre-school children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2067">The Government has invested in the region of €1 billion over the last decade in developing the childcare infrastructure.  More than 70,000 additional childcare places will have been created by this investment by 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2068">Other than those funded under the investment programmes which I have referred to, I do not have details in relation to the total number of childcare places currently available.  However, officials in the Childcare Directorate of my Office will be undertaking a census of the almost 4,700 pre-school services notified to the Heath Service Executive in September of this year and this should provide information in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2069">I have received many representations from childcare facilities in recent months reporting vacancy rates of up to 25% due to the economic downturn.  I am also aware of a number of people, many of whom are qualified childcare workers, who are now considering investing in a childcare business as the new pre-school scheme will provide a degree of certainty which exists in very few areas today.  In addition, many childcare services which to date have only operated in the mornings, are now considering offering an additional session to meet an increase in local demand.  I am confident, therefore, that, except in exceptional cases, any parent who wishes to avail of a pre-school place for their child will be in a position to do so.</p>

            <p eId="para_2071">The objective of the Primary Childhood Immunisation Programme is to achieve vaccine uptake levels of 95% as recommended by the World Health Organisation.  This is the rate required to provide population immunity and to protect children and the population generally from the potentially serious diseases concerned. Ireland's recommended immunisation programme is based on the guidelines of the National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  These guidelines are prepared with the assistance of an active committee from associated disciplines in paediatrics, infectious diseases, general practice and public health.  The current childhood schedule contains immunisations against twelve infectious diseases: Tuberculosis, Diphtheria, Tetanus, Whooping cough, Polio, Haemophilus Influenzae B (Hib) disease, Hepatitis B, Pneumococcal disease, Meningococcal Group C disease, Measles, Mumps and Rubella.</p>
            <p eId="para_2072">Immunisation uptake rates in this country continue to improve. Figures published recently by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre of the HSE show that immunisation uptake rates for children aged 24 months reached 94% for diphtheria, tetanus &amp; pertussis (whooping cough) and DTP vaccines, and 90% for MMR (Measles, Mumps and Rubella) vaccine.  I welcome the fact that the uptake target of 95% was reached or exceeded in a number of HSE Local Health Offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2073">Vaccination is not mandatory in Ireland, but is strongly recommended by my Department.  Under the Childhood Immunisation Programme all vaccines and their administration are provided free of charge for all children.  I am arranging for the latest Quarterly Summary Uptake Report to be forwarded to the Deputy today.</p>

            <p eId="para_2078">The ECCE is being introduced from January 2010 as a free scheme to benefit children in the key developmental period prior to commencing school.  The scheme will allow eligible children to avail of a free pre-school place in the year before the commence school.  This will consist of 3 hours per day, 5 days per week over 38 weeks or 2 hours and 15 minutes per day, 5 days per week over 50 weeks.  As the new scheme will be introduced from January next, the first full year will be from September 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2079">Participating children must, normally be aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months on the 1st September of each year.

Participating services will receive capitation of €64.50 per week where children attend for 38 weeks, and €48.50 per week where they attend for 50 weeks.  Services will receive payments at the start of each term.</p>
            <p eId="para_2080">While the scheme will normally be required to provide services on a five day per week basis, transitional arrangements will apply during the initial period of January to August 2010, to allow services to adjust to the requirements of the new scheme.  During this period, services which are already accommodating children on a pro rata basis, may continue to do so and the capitation grant will be set by reference to the number of children attending per day rather than the total number of children per week.</p>

            <p eId="para_2084">Under the provisions of the Health Act, 2008, the new assessment of income for a person aged 70 and over who applies for a medical card is based on gross income.  This is designed to make it easier to qualify for a medical card than under the net income basis in the means test used for persons aged under 70.  A person aged 70 and over may still apply under that means test if, given their financial circumstances and outgoings, it would be more beneficial.  It is also possible that a person could be granted a medical card by the HSE on discretionary grounds. Under the Act, gross income is income before taxation.  The Act does not make an exception to this provision in respect of income arising from deposit interest. There is, however, an exemption from the calculation of interest income in respect of the first €36,000 of savings for a single person and €72,000 for a couple.</p>

The redeployment and reassignment of existing staff will also support the reorientation of care from hospitals to the community and to facilitate the development of integrated care. It is seeking a high level of flexibility from staff and unions to achieve this.</p>
            <p eId="para_2090">In addition, the employment control framework specifically exempts the following front line grades in the health sector from the moratorium: Medical Consultants, Speech and Language Therapists, Occupational Therapists, Physiotherapists, Clinical Psychologists, Behaviour Therapists, Counsellors, Social Workers, and Emergency Medical Technicians.  The framework actually allows for a growth in the number of those posts within the overall approved employment ceiling (111,800 wtes) for the health sector. The framework also includes provision for the creation of 225 new development posts this year for cancer and disability services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2091">The focus on these key grades is in line with existing Government policy on the prioritisation of certain development areas, for which significant funding has already been provided. The overall result will be to assist in the reorientation of health employment to services delivered in primary and community care.</p>

            <p eId="para_2093">The Health (Amendment) Act 2005 and the subsequent Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) Regulations 2005 and the (Health Charges for In-patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations 2008 provide the legislative basis for the imposition of long stay charges.  The legislation provides for two different classes of person for the purpose of levying a charge.</p>
            <p eId="para_2094">Class 1</p>
            <p eId="para_2095">Class 1 refers to persons in receipt of in-patient services on premises where nursing care is provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises.</p>
            <p eId="para_2096">Class 2</p>
            <p eId="para_2097">Class 2 refers to persons in receipt of in-patient services where nursing care is not provided on a 24 hour basis on those premises.   The Health (Charges for In-Patient Services) (Amendment) Regulations, 2008 amend the 2005 regulations and provide for the first increase in the level of long stay charges payable since 2005.  The following revised level of charges will apply. In the case of Class 1 a weekly charge of €153.25 or the weekly income of that person less €44.70, whichever is the lesser. In the case of Class 2 a weekly charge of €114.95 or the weekly income of that person less €70.25 or 60% of the weekly income of that person, whichever is the lesser. The actual charge levied will vary from person to person depending on individual circumstances and under the legislation the Health Service Executive can waive or reduce the charges to avoid undue financial hardship. The increase in the level of long stay charge levied is directly linked to recent increases in social welfare entitlements.  The new weekly charge for Class 1 of €153.25 represents an increase of €33.25 or 27.7% on the 2005 charges and the new weekly charge for Class 2 of €114.95 represents an increase of €24.95 or 27.7% on the 2005 charges.  In the corresponding period from 2005 to 2009 the rate of Disability Allowance payable has increased by €55.50 or 37.3%.  The rate of Disability Allowance has increased from €148.80 in 2005 to €204.30 in 2009.</p>

            <p eId="para_2101">As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the implementation of the new scheme to provide a free PreSchool year of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) which was announced recently by the Minister for Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2102">The scheme, which is being introduced from January 2010,  will allow eligible children to avail of a free playschool place in their preschool year, which will be provided for 3 hours per day, 5 days per week for 38 weeks.  It will also allow eligible children in their preschool year who are attending full day or part-time daycare services to avail of a free session of 2 hours and 15 minutes per day, 5 days per week for 50 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2103">An annual capitation fee of over €2,400 will be paid to participating services in return for the provision of a free preschool year to each child.  This is equivalent to €64.50 per week where a service is participating for 38 weeks and €48.50 per week where it participates for 50 weeks.  It is a matter for each participating service to manage its overheads within this framework.  Services will be paid in advance at the start of each term.</p>
            <p eId="para_2104">As a free preschool year, participating services must agree to provide the service in return for the capitation grant.  This does not preclude a service from charging for additional services provided these are clearly optional to parents.  Optional services can include additional hours, over and above the free preschool year requirement, and additional services in the form of various one-off, or on-going, activities or services such as outings, birthday parties, specific teaching resources such as dance or music or food.  By their nature, full or part-time services will offer additional hours to the preschool provision and sessional playschools can offer an additional 30 minutes per day.</p>
            <p eId="para_2105">However, services must ensure that all such additional services are offered and charged for on an optional basis and are not compulsory.  A parent's agreement cannot be a condition of initial or continued enrolment.  It is also essential that appropriate programme based activities must be provided to children not participating in an optional activity where this takes place during the required period of preschool provision.</p>

            <p eId="para_2108">The ECCE is being introduced from January 2010 as a free scheme to benefit children in the key developmental period prior to commencing school.  The scheme will allow eligible children to avail of a free preschool place in the year before they commence school of 3 hours per day, 5 days per week over 38 weeks or 2 hours and 15 minutes per day, 5 days per week over 50 weeks.

            <p eId="para_2109">Preschool Leaders will be expected to have a qualification in a qualification in early childhood care and education at level 5 in the National Framework of Qualifications or be in the process of completing their qualification.  This can equate to a FETAC accredited major award at level 5 or equivalent.  During the initial period following introduction of the scheme, evidence of completion of the core modules of FETAC level 5 will be accepted as meeting the requirement.  The Workforce Development Plan which is due to be implemented in 2010, will address issues such as access and effective participation in education and training programmes and will facilitate practitioners to achieve full qualification.  Within a reasonable time a qualification at level 6 in the National Framework of Qualifications will be the required qualification for staff in this position.</p>
            <p eId="para_2110">If an individual has completed an award in early childhood care and education that has been accredited by an international awarding body then a procedure has been established by the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI) whereby they can seek to establish if it's recognised as being equivalent to an award on the National Framework of Qualifications.</p>

            <p eId="para_2113">As the Deputy will be aware I have responsibility for the implementation of the new scheme to provide a free Pre-School year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE), which was announced recently by the Minister of Finance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2114">The ECCE which is being introduced from January 2010,  will allow eligible children to avail of a free preschool year in the year before they commence primary school.  It will consist of either 3 hours per day, 5 days per week over 38 weeks or 2 hours and 15 minutes per day, 5 days per week over 50 weeks.  As the new scheme will be introduced from January next, the first full year will be from September 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_2115">Participating children must, normally be aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months on the 1st September of each year. Participating services will receive capitation of €64.50 per week where children attend for 38 weeks, and €48.50 per week where they attend for 50 weeks.  Services will receive payments at the start of each term.  Where the child is attending full-day or part-time child care, the service will be required to reduce the child care fees by the amount of the capitation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2116">Up to 5,000 preschool services, which will include more that 4,000 commercial child care providers, will be invited shortly to participate in the new scheme. These services include full and part-time daycare services as well as sessional playschool services. These services must be notified to the Health Service Executive (HSE) or registered with the Irish Montessori Education Board. Officials in my Office will be writing to these providers before the end of this month providing them with further details and advising them of the application process.</p>
            <p eId="para_2117">Pre-School Leaders will be expected to have a qualification in a qualification in early childhood care and education at level 5 in the National Framework of Qualifications or be in the process of completing their qualification.  This can equate to a FETAC accredited major award at level 5 or equivalent. Within a reasonable time a qualification at level 6 in the National Framework of Qualifications will be the required qualification for staff in this position.

A national team of Síolta co-ordinators will assist services in meeting these standards.  The City and County Child care Committees and the National Child care Voluntary Organisations are also expected to play key roles in implementing the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2118">To ensure that a satisfactory standard of pre-school provision is delivered, a minimum enrolment of 8 children is envisaged.  Exceptions will be considered where, for good reason, a service has a smaller enrolment, for example where 8 children are enrolled but only 3 or more, are in their pre-school year and the remainder will be eligible for a preschool in the following year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2119">Many of the 5,000 existing private and voluntary pre-school services will have already received capital grant aid under the Equal Opportunities Child care Programme (EOCP) and or the National Child care Investment Programme (NCIP).  More than 65,000 additional child care places will have been created by the end of 2010 as a result of this investment.  I am aware from representations received from preschool services in recent months that many services are currently reporting vacancy rates of up to 25% in their facilities.  I am also aware of a number of people are now considering investing in a child care business, and also that many existing services, which to date have only been open in the morning, citing lack of demand for an afternoon session, are now considering offering an additional session to meet an increase in local demand.  As I said at the time of the announcement, some instances of under-supply may arise in the initial period of implementation of the scheme, however my Office and the city and County Child care Committees will monitor the situation carefully, to maximise the beneficial impact of the scheme for parents and children.</p>

            <p eId="para_2221">There are thirty two thalidomide victims in the State.  Each of the people affected by thalidomide has a unique set of problems to deal with and is in receipt of a special monthly payment made to persons suffering from the effects of thalidomide.  Each individual is entitled to a medical card and health services are made available to support them.</p>
            <p eId="para_2222">The payment is made to affected persons by the Department of Health and Children.  Payment of a Christmas bonus is by approval by the Department of Social and Family Affairs, on foot of a Government decision each year.  The monthly payment to victims of thalidomide is between €514.59 and €1,109.46.  The Christmas bonus for weekly social welfare recipients and recipients of the thalidomide payment has traditionally added one additional week's payment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2223">The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has explained that the Government's decision in the April Supplementary Budget to discontinue funding for the Christmas bonus this year is necessary to help restore order and stability to the public finances.  Payment of a Christmas bonus to persons suffering the effects of thalidomide are included in this decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2224">The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has pointed out that the cost in 2008 of the Christmas bonus was €233 million.  She has further said that, without wishing to raise expectations, if there were any sort of windfall arising in the course of the year, this would be one area where the Government would like to reinstate payments.</p>

          <speech by="#MaryHarney" as="#Minister_for_Health_and_Children" eId="spk_627">
            <from>Minister for Health and Children (Deputy Mary Harney)</from>
            <p eId="para_2228">In April 2007, the National Cancer Screening Service Board (NCSS) established an Expert Advisory Group to study the medical scientific evidence concerning Screening for Colorectal Cancer and to make recommendations to the Board about the desirability of introducing a population-based screening programme. The Board of the NCSS approved the Second (Final) Report of the Expert Group at its meeting on 20 November and it was submitted to me on 3 December 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2229">The Report of the Expert Group could not be comprehensively considered until the completion of the Health Technology Assessment (HTA), carried out by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA). The Board of HIQA approved the HTA report on 25 March and it was submitted to me on 17 April 2009.  The reports will be published when I have completed detailed consideration of the recommendations, the funding required and the method of putting that in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_2230">Colorectal cancer is the cause of death of approximately 950 people each year in Ireland. This compares to 666 deaths from breast cancer and 1606 deaths from lung cancer, for example.  Because of our ageing population and the long time in people's lives over which risk factors are built up, we can expect an increase in the numbers of colorectal cancer cases in the coming years.  The National Cancer Registry, in its report on Cancer Projections 2005 to 2035, projects that there will be approximately 3,402 cases of colorectal cancer in 2020.</p>
            <p eId="para_2231">As with many cancers, early detection and treatment is one of the most effective measures to avoid premature death. Thorough population-based screening programmes are critically important, with proven effectiveness in breast cancer and cervical cancer, where we now have screening programmes being actively rolled out.  For these reasons, colorectal screening is my top priority for the next preventive and early detection services in our National Cancer Control Programme.  I am pleased to note that the Irish Cancer Society shares this priority and at a recent meeting said that it would actively support a colorectal screening programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2232">I intend that it will have the first call on new resources, which will be found principally by cost-saving measures elsewhere. Other priorities for new developments in cancer prevention and early detection will be capable of being implemented to the extent that sufficient cost-saving measures are found.  With the benefit of the report of the Expert Group and the Health Technology Assessment, I am now considering the design and implementation of a colorectal screening service in the most cost-effective way.</p>

            <p eId="para_2238">The first phase of the reconfiguration of acute hospital services in the HSE  Mid West involves the reorganisation of the arrangements in Ennis and Nenagh so that these hospitals provide an urgent care/minor injuries service for 12 hours a day as part of a regional Accident and Emergency structure.  This took effect on the night of 6/7 April.</p>
            <p eId="para_2239">In the context of the re-configuration process, the level of staffing of the ambulance services in Clare and North Tipperary has been enhanced and an advanced 24-hour paramedic service is also now in operation. Advanced paramedics are trained to a high standard which equips them to provide more complex pre-hospital care than other personnel.  This includes the administration of a wider range of drugs and the urgent assessment and treatment of patients with life threatening conditions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2240">Protocols are in place to ensure that all trauma, paediatric and obstetric emergency cases will be brought directly to the major tertiary centre at Limerick Regional Hospital rather than to Ennis or Nenagh.

I firmly believe that legislation and, specifically, the regime of the Hague Convention provide an assurance for individual children, their families, and the State, that appropriate procedures have been followed and that the adoption was affected in the best interests of the child.</p>
            <p eId="para_2251">The Adoption Bill, 2009, was initiated in the Seanad and is currently at Report Stage in that House.  The Bill will continue to be prioritised by Government for its passage through the Oireachtas.  I have reported in detail to both Houses on the situation regarding a bilateral agreement with Vietnam in recent weeks. As I have already indicated, I will not speculate on the timeframe or outcome of these negotiations as these are genuinely difficult to determine.  What I can say is that efforts on the Irish side are intensive and will continue to be so in the coming weeks.  I can also say that there has been a high level of engagement on both sides.  It is clear from progress so far that there is a willingness on both sides to bring these matters to a successful conclusion, if at all possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2252">My Office has been working actively to assess the possibilities of entering into bilateral agreements with a small numbers of countries from which Irish applicants have traditionally adopted, including Ethiopia and the Russian Federation.  Work in relation to the Russian Federation has been ongoing for some time.  This has included contacts with the Irish Embassy in Moscow and legal and other preparatory work on the possibility of a draft Inter-Country Adoption Agreement between the two countries.  A first formal meeting was arranged with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs.  This meeting of officials of the OMCYA and the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Ireland took place in earlier this month.  I will continue to advance this matter with the assistance of my colleague Minister Martin and of his officials in both Dublin and Moscow.</p>
            <p eId="para_2253">The demand for inter-country adoption has been increasing at an exponential rate over the last number of years.  I understand from the HSE that over 370 first time assessments were completed in 2008 and over 170 second time assessments — a total of around 550. In addition to this increasing figure, the number of post adoption reports required has also been increasing. In 2008 around 1350 post adoption reports were completed. This is now considered to take around 28% of total social work time spent on the inter-country adoption process. Resourcing adoption assessment services has to be considered in the context of other child welfare and protection services provided by the HSE. The adoption service does not sit within a vacuum but has to be managed against competing priorities. Notwithstanding that, every effort has been made by the HSE to protect and improve the service over a number of years.</p>
            <p eId="para_2254">Under existing legislation assessments for adoption can be undertaken by registered adoption societies and a small number of societies continue to provide such services. Their focus is primarily on domestic adoption services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2255">The Adoption Bill 2009 develops a new regime for the accreditation of a range of agencies providing adoption services which more fully recognises the phenomenon of inter-country adoption and makes provision for the accreditation of agencies to provide both assessment services or mediation services. The Bill also proposes changes to the regulation of the activities, management and financial arrangements of such agencies. If enacted, there will be opportunity for the development of new agencies to assist in the reduction of waiting times in those areas where the waiting times are longest.</p>

            <p eId="para_2268">As the Deputy will be aware, I have responsibility for the implementation of the new scheme to provide a free Pre-School year of Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) which was announced recently by the Minister for Finance.  The scheme, which is being introduced from January 2010, will allow eligible children to avail of a free preschool place in the year before they commence school.  Services can participate in the scheme on the basis of a number of options.  A full or part-time service will be required to provide a preschool service for 2 hours 15 minutes per day, five days a week for 50 weeks per year, in return for a capitation fee of €48.50 per week.</p>
            <p eId="para_2269">A playschool sessional service will, normally, be required to provide a preschool service for 3 hours per day, five days a week for 38 weeks per year, in return for a capitation fee of €64.50 per week.  However, where for good reason a sessional service is unable to operate over 5 days, consideration will be given to allowing it to participate in the scheme on the basis of providing the pre-school year for 3 hours 30 minutes per day for 4 days per week.  In such cases, a service will be required to provide the pre-school year over 41 weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2270">Sessional services are limited under the Child Care (Preschool Services) (No. 2) Regulations 2006 to 3 hours and 30 minutes.  Should a parent wish to avail of the pre-school year in a full or part-time service, the 50 week model should apply.  As an early childhood care and education measure, while the ECCE scheme has been designed to be flexible to meet the needs of parents and of childcare services, it is the developmental needs of the child that are the key focus and which have determined the way in which the scheme has been designed.</p>

            <p eId="para_2294">The ECCE is being introduced from January 2010 as a free scheme to benefit children in the key developmental period prior to commencing school.  The scheme will allow eligible children, to avail of a free preschool place for 3 hours per day, 5 days per week over 38 weeks or 2 hours and 15 minutes per day, 5 days per week over 50 weeks.  As the new scheme will be introduced from January next, the first full year will be from September 2010 and children availing of the scheme in January 2010 will have a reduced period of free preschool provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_2295">Participating children must, normally be aged between 3 years 3 months and 4 years 6 months on the 1st September of each year. Children availing of the scheme from the 1st January 2010 must be aged between 3 years and 7 months and 4 years and 10 months on that date.   Exceptions will be allowed where children have special needs or it is necessary to accept children at an older age due to the enrolment policy of the local primary school.</p>
            <p eId="para_2296">A child three and a half years on the 1st January 2010 will not be eligible to avail of the scheme on that date but would be eligible for a full year free preschool from September 2010.  A child four years and five months on the 1st January 2010 will be eligible to avail of the reduced free preschool year up to June 2010, in the case of the 38 week model, and up to August 2010, in the case of the 50 week model.</p>

            <p eId="para_2321">Issues relating to business matters generally and employment levels in particular at the three state airports are day-to-day commercial matters for the Dublin Airport Authority (DAA) in which I have no statutory function.  The reality is that the world wide economic downturn has had a seriously negative impact on the aviation industry generally and this in turn has severely affected the financial position of the DAA.  The recently published DAA annual report for 2008 shows that passenger number arrivals at the three State airports are down 0.6% which is the first fall in passenger numbers for 17 years.  I understand that there have been further declines in the first quarter of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2322">I know that following the announcement of its annual results for 2008, which saw a drop in Group profit of 28% from 2007, the DAA has been reviewing all aspects of its business, with a particular focus on costs, including capital development and operational expenditure.  I also understand that in recent days discussions have commenced between the DAA and the airport unions on a major cost recovery programme.  The programme is to be company wide applying to Dublin, Cork and Shannon Airports.</p>
            <p eId="para_2323">DAA has informed me that it has a series of traffic incentive schemes in place in Shannon to promote growth in traffic and to stimulate it across a number of regions and routes.   In addition it is anticipated that the introduction of Pre-clearance at Shannon Airport will boost development at the airport and open a range of potential opportunities for services between Shannon and the United States.</p>

            <p eId="para_2337">The Commissioners of Irish Lights (CIL) are an example of long-standing British-Irish and North-South co-operation serving the mutual interests of its communities.  There are three General Lighthouse Authorities (GLAs) for Britain and Ireland. CIL are the authority for all of Ireland, the Northern Lighthouse Board for Scotland and the Isle of Man and Trinity House for England and Wales.  The entire system of lights and navigational aids is funded by the General Lighthouse Fund (GLF) as a single financial unit.  Expenditure is met from the GLF which derives its income principally from the collection of light dues levied on commercial shipping at ports. The three GLAs spend a total of almost £100m. each year to provide the service. This arrangement predates the foundation of the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2338">The light dues collected at Irish ports are supplemented by annual Exchequer contribution to the GLF so that the total revenues from sources in the State account for 50% of expenditure by CIL in the State or 50% of 70% of CIL's total expenditure. The remaining 50% is met out of GLF revenues from UK Light Dues.  A review of funding of CIL has been underway since February 2007. The review followed sustained pressure over many years in the UK by ship-owning interests which complained that they were, in effect, subsidising the Irish lights service to an unreasonable extent.  Negotiations are continuing with the UK Department for Transport on all elements of funding arrangements including any implications for the Irish Exchequer contribution.</p>
            <p eId="para_2339">UK authorities have indicated that they support continuing the service as a single integrated system covering Britain and Ireland. The lighthouse authorities' operations are being examined with a view to maximising the benefits of the integrated system in the interest of safe navigation in both Irish and UK waters.  I have arranged to meet Mr. Jim Fitzpatrick, UK Under Secretary of State for Transport, on 21 May 2009 and will be discussing these matters with him.</p>

            <p eId="para_2357">I propose to take Questions Nos. 257 to 259, inclusive, 277, 279, 281 and 288 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2358">One of the strategic goals set out in the Garda Síochána Corporate Strategy 2007-2009 is to significantly reduce the incidence of fatal and serious injuries on the roads and improve road safety.</p>
            <p eId="para_2359">I am informed by the Garda authorities that there has been no reduction in the efforts of members of An Garda Síochána in the enforcement of road traffic legislation.  While members of the Garda Traffic Corps in every Garda Division are specifically tasked with the enforcement of the road traffic and road transport legislation, all members of An Garda Síochána are tasked with enforcing the provisions of all criminal law, including the relevant provisions of road traffic and road transport legislation.  An Garda Síochána continuously conducts awareness and education campaigns and enforcement initiatives to reduce road fatalities and serious injuries, increase driver awareness, prevent and detect breaches of road traffic and transport legislation and promote an improved compliance culture among road-users.</p>
            <p eId="para_2360">Members of An Garda Síochána conduct planned, unplanned and ad hoc checkpoints, including mandatory alcohol testing checkpoints.  Planned multi-agency checkpoints are also conducted on a weekly basis, in conjunction with the Road Safety Authority, the Revenue Commissioners (Customs and Excise Branch) and the Department of Social and Family Affairs.</p>
            <p eId="para_2361">The emphasis of Garda speed enforcement is on the use of mobile speed cameras, and their capacity in this area has been substantially enhanced recently.  In September, 2008 the Garda Commissioner and I launched eight new Garda mobile speed detection vehicles.  These state of the art vehicles represent a substantial upgrading of the resources available to An Garda Síochána to address the problem of speeding on our roads, particularly in collision prone zones.  An Garda Síochána also has over 400 hand held speed detection devices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2362">The Garda authorities support the action in the Road Safety Strategy 2007-2012 to implement a safety camera network.  Consequently, An Garda Síochána is engaging in a procurement process, in accordance with EU Directives, national public procurement procedures and relevant legislation, for the provision and operation of safety cameras.  As a result, a preferred supplier has been selected.</p>
            <p eId="para_2363">Discussions are taking place between my Department, the Departments of Transport and Finance and An Garda Síochána with a view to making every effort to proceed with this project as speedily as possible. Until contract discussions are concluded, it is not possible to indicate a specific timescale for the project.</p>

            <p eId="para_2380">The person concerned applied for asylum on 23 February 2005. The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner made a determination that the asylum application of the person concerned be ‘deemed to be withdrawn' as she did not attend at that Office within five working days of her arrival in the State nor did she notify that Office of her address in the State at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_2381">The person concerned subsequently claimed asylum in the United Kingdom using another identity. Arising from the UK asylum application, a request was received from the UK authorities, on 18 March 2005, that this State ‘take back' the person concerned in accordance with Article 16(1)(<i>c</i>) of the Dublin II Regulation [Council Regulation (EC) No. 343/2003] on the basis that an earlier asylum application had been made in this State. Ireland agreed to accept responsibility and the person concerned was formally transferred to Ireland by the UK authorities.</p>

In addition she was notified that, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended), the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  She was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_2383">Representations have been submitted on behalf of the person concerned and these representations will be fully considered, under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act, 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement, before the file is passed to me for decision.</p>

            <p eId="para_2397">I propose to take Questions Nos. 270 and 280 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2398">I have been informed by the Commissioner that the personnel strength (all ranks) of the Traffic Corps as at the 31st December 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and the 31st March 2009 was as set out on the table below. The personnel strength of the Traffic Corps prior to the 31st December 2005 and the number of gardaí who have left the Traffic Corps for various reasons including promotion, retirement transfer etc., are not readily available. On the question of the ultimate strength of the Traffic Corps and the Garda strength generally, the moratorium on recruitments and appointments in the Public Service applies to An Garda Síochána. It should be noted however, that it is the responsibility of all members of An Garda Síochána to enforce traffic legislation as and when required.</p>
            <p eId="para_2399">Each Regional Assistant Commissioner is responsible for the implementation of the Commissioner's Policy on Traffic Policing, contributing to national initiatives developed by Assistant Commissioner, Traffic and liaising with relevant bodies within his/her Region on Traffic matters. The Assistant Commissioner is assisted in fulfilling his / her Traffic policing responsibilities by a Regional Traffic Superintendent, the exception being the Dublin Metropolitan Region where the role is filled by a Chief Superintendent. At the present time it is not considered appropriate to have an operationally separate Garda Traffic Corps.</p>
            <p eId="para_2400">It is not possible to provide a total costing for the Garda Traffic Corps as members of the Corps are assigned to individual Garda Divisions.  As such all costs are charged to the relevant Divisional cost code along with all other Garda operational members within the Division, rather than a separate Traffic Corps cost code.  A separate cost code is only used for identifying the costs associated with the Garda National Traffic Bureau (GNTB) which is responsible for the formulation and implementation of traffic policy in An Garda Síochána. The total cost of the GNTB in 2008 was €5.2m.</p>

            <from>Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform (Deputy Dermot Ahern)</from>
            <p eId="para_2586">I propose to take Questions Nos. 271 to 273, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2587">Council Directive 2000/78/EC establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation has been transposed into Irish law through the Employment Equality Acts 1998 to 2008. Article 6(1) of the Directive states that "notwithstanding Article 2(2) Member States may provide that differences in treatment on grounds of age shall not constitute discrimination, if, within the context of national law, they are objectively and reasonably justified by a legitimate aim, including legitimate employment policy, labour market, and vocational training objectives, and if the means of achieving the aim are appropriate and necessary."</p>
            <p eId="para_2588">I agree with the Garda Commissioner that it is necessary to fix a maximum recruitment age and a retirement age for full-time members of An Garda Síochána to ensure the continued efficiency and effectiveness of the Force.</p>
            <p eId="para_2589">The recruitment age was considered as recently as 2004 when, on the recommendation of the Garda Commissioner, the maximum recruitment age was increased from 26 to 35 years. This was considered a balanced and fair approach having regard to natural justice, the requirements of the organisation, the policing needs of the State and does not constitute a breach of the Equality legislation.</p>
            <p eId="para_2590">The standard retirement age in An Garda Síochána is 60 years of age and this retirement age is compatible with national legislation and the EU Directive. Indeed the retirement age for Assistant Commissioner rank was recently challenged in the High Court which found that the setting of that retirement age was compatible with the Directive.</p>
            <p eId="para_2591">Reserve gardaí are volunteers and not employees, serve on a part-time basis and have a limited set of powers and duties which is determined by the Garda Commissioner.  The upper recruitment and retirement age limits for Reserve gardaí were set at 60 and 65 respectively so that the Garda Reserve would attract applicants from a broad range in society, and benefit in particular from the experience and skills of more mature members of society.</p>

            <p eId="para_2593">An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's Question was received in the Citizenship Division of my Department in March 2006.</p>
            <p eId="para_2594">The average processing time from application to decision is now at 23 months. More complicated cases can at times take more than the current average while an element of straight forward cases are now being dealt with in less than that time scale.

            <p eId="para_2595">There is a limit to the reduction in the processing time that can be achieved as applications for naturalisation must be processed in a way which preserves the necessary checks and balances to ensure that the status of citizenship is not undervalued and is only given to persons who genuinely satisfy the necessary qualifying criteria.</p>

            <p eId="para_2601">I understand from the Garda authorities that the vehicle of the person referred to, which had been stolen, was identified as being involved in a serious crime. The vehicle is being retained for evidential purposes in accordance with legislation and has been technically and forensically examined.</p>
            <p eId="para_2602">Both the High and Supreme Court have determined that An Garda Síochána, as a police force, has both a right and a duty to take possession of and retain any evidence which may affect the guilt or innocence of an accused person. The purpose relates to due process and the administration of justice.  It follows that this duty must be exercised in an impartial manner and not for the sole advancement of one side.</p>
            <p eId="para_2603">As the vehicle in this case is critical evidence in the investigation of this crime the practice is that notice must be served on those persons suspected of involvement in this crime, to allow independent examination of the vehicle, prior to the return of the vehicle to its owner.  The Garda authorities therefore are not in a position at this stage to give an indication of when that might be.</p>
            <p eId="para_2604">Unfortunately, for the person concerned in this case there is no scheme of financial assistance for innocent third parties where property has to be retained for evidential purposes.  However, the matter has been raised on a number of occasions and the issue of the retention of property as evidence in such cases is currently the subject of correspondence between the Garda authorities, my Department and the Office of the Attorney General to see if anything can be done to speed up the return of property once it has been forensically examined.</p>

            <p eId="para_2677">I wish to advise the Deputy that the gathering of the information requested would require a disproportionate and inordinate amount of staff time and effort and could not be justified in current circumstances where there are other significant demands on resources.</p>
            <p eId="para_2678">The Criminal Justice Act 1960, as amended by the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Act 2003, provides that the Minister may approve the temporary release of a sentenced prisoner.  This discretionary instrument assists in gradually preparing suitable offenders for release and in administering short sentences, and is an incentive to well-behaved prisoners. As the Deputy will be aware temporary release arrangements operate similarly to a system of parole, which is a feature of prison systems worldwide. They are an important vehicle for re-integrating an offender into the community in a planned way.</p>
            <p eId="para_2679">The generally accepted view is that the risk to the community is reduced by planned re-integration of offenders compared with their return to the community on the completion of their full sentence. I should add that each case is examined on its own merits; the safety of the public is paramount when decisions are made. In addition, all releases are subject to conditions, which in the vast majority of cases include a requirement to report on a regular basis to the offender's Garda Station. Of course, any offender who breaches his or her conditions may be arrested and returned to prison immediately by the Garda.  Applicants for temporary release are identified by a number of different means but primarily on the recommendation of the Prison Governor or the therapeutic services in the prisons. The prisoner, their family or their legal representative can also apply for consideration of such a concession. Recommendations are also made to me in relation to long term sentence prisoners by the Parole Board. However, it is very important to note that it does not necessarily follow that a prisoner will receive temporary release even if the recommendation is to that effect.</p>
            <p eId="para_2680">The Courts have determined that, with the exception of debtors or those serving a sentence for contempt of court, no category of sentenced prisoner can be excluded from being considered for temporary release. The periods of temporary release granted can vary greatly from a few hours following a family bereavement to, for example, a requirement to report to the prison every 12 months in the case of a life sentence prisoner who has been released into the community a considerable time ago.</p>

            <p eId="para_2687">The functions of the Irish Sports Council, which is funded by my Department, are outlined at Section 6 of the Irish Sports Council Act, 1999. Under these functions the Council has a statutory role in encouraging the promotion, development and co-ordination of sport.

            <p eId="para_2690">In the context of the provision of funding for National Governing Bodies of Sport , such funding is provided in accordance with criteria which have been established by the Irish Sports Council.

The scheme also provides for a weekly or monthly supplement to be paid in respect of mortgage interest.  Under existing arrangements, an appeal against a decision on entitlement to supplementary welfare allowance or mortgage interest supplement is made in the first instance to a designated appeals officer in the HSE.

            <p eId="para_2758">I propose to take Questions Nos. 316 and 320 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2759">The Department's public office in Mallow is a branch office which is not staffed by civil servants but operates under a contract for service on behalf of the Department.  Under the terms of their contract Branch Managers are responsible for recruiting their own staff and are required to employ sufficient staff to deliver an efficient service to the public.  Claims from Mallow Branch Office are decided in Mallow Control Office which also deals with claims for Fermoy and Macroom Branch Offices.</p>
            <p eId="para_2760">The additional number of people applying for jobseeker payments has placed increased pressure on all of the Department's offices and on branch offices.  Staff in these offices are working extremely hard to process claims as quickly as possible.  During the past year an additional 190 staff have been assigned to local offices throughout the country.  The Department could not assign additional staff to Mallow Control Office as accommodation in the office was at capacity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2761">Several options in relation to the provision of a new Control office for the Department in Mallow have been investigated by the Office of Public Works. This was done in the context of providing a viable accommodation solution which takes account of the operational needs of the Department, the service needs of the local community and also the need to demonstrate value for money to the taxpayer in the acquisition of any property there.  I understand that negotiations are now at an advanced stage in this regard and it is hoped that staff will be relocated to new accommodation by the end of the year.  In the interim, to support offices such as Mallow where accommodation is at capacity, the Department has set up four central decision units around the country and a further three are planned.  In addition, since early 2008 we have been examining all aspects of the work associated with the processing of claims and streamlining them wherever possible with a view to expediting decisions.</p>

            <p eId="para_2767">The supplementary welfare allowance scheme, which includes mortgage interest supplement, is administered on behalf of the department by the community welfare service of the Health Service Executive.  The mortgage interest supplement scheme is designed to help those who have difficulty meeting their mortgage repayment schedule where their means are insufficient to meet their needs. The scheme provides a short-term "safety net" within the overall social welfare scheme to ensure that people do not suffer hardship due to loss of employment. A supplement may be paid in respect of mortgage interest only, to eligible people in respect of a house which is their sole place of residence.</p>
            <p eId="para_2768">There are currently over 11,900 people in receipt of mortgage interest supplement, an increase of 190% over the number in payment at end 2007. "Mortgage interest" is defined in Section 14 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2008. In accordance with this definition, only the portion of mortgage interest that relates to the purchase, essential repair or improvement of a person's sole or main residence is taken into account in assessing entitlement to mortgage interest supplement.</p>
            <p eId="para_2769">The Executive has advised that the person concerned has re-mortgaged his home a number of times, not all of which related to the purchase, essential repair or improvement of his sole or main residence. In these circumstances, the person concerned was awarded mortgage interest supplement of €42 per week based on interest payable on his original loan application relating to his main residence.  The person concerned appealed against this decision to an Appeals Officer of the Executive but this appeal was unsuccessful. He now has a further right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.  It is also open to the person concerned to provide any new or additional documentary evidence of expenditure of mortgage funds on improvements to his home and seek a review of his entitlement to mortgage interest supplement.</p>

            <p eId="para_2775">In order to qualify for the maximum rate of the state pension (contributory), a person must, amongst other qualifying conditions, achieve a yearly average of at least 48 contributions paid or credited on his/her social insurance record.  Reduced pensions are paid to those with yearly averages as low as 10 contributions and arrangements are also in place for the payment of pro-rata pensions to those with mixed rate insurance records or contributions from other EU member states or countries with which Ireland has a reciprocal agreement.  The state pension (non contributory) is paid to those who do no t have the requisite number of social insurance contributions for a state pension (contributory) and is subject to a means test.</p>
            <p eId="para_2776">The current rate of payment for the maximum state pension (contributory) is €230.30 per week.  Estimates provided for the Green Paper on Pensions in 2007 suggested that the full-year cost of providing a standard rate pension for all citizens over 66 years of age at the then maximum rate of €209.30 per week was €1.2 billion.  Up-rating this figure provides an estimated total cost of €1.3 billion for 2009.  This estimate does not take account of the cost of exporting payment to former residents.</p>

            <p eId="para_2805">Traditionally, social insurance spending has been funded on a tripartite basis — with contributions coming from the Exchequer, employers and employees.  Legally, the Exchequer is the residual financier of the Social Insurance Fund and Exchequer contributions were the norm for over forty years — for example, in 1967, the State contribution was 38% of SIF expenditure; and almost 29% in 1985.  As the fund does not operate on a future funded basis, it does not acquire liabilities in respect of scheme funding, including pensions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2806">The Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund, 2005, which covered the period from 2006 to 2061, did highlight that progressive action is required if future costs, including pensions, are to be met. This will involve finding an appropriate balance between the three strands of the tripartite funding system.  However, despite the current economic situation, Ireland is better placed than many EU States to meet this challenge.  Approaches to such matters are for the Government to consider in a budgetary context.</p>

            <p eId="para_2829">I propose to take Questions Nos. 334 to 336, inclusive, together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2830">The mortgage interest supplement scheme is designed to help those who have difficulty meeting their mortgage repayment schedule where their means are insufficient to meet their needs.  A supplement may be paid in respect of mortgage interest only and in respect of a house which is a person's sole place of residence.  Mortgage repayment protection is designed to cover mortgage repayments if a mortgage holder cannot work due to compulsory redundancy, illness or disability.  However, there is no statutory obligation on a person to take out such mortgage repayment protection.  The introduction of mandatory mortgage repayment protection for all new mortgages is a matter for consideration by the Government in the context of overall consumer credit policy.</p>
            <p eId="para_2831">As part of the mortgage interest supplement claim process, an applicant is obliged to disclose all means including income from a mortgage repayment protection policy.  The process also requires lending agencies to certify where a mortgage is covered by a mortgage repayment protection policy.  Where it is confirmed that such a policy is in place, the income from the policy is assessed as means and it is the responsibility of a community welfare officer to decide how much, if any, mortgage interest supplement is payable in such circumstances.  If a mortgage repayment protection policy has been taken out with an agency other than the lending agency, the process is dependent on an applicant for mortgage interest supplement disclosing this information to a community welfare officer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2832">There are currently 11,900 recipients of mortgage interest supplement, a 190% increase since the end of 2007.  The published estimate of expenditure for 2009 mortgage interest supplement is €40.1m, an increase of €12.5m on the outturn of expenditure in 2008.  Overall, it is expected that adequate provision has been made for the mortgage interest supplement scheme in 2009.  However, expenditure continues to be closely monitored on a monthly basis taking into account trends in recipient numbers, average monthly payments and savings arising from the supplementary budget measures.</p>
            <p eId="para_2833">The current review of the administration of the mortgage interest supplement scheme is progressing.  The main purpose of the review is to consider how the mortgage interest supplement scheme can best meet its objective of catering for those who require assistance on a short-term basis, where they are unable to meet mortgage interest repayments on their sole place of residence.  Legislative and operational issues arising in the existing mortgage interest scheme, including the cap on hours of employment and the need for mortgage repayment protection, are also being examined.</p>

            <p eId="para_2850">The Irish Coast Guard has overall responsibility for the provision of a maritime search and rescue services within the Irish search and rescue region and on rivers, lakes and waterways in this country.  Prior to the Irish Coast Guard, responsibility was with the Irish Marine Emergency Service (IMES) of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources.  An Garda Síochána have lead responsibility for land based search and rescue.  The Air Corps does not have now and did not have in the past full responsibility for the provision of search and rescue services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2851">The Defence Forces are committed to providing support to the civil power and to the civil authorities in relation to search and rescue.  In this regard, the Air Corps and the Naval Service will continue to provide support to the Coast Guard and an Garda Síochána as the need arises and within their available capacity.

            <p eId="para_2852">The last year in which the Air Corps was the sole provider of air support for search and rescue was 1990.  The types of helicopters used were an Alouette 3 based in Baldonnel (day time operation only) and a Dauphin based in Shannon (day and night operations).  It has not been possible, in the time available, to discover the number of hours flown in the role, or the number of missions flown.  To do so would require the assignment of personnel to specifically retrieve archival material from approximately 20 years ago.  As a result, it has not been possible to calculate the total cost of search and rescue for 1990.  The costings applicable in 1990 were £615.00 per hour for the Alouette 3 and £2,000.00 per hour for the Dauphin.  These figures included fuel, depreciation, maintenance and personnel costs.</p>

            <p eId="para_2855">There are no plans to downgrade the Reserve Defence Force or abolish the Reserve.  The Government introduced a moratorium on recruitment to the Public Service with effect from 27th March 2009 and the Defence Organisation is required to operate with reduced funding for 2009. In this context, all recruitment to the Reserve Defence Force had been suspended. The first priority is to consolidate the gains that have been made over recent years in developing the Reserve. I have today announced the re-commencement of limited recruitment to the Reserve so as to replace existing members who leave.</p>
            <p eId="para_2856">While the budgetary provision for training of members of the Reserve has been reduced, it will be sufficient to allow all current members of the Reserve to undertake paid training during 2009.  Discussions are ongoing with the Reserve Defence Force Representative Association in relation to a range of issues relating to the Reserve including the suspension of recruitment.  As the Reserve Defence Force Review Implementation Plan is reaching its conclusion, options for the future development of the Reserve will be considered. This will be informed by the lessons learned from the implementation process. In addition, the Reserve Defence Force has been selected for review as part of the 2009-2011 phase of the Government's Value for Money and Policy Review initiative.   It is anticipated that this review, together with the general budgetary situation, will also assist in informing decisions regarding the future of the Reserve.</p>
            <p eId="para_2857">Clearly we are facing challenging times and the reduction in funding for 2009 has impacted on the Reserve as it has the broader Defence Organisation. However there are no plans to abolish the Reserve Defence Force and I am not considering any proposals in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_2859">The 2002 National Spatial Strategy (NSS) aims to achieve a better balance of social, economic and physical development across Ireland, supported by more effective planning, and has designated nine gateways and nine hubs which have the capacity to grow sustainably and to act as drivers of growth for their hinterlands and wider regions.   Investment priorities identified under the National Development Plan 2007-2013 and Transport 21 have been aligned with the NSS.  As a result, the Gateways and Hubs are benefiting substantially from significant infrastructure and enabling investment.</p>
            <p eId="para_2860">Implementation of the NSS is also facilitated by the 2004 Regional Planning Guidelines (RPGs), which are currently under review for adoption in 2010.   City and County Councils have regard to the NSS and regional priorities in their development plan and local area planning processes.</p>
            <p eId="para_2861">My Department has undertaken extensive research into the development issues and challenges of the nine Hub towns.  This work culminated in the publication in June 2007 of the report, NSS Hubs — Development Issues and Challenges, which is available on the Department's website – <i> www.environ.ie</i>. The study provides a detailed description of the current status of the hubs, identifies the many development issues and challenges associated with the hubs and makes recommendations to support and advance future hub growth and development.  Key among the recommendations is the need for the establishment of implementation and co-ordination arrangements at the hub level and this is being encouraged and facilitated by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2862">The 2008 Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal: Building Ireland's Smart Economy indicated that an analysis of NSS implementation and an assessment of the extent to which sectoral programmes are aligned with the NSS was to be undertaken; this work is currently underway in my Department.</p>

            <p eId="para_2864">The EU Directive on the Energy Performance of Buildings, which was transposed into Irish law by the European Communities (Energy Performance of Buildings) Regulations 2006-2008, introduced a requirement for a Building Energy Rating (BER) system.</p>
            <p eId="para_2865">The Regulations require a person offering a building for sale or letting to produce a copy of the BER certificate and advisory report in relation to the building to any person who expresses an interest in availing of the sale or letting.  The BER certificate and advisory report serve to enable prospective purchasers or tenants to take the energy performance of a building into account when making decisions in relation to sales or lettings and to compare in a standard format the energy performance of a range of buildings available to them.  In this way it is intended that the BER system will promote greater awareness of energy efficiency in the property market and encourage building owners to take cost effective steps to improve the energy rating, and hence the overall energy performance, of such buildings.</p>
            <p eId="para_2866">In the case of new buildings other than dwellings, the BER system was introduced with effect from 1 July 2008, subject to certain planning-related transitional arrangements, which remain in force until 30 June 2010.  The BER system was extended to existing buildings offered for sale or rent, with effect from 1 January 2009 unless the building is specifically exempted under article 3 of the Regulations.</p>
            <p eId="para_2867">To date this year 668 BER certificates have been issued in respect of buildings other than dwellings; it is not possible to determine the level of compliance indicated by this figure.  However, it is worth noting that the Regulations impose obligations on agents, including law agents, who assist a person in connection with the sale or letting of a building, to ensure compliance with the mandatory BER requirements.  Given that law agents are likely to be involved in the majority of transactions involving buildings other than dwellings, a high degree of compliance is anticipated in this category of buildings.</p>

Where an estate has not been completed to the standard outlined in the planning permission and the planning authority has not taken enforcement action within 7 years of the expiration of the duration of the planning permission, the planning authority must also initiate taking in charge procedures if requested to do so by the majority of qualified electors who own or occupy the houses in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_2872">Section 34(4)(g) of the Planning and Development Act, 2000 provides that a planning authority may attach conditions to a planning permission requiring the giving of adequate security for the satisfactory completion of a proposed development.

Where a planning permission expires, the developer may seek an extension of the relevant period.  Subject to compliance with certain requirements, including a requirement that substantial works were carried out pursuant to the permission during that period, a planning authority may extend the duration of a permission by such additional period as it considers necessary to enable the relevant development to be completed.  This period may be further extended where the planning authority is satisfied that the relevant development has not been completed due to circumstances beyond the control of the developer.</p>

Otherwise, there are no plans to alter the claw back provisions applicable to existing purchasers of affordable housing.</p>

            <p eId="para_2936">Under the Waste Management Acts the statutory responsibility for the regulation of private waste collectors rests with the relevant local authorities. Consequently, my Department does not maintain data on the number of such service providers. In most cases these service providers act on an entirely commercial basis and are not contracted to provide services on behalf of a local authority.</p>
            <p eId="para_2937">In relation to the types of material collected, the Environmental Protection Agency is the national repository for waste statistics and the most recent data from the Agency are contained in the National Waste Report 2007 available on www.epa.ie.</p>
            <p eId="para_2938">Traditionally, local authorities were the main operators in the waste collection market.  There have been rapid changes in the waste management sector over the last decade due to the increased involvement of a developing and consolidating private sector and, as a consequence of this increased involvement, the private sector is now the dominant collector in at least 20 of the 34 local authority areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2939">Currently the collection of household waste from single dwelling households is either carried out by the local authorities themselves or by private sector companies entering the market in direct competition with the local authorities i.e. "competition in the market" leading to a situation in many instances where the local authority has simply withdrawn from the market as a service provider.</p>
            <p eId="para_2940">A High Court action was taken late in 2008 by two private sector waste management companies to seek to prevent the Dublin local authorities from using their existing powers to vary the Waste Management Plan for the Dublin Region by inserting an objective in the Plan that the collection of household waste from single dwelling households be carried out by the local authorities themselves or that the local authorities make arrangements by way of a public tendering process for the collection of such household waste i.e. introduce "competition for the market".</p>
            <p eId="para_2941">The outcome of this High Court action, which is expected shortly, will have clear implications for the future direction regarding the regulation of the waste management sector generally and will further inform what measures may be necessary to underpin sustainable waste collection services, whether delivered by the private or public sectors.</p>

            <p eId="para_2957">In the case of the Water Services Investment Programme, major schemes in each water services authority area have been undertaken for a number of years now on the basis of 3 year rolling capital programmes, the latest of which — Water Services Investment Programme 2007-2009 — is available in the Oireachtas Library.</p>
            <p eId="para_2958">The length of time taken for schemes included in the Programme to advance to completion of construction largely depends on the nature and complexity of the scheme and the statutory processes involved.  My Department is involved at key stages in the development of schemes to ensure compliance with obligations relating to management and oversight of Exchequer expenditure. Water Services Authorities have a range of responsibilities in relation to the detailed progression of schemes, including issues such as statutory planning and other processes (including public consultation and approval of elected members), site investigations, acquisition of lands and wayleaves, preparation of tender documents, tendering process, appointment of contractors and carrying out of works. Water Services Authorities have also to take account of the specific funding parameters for servicing the domestic sector, particularly in relation to the extent and scale of collection systems and the capacity at treatment plants. The time taken to advance a scheme will depend largely on these considerations and how quickly these processes are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_2959">Funding of schemes is organised on the basis of approved budgets for the planning and procurement/construction stages of schemes. Eligible expenditure within these budgets is claimed from my Department as schemes progress. With the exception of claims in respect of completed works, which require a more detailed appraisal of the costs involved, all claims for payment currently on hands from Westmeath County Council have been processed and will be paid shortly.</p>
            <p eId="para_2960">In addition to schemes under the Water Services Investment Programme, water services authorities can fund works under the devolved Rural Water Programme, for which my Department allocates annual block grants. The 2009 allocation to Westmeath County Council is €1.56 million.</p>

        <b>Deputy James Bannon</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government</b>
         the reason he has informed all local authorities that local government expenditure cannot take place unless funding is identified, for both revenue and capital account, which will have a negative impact on capital schemes, as loan approval is being withheld for projects such as Mullingar civic offices and Mullingar main drainage, which could result in local authorities such as Westmeath County Council being forced into overdraft; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_2962">In February 2009, my Department set out details of the financial requirements for local authorities relating to the overall management of their capital and current accounts.  These arise from the requirements for Government finances as a whole to be managed in accordance with the Stability and Growth Pact established under the Maastricht Treaty, and the associated limitation on budget deficits.  This is not a new requirement for 2009, but current economic and budgetary considerations require all sectors, including local authorities, to ensure effective control and management of public finances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2963">In order to stay within the overall limit for the General Government Balance, it is necessary for local authorities to manage their finances and to maintain their current and capital accounts broadly in balance for 2009.  Within this general requirement, there is capability for borrowing by local authorities for capital infrastructure.  To achieve the objective of the aggregate change in the General Government Balance, my Department is issuing loan sanctions allocated for capital projects on a prioritised basis.  Sanctions totalling €106m have issued so far.  Priority is being given to meeting contractual commitments.</p>
            <p eId="para_2964">These requirements do not conflict with the continuing emphasis on capital investment in necessary infrastructure critical to economic recovery and sustaining the economy at local level.  The Government and local authorities will continue to progress capital investment projects that can maximise economic, social and environmental returns.  Accordingly, the prioritisation of investment opportunities, and targeting of available resources to labour intensive activity and the support of economic recovery, will continue to be the key focus of capital expenditure in the local government sector.</p>
            <p eId="para_2965">My Department will continue to work closely with local authorities, including Westmeath County Council, to ensure that within the overall financial limits to be met, decisions on these matters are taken in a way which gives the necessary prioritisation to environmental, economic and social infrastructure as part of the overall contribution to economic recovery.</p>

            <p eId="para_3051">My Department has entered into a contract with "3", a Hutchison Whampoa company, for the delivery of the National Broadband Scheme (NBS).  3 is currently planning the construction and rollout of the required infrastructure for the purposes of the provision of the service.  Challenging roll out targets are contained in the contract with 3.  Services were launched in a small number of rural areas at the end of April and the entire NBS area must be covered by September 2010.</p>
            <p eId="para_3052">While Fahy, Westport, County Mayo will be covered by the NBS, 3 is not in a position, at this juncture, to predict the progression of site rollout in advance of obtaining the necessary planning permissions.  One month prior to the NBS being launched in any given area, 3 will implement a marketing campaign to announce the forthcoming service availability.  The campaign will include, inter alia, local press and outdoor advertising.</p>

            <p eId="para_3054">The appendix below details the Phase II networks completed under the (MANs), the length of the network per town and the overall cost per region.  A procurement process for the appointment of a Managed Service Entity (MSE) to manage the Phase II MANs is almost completed.  Once appointed, the MSE will market the Phase II MANs to service providers.  The service providers will be in a position to offer their services using the state-of-the-art networks in the regional towns.  Until such time as the MSE is appointed, interim arrangements have been put in place to allow service providers to use the MANs to meet their needs.  Four service providers are currently offering services on the Phase II MANs.   It is expected that the number of service providers will increase once the MSE is in place.</p>
            <p eId="para_3055">Service providers are deemed as "customers" of the MANs.  In other words, a service provider, as a customer of a MAN, uses the MAN to offer services on to the service provider's own customers.  Service providers use the MANs to compete for voice and data services over a range of platforms including:</p>

The purpose of the meeting was to consider and seek support for a plan to deliver compliance of wild fisheries and aquaculture in Natura sites with the EU Birds and Habitat Directives which had been submitted in advance by the Irish authorities to DG Environment.</p>
            <p eId="para_3288">It was a constructive meeting where the Irish delegation set out in technical detail the content of the plan.  DG Environment officials raised a number of issues and suggestions.  DG Environment advised that it was, in principle, favourably disposed towards Ireland's plan subject to a positive response to the issues raised and further clarifications from the Irish authorities on the details of the plan.  When these matters were satisfactorily addressed by the Irish authorities, it expected to be in a position to formally respond on the plan at an early date.</p>
            <p eId="para_3289">DG Environment advised that it was positively disposed towards the interim approach for wild fisheries which had been described in the Irish plan whereby best available data together with the collection of some limited additional data would be used as an interim assessment to access impacts of these activities on the Natura sites.  This assessment would inform and determine possible fishing opportunities, based on a precautionary approach.  Fisheries opened in Natura sites would, in any case, have to be subject to stringent management arrangements (including possibly limiting access, restrictions on areas fished / gears used, time spent fishing) and additional control arrangements.  As soon as full data is available on sites, these fisheries will be subject to full Appropriate Assessment under the Directives.  My officials are in regular contact with the fishermen's representatives and will continue to keep them updated on developments in this regard.</p>

            <p eId="para_3325">In the Fourth Review, the Less Severely Handicapped category was divided into two groupings:</p>
            <p eId="para_3326">(a) areas designated under Article 3.4 of 75/268/EEC (the usual basis on which new areas are selected), and</p>
            <p eId="para_3327">(b) areas designated under Article 3.5 of 75/268/EEC, which allows areas with specific handicaps to be designated as less-favoured without meeting the strict criteria required under Article 3.4. Areas in this sub-category are generally coastal areas or islands which suffer from specific handicaps such as wind/water erosion, excessive climatic conditions, or where preservation is required for environmental or tourism purposes, thereby preventing farmers from fully utilising the land. Land in this category is limited to a maximum of 4% of the total land area of the state.</p>
            <p eId="para_3328">Areas were designated under Article 3.5 in both the Fourth and Fifth Reviews, and at present amount to 0.4% of the total land area. The most recent (Fifth) review of Less Favoured Areas took place between 1992 and 1996, with new Less Severely Handicapped areas being designated in 1995 and reclassification of additional land as More Severely Handicapped in 1996.</p>
            <p eId="para_3329">The Commission is currently conducting a review of Disadvantaged Areas across the Community, having been mandated by the Council of Ministers to conduct the review. The object of the exercise is to establish an EU-wide system, which will allow comparisons between regions; the proposal represents a move away from designation based on socio-economic factors, (declining rural population, low productivity and low farm incomes), to a methodology favouring physical characteristics, (soil type, poor climate, slope and altitude of land). While the Commission initially had a November deadline for concluding the review, with a proposal due to be made to Council in December 2008, it became apparent during the consultation process with individual Member States that this timeframe was too ambitious, given the fundamental changes being proposed. These discussions are ongoing; it is envisaged that any changes to the Scheme will not be introduced before 2014.</p>

This concern has resulted in the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) initiating a research project to identify factors causing CCD.  This will highlight gaps in scientific knowledge and guide future research in this area.  At present the cause of CCD is not known, although various factors are thought to be responsible including starvation, viruses, mites, pesticide (spray) exposure and climate change. There is already publicly funded Irish research into effects and treatments for varroa mite. It is hoped that this research programme will help identify the reason for CCD and allow countries to take appropriate measures to help counteract the problem.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_3339">The annual charges for school transport services are being increased from the first term of the 2009/10 school year as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_3340">Eligible post-primary pupils (junior) from €168 to €300 (78% increase) Eligible post-primary pupils (senior) from €234 to €300 (28% increase) Concessionary post-primary pupils from €234 to €300  (28% increase) Concessionary primary pupils from €120 to €200 (66% increase) Maximum family charge from €495 to €650 (31% increase).</p>
            <p eId="para_3341">The cost of school transport in 2009 is now estimated to be €192m. However, this still represents a significant increase of over €82m (over 75%) since 2004, up from €109.8m. Costs in school transport have been increasing arising from a range of issues. These include the phasing out of the 3 for 2 seating arrangement on both primary and post-primary services and the addition of a considerable number of vehicles to address capacity shortfalls arising from the decision to provide each child with an individual seat and the equipping of all dedicated school buses with safety belts. Increases in rates for private contractors in the 2000-2007 period and increased demands to meet the needs of special needs children and parental choice of school have also impacted on school transport costs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3342">I wish to point out that, despite the escalating costs of the service, charges for school transport had not been increased from 1998 until the third school term in the 2007/08 school year. A further increase was put in place at the start of the 2008/09 school year. The total contribution of charges from parents in 2009 will still only represent about 8.6% of the overall expenditure for school transport.</p>
            <p eId="para_3343">In the overall context and in order to minimise the overall effects, these charge increases have been confined to the 55,000 eligible post-primary and children availing of concessionary transport. Charges continue to be waived in the case of eligible post-primary children where the family is in possession of a valid medical card (or over 22,500). Eligible children attending primary schools and children with special needs (or about 54,500 children) will still travel free. A maximum family rate of €650 will also be applied.</p>
            <p eId="para_3344">Parents are also being given the option of spreading the amount due over two payments payable in July and December 2009. Those who pay the full annual charge, in advance, will benefit from a ticket being issued for the school year and this includes pupils on concessionary travel.</p>
            <p eId="para_3345">My Department has also commenced a Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme which is to be completed before the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_3348">The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside. However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise known as catchment boundary transport. These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for. Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area. In general, catchment boundary tickets are issued on a first come, first served basis.</p>

            <p eId="para_4685">Details of the service and professional requirements for probation of primary teachers are outlined in my Department's Circular 0140/2006 which is available on my Department's website. Schools are advised in June each year to notify the Department of teachers who may be eligible for probation. A series of dates is nominated for submission of applications: round 1 by the end of June; round 2 by the middle of September; round 3 by the beginning of November; and round 4 by the middle of January.</p>
            <p eId="para_4686">With regard to the 2008/9 year, the current position is that 2,465 teachers who registered for probation during rounds 1,2 and 3 have been deemed eligible. The completion of probation is subject to both service and professional requirements. All eligible teachers who registered for probation by November 7th 2008 will have the opportunity of completing the professional aspect of the probationary process by the end of the current school year.  The majority of these teachers will also fulfil the service requirement of 178 days and, where both professional and service requirements have been satisfactorily met, the teacher will be deemed probated.</p>
            <p eId="para_4687">For those teachers who satisfactorily meet the professional requirements in the current school year but do not meet the service requirement, it will be necessary to gain further experience during the coming school year.  In these cases, the teacher will be deemed probated on the date on which the service requirement is met.</p>
            <p eId="para_4688">There are 96 teachers who registered for probation after November 7th 2008 who will not have an opportunity of completing the professional aspect of the probationary process in the current school year.  These teachers will be given priority in the coming school year.  While awaiting the completion of the professional aspect of the process, all service given in the current school year will be credited toward meeting the service requirement of the process.</p>
            <p eId="para_4689">A breakdown by county of the numbers of teachers undergoing probation in the current school year follows.</p>

Verification of actual teaching service is not completed until much closer to the actual retirement date so it is not possible at this time to provide these numbers based on service given.  It is, therefore, provided on the basis of age categories.  The figures for post-primary teachers do not include VEC teachers where the retirements and pension benefit awards are made by the relevant VEC.</p>
            <p eId="para_4772">My Department has received a somewhat increased level of general enquiries from teachers so far this year in relation to retirement options.  It will be much later in the year, however, before we know to what extent these enquiries  translate into actual retirements.</p>

            <p eId="para_4817">Section 27 of the Education Act, 1998 requires Boards of Management of schools to establish and maintain procedures for the purposes of informing students in a school of the activities of the school. The procedures established and maintained for this purpose shall facilitate the involvement of the students in the operation of the school, having regard to the age and experience of the students, in association with their parents and teachers. Students of a post-primary school may establish a student council and a board of a post-primary school shall encourage the establishment by students of a student council and facilitate and give reasonable assistance to students who wish to establish a student council and to student councils when they have been established.</p>
            <p eId="para_4818">An assistant National Co-ordinator with responsibility for student councils was appointed to the Second Level Support Service in 2007. This co-ordinator has designed and is delivering a programme of professional development to respond to the identified needs and to support teachers with establishing student councils in their schools. In addition, this co-ordinator provides support to the whole school: management, staff and the students prior to establishing its students council and to the students on the council, following their election. My Department understands that student councils have been established in the majority of post-primary schools and that the remainder of these schools are in the process of establishing councils.</p>
            <p eId="para_4819">Having regard to the provisions of Section 27 of the Education Act, 1998 and my Department's ongoing commitment and support for the establishment of student councils I feel there is no requirement at this time for further legislation on student councils in order to provide for Article 12 of the Convention of the Rights of the Child in an educational setting.</p>

         his plans to introduce legislation that would place a statutory duty on all schools to introduce anti-bullying policies in order to ensure that all children are protected from harm; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#BattOKeeffe" as="#Minister_for_Education_and_Science" eId="spk_804">
            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Batt O’Keeffe)</from>
            <p eId="para_4821">Section 23 of the Education Welfare Act 2000 requires all schools to have in place a Code of Behaviour.  My Department further requires each school to have in place a policy which includes specific measures to deal with bullying behaviour, within the framework of its overall school Code of Behaviour and Discipline. Such a code, developed through consultation with the whole school community and properly implemented, can be the most influential measure in countering bullying behaviour in schools. I have no plans to introduce additional legislation of the nature referred to by  the Deputy. I am, however, intent on supporting schools in tackling bullying and it is for that reason that a number measures and supports have been put in place in recent years.</p>
            <p eId="para_4822">Responsibility for tackling bullying falls to the level of the individual school as it is at local level that an effective anti-bullying climate must be established. My Department has issued guidelines as an aid to schools in devising measures to prevent and deal with instances of bullying behaviour and to increase awareness among school management authorities of their responsibilities in this regard. These guidelines were drawn up following consultation with representatives of school management, teachers and parents, and are sufficiently flexible to allow each school authority to adapt them to suit the particular needs of their school.</p>
            <p eId="para_4823">In 2007 my Department published, on its website, policy templates for post-primary schools in five key areas, including anti-bullying. The template documents are not prescriptive, but rather highlight possible approaches and potential material for inclusion in school policies and takes account of more recent legislative and regulatory changes. Reference is also made to issues of contemporary concern such as the need to tackle text bullying, cyber-bullying and homophobic bullying. The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) has developed further guidelines for schools on Codes of Behaviour, as provided for under section 23 of the Education (Welfare) Act 2000. These guidelines have been informed by broad consultation.</p>
            <p eId="para_4824">I have previously indicated that once schools have had an opportunity to familiarise themselves with the NEWB Guidelines, my Department will commence the process of revising and updating its own Guidelines. This review will commence shortly and will take into account issues such as legislative developments, the involvement of the support services available to schools, technological advancements such as use of the Internet, e-mail, mobile phones and camera phones and the latest developments in international best practice on dealing with bullying behaviour. The National Behaviour Support Service (NBSS) was established in 2006 in response to the recommendation in "School Matters", the report of the Task Force on Student Behaviour in Second Level Schools. The NBSS is currently working with over 60 Post Primary Schools to promote and support positive student behaviour.</p>
            <p eId="para_4825">The National Centre for Technology in Education's Webwise Internet Safety initiative includes an integrated educational programme with the following elements:</p>
            <p eId="para_4826">1. The development of an integrated educational programme in partnership with the SPHE Support Service called — Be Safe<u>  </u>Be Webwise, which is delivered in the context of the SPHE module on Personal Safety by the SPHE Second Level Support Service.</p>
            <p eId="para_4827">2. Delivery of Internet Safety Seminars for parents in schools in partnership with the National Parents Council Primary.</p>
            <p eId="para_4828">3. Provision of Internet safety continuing professional development training for teachers.</p>
            <p eId="para_4829">4. The Watch Your Space awareness campaign, which was launched in February 2007 seeks to raise awareness and promote safe, responsible practice by young people when on-line. The campaign has a strong peer-to-peer perspective and centres on an interactive on-line service, www.watchyourspace.ie developed by the NCTE. This site offers practical tips and advice and supports teenagers who use the web. A key feature is the advice given from teenagers to teenagers on how to cope with the fall-out from abuses and misuse of social networking and picture-sharing websites.</p>
            <p eId="para_4830">The EU Safer Internet Programme campaign WATCH<u>  </u>YOUR<u>  </u>SPACE — STOP CYBERBULLYING was launched earlier this year. This social marketing campaign, combined blanket and targeted messages delivered through a wide range of media channels and involving children and young people themselves, to the promotion of effective responses to cyberbullying by young people. In Ireland, the campaign included an on-line source of information and advice for young people, watchyourspace.ie, and the TEENTXT active listening service of the ISPCC.</p>
            <p eId="para_4831">Dealing with bullying has also been incorporated in training for principals through the Leadership Development for Schools programme.The education of students in both primary and post-primary schools in relation to anti-bullying behaviour is part of the SPHE curriculum. SPHE is now a compulsory subject both at primary level and in the junior cycle of post-primary schools.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science (Deputy Seán Haughey)</from>
            <p eId="para_4835">The data sought by the Deputy will be forwarded directly to him shortly. My Department has adopted a broad-based approach to tackling early school leaving. This includes the establishment of the National Educational Welfare Board, under the Education Welfare Act, 2000, to monitor attendance and help to get young people back to school. Targeted interventions include the School Completion Programme, Home School Community Liaison services, visiting teacher service, additional funding for pupils at risk of early school leaving and alternative curricular options.</p>
            <p eId="para_4836">Enhancing attendance, progression, retention and attainment are central elements of DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the Action Plan for Educational Inclusion. In the current school year, €18.3m was paid in grants to schools to meet the needs of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds under DEIS. €31 million has been allocated to the School Completion Programme which contains strategies for the whole-school, targeted strategies for individual students, and those who are already outside of the formal system. Provision includes in-school, after-school and holiday time supports to enhance the young person's readiness to benefit from education. In the region of €32 million has been allocated to Home School Community Liaison, which focuses  directly on the salient adults in children's educational lives, seeking indirect benefits for the children themselves and works to involve parents in their children's education which is a crucial component in convincing young people of the value of education. HSC coordinators are assigned on a full time or shared basis between schools and are deployed to do full-time home school community liaison duties.</p>
            <p eId="para_4837">Progression from primary to second-level is recognised as a crucial transition period in a child's education. Under the DEIS action plan, a continuing emphasis is placed on the development of effective transfer programmes by building on the existing work of the Home School Community Liaison Scheme and the School Completion Programme. My Department have widened the range of curricula available to students by promoting the Junior Certificate Schools Programme, the Leaving Certificate Vocational Programme, and the Leaving Certificate Applied Programme in addition to the traditional Junior and Leaving Certificate curricula. In addition to the NEWB, there are currently in excess of 600 staff within the education sector working in various educational disadvantage programmes of which over 130 are additional posts allocated under DEIS.</p>
            <p eId="para_4838">On Monday 18 May, I announced that from the start of the next school year in September 2009, a single coordinated School Support Programme involving the Home School Community Liaison Scheme (HSCL), the School Completion Programme (SCP) and the Visiting Teachers Service for Travellers (VTST) will be integrated under the NEWB. This development will put in place structures to facilitate closer integration of the services at local, regional and national levels, increase effectiveness and help bring about real and meaningful improvements in services to confront in a cohesive way the underlying causes that impact negatively on the school life of children, particularly as they relate to school attendance, retention and attainment. I would like to assure the Deputy that we have greatly intensified our efforts in recent years to keep more young people in school and I will continue to prioritise further progress in this area.</p>

            <p eId="para_4842">The funding (including capital) being made available by my Department in 2009 for research and development activities amounts to some €150 million. This includes an allocation of over €90 million for the Programme for Research in Third Level Institutions (PRTLI) and will allow projects under Cycle 4 of the PRTLI to proceed as planned. The Irish Research Council for Humanities and Social Sciences and the Irish Research Council for Science, Engineering and Technology have both received an increased allocation on last year's funding which will enable a continuation of their various scholarship and fellowship programmes, although there may be some decrease in the numbers of awards made in 2009 compared with 2008. €26 million is being provided this year to projects under the Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF), the largest annual allocation under the Fund to date. This funding will allow projects under both cycles of SIF to continue, however some slow-down of activity on approved projects may be required to remain within this overall funding provision.</p>

         the number of researchers or research projects funded by strand one funding by the Higher Education Authority each year since the funding was introduced; the level of funding allocated under strand one to date; if this type of funding will be available in 2009; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4844">I understand that the Deputy is referring to the Technological Sector Research Programme, which provides funding for research activities in the Institutes of Technology and the Dublin Institute of Technology.  The first of the three strands of this programme provides funding on a multi-annual basis for the training in research and development skills for graduates undertaking a Masters degree.</p>
            <p eId="para_4845">The number of awards and annual expenditure under this strand of the programme for the years 2000 to 2008, inclusive, are outlined in the following chart.  The funding being provided to the overall programme in 2009 amounts to €6.6 million which will be allocated by the institutes across the three strands of the programme.  I understand that the level of funding will be sufficient to meet commitments to existing award holders.</p>
            <p eId="para_4846">I would also like to inform the Deputy that the HEA has commissioned a review of the Technological Sector Research Programme and this report will be available to my Department in the near future.</p>

            <p eId="para_4910">I am committed to providing information in relation to the allocation of teachers to schools and as a new feature on my Department's website.  The process has begun with the provision earlier this year of initial information on the allocation of mainstream classroom teachers to primary schools under the revised schedule for 2009/10.</p>
            <p eId="para_4911">In terms of the position at individual primary school level the key factor for determining the level of resources provided by my Department is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2008.  The annual process of seeking this enrolment data from schools took place in the autumn and the data has since been received and processed in my Department enabling the commencement of the processes by which teaching resources are allocated to schools for the school year that begins next September.</p>
            <p eId="para_4912">My Department has written to the primary schools that are projected to have a net loss or gain in classroom teaching posts in September, 2009.  As part of my efforts to ensure that relevant information is openly available to the public detailed information on the opening position for primary schools is now published on my Department's website.  This provisional list sets out the details on individual schools that, taken collectively, are projected to gain 128 posts and to lose 382 posts — a net reduction of 254 posts.  It is my intention to have this information updated and ultimately to set out the final position when the allocation processes are completed.</p>
            <p eId="para_4913">The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.  The operation of redeployment arrangements also impacts on the final position as a teacher can remain in his or her existing school where a suitable redeployment position does not exist.  The final staffing position for all schools will therefore not be known until the autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and appeals to the Staffing Appeals Board will have been considered.</p>
            <p eId="para_4914">At this time the priority for my Department within the resources available to it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner.  Diverting resources in order to create staffing profiles for the schools in the area referred to by the Deputy, could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.</p>

            <p eId="para_4927">The number of permanent teaching posts available in VEC schemes at any one time is determined in accordance with the agreed criteria relating to the application of the pupil teacher ratio.  It is a matter for the individual VEC scheme, as employer, to determine whether any particular post when vacated may be filled on a permanent basis.  The number of permanent whole-time appointments in each VEC over the past ten years is therefore not readily available within my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_4928">The information recorded on the database for secondary and community / comprehensive schools indicates that there were 14,870 appointments to permanent posts in the 2000/2001 school year in Secondary and Community/ Comprehensive schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4929">In recent years the school managerial authorities have awarded contracts of indefinite duration to whole time and regular part-time teachers employed in their schools to comply with the agreed terms of the Fixed Term Act, 2003.  In the current school year there are 15,339 holders of contracts of indefinite duration and permanent posts in secondary and community/comprehensive schools.</p>
            <p eId="para_4930">When deciding on the number of teaching posts, if any, which may be filled in a permanent capacity in a particular school year, the school authorities must take account of the approved teacher allocation for the school for that year, the number of permanent teachers currently employed, including those on approved leave, the overall limits as to the level of permanency as agreed from time to time and the need for flexibility to cater for the needs of all of the pupils attending the school.  The assignment of teachers to individual classes within the overall approved allocation is a matter for the authorities of the school concerned.</p>

            <p eId="para_4940">The Institutes of Technology are autonomous statutory bodies.  Under the terms of the Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006, the governance and day-to-day management of the institutions, including procedures for dealing with allegations of bullying and harassment, are matters for which the Governing Bodies and the management of the relevant institutions are responsible.  As employers all of the institutes of technology have in place formal procedures for dealing with allegations of bullying and harassment which provide for investigation of such matters by a third party.  Any staff member who is not satisfied with the outcome of an investigation has a right of appeal to a Rights Commissioner.  The Employment Equality Acts and Health and Safety legislation place specific obligations on employers in relation to protection from harassment and promoting the health and safety of their workers, who have rights and are entitled to due process.  Investigations into allegations of bullying and harassment, by their nature, can sometimes be lengthy and costly because due process is required.</p>

            <p eId="para_4948">The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. Decisions were made in order to control expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long term. In this respect my Department, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be  entirely spared, and I acknowledge the impact of funding restrictions in a number of areas, including at school level. However, these are the inevitable result of the challenging economic environment and the need to manage Exchequer resources prudently. These decisions included the withdrawal of teaching posts which have been historically provided under previous disadvantage schemes to non-DEIS schools and the increasing of the pupil teacher ratio across all second-level schools from 18:1 to 19:1. In the case of fee-charging post-primary schools, there will be an additional one-point adjustment to 20:1.</p>
            <p eId="para_4949">Teacher allocations to all VEC schools are approved annually by my Department in accordance with established rules based on recognised pupil enrolment. In accordance with these rules each VEC is required to organise its subject options within the limit of its approved teacher allocation. The deployment of teaching staff, the range of subjects offered and ultimately the quality of teaching and learning are in the first instance a matter for the VEC's.</p>
            <p eId="para_4950">In accordance with existing arrangements, where a school management authority is unable to meet its curricular commitments within its approved allocation, my Department considers applications for additional short term support i.e. curricular concessions.  This concession is available as a short term support to enable essential curricular provision to continue. An application for curricular concessions was received in my Department from the VEC concerned. The VEC has been notified of the outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_4951">The allocation processes also include appellate mechanisms under which VEC's can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. The CEO of a VEC can submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board which was established specifically to adjudicate on appeals on staffing allocations in post-primary schools. This Board operates independently of my Department.  Discrete allocations are also made to VEC schools to cater for pupils with Special Educational Needs and those with Language difficulties for example.</p>

        <b>Deputy Emmet Stagg</b>
         asked the 
        <b>Minister for Education and Science</b>
         the reason he is prepared to stand over the situation whereby students in County Kildare are not paid a third level grant for an Erasmus year whilst others in the same course and from different counties in the State such as Fingal, Mayo and Tipperary are paid the grant; and his views on whether the Central Applications Office booklets were deficient in respect of this course and that the Erasmus year is an integral part of the degree course.

            <p eId="para_4957">With regard to study abroad, clause 7.3 of the Higher Education Grant Scheme states:</p>
            <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4958">"Where grantholders as part of their approved course, are required to attend foreign university courses for a period of up to one year, a maintenance grant may continue to be paid where the period abroad does not affect the normal duration of the approved course".</p>
            <p eId="para_4959">The candidate referred to by the Deputy appealed Kildare County Council's decision not to award a Higher Education Grant for her Erasmus Year to my Department. The decision of the assessing authority in this case was upheld on appeal.  Where the Erasmus Programme is an integral part of the approved course of study it is funded by my Department. Further examination of the status of the Erasmus component of the course which this candidate is pursuing is being undertaken and the candidate in question will be notified of the outcome of this examination.  The higher education institutions in the State have delegated to CAO the task of processing centrally applications to their first-year undergraduate courses.</p>

         his views on the De Buitléir Report on Student Support 1993 and its principal recommendation that there be an assets based means test in the determination of eligibility for student support; his further views on recommendation 51 of the OECD Report on Higher Education 2004 in favour of the De Buitléir proposal and its view that the adoption of this scheme was an essential feature of any policy to bring back student tuition fees at third level; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_4963">The Report of the Advisory Committee on Third-Level Student Support which was chaired by Dónal de Buitléir was published in February, 1995 and included a number of recommendations, some of which have already been implemented.  The issue of introducing an assessment of capital assets for the purposes of determining eligibility for student grants was among the issues considered and recommended by the report.  The schemes of student support are currently under review in the context of the Programme of Administrative and Legislative Reform of Student Grants.  The development of a single unified scheme and the means testing arrangements are being considered in this context.</p>
            <p eId="para_4964">As the Deputy will be aware, I am currently finalising a review of policy options relating to the introduction of a form of student contribution. There are many complex and competing considerations involved. These include considerations relating to institutional funding, family affordability, equity, participation and value for money for the taxpayer. However, it is an issue that merits consideration at this important juncture in the development of higher education and also given the current economic circumstances.</p>
            <p eId="para_4965">My officials are finalising a technical report on the various options available. This will look at available models and reports, including the OECD report referred to by the Deputy. It will assess the potential policy, cost and revenue impacts of various available approaches in an Irish context. I will be providing the completed technical report to my Cabinet colleagues for consideration in the near future. As the Deputy will appreciate, I do not wish to pre-empt any decisions of Government in relation to these matters.</p>
