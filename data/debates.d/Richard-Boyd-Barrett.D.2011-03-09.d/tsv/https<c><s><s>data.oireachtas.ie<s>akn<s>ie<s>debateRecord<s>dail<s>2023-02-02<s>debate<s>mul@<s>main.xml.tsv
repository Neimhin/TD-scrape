RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the Tánaiste explain to the public why successive Fianna Fáil- and Fine Gael-led Governments, including many he was a part of, have pursued a systematic strategy over many years of denying rights and entitlements to vulnerable people and to people who have been wronged by the State, often pursuing a very hostile, cynical legal strategy to deny people their rights? Vulnerable people in long-term residential care with disabilities were denied their disability allowances; before that we had women affected by CervicalCheck and scandals subjected to a very hostile legal strategy. Last night, we had the Government yet again excluding tens of thousands of mothers and children who were victims of the abuse by church and State in mother and baby homes, arbitrarily and unjustifiably excluded from the redress scheme. Then, of course, there is the scandal of the nursing homes fees wrongly levied on vulnerable, often elderly, unwell people. The Government has fought them every step of the way, legally and otherwise, to deny them their rights and entitlements and has used legal strategies to prevent them from getting those entitlements and to hush them up in instances where it was forced, because of legal action, to acknowledge the refunds to which they were entitled. I ask the Tánaiste this very particularly as he was Minister for Health between 2000 and 2004. In that year, the Report on Nursing Home Subventions was laid before him containing 70 pages detailing how successive Governments knew that the fees being charged in nursing homes were illegal, that there was no legal basis for them-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	2001. By the way the report also found, and this is important, that people who had gone to private nursing homes were, in fact, entitled to public nursing home care but none were available to them and they were forced into the private system. The Tánaiste is still saying these people were not entitled to this care when that report made it clear that they were. Another report in 2003 by the Human Rights Commission said the same thing. There was another report in 2010 by the Ombudsman, entitled Who Cares?, while the Tánaiste was Minister in the Government. Where was his moral compass when it came to acknowledging the rights and entitlements of vulnerable people? How could he treat people in that disgusting fashion?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did the Tánaiste read this report in 2001? It made very clear that successive Governments, including the one he was part of, knew that the basis on which these charges were being levied had no legal basis. He has gone on to repeat what the Taoiseach said earlier this week about the State still not conceding that people who were in private nursing homes but had medical cards had the right to have the fees paid. The Ombudsman report I am referring to noted in 2001, when the Tánaiste was the Minister for Health: "The health boards appear to be directing such patients and their families towards private care without in anyway acknowledging the boards' own responsibilities in this area." People were being forced into private nursing homes because the State had failed to provide them the public nursing home care they were entitled to and the Tánaiste knew this. He knew the charges that were being levied had no legal basis long before courts made decisions on it and he did nothing about it. Vulnerable people had to fight and face hostile legal strategies. It is immoral.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome President Metsola to Dublin and Ireland. I welcome her commitment to supporting continued peace on this island and to preventing any return to a hard border in this country. I also welcome her comments about the need to address the cost-of-living and housing crises that are gripping Europe and significantly impacting this country. I have to say, however, that it is long past time the European institutions acknowledged the role they played, particularly in response to the economic crisis after 2008 and the decision of the Troika to impose swingeing, cruel and brutal austerity in this country. That is not an historical matter and it has left us with a dire and cruel housing crisis that is inflicting utter misery on record numbers of people in homeless accommodation and tens of thousands of people who are affected by the lack of affordable and public housing. Europe has a great responsibility for the decisions it made in that regard, which also affected the crisis that continues to grip our health service as we were forced to cull thousands of health workers. That has left us a grim legacy in our health services, which are overrun. I also want to question the assertion President Metsola made about "a superpower of values" and principles. She rightly condemns Vladimir Putin's brutal and invasion of and inexcusable and criminal warmongering in Ukraine, but fails at the same time to condemn the crimes against humanity and the apartheid system that Israel is perpetrating against the Palestinian people, as was recently publicised by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories. When she went to the Knesset in May last year she did not say a word about the illegal occupation of Palestinian territory and did not condemn the apartheid regime. The European Union does not call for sanctions in the way it has called for them against Russia.It is does not assert the legitimacy of the Palestinian people's right to resist an illegal occupation of their land and territory and the criminal apartheid regime that is imposed on them. Those double standards cannot stand. That is not a superpower of principles but one of double standards. Ms Metsola will know that six MEPs from the parliament of which she is president were denied access to go in to monitor the crimes of Israel against the Palestinian people. The humans rights organisations in Palestine wrote to her asking her to speak out against that, which she has failed to do. We need consistency and real principles when it comes to these matters.
