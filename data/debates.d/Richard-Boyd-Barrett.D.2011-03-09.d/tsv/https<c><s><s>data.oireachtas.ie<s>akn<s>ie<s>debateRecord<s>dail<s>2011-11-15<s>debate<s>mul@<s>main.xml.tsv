RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is bad enough that we have effectively seen a political coup d’état by the markets and the troika in Italy and Greece in recent weeks and all the suffering resulting from these so-called fiscal adjustments but is there any recognition on the Minister’s part, as projected growth rates for Europe are being downgraded on a daily basis, that the austerity might not be working?  Does the Minister agree that our ability to deal with deficit problems or even meet the terms of the troika agreement are dependent on economic growth when it is obvious that economic growth is being crippled in the eurozone?  Is there any recognition on the Minister’s part or that of the troika that no matter what they do it is resulting in the contraction of the European economy which will throw all plans for this economy and that of Europe off course?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking about fiscal adjustment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To what does the Minister ascribe the contraction?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about Spain and Britain?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not understand how property transferred or sold by NAMA can contribute to dealing with the 93,000 people on housing lists when the Government announced over the summer that there would be no more direct building of council housing.  Will the Minister square that circle for me?  Will the Minister also explain the economic rationale behind local authorities leasing properties from NAMA, as the rental income will go back to NAMA or developers and not the authorities?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are the ones who are interrupting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the fish——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was raised in the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach agree with the saying which an old Jewish socialist comrade of mine used to say, that the fish rots from the head, that is, that responsibility lies at the top?  In so far as the Taoiseach has put an emphasis on employment as a priority for this Government, in the programme for Government and in many statements in this House since, does he agree that if we do not make a serious dent in unemployment, of which there is no sign thus far, that he will have failed and that he is responsible?  What precisely in the programme for Government or in the policies the Taoiseach has enunciated since will make a serious dent on the unemployment crisis and when will they do so?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am baffled by the statement the Taoiseach made earlier.  Somebody should analyse it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Please, a Cheann Comhairle, I am almost finished.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is unbelievable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have almost finished my question.  The Taoiseach said that reducing costs in the health service — by which I presume he means staff cuts and so on — will improve our competitiveness and is somehow linked to our export recovery.  That connection baffles me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How do cuts in health spending help our competitiveness, improve employment prospects or contribute to export-led recovery?  It is a baffling assertion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How will that enhance competitiveness and exports?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What does that have to do with exports?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Chair, I——
