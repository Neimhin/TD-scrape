RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Whatever about the finer details and implications of the matters concerning the Tánaiste yesterday, one implication is definitely that there are many groups of workers who are scratching their heads and wishing that they had such matey backchannels with the Tánaiste or Taoiseach of the day. One of those groups of workers that the Taoiseach has suggested it is in his DNA to communicate with is the Debenhams workers who have now been seven months on the picket line fighting for a just redundancy as we face into the winter months. They certainly have not enjoyed the level of access and communication they would like. Deputy Barry has sent an invitation to all Oireachtas Members to an online briefing at 2 o'clock today where the shop stewards will brief Oireachtas Members. They are hoping the Taoiseach or representatives from his office and the Tánaiste can make it to hear about their plight. One very important development is that KPMG, in an action that I regard as bullying and trying to demoralise these heroic, brave, decent, hard-working and mostly women workers, is threatening to walk away from the liquidation process, offering them an even more insulting €500,000 when an already insulting €1 million was previously offered. It is suggesting that if the workers do not take this, nothing will be left for creditors, meaning even the State could lose out.That should make the Government sit up and act in a way that it has so far failed to do to intervene for these workers, since Debenhams is effectively threatening the State as a creditor. All this is based on spurious claims which are being discussed at the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, the failure of the Government to implement the Duffy-Cahill report and the way that companies like Debenhams hide assets which should be used in this case to pay a decent redundancy to workers. The online business and other Debenhams assets have been hidden even though Debenhams stood in court in April and said that an online business worth at least €30 million was an asset of the Irish company, which it is now claiming is an asset of the British company. All this is contrived to deny these workers a just redundancy and now, possibly, to rob Revenue and the State of money. Will this finally prompt the Taoiseach to engage with the Debenhams shop stewards to force the liquidator to sit down with those shop stewards to secure a just settlement where the actual, real assets of the company are used to give them the just redundancy and save them from having to stay on the picket line for the coming winter months?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach has an invitation to meet the shop stewards today to hear directly from them. They are also holding an online mass meeting on Thursday. The Taoiseach is also invited to that and they would be very happy for him to attend to hear from them. Successive Governments failed to legislate for Duffy-Cahill and now the Debenhams workers find themselves in a situation where a company is once again hiding assets. They are furious that the Government, Revenue and the liquidator show no interest in the fact that the directors of Debenhams Ireland stated explicitly that the online business worth €30 million in 2018, and almost certainly more in 2019, has not been pursued while Debenhams says it has nothing, even though the balance sheet that it put forward in court during pre-liquidation showed a balance of €30 million as at the end of 2019. That is three times more than would be necessary to pay the workers their just redundancy yet neither the Government nor the liquidator shows any interest in pursuing these assets from a company that swore in court that it had those assets but then, a few weeks later, magicked those assets over to Britain, pretending they did not exist. They are asking the State to go after those assets to pay the just redundancy as well as Revenue the money that Debenhams owes them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to ask the Taoiseach about the Land Development Agency. In my area, the councillors on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council are going to be asked to vote for the disposal of public land to the Land Development Agency, supposedly to build social and affordable housing, which we and others have campaigned for on the Shanganagh Castle site for a long time. There is, however, absolutely no statutory basis to the Land Development Agency, LDA. I do not know why on earth councillors in Dún Laoghaire or anywhere else would vote to hand over public land, which could be used for public and genuinely affordable housing, to an agency that does not have a statutory basis but which seems, essentially, geared up to privatise parts of public land. This is supposedly to deliver some public and affordable housing but in reality could be a back door to privatising parts of those many public sites that should be developed for public and genuinely affordable housing. We also have no idea what genuinely affordable housing will be via the LDA. I do not see why we need the agency. Will the Taoiseach clarify when the LDA will be put on a statutory basis or when we will even get to discuss these things? Why on earth should any public land be disposed of to this body until it is absolutely clear what the agency is going to do and that there will be no question of privatising public lands that should be used to help address the massive housing crisis that persists in this country due to the chronic lack of public and affordable housing, which is the responsibility of successive governments that have landed us with the housing crisis we now face?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	After the debate that took place on mother and baby homes in the Dáil, we, like many other Deputies, were overwhelmed by the response from people and the anger, anxiety and concern expressed, particularly by those who had been in those institutions and suffered abuse in them. I held an online public meeting which was attended by hundreds of people, many of whom had suffered horrific abuse and who were very angry. Their anger can only have been magnified by the information that has emerged since then that the Minister misled the House about the advice from the Attorney General. There was no advice. The suggestion was made that GDPR did not apply under the condition that it might jeopardise the work of this or future commissions, but that was not a basis under GDPR. Why did the Minister claim he got this advice from the Attorney General? Why did he claim something that simply was not true, when GDPR did not do as he suggested it did? He wrongly suggested that it applied in a certain way. More generally, what was expressed by the survivors and those who had a stake in this matter was how angry they were that they were not consulted, were not part of the process and were not at the centre of the Government's considerations on how to deal with this matter.Even with the matter of the proposed archive, what is said by the survivors is that this is the place that the narrative will be set about their lives and histories. They, not somebody else, and not so-called experts, want to determine that narrative. They want to determine the narrative about their lives and histories. They want to have a real stake and involvement in how that archive is operated. Even now, after the admission following the Data Protection Commissioner's intervention in the debate, the Taoiseach or the Minister said that the right to people's information and history is not absolute. That is worrying. The Government misled the House about GDPR and then said that a person's right to identity and history is not absolute. All of that adds to the suspicion of a group of people who have been robbed of histories and identities and been abused. There needs to be an admission that what was said was wrong and the needs, wishes and direct involvement of the survivors of the process, and the people whose identity and history are at stake, need to be at the centre of how we deal with this matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to apologise to the ambulance paramedics because I meant to raise this matter last night in the context of the debate with the Tánaiste. There are many angles to that discussion, but one is the attitude the Government takes to negotiating with trade unions or representative organisations. A huge contrast was glaringly apparent, and this is directly related to the issue of social dialogue. At around the same time that the then Taoiseach was sending backchannel packages to his mate in the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, he was refusing repeated requests from Deputy Bríd Smith, former Deputy Ruth Coppinger and others to engage with the National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, the ambulance paramedics. The then Taoiseach said explicitly at the time that one could join whatever union one wishes to join, but it does not have to be recognised. The HSE does not have to recognise it. The then Taoiseach refused the requests to instruct the HSE to engage with the ambulance paramedics and said - this is relevant to the evidence the Tánaiste gave yesterday - that the Government engages with the trade union movement through ICTU. That was the Government policy. I do not agree with that policy. I believe it should engage with the organisations by whom workers choose to be represented. Clearly, however, the then Taoiseach did not abide by that policy. He operated a backchannel to his mate in the NAGP but would not extend the same courtesy to the ambulance paramedics, who are still denied recognition by the HSE. What does the Taoiseach think of that in terms of double standards and not being willing to recognise the chosen representatives of a group of workers, in this case ambulance paramedics? I wish to make a second point. On 20 October, I raised with the Taoiseach the issue of student nurses and the failure to pay them. They were given healthcare assistant pay in March and April, rightly, for the major role they were playing in the dangerous environment of Covid-19. The Taoiseach said that they should get the pay they got in March and April and that he would follow through on it. Nothing has happened since then. When I asked the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, last night about paying these student nurses, he essentially made it clear that it was not the Government's intention. These student nurses are, in many cases, holding hospital wards and health workplaces together in the context of Covid-19, in which massive numbers of employed staff are out of work because of extraordinarily high levels of infection with Covid-19 among nurses and healthcare assistants. It is unacceptable that we continue to exploit them when they are holding workplaces together on the front line in dealing with Covid-19. There is much anger among student nurses about this. The Taoiseach should follow through on the commitment he made to me on 20 October and ensure that the exploitation of student nurses ends and that they are given the respect and remuneration they deserve for the role they are playing in the fight against Covid-19.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	NASRA is not doing that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am something of a political nerd when it comes to finance Bills. I am fascinated by the way they provide a mechanism to transfer the wealth generated by society and by working people into the hands of the very wealthy in an opaque manner, year after year. For the most part, working people do not know the details of how they are being robbed of the wealth they collectively produce. I play a game with the finance Bill every year in which I try to find the tax relief that will benefit the rich. I then try to find the sneaky tax that will punish the poor. It is a game I strongly recommend people who care about injustice in society learn to play. They would learn a lot by examining these opaque mechanisms through which the very rich and big business rob the poor. They do so by not paying a fair contribution in tax on the enormous wealth they acquire through profits generated by working people, working people who have to pay their taxes because they are taken directly out of their pay packets every week. Many of the very wealthiest people, who own some of the biggest and wealthiest companies, effectively write their own tax bills. Year after year, finance Bills provide a mechanism for the wealthy to avoid paying tax, either through omission, by failing to discontinue tax reliefs given in previous years, or through proactive moves. I want to talk about specific instances of that phenomenon. I should mention some of the highlights, most of which were mentioned in the main budget discussions. If for no other reason, we will be opposing the Finance Bill 2020 because of the carbon tax. It is the latest in a long line of regressive taxes which punish ordinary people, often on the grounds of protecting the environment as in the case of bin charges and the attempt to bring in water charges. In fact they are just ways of regressively taxing working people for things that are not their fault but the fault of other people. That is what the carbon tax does. The net effect of the €7.50 increase in carbon tax this year will cost ordinary people about €60 or €70 a year. Increasing carbon tax by €60 or €70 every year up to the targets proposed will slowly chip away at the income of ordinarily people, disproportionately hitting the poorest as a substitute for taxing the polluting corporations that do the real damage. We do not want to tax them. In fact we go out of our way to make sure they do not pay taxes by providing them with a multiplicity of tax breaks. Because we will not do that, we tax people who live in council houses they are not even allowed to retrofit. Such people cannot do anything to reduce their energy bills until the local councils decide to retrofit their homes, but they are going to be punished with additional energy costs to keep their houses warm. People are going to be punished for the fact that they cannot afford electric cars. A wealthy person can afford a brand new electric car, but someone who does not have the money for that will be punished for it year after year on a progressive basis. That is one reason we will be opposing the Bill. The employment wage subsidy scheme is another major issue. We welcomed and supported the measures to support people's incomes and maintain their relationships with their employers. There is an interesting contrast with the case of Debenhams workers. We are looking for €10 million for them to get their two plus two. We cannot get it because it is too much to ask, it will set desperate precedents, etc. However, Boston Scientific, a major multinational company that produces medical equipment, was fully operational during the pandemic but it benefited from the temporary Covid-19 wage subsidy scheme. This company is hugely profitable but fiddled around with its manufacturing process to meet the required 25% reduction in turnover and benefited from the scheme as a result. A range of quite profitable companies are benefiting. I support any Government measure to keep people employed and to maintain their relationship with their employers, but there should be oversight over companies' cash reserves, their ability to contribute and any top-ups they are making. Are the CEOs and executives of these companies paying themselves massive salaries? Are they operating offshore in order to avoid tax? Those oversights were not imposed on many very profitable and wealthy companies that benefited from the subsidy schemes. Returning to my favourite game, I notice a couple of tax benefits for the rich. One was mentioned earlier. Section 48 provides a partial refund of stamp duty where land is developed for residential purposes. This extends from 24 months to 30 months the period in which construction must be completed for a developer to benefit. In layperson's terms that is a tax benefit for land hoarders and speculators, people who are already profiting very handsomely from our inflated housing market. That market benefits developers while the lack of public and affordable housing has the wider social effect of a housing crisis. I do not really understand this section 23, which provides for capital gains tax relief for individuals who dispose of assets of a qualifying business or shares in a qualifying company if they have owned them for three years in the five-year period before their disposal. I will not go into all the detail. We can do that on Committee Stage. However, that seems like another tax giveaway for the haves instead of the have-nots.That can be added to the litany of tax reliefs and allowances that allow very big corporations, some of the wealthiest corporations in the country which have seen their profits double in the past ten years from approximately €80 billion gross profit in 2008 to approximately €180 billion gross profits before tax deductions in 2020, to pay tax on only approximately €90 billion of those profits. They avail of tax loopholes for the other €90 billion. The loopholes include things such as the research and development tax grant, intra-group transactions and tax relief around amalgamations, which is another big one. Many of them are detailed in a very interesting list I have before me which is produced by Revenue. I wave it about every year. It lists all these tax reliefs which amount to approximately €20 billion or €30 billion per year. A tax relief I have highlighted for the past few years is that relating to intra-group transactions. That is how big multinational corporations essentially write down their tax bill by stating they owe money to another subsidiary of their company and therefore do not have to pay tax on those profits. Interestingly, that heading on this little Revenue list has changed and disappeared. I suspect that is because I keep highlighting it. It has gone from the list and been merged into a few other headings. It is worth pointing out that Pfizer has 27 subsidiaries in Ireland, Johnson & Johnson has 23, Merck has 23, Abbott Laboratories has 13, Thermo Fisher Scientific has eight, Gilead Sciences has seven, Boston Scientific has six and Eli Lilly has six. There are loads of companies that have a network of subsidiaries through which they organise their tax affairs basically by paying each other loans and money and royalties and all the rest in order that they end up paying little or no tax. I do not have time to go into all the details but it is a scandal. Every single year at budget time the House should be examining every single one of these tax reliefs, looking at who benefits from them and assessing what benefit, if any, is actually going to society. I think we would find they are of very little benefit to society. I will conclude on section 481 tax relief. I pay tribute to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, because he has genuinely listened on this issue and made genuine changes relating to the section 481 tax relief from which film production companies benefit to the tune of approximately €80 million each year, in addition to the approximately €20 million they get from Screen Ireland. That adds up to €100 million per year, or €1 billion over the past ten years, that has gone to the film industry, but how many people have actual permanent jobs of any description in the film industry? There may be 50 such jobs if we are lucky. At one stage, the people who get all this money appeared before an Oireachtas committee and stated there were 17,000 jobs. Members stated that was not true and that there were nothing like 17,000 jobs. The Department of Finance looked into it and discovered there were approximately 2,000 jobs, all of which were Strumpet City-style jobs. People would go down when the film was set up and ask if there was any chance of a job but be told that the film company did not really like them and would not give them a job. That is how the film industry in this country works. Nobody working in the industry has a pension or any basic entitlements in terms of continuity of service. One can work in the Irish film industry and be blacklisted tomorrow, as some people have been because they actually highlight these matters. Those people get absolutely nothing, but the State hands out very large sums of money totalling approximately €100 million each year. Deputies should not get me wrong. I want money to be put into the Irish film industry. In fact, I would not like a cent less to go into it. However, I believe the funding needs to be tied to ensuring there is proper employment, decent contracts, pensions and so on for those who work in the industry and a recognition of their service and the years they have worked in the industry, something that does not currently happen. In that regard, I point out to the Minister that, according to the Revenue figures, several of the big production companies get €10 million to €30 million on a production. It is probably a breach of the EU rules in terms of reporting state aid not to be sure whether they were given €10 million or €30 million of public money. That is unacceptable for a start, but those same companies have gone to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, in recent weeks and stated that they have no employees, that it is a designated activity company, DAC, that has the employees rather than the company that receives the money from the State. Despite the reforms the Minister brought in, the companies are still playing the same game of trying to hide behind the DAC and not take legal responsibility for their employees. That must stop. I appeal to the Minister to look further into how these companies are saying one thing on a declaration they are supposed to sign to get the relief and saying another thing when they go before the WRC.
