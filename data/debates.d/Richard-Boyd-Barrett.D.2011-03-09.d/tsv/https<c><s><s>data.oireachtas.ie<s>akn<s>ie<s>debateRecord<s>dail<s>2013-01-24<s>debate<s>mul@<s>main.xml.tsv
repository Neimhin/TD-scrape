RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Title is a misnomer as it is entirely incorrect to suggest the agreement will enhance the stability of the euro area. It will do precisely the opposite by further destabilising the Greek economy. It is likely that a slightly different or modified version of the model used here will be applied to Ireland in the near future. All of the models put forward thus far have failed because rather than delivering stability, they have brought devastation and instability. The Bill is misnamed and I do not support it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister of State mentioned, we have discussed much of this matter. However, I wish to underline a point in challenging the notion that this Bill will bring stability, as the Title suggests. I want to cut through the myth that the money in question is, for the most part, being invested in the Greek economy to make it function and to provide funding for services and citizens. This is not the fact. Some €29 billion of the amount involved will be used for bank recapitalisation. Yet again, we are bailing out the banks, not the Greek people. Just as in our case, the majority of our loans were for the banks. We did not take them on because we were spending too much, though. Like Greece, we bailed out our banks so that they could bail out German and French banks. The cost of the loans has been loaded onto the people, who must make significant interest payments, digging them deeper into a hole. The legislation before us should be called the "Control a Country Through the Use of Debt Bill". That is what it is about. Debt is control. If one can force a country into a position of indebtedness, one controls its economy. One can then asset strip that economy. This is what is happening in Greece and is beginning to happen in Ireland. Demands are being placed on us to sell our State assets. We have already gone a long way down the road of smashing up public services. We are doing what others want us to do, that being, to open our economy so that they can control it and buy our assets and markets at fire sale prices. This Bill is not about stability. It most certainly is not about bailing out the ordinary Greek people who have been crippled by the situation. The main opposition party in Greece and the many left-wing parties that oppose this Bill may well be in government soon. They do not consider it a bailout of the Greek people. Just in case there is any suggestion that those of us who oppose the Bill do not want to help the Greek people, I wish to say that it is precisely because we want to help them that we are opposing it. We want to stand in solidarity with the Greek people, who know that this is a debt noose around their necks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not agreeing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support many aspects of the Bill. A key provision is on the significant problem of deposit retention whereby landlords refuse to return deposits to tenants. It is very welcome that we should strengthen the law in this area to ensure landlords do not abuse tenants in this way. The biggest category of cases brought to the attention of the Private Residential Tenancies Board is deposit retention and this indicates a real problem. This is not to say all landlords are of the 19th century variety but sadly quite a few of them are. Anything which gives us stricter regulation in this area and safeguards the rights of tenants and their entitlement to get back their deposit is very much to be welcomed. On the issue of the non-payment of rent, obviously people should pay their rent and it is reasonable that landlords should expect rent to be paid. However, I am aware that a number of housing organisations believe people are in rent difficulties for all types of reasons, particularly in the current economic climate. I agree with this view as it has certainly been my experience in dealing with the many people coming to my clinic and I am sure other Deputies have the same experience. It is clear the difficult situation we are in is putting families in great difficulty with regard to paying rent. Many families are forced to make terrible choices between putting food on the table, paying electricity bills or paying the rent. We must have a regime which is humane in this regard and takes into account situations where people, for genuine reasons, fall into arrears. I do not know exactly what is the answer but these issues must be taken into account. We must assist people who are in difficulty and not take a hard line. I am a little concerned about this area and I understand groups such as Threshold and others are also concerned. When disputes arise about tenancies - a significant number of such cases are on my desk at present - while a hearing is awaited rent builds up and this can be a real difficulty. Several times I and others have raised an issue which contributes to the extreme difficulty for many tenants, namely, the reduction in rent caps for rent allowance. The Government does not seem to acknowledge it has got this wrong and that the rent caps applied are simply not appropriate in many parts of the country. Particular categories seem to be hit very hard in this regard such as single people in Dublin, particularly in south Dublin but I suspect in the centre of Dublin also. It is possible to obtain private rented accommodation in parts of Dublin within the rent cap and obtain rent allowance, but in many places it is impossible. I am not exaggerating, and perhaps the Minister of State knows this. Week in week out people come to my clinic in tears fearing that because of reductions in the rent caps and the refusal of landlords to reduce rent they face eviction and will find it impossible to find somewhere else to rent in the vicinity.Consequently, families - most often with young children - are faced with the prospect of entering the emergency homelessness system, which is awful. Something must be done about this because the situation is dire and getting worse.  In order to resolve this matter, quite a number of people are - sometimes with the tacit suggestion of community welfare officers - making arrangements with landlords to under declare the amount of rent that is being charged. They are getting rent allowance on the basis that it might be €925, but in fact the rent is €1,000 or €1,100 so they have to make up the difference. People are getting into extreme difficulty as a result. Further down the road, people are simply unable to pay the rent, so they find themselves in arrears. In that scenario pressure is put on them over non-payment of arrears, whereas it is not the tenant's fault but the fault of the Government and the inappropriateness and unfairness of rent cap reductions.  I can think of quite a few cases that are currently in that category. I know of one such case, although I will not name where it is. It is not even in my constituency, but slightly outside it. There is a terrible situation both for the landlord and the tenant, which has resulted directly from the reduction in rent caps. There is now a bitter dispute going on between the tenant and the landlord. The latter feels they are owed a lot of money going back several months. They are calculating the rent owed based on the original rent, whereas the tenant is saying, "All I can pay is the rent cap based on what I am getting in rent allowance and my ability to top that up. I can't pay the extra". Meanwhile, the landlord is claiming the tenant owes €5,000 or €6,000 while the tenant is says it is about €2,000. I will not say there have been pitched battles on the doorstep, but something akin to that. It is a nasty situation and both parties are somewhat innocent in this. That is because they are both victims of a situation that is essentially being created by the rent cap.  There must be real sensitivity, flexibility and awareness that people are often in rent arrears through no fault of their own or in some cases as a direct result of Government policies in this respect. I do not have the figures, although the Minister of State probably does, but I have plenty of anecdotal evidence that rent arrears have risen dramatically since the recession kicked in and austerity was imposed. It is completely understandable why that would be the case. The dire economic situation in which we find ourselves results directly in significant rent arrears for many families. We should not deal harshly with them because of arrears that are out of their control and arise from an economic situation that is not of their making.  I appeal to the Government to examine the rent cap issue in terms of rent allowances. It should be more area specific in that regard, although they may be appropriate. When I raised the issue previously with the Minister, she said many people have managed to get their landlords to reduce the rent. It is clear that while that is possible in some areas, it is not so in other areas. Rents are rising in parts of Dublin, so landlords are asking why should they bother reducing the rent when they can get somebody else to rent it at a higher rate. Ultimately, it will cost the State money if people have to go through the emergency housing system. That situation has to be examined.  The answer to many of these problems is the provision of social housing. The differential rent scheme takes into account people's various incomes depending on whether they are working or have lost income. Nonetheless, it is worrying that the Government and local authorities seem unclear as to whether the significant cost of the property tax will be loaded on top of council rents, particularly where council rent arrears have also grown significantly in recent years. The idea that a significant increase in council rents will result from the imposition of the property tax could put many people in serious difficulty. I call on the Government not to do that and urge it to avoid putting even more families into a difficult situation. As many housing organisations say, the ultimate solution to many of these problems is to provide a greater stock of social housing. That can be done either through an acceleration of the slow process of identifying properties in NAMA's control for social housing or through direct build, which is still required particularly in Dublin and some other urban centres. It is clear that in such centres we will soon have a housing shortage, notwithstanding the excess of housing in other parts of the country. The identification of social housing units by NAMA has been pitifully slow. It is difficult to get to the bottom of this, but I do not understand why so few houses are being identified by NAMA as suitable for social housing. I suspect it is happening because NAMA's mandate is to recover as much money as it possibly can. With rents beginning to rise in cities, NAMA probably figures it can get a higher return by renting those properties in the private market rather than giving them over to local authorities. It may even be sitting on properties in the hope that property prices will bounce back in the near future, although that is a forlorn hope. NAMA may also think it will sell off a lot of the properties and can thus get a bigger cash return quickly from them. Whatever the reasons, however, if we continue along the current road we are unlikely to get a significant dividend in terms of social and affordable housing from the NAMA properties unless the Government takes serious action to transfer some of that housing over.While I will not rehearse at length the economic argument, it has been stated repeatedly in this House that it would make financial and economic sense for the State and the Government to provide more social housing directly, either through acquiring NAMA properties or through the direct building of social housing. Whatever the initial capital costs might be, the Government would make huge savings on rent allowance payments that are going to landlords at present and this measure would draw rental revenue back into the State. This would mean, for example, that were we to set out with a housing programme to house the 100,000 families who currently are on the housing list within a reasonable period of five years, such a scheme could have paid for itself by the end of that five-year period. Beyond that, such a plan would generate additional revenue for the State or for the local authorities. I do not understand the reason the Government will not do this and the only excuse provided by the Government is that it lacks the initial capital. However, the National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, has money. What is that agency doing with its money? I attend the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and reform-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hold on a second. The NTMA is charged with investing the National Pensions Reserve Fund in a safe way to protect that money and get some return for the State. What could be safer and better for the economy than investing some of that money in a major direct-build social housing programme or refurbishment of NAMA, houses to make them suitable? This would put people back to work and would be guaranteed to achieve the return. This would be over the medium to long term but the National Pensions Reserve Fund is a medium to long-term fund and is not obliged to make an immediate return. Were the Government to invest now and build a particular number of houses for this number of council tenants, one could quantify exactly how much revenue it would get back. It is guaranteed and in the present situation, in which markets are all over the place and very few investments could be said to be safe, the provision of social housing is a safe investment. The Government would get the money back. While it would not get back massive profits, it would be a steady return that would wash its own face and, once the initial capital costs had been paid back, such a programme would derive additional revenue over the longer term for the State. I simply do not understand the reason the Government will not do this and I am sure the Labour Party-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I remind the Minister of State that in the 1950s, when Ireland was virtually a Third World country, 50% of the housing in the State was provided by the State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I do not mind a bit of engagement on this issue, because it must be debated.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not an excuse. I will not get into the debate on the debt but notwithstanding the rights and wrongs of how much Ireland is paying out, borrowing and all the rest, it still has investment funds, albeit perhaps not as much as one would wish. Nevertheless, such funds exist and the NTMA has money. As for going to the international markets to borrow money, I note that at present, Ireland is borrowing money to pay back the international markets. It is borrowing money from the markets to pay back to the markets, at interest. It is a win-win situation for them and a lose-lose situation for us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	However, notwithstanding that debate, we could go to financiers or even to the credit union movement, which has indicated it has a couple of billion quid it would like to invest. At present, the credit unions are obliged to invest this money out of the country because of various rules. The credit union movement has stated it would not mind investing in community or social projects. Why does the Government not talk to the credit union movement and agree to borrow that money from it? It would be at a low interest rate, which the credit unions are willing to accept because they simply wish to protect those moneys and get some return on them. The Government could use it for a major direct-build social housing programme on which it would get a guaranteed return. It is a safe bet and there is no risk. Moreover, a desperate social need would be met and people would be put back to work to boot, thereby boosting tax revenues to the State. It is an absolute win-win situation. It is a no-brainer and frankly, even a capitalist could work that one out and probably would lend the State money for such a programme. However, the credit union movement is one organisation that has offered to so do. The point about this proposal and where it relates to all this stuff and the problems with which the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, and tenants must deal is-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thought I could go on for as long as I wished.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to mention one measure to the Minister of State that the PRTB should be doing. It is a legal requirement that after January 2009, any dwelling that is rented should have an energy rating. However, this requirement is not being enforced. The State is training people in this area of energy rating, installation, retrofit and so on, but while 30 or 40 such individuals in my constituency will qualify in May 2013, there are no jobs for them because the requirement for energy ratings is not being enforced and, following on from that, a national installation programme is not being rolled out sufficiently rapidly. There would be an employment dividend in so doing, as well as a dividend for tenants, many of whom are living in substandard accommodation in which there is no proper insulation and where it is damp, cold and so on. The Government should examine this issue and should enforce what is the law. In addition, the Government would be obliged to control rents to ensure landlords did not pass on the cost of such enforcement to the tenants. The way to do this would be to roll out the pay-as-you-save scheme on installation in order that there would be an incentive for landlords to retrofit and insulate their homes without incurring a long-term cost.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about energy ratings?
