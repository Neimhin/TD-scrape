RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On matters that are of the most serious importance about allegations of widespread malpractice and possible criminal activity in the Garda on a range of fronts, the Minister's arrogance is breathtaking. His contempt for the public's intelligence is disgraceful. His line is that he did nothing wrong and it is everybody else's fault but his.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At every turn, including today, the Minister has tried to undermine the seriousness of these issues by impugning the character of anybody who raises those issues or questions his role in them. He tried to take pot shots at the Opposition rather than deal with the substance. He rubbished the whistleblowers who had the courage to speak out about widespread malpractice in the Garda. The Minister sacrificed the confidential recipient because he raised the most alarming suggestions about the Minister's demeanour when it came to the whistleblowers. He rubbished the competence of GSOC, the body supposed to oversee the Garda, when it came to the serious question of the bugging of GSOC. He now tries to claim that he is the great reforming Minister who wants an independent policing authority when less than a year ago he rubbished an attempt to bring forward a Bill by Deputy Wallace on the issue of an independent policing authority. Let us not forget that the character of two of the TDs who raised this issue at the outset were impugned in the most sinister circumstances with information, and, it would appear, connivance, at the most senior levels of the Garda. The Minister now has this situation where he expects us to believe, with all of this happening, with all the controversy surrounding his relationship with the former Commissioner, Mr. Callinan, that he receives a letter marked "urgent" from that same Commissioner and he does not open it. For five days, the Minister goes off on holidays to Mexico and he does not open it until Monday. The Minister is the last to know. That is incredible. Either the Minister is not telling the truth or it indicates a level of incompetence that is staggering. How could the former Garda Commissioner send the Minister a letter marked "urgent" for his attention and the Minister not open it? That is beyond belief. I will finish with this. To add to the long list of scandals which I have not time to go into, there is the shocking case, with which the Minister is familiar, of Cynthia Owen, a ten-year-old child raped, made pregnant and her baby murdered. Her representatives have asked the Minister to look into the sham of an investigation carried out by the Garda, with the most serious allegations that gardaí were involved in a cover-up-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----possibly involved in the substantive event itself, and the Minister fails even to meet her legal representatives to discuss the possibility of opening a serious investigation into that most heinous of crimes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has no credibility, none.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did nobody tell the Minister?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the answer to why the Minister was not notified on 10 March.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why was she not prepared to do so? Was it because it might have been bugged?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should have picked up the phone to the Minister, Deputy Shatter, and asked him what he knew.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is not much of it going around.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There should be no ambiguity about our attitude to the Russian actions in Ukraine. They should be condemned outright. President Putin’s regime is vile. It has been involved in vicious repression of the Pussy Riot movement and gay people and carried on a terrible and brutal campaign of Russian imperialism in the smaller nations surrounding Russia which has earned it the title, Prison House of Nations, which it still deserves. That imperial impulse is driving its actions in Ukraine. Russia should get out, as President Putin has no credibility. The hypocrisy of the European Union and the Government in the assessment of the situation in Ukraine is equally nauseating. The Taoiseach said, “Europe and the world need stability based on the fundamental principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity.” Presumably, the violation of these principles justifies sanctions. How can that be the case when, for example, Israel routinely, systematically, brutally and continually violates all of these principles and human rights, makes regular incursions into other sovereign states, affecting their territorial integrity, and Europe does not impose sanctions? Palestinians and many others have called for sanctions, but instead the European Union gives it privileged trade status, the opposite of sanctions, despite its vile breach of the principles the Taoiseach says we must uphold. That hypocrisy suggests this is not the real motive. These principles are a cover for the European Union engaging in a geopolitical battle to try to expand its borders at the expense of another geopolitical rival and being willing to play around in the most dangerous way with vile right-wing and neo-fascist forces inside Ukraine. There has been no outright condemnation of Svoboda and the Right Sector and all they stand for, in a worrying echo of what happened at the beginning of the First World War or Germany’s unilateral actions which pre-empted the war in the Balkans in the mid-1990s. I will keep raising my next point until it is acknowledged. Is there any discussion of social objectives in Europe, or this country, particularly homelessness, poverty and unemployment, in all of the discussions about banking union and bank resolution mechanisms? Will the Government acknowledge and discuss with its European partners how property and housing are again being deployed as speculative commodities, stoking a property bubble here reminiscent of the one that led to the crash? The banks and the Government are actively encouraging this with tax breaks for speculation, banks seizing properties to maximise their value and evicting people, leading to a crisis of homelessness. What is the Government stating about the human impact or the macroeconomic danger that represents? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is not out of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Minister of State to comment on the property sector.  I have spoken previously about the growing homelessness and housing crisis but the macroeconomic dimension of this issue has not been discussed.  I raised the issue with the Fiscal Advisory Council at the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform.  The council was introduced by the troika to monitor imbalances in the macroeconomic environment in this country.  It is alarming that we are putting in place property based tax incentives and that the Taoiseach is going to the United States and God knows where else to encourage big corporate investors to make money out of the housing crisis.  Large numbers of property assets currently in the hands of the State are being unloaded to these investors.  Alarm bells should be ringing in Europe in this regard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Government concerned about this or is anybody in Europe discussing it?  The point of the troika's intervention and the establishment of the Fiscal Advisory Council was supposedly to ensure these kinds of imbalances do not arise again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are these issues being discussed or is the focus solely on banks recovering value from asset portfolios?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chair only interrupts Members from the Technical Group.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have two questions. First, the Minister of State did not respond on the contrast between Europe's apparent concern in Ukraine to uphold territorial integrity and sovereignty as a fundamental principle, which is what the Taoiseach stated, and its absolute failure to do that in relation to Palestine. In fact, these are starkly contrasting approaches. One country gets sanctioned for breaching those principles while another country gets favourable trade status, not sanctions, despite repeated calls for sanctions. I would like to hear a comment on that. I accept there is another dimension to property and it concerns housing policy, which we will take up elsewhere. There is a major macroeconomic dimension at national and European levels and it is often forgotten in intricate discussions about European economic architecture that property was at the heart of the crash across Europe and the United States. For us not to see the issue as a central consideration when looking at the question of macroeconomic imbalances or potential warning bells about developing imbalances is crazy yet I do not hear talk about it. I ask for this to begin to feature in our discussions. Is there any discussion about whether property-based tax reliefs, encouraging speculation in property, are inherently dangerous? I see a link between the failure to look at the problem and the imperative of the EU, which the Government has adopted, to say that the banks must restore as much value from the distressed assets as possible. If that means inflating the property market, so be it. They are not worried about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Attorney General briefed the Taoiseach about the seriousness of the bugging, the Minister was briefed on Monday and then the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality went to see the Garda Commissioner. Did the Minister know the Secretary General of his Department was going and what he was going to say to the Garda Commissioner or what he did say? Could the Minister give us a simple answer?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What matters was he told to discuss with the Garda Commissioner?
