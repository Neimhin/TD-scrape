RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also wish to raise what I believe to be the utterly shameful approach of the European Union when it comes to dealing with migrants attempting to get into the European Union. Since the year 2000, some 22,000 people have died while attempting to get into Europe and that number has escalated dramatically. The blood of those innocent people is on the hands of European Union and every single leader, including the Taoiseach, in so far as they have co-operated in developing the policy of fortress Europe, the most shameful example of which is the EU-Turkey agreement. To be absolutely clear about this agreement, the European Convention on Human Rights states that "Collective expulsion of aliens is prohibited". There is no equivocation; it is prohibited but the Taoiseach and other European leaders have signed an agreement that states that "All new irregular migrants crossing from Turkey to the Greek islands as of 20 March 2016 will be returned to Turkey". Ireland has signed an agreement that commits explicitly to the collective expulsion of aliens, which is counter to the European Convention on Human Rights. Consequently, we are engaging in what is, in human rights terms, illegal action that from a moral point of view is shameful and murderous. There simply is no other way to describe it and this situation is getting worse. All the measures, including Operation Triton despite the humanitarian gloss put on it, are about push-back. The policy now is one of push-back, that is, preventing them from getting in and the Taoiseach stated as much in his opening comments when he spoke of stemming the flow of migration.That is the policy now - push them back and if they drown, tough luck. They are drowning in huge numbers. The more Europe ramps up its border controls, which it is doing, the more people will die. What is particularly hypocritical about all this is that the number of people who are trying to cross in this manner represents a tiny proportion of the number of so-called illegals in Europe. I think the term "illegals" is shameful because, in my opinion, no human being is illegal. However, in so far as one defines illegality when it comes to human beings, the vast majority of so-called illegals are people who arrive on planes with work visas. When their work visas run out, they become technically illegal. Their numbers dwarf the number of people who are trying to cross from desperate situations in Syria and north Africa, yet all the focus is on them. Deputy Adams mentioned the numbers that have come in as 190,000. Some 110,000 people came into this country alone in 2007, which was almost as many as the so-called flood trying to get into Europe. It is not a flood. The crisis is created by the EU's push-back fortress policy. The numbers are absolutely tiny but political cynicism and self-interest are killing those immigrants. It has to stop. The EU-Turkey deal is utterly shameful in that regard. We should demand that the deal be suspended and abandoned, particularly given the utterly shameful human rights record of Turkey in the treatment of its own population.  Did the Taoiseach raise the housing and homelessness emergency with his EU counterparts? In what has to be the supreme exercise in irony and hypocrisy, the EU Commission staff working document recently criticised the Government here for failing to invest sufficiently in infrastructure. That is unbelievable seeing as it was the same troika that demanded and insisted on savaging the capital investment programme as part of the EU-IMF bailout. Nonetheless, they do point to the fact that despite the Government's claim that it is going to do something about housing, the capital investment programme this year will be less than next year's. With all the talk from the Minister, Deputy Coveney, about dealing with the housing and homelessness crisis, he is still using the same figures in terms of the direct provision of council housing as his predecessor, Deputy Kelly. There is no change.  Will the Taoiseach take the advice of the Housing Finance Agency which said that we need to significantly ramp up the level of investment in housing? If that requires increasing our debt or deficit we need to go to the European Union and say that it is right, that we have an infrastructural deficit, specifically in housing, and we want the fiscal rules suspended, or with flexibility in them, so that we can borrow the necessary money to develop a housing programme that will deal with what is an emergency. Is the Taoiseach making that argument with the European Union about our need for a dramatic ramping up of investment in social housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not followed all of this as keenly as some Deputies, notably Deputies Daly and Wallace, who have done the State a great service in how they pursued the matter regarding Sergeant Maurice McCabe and whistleblowers generally and serious problems within the Garda, both in terms of how they conduct or fail to conduct proper policing and in how they deal with whistleblowers. However, the statement today by Garda Commissioner Nóirín O'Sullivan and the response of the Minister to the events surrounding the O'Higgins report are not satisfactory at all. There is a glaring contradiction between Commissioner O'Sullivan's statement today to the effect that there was no attempt to impugn the integrity or credibility of Sergeant Maurice McCabe and the leaked transcript of what the senior counsel for the Commissioner, Colm Smyth, said to the judge. As Deputy Barry has already said, when questioned by Mr. Justice O'Higgins, Colm Smyth repeatedly indicated that he had got instructions about challenging the credibility and integrity of Sergeant Maurice McCabe. There is a glaring contradiction there. That also raises very serious questions over the commitments and assurances that Commissioner O'Sullivan is giving in the same statement about a new regime when it comes to dealing with whistleblowers. The O'Higgins report clearly vindicates Sergeant Maurice McCabe and indicates what tremendous service he did the State and the public in blowing the whistle on serious failings in the Garda in Cavan-Monaghan. Mr. Justice O'Higgins at least acknowledges that "there was a corporate closing of ranks" by the Garda in the face of the whistleblowing efforts of Sergeant Maurice McCabe, although frankly I think that is an understatement of what Sergeant Maurice McCabe was put through.We all hoped and imagined that with the ascension of the Garda Commissioner Nóirín O'Sullivan, and after all the controversy surrounding the stepping down of the former Garda Commissioner, Mr. Martin Callinan, and the former Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr. Alan Shatter, we might have a new regime to deal with things in a different way. Instead it appears that the new Garda Commissioner is carrying on in precisely the same way as the old regime carried on in failing to deal in a proper way with whistleblowers to give them the proper protection and support they deserve for highlighting problems, failings and shortcomings within An Garda Síochána. It would appear that two gardaí were preparing to perjure themselves by giving evidence to the O'Higgins investigation by saying that Sergeant Maurice McCabe had indicated malice in his allegations against gardaí in the area. They were unable to do that because, thankfully, Sergeant McCabe had recorded the conversation and showed there was no such malice demonstrated. The fact that two gardaí were willing to perjure themselves, the effect of which would have been to undermine and malign the credibility and integrity of Sergeant Maurice McCabe, is incredibly serious. Only now, after all the furore, complaints and protests about it, we hear that Commissioner Nóirín O'Sullivan is going to refer this to GSOC. However, that does not satisfy me at all. When will GSOC report on the issue and has its record on these matter been such that one would have confidence that it would get to the bottom of what is an incredibly serious issue? It would appear that two gardaí were prepared to tell lies to Mr. Justice O'Higgins to malign Sergeant Maurice McCabe. The O'Higgins report clearly indicates that Sergeant McCabe had performed a genuine public service at considerable personal cost and had acted out of genuine and legitimate concerns. The response to this is gardaí who were planning to perjure themselves and lie about Sergeant McCabe's integrity. Luckily, they were caught out because of Sergeant McCabe's forethought. One could say that all of this is past history but there is still a glaring contradiction between what the Garda Commissioner Nóirín O'Sullivan is saying and what appears to be the case. These events might be considered in the past but the same thing seems to be happening again with other whistleblowers. I have not had as much contact with whistleblowers as have Deputies Daly and Wallace but earlier this week I had an extended conversation with Garda Keith Harrison. Before attending the Chamber now, I spoke with him about his thoughts on what was being said. It indicates that nothing at all has changed. Here is another garda with a very serious story, which I will recount. Garda Harrison arrested a senior garda on suspicion of drink driving, which he pursued following the arrest. He was faced with obstacles and resistance by senior Garda management in Donegal. Garda Harrison then started to experience bullying, harassment and victimisation by senior management in the Donegal area, gardaí who were actually supposed to be pursuing the person who was arrested and to serve justice on the senior garda against whom other very serious allegations were also being made by Garda Keith Harrison. Garda Harrison told me that he went to the confidential recipient, a commission of investigation was set up and information from the affidavits he gave to that investigation team were then leaked to the people against whom he had made allegations. This is very serious. Garda Keith Harrison has written on four occasions to Commissioner O'Sullivan and has received nothing but perfunctory acknowledgements with no serious follow-through, no protection, and no support. I understand that he wrote to the Minister for Justice and Equality in December, and has written to her again this week. He has received from her only a perfunctory acknowledgement of his December correspondence with no real response to the contents of his letter, an account of his treatment when he tried to blow the whistle on very serious failings in the Garda in Donegal. Garda Harrison tells me that Garda cars drive past his home on a regular basis in what appears to be some sort of low-level intimidation of him and his family. He has been on sick leave since May 2014 and from this week he has no income whatsoever. He has had no support from the Garda, financially or in any other regard. He is getting no support from the Minister or from Commissioner Noírín O'Sullivan. Despite the very serious allegations he has made, despite everything that has happened and despite the vindication of Sergeant Maurice McCabe and Deputies Daly and Wallace - who have championed these issues and the cause of the whistleblowers - nothing seems to be changing. All we get today is another statement that appears to be the Commissioner trying to cover her tracks. It appeared that finally something was going to be done but the evidence suggests that right up until recently they were in fact trying to undermine Sergeant Maurice McCabe, and we have that on the word of their own legal counsel. Consider also the treatment of whistleblowers such as Garda Nicky Keogh. I do not know much about the Garda Nicky Keogh case but apparently it covers very similar concerns. Given what has happened, how she treated - or tended to treat - Sergeant Maurice McCabe in order to undermine his integrity and in her compete failure to respond to, support and protect whistleblowers such as Garda Keith Harrison, it would appear that Commissioner O'Sullivan simply has no credibility. The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality knows all of this and I do not understand what she is doing and why she is allowing this to stand. I would hope to hear from the Minister that she is not satisfied with the Garda Commissioner's explanations. It would be good to hear an explanation as to what the Minister intends to do to protect whistleblowers like Garda Keith Harrison and others. Simple rhetoric about protecting whistleblowers that in reality is not matched with visible change, and other Sergeant Maurice McCabes are coming forward, suggests that at best the Government is just playing politics with this issue. The Government was just playing politics when former Commissioner Martin Callinan and former Minister Alan Shatter stepped down. In fact, the Government appears to be doing what the senior gardaí hierarchy seems to be engaged in - the closing of ranks and self-protection, with no serious effort to bring about the needed reform and not following through on its commitment to protect and support whistleblowers.I do not think any of the serious questions that have been raised regarding Sergeant Maurice McCabe or the whistleblowers have been answered, and a very radical change in attitude is necessary from the Government if it is to regain any credibility on these matters.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Two and a half, two and a half, five and five minutes. What we need first is respect for democracy and honesty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. Respect for democracy is a very simple matter when it comes to this issue. A majority of Deputies elected to this House gave pledges to get rid of water charges. That is democracy. The Members opposite should accept it. We know their position. They have lost the popular debate. They should accept it. They often say that there are more important issues like health and housing. We agree, so get this issue off the pitch. The people have decided. They debated it for two years. They disagree with their position and they should simply respect democracy. On the question of honesty, we want the rehabilitation of the water infrastructure and water conservation more than the Members opposite but they are not being honest about their plans. Do they know how Irish Water's investment programme compares even to what was being invested in 2009, and it was not enough then? Even at the highest spend, in Irish Water's plans, it will be less by €100 million or more than we were spending in 2009. The claim, therefore, that Irish Water had a plan to ramp up the investment in water infrastructure is factually incorrect. We then consider all the waste, including 29 staff on €100,000 or more a year, 21 on salaries of €90,000 to €100,000, all the bonuses, the money that went out to private contractors like Denis O'Brien's company, all the consultants and so on. Money that should have been going to fix the water infrastructure was instead being used to line people's pockets. We want that money going to the front line. As the Minister rightly said, the people always pay. It was the Members opposite who were saying that someone had to pay for water when they knew we always paid for water and we always will. The issue is whether we pay for it fairly or disproportionately impose the burden on the least well off. That is the effect of water charges. They were also being dishonest on the issue of privatisation. The EUROSTAT ruling confirmed what we said. In order for the Irish Water model to work, it had to ramp up the charges and reduce State support for Irish Water, leading to privatisation. That is what it said. The Minister should be honest about it.
