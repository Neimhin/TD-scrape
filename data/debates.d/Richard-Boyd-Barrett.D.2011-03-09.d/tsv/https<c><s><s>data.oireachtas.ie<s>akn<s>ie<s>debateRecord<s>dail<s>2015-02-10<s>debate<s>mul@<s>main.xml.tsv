RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Should we not come in first then?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to come at this issue slightly differently. I certainly have no particular truck for the drinks industry as it pumps its products at young people through advertising. I would like to hear a little more detail in this debate about the precise link between advertising and levels of alcohol consumption. To my mind, there were chronic problems of alcohol abuse in the days before there was any advertising. This was often linked to deprivation. We need to discuss these things. I do not make that comment in defence of the drinks industry. Alcohol abuse among any group in society, including young people, is quite a complicated issue. As I am coming at this from a slightly different angle, I want to know whether the Taoiseach believes it would be worth considering putting extra taxes on the corporate profits of the drinks industry. Is there not a case for that, given that problems related to alcohol abuse have such a huge cost for Irish society at so many different levels?Setting aside the wider debate on corporation tax, which as the Taoiseach knows I feel is too low, is there not a good case for applying a special levy on the profits of the drinks industry and using that money for rehabilitation programmes, sport, youth services and community services? The conundrum of where to get extra revenue for sports and young people could be solved by directly taxing the enormous profits of the alcohol industry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In his initial reply, the Taoiseach indicated that he had met a litany of CEOs of large corporations in New York. He referred on two occasions to what he calls the roadmap to tax competitiveness in Ireland and stated that he had encouraged the corporations in question to invest here as a result of that competitiveness. There have been widespread reports of the Government conferring with multinationals in order to reassure them that the changes to the double Irish tax arrangement will not impact on the amount of tax they pay. Is evidence not piling up to the effect that the policy of this and previous Governments has been to act - to some degree and in a pretty shameful way - as the corporate tax prostitute of Europe, particularly when it comes to attracting investment from the United States? A report in the business section of today's edition of The Irish Times indicates that the high-powered barrister the Government has hired to defend Ireland in the context of the European Commission's investigation into Apple's tax affairs and the possible state aid extended to or special arrangements made for it by the Government has gone on record in the past month implying that the new knowledge box arrangement with which the double Irish will be replaced may be found to be very problematic. The individual in question apparently indicated that the knowledge box may constitute further state aid and may not involve a proper imposition of tax on the corporate sector. Even people the Government is hiring have stated that something about the Irish corporate tax regime stinks. That regime allows multinationals to literally get away with murder when it comes to corporate tax. Does the Taoiseach communicate with the American Administration in respect of the fact that it is considering pouring fuel on the fire of the dire conflict in Ukraine by discussing the possibility of providing arms to one side, thereby inflaming an absolutely disastrous situation? What does the Taoiseach think of the proposal to supply arms? Would he join some of us in stating that it would be a disastrous move - and would make the situation even worse - for the United States to pour arms into what is an already dire conflict?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Six and a half percent.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could we all see it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could we see the advice before we vote?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could we see it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why should some get the briefing when we do not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We all have to vote on this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So the Taoiseach gets to see it and we do not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He will not show us the proof.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have got to vote on it. How are we supposed to do so if we do not see the evidence?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In relation to the vote we have to take later on Deputy Clare Daly's Protection of Life in Pregnancy (Amendment) (Fatal Foetal Abnormalities) Bill 2013, the Taoiseach has just indicated that Labour Deputies are receiving a briefing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach did say a "briefing".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask out of respect for what goes on in this Chamber, in which we are to vote on a Bill of that level of seriousness. A briefing has been given to some Deputies in this House. it must contain argumentation. It does not merely state in one line that the Bill is unconstitutional. Is the Taoiseach seriously suggesting that is the advice? There must be argumentation in it dealing with the issues that have been raised.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am only asking whether Deputies who will be required to vote on this can be given the same briefing-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----that the Taoiseach just admitted is being given to Labour Party Deputies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach said it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did the Attorney General even give the Government any arguments?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is extraordinary.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I find myself in something of a dilemma in the face of this Standing Order. There is not much point in opposing it, but I could hardly be enthusiastic in supporting it. Essentially, this change relates to the veil of secrecy that legally supports the golden circle in this country. If the public is to see any value whatsoever in the banking inquiry, I suggest it relates to the question of discovering who was responsible for bankrupting this country and inflicting such misery on millions of our citizens over the past seven years. Indeed, the consequences of what this golden circle of bankers, developers and politicians did to this country are likely to continue for many years to come. The law set down by the EU in terms of central banks and confidentiality requires that for the banking inquiry, which is supposed to be acting on behalf of the public, to look into these matters, the members of the inquiry have to give an undertaking that none of the confidential information from the Central Bank that they will look at will be revealed to the public. That is why we have a public inquiry that cannot reveal to the public the details of what it is looking at. In such circumstances, what is the point of the public inquiry at all? I suppose it is marginally better that, as a result of this motion, the secret circle around the golden circle is expanded to include some public representatives. For those public representatives to access confidential information and evidence that might help them to draw serious conclusions about who was responsible for the banking crisis, they will have to give an undertaking not to pass this information on to the public. It is really pretty scandalous. As I said when we discussed this matter last week, I can see the logic that underpins the rules of the European Central Bank or our own Central Bank to the effect that information on normal deposit holders and normal borrowers should not be divulged to the wider public. There is good reason to keep that information confidential and private. It seems to me that there is absolutely no justification for withholding the names of the 20 or so biggest borrowers from Anglo Irish Bank, the tiny golden circle of people who were borrowing from Irish Nationwide or any of the other small groups of super-wealthy and well-connected developers who borrowed enormous sums of money from the banks to speculate in the property area and consequently crashed the economy.Why should their identities and the extent of their loans and involvement in destroying our economy be confidential? They should not be. Why should public representatives who get to see that information be bound by confidentiality clauses under threat of sanction from the Dáil? The only comfort I can take is that the sanctions are pathetic, which makes it likely that the information will be leaked and make a mockery of the entire process. Getting flung out of the Dáil for eight days could hardly be described as the worst punishment one could inflict. One could argue the case that it might allow public representatives time to do something useful, for example, organising the next demonstration against water charges and austerity, which might have a serious impact on addressing the wrongs arising out of the banking crisis and the austerity that has ensued. I will not vote against the motion because it is marginally better that the inquiry have access to this information, but why the secrets and key individuals, developers and culprits behind the crisis should be protected by a veil of confidentiality is beyond me. It says everything about how the golden circle persists.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will not get any of the detail.
