RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This chapter enables the bank to authorise an ICAV which is not authorised under the UCITS regulations.  A concern I expressed, which is my primary concern, is that this seems to be a mechanism to encourage activity in this area without appropriate regulation and that there is a lesser regulatory burden on these ICAVs than there might otherwise be.  Given that it is lack of regulation in the area of financial speculation that landed us in the mess we are in, I would like to know the meaning of authorising things that are outside the UCITS regulations.  I am not familiar with them but I presume those regulations are the more normal regulatory regime.  Why are we authorising things and insulating them from the normal regulatory regime?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has to be one or the other.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will flag my concern.  I need to look into the UCITS regulations because one is flying blind in a situation like this one where one does not know how one compares with the other in terms of the level of regulatory burden and obligation.  I am concerned, particularly when I look at some of the promotional material from KPMG, Ireland's first tailor-made corporate funds vehicle.  Essentially, it was selling and promoting these ICAVs as mechanisms whereby one can avoid tax and have a lesser regulatory burden.  I know that is not directly relevant to this discussion but my concern is that we are creating two different sets of rules.  The perception KPMG seems to be putting across is that the rules here are less burdensome and that is much more favourable from the investors point of view.  I want to express my concern about that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is strengthening the legislation against possible problems in the transparency of accounts and clear, true and fair presentation of accounts.  This improvement is welcome and I can see the logic of allowing for other accounting standards as long as they meet the criteria.  It all seems reasonable enough.  However, "true" and "fair" are vague terms.  I assume there is more detail as to what they mean.  Is there necessarily a relationship between including the words "true" and "fair" and the true and fair standard, which would be set down in a more detailed way?  How do we marry them?  Should the true and fair standard not be set down in a particular place or developed by a particular body?  Is the European Union doing it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is reasonable enough.  From where is the Minister of State taking the definition of "true and fair"?  What are we assessing it against?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us say somebody challenges a set of accounts and he or she says they are not true and fair, that the company is hiding things behind categories or under certain headings, which can happen.  What standing does this term have?  I can imagine the company might state it thinks the accounts are true and fair.
