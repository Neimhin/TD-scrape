RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will we go around first-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We all know Theresa May is an absolute horror and is trying to use the exit vote to pursue her little Englander, anti-immigrant-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it on?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to be heard. We all know Theresa May is an absolute horror who is trying to use the exit vote to pursue her little Englander, anti-immigrant, hard-line austerity agenda. However, when Monsieur Barnier was here, he gave fairly strong indications that the EU is also going to play political games on the issue of exit - talking about how there must be consequences for exiting the EU. I put it to the Taoiseach that between the horror of Theresa May and the politicking of the EU, this country is piggy in the middle in a political game between these two blocs. The question is whether the Taoiseach is going to stand up to this politicking and demand that we have a say in whatever deal or arrangement they come up with. It is clear that neither Theresa May nor the EU gives a damn, or are cavalier, about the consequences of their approach to the exit negotiations on this country. They clearly do not give a hoot about the Border or the common travel area and are playing politics. Are we going to demand a referendum on the final deal? I ask this question very seriously. Are we going to demand a veto on any deal they hatch or that impacts on us and does not suit us in respect of the issues on which there is consensus North and South?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Taoiseach sure about that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will we exercise it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would help if Mr. Jeremy Corbyn won. The Taoiseach should say that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would it not be better if Mr. Jeremy Corbyn got in?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is coming up on Ms Theresa May. That will put the cat among the pigeons.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am in favour of Mr. Jeremy Corbyn, not the Blairites.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not the Blairites.
