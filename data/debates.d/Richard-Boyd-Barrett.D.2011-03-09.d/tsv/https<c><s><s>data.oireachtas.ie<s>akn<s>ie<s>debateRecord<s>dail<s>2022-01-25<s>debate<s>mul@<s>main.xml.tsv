RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The €100 to offset the absolutely shocking increases in energy and fuel prices that people will be struck with over the coming weeks is pathetically inadequate. I am already getting reports of people getting energy bills that have increased by 125% in the bills that are going to drop in the next few weeks. The Government needs to do more than it is doing. We have repeatedly urged it to use its powers under the consumer Act to declare an emergency in energy prices, to control the unit prices of electricity and heating fuel, and to expand access to the fuel allowance for the many pensioners and people on low pay who do not benefit from it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Government take the sort of radical action that is necessary?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will talk about that later.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do not side with NATO on it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will mention the risk of people dying unnecessarily during the winter, as happened in this country even before the energy price hikes. Every winter, 1,500 to 2,000 people, most of whom are elderly and less well off, die as a result of the impact of winter, the cost of heating and so on. That situation will get exponentially worse in light of the current price hikes. I again ask whether the Taoiseach will use the powers available to him under the Consumer Protection Act 2007 to control the price of energy, including electricity and heat, and to expand the financial assistance available through the fuel allowance to cover more households. Of course, there is an international context to this matter but this country lining up with NATO in a conflict between it and Russia is not a very sensible strategy to address that wider international context.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There were a couple of other questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One thing among others that people in the South and the North share is fuel poverty. The Taoiseach did not have a chance to respond in the last round of questions but I hope he will this time. Fuel poverty in the North is 22%. It is only 13% in England. The ESRI estimates one in six in the South suffers from fuel poverty. A RED C poll last year found that 19% of people turn the heat off because of fears of not having enough money to meet other bills and the cost of food. We share, North and South, a failure of government to deal with energy price hikes that are impoverishing working people, the vulnerable, pensioners, disabled people and so on. Will the Taoiseach take a lead in taking some measures to address this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I still did not get an answer. That is two different rounds where I did not get an answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On price caps.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Vladimir Putin is a thug and autocrat who has done very nasty things recently to working people in Kazakhstan, has waged a bloody war in Chechnya and is now flexing his muscles in Ukraine, so of course we should condemn what Russia is doing, but why is there no condemnation from a country that is supposed to be neutral of a clear agenda by NATO to expand eastwards and escalate military tensions with Russia? Why does the Government correctly condemn Russian military exercises in Irish waters but allow the US military to use Shannon Airport every single day of the week to prosecute wars across the world and kidnap and torture people in its rendition programme? We do not condemn that. Why is the Government saying nothing about the fact NATO wrote to EU foreign ministers before Christmas asking them to increase military expenditure and align more closely with the NATO military alliance, which is a US-led and aggressive military alliance? Neutrality means not taking sides in dangerous conflicts and game-playing between major imperial powers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why no criticism of NATO?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is NATO not expanding eastwards when it is not static?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The murder of Ashling Murphy was an absolutely unspeakable and horrific act. I can only imagine the grief the family must be feeling. I pass on my deepest sympathies to her family, her friends and her community. Against that background of an utterly unspeakable senseless murder and tragedy, it has been very heartening to see the amazing response of people throughout the country, coming out on vigils and insisting we must address the reasons our society continues to produce this phenomenon of violence against and murder of women because they are women. Violence of any description needs to be stamped out, but violence against women and the murder of women because they are women is a particularly horrendous thing. On the vigils, it was brilliant how so many people were saying that of course the wheels of justice will have to grind out an explanation and a punishment in the individual case, but everybody insisted we must also look at ourselves and our society to ask how it is our society continues to produce this phenomenon. I certainly do not have all the answers, and I do not believe any individual does, but there are a few things we can say. There is an urgency demanded by people in addressing this phenomenon and for taking measures to stamp this out and to change the culture - whatever it is about our society that produces this violence - to get to the root of it quickly and change things. Some of these have already been alluded to. First of all, if a woman is in such a relationship, and given we know most domestic violence takes place among people who know each other and in the family home, it is self-evident that if she has nowhere to go, cannot get out of where she lives, and therefore does not have the ability to escape violence, there is a greater likelihood the violence could end up with tragic consequences. It is a matter of absolute urgency we provide the refuge places. I am aware that in my area there is no women's refuge in the whole of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. The Government has now committed to it, but it is worth saying that people have been talking about it and campaigning for a refuge in Dún Laoghaire for as long as I have been in representative politics since I was first elected as a councillor, which was 12 or 13 years ago. We still do not have a refuge. It is not just about refuge spaces, however. It is also about alternative accommodation and the housing situation more generally. I will highlight one issue with Minister, which is that, even now, of the cases I am dealing with this minute, there are women in domestic violence situations who cannot leave those situations because they are joint tenants with their partners and therefore there are bureaucratic obstacles to them getting onto the housing list due to them already being tenants. This means they do not want to leave the house even though they are in a situation of domestic violence. This is crazy. Those barriers must be removed. As long as we have a housing crisis and until we address it, women will be left trapped in these violent or abusive situations. The other aspect is the question of objective sex education. I do not have all the answers for where this came from, but in Irish society the State for much of its history prevented people from having divorce and getting out of bad relationships. The State also did not want women to have control over their own bodies. We have had the horrific organised institutional abuse of women and children in the Magdalen laundries and the mother and baby homes. Against that background, it is crazy that religious institutions with particular views of women, sexuality and so on still control 90% of our schools, and have any control whatsoever of the sex education that is taught to our young people.That issue has to be addressed as a matter of urgency so that people get factual and objective sex education, and we do not have religious bodies that are not giving people the proper education they need running our schools.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputy Ó Laoghaire and Sinn Féin for introducing this motion on the leaving certificate. People Before Profit is happy to support it. The very least we can insist upon in the particular situation of Covid-19 is that the voices of leaving certificate school students, as clearly expressed by them and their representative organisations, should be heard. They want a choice with a hybrid exam. They have been through enough and they need that clarity soon. They want the Minister to listen to their voice. We are happy to support that. As the Minister is aware, we wish to go further. We brought a motion to that effect to the Dáil last March, but the Government opposed it. I am going to repeat the argument a year on, as it is even more relevant now. We have tabled a short amendment which does not delete anything from the Sinn Féin motion but adds that we should have open access to higher and further education and apprenticeships, and that we should scrap the leaving certificate. We should get rid of it because it is a way of limiting access to higher and further education and it is irrational and unfair to do that. It forces people into a rat race for points which is extremely detrimental to the well-being of our young people. It is completely pointless. It is damaging and reinforces social inequality, is long past its sell-by date and should go. We are very clear about this. School students who have led the way, by the way, on climate - we should bear that in mind - say that they want system change, not climate change but system change. System change is what we need in education and we need it now, not some time in the future with little bits here and there of tinkering around with the existing failed and unfair system. The unfairness of this has been magnified in the context of Covid-19 but it was always an unfair system. Deputy Gannon has already referred to something that was in our motion last March. It is shocking that the Government can maintain that the leaving certificate is fair. It is ridiculous to say that unless one is not looking at the context of the leaving certificate. Some 99% of people from Ranelagh - I have nothing against the people of Ranelagh - go to university but 15% or 16% of people from working-class areas do so. Is that fair? It is grossly unfair and something has to be done about it. If one does not start by recognising that there is a problem, quite frankly one is defending the indefensible. I am delighted that the ASTI has now endorsed the view that open access is needed. We should listen to it, even though I do not agree with everything the teachers' unions have said on this issue, because it is absolutely right in saying that we need open access. That is about responding to the pandemic. We have gone on and on about where there is going to be a new normal. That is the expression. We are going to learn from Covid-19 but what we are actually trying to do is to drag ourselves back to the stuff before Covid-19 and to return to the status quo. We do not need that status quo when it comes to the leaving certificate; we need a revolution in education. We need the imagination to remember that once upon a time people thought it was fair and reasonable to limit access to second level education. We think that would be utterly preposterous now, but once upon a time that is the way it was looked at. Once upon a time significant numbers of people did not imagine that they would ever get past primary education. Now, equally, we think that is preposterous. Why on earth would we ration and have a gatekeeping exercise for access to further and higher education? When we brought this motion forward last year, the Tánaiste said it was a nice idea but was totally impractical and asked where we would get the buildings. If one walks down Aungier Street, one will see a third level institution that has been sitting empty for the past two to three years. It is outrageous. If one goes along by the Merrion Gates, one can look at the Seamark Building in which a college could be fitted. It has been sitting empty for ten years. There are multiple buildings like that around the country. There is no problem with the physical infrastructure if we are serious about this. The other comment I love is that everyone will want to be a doctor. This is the sort of nonsense that is wheeled out. We are defending a situation whereby in order to do the thing one would like to do, one has to be subjected to a regime of studying many things that one does not want to do, in order to get to the thing that one does want to do.Is it even the thing the student wants to do, given it is just a hierarchy of points to get into particular courses? Surely it is a little more logical to let people do the thing they really want and are enthusiastic to do in third level. Would that not be imaginative? Imagine the type of creative potential that could be unleashed if people were given the opportunity to do the things they are really keen to do. I believe that might produce better graduates. It might contribute better to our society to unleash the creative potential of the many people whom the system at present deters or to whom it denies access to education and the things they want to do. It is entirely practical. The gap between the number of higher education places and the number of applicants is about 25,000. That gap can be filled. There are many part-time academic staff who would love a full-time job but who are on crappy part-time contracts or are paid by the hour. We have the people who could do the teaching and, believe me, we have buildings in which we could put the students. We just need the imagination of the Government to take this leap, and now is the time to take it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Talk about being found out. Fianna Fáil is in combative mood tonight. Here is a Fianna Fáil hoax, that it got rid of strategic housing developments, SHDs, before Christmas. As we warned, there was a flood of SHD applications for build-to-rent developments by greedy developers trying to get in on the gold rush in our area as soon as that legislation went through. The Minster said it would not happen. Among other things, as well as a whole load of unwanted private development, it is going to cause major staff problems for our local authorities, which are not equipped to deal with the new regime and the old regime at the same time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Since the Minister of State said the Government had abolished SHDs, there have been seven new applications for SHDs just on the Dún Laoghaire side of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. That is because the Government essentially allowed an extension for these build-to-rent developer-led developments. Ironically, some of the Government's local representatives are now running around saying that they are terrible developments. The only reason the applications were allowed to be made was because the Government voted down our amendments that would have closed down the SHD system completely. There would have been none of the outrageous developments that are now being proposed and are all about expensive built-to-rent apartments. Communities are overrun with them, as are local authorities. Local authorities have to deal with SHDs. The planning department in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is telling us that it will be dealing with new SHD applications until well into the end of this year at the same time as having to deal with LRD proposals under the new regime.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not have the staff and the money being provided is going into general funds, not into creating new posts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	SHDs were a scandal. They did nothing to address the housing crisis. They delivered overpriced rents to make money for developers. Since the announcement that this process would go, though, we had seven applications in December. There is murder in Sallynoggin over a nine-story construction. It is a working-class area where there are only two-storey houses but this will be a nine-storey building on a tiny site. It is developer led. In another case, there was planning permission for an SHD of 150 apartments but the developer lashed in 300 apartments onto the application just before Christmas. It is a scandal. The local authority is going to have to pick up the pieces, but it does not have the people to do so because they will be dealing with SHDs and LRDs. The money will go into general funds. We need people in the planning departments who can deal with these applications, but we are dealing with SHDs, which bypass the system. Even though the council still has to do all the work, the board makes the decision and the public have no right of appeal. It is a disgrace.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government said that it was getting rid of SHDs.
