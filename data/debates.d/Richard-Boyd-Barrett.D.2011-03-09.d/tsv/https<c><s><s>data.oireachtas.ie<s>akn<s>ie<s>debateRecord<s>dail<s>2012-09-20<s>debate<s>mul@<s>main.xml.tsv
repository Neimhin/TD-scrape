RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last year, we saw an unprecedented public revolt and mass boycott against the unjust household charge the Government imposed. Faced with that revolt, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government went into hiding for a period but the Government finally admitted that the charge was unfair and unjust and promised something fairer. In recent weeks, it is becoming clear, through various leaks from the Government, that what is proposed will not be fairer. As we who opposed the household charge predicted, ordinary families, even at the low rate of 0.25% of the value of the property which has been leaked, will be paying between €500 and €800 per year in property tax. With 1.6 million people having less than €100 left when they have paid their bills every month and 900,000 people living on or below the poverty line, including 100,000 children, how does the Tánaiste expect people to pay this charge? Does he not realise that if the Government presses ahead with this tax, hundreds of thousands of families will be pushed into poverty? One cannot get blood out of a stone. Does he not realise that the revolt and protests against the household charge will be nothing compared with the public revolt he will see if the Government imposes hundreds of euro more in austerity taxes on ordinary low and middle income families, the unemployed and people facing mortgage distress? It makes a mockery of the Government's claims that it will protect children if it imposes a property tax that will drive the parents of those children into poverty. Will the Tánaiste assure the House that he will not impose further unsustainable financial burdens on ordinary families, the unemployed, low and middle income families and people facing mortgage and financial distress?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Tánaiste should not insult the people of this country by suggesting that the more than 1 million households that refused to pay the household charge before the deadline his Government set on 31 March earlier this year did so simply because we advised them to do it. They did it because they recognised it was an unjust and unfair charge. As a result of that boycott and revolt, the Tánaiste's Government was finally forced to admit it was unfair and unjust. I want to know, and hundreds of thousands of families across the country want to know, if the system that will replace the household charge will be even worse than the €100 charge that was imposed on them last year. All the indications are that it will be three, four or five times what the Government tried to impose on them last year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We want to see a wealth tax. This is my question-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why does this Government not levy taxes on those who can afford it rather than continuing to hammer those who cannot? They are hanging on by their fingernails and being driven into poverty because the Government's determination to bail out the banks and protect the super wealthy.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the Order of Business yesterday the Taoiseach indicated that he might be willing to allow for a debate in the House following the report by the Irish fiscal advisory council on the state of the economy. Given his challenge to me earlier about the need for different sides to outline their alternative ways of dealing with the deficit and debt problems, will the Tánaiste confirm that the Government will allow for a debate on the financial situation we face running into the budget and what the options might be in regard to taxes and so on to deal with the State's financial crisis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I look forward to it.
