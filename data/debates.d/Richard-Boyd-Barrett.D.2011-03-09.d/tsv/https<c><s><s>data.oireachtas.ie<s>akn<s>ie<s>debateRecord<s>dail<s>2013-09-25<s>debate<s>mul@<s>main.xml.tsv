RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was not addressing the Minister. I said that I bristled when I heard-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	----- the words "public sector reform".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Cheann Comhairle-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Chathaoirleach, I bristle when I hear the words "public sector reform".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is unbelievable. I bristle because the term is simply a euphemism for cuts. It is as simple as that. We do not need fewer public sector workers, we need more public sector workers. We need more people cleaning the streets, cleaning the graffiti off the walls and building social housing. We need more social workers, more people working with the vulnerable in our society and more people helping to maintain our public services, facilities and amenities. We need them more than ever because the private sector has shown itself completely incapable of creating employment or of dealing with the situation that we face in this country. In case the Minister has not noticed, we have an astonishing unemployment crisis. Investment has collapsed since 2007 to the tune of billions of euro. There are little investments here and there but they are set against a general backdrop of massive cuts in capital expenditure by the State and an overall collapse in investment in the economy. To cut back in the way the Government has in public investment and public services is bordering on the criminal. Moreover, for the Labour Party to be involved in the targeting and vilification of public sector workers in the way that it has been or for it to lend credence to those who wish to vilify public sector workers is utterly shameful. Public sector workers have been hammered. I offer one stark example. With the Haddington Road agreement and the two hours extra or thereabouts that people must work for nothing, some workers, not too far from this Chamber, found when the two extra hours were added in and divided into their basic pay that they were getting paid less than the legal minimum wage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was possible. The matter had to be taken up with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. That is the reality for vast numbers of public sector workers. They have had their pay slashed by between 15% and 20%. Now, they are having their hours increased. Numbers have been slashed with an overall loss since 2008 of 9.3% or approximately 30,000 public sector workers. As Deputy McDonald pointed out, even before the crash came Ireland did not have a high level of public sector employment compared with other OECD countries. All this talk of reform is to cover up the fact that workers and ordinary citizens in general, but particularly public sector workers, have become the scapegoats for the economic crisis that was caused by politicians, developers and bankers who are still protected. There have been no reforms there. No matter what they do, they are protected and bailed out. However, again and again ordinary workers have to bear the brunt of this. Frankly, some of this stuff is almost bordering on the insulting. I was reading the digest which referred to mobility for generalist staff. I would like to know what are generalist staff.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to see that definition work its way through to what people do. Does it refer to someone in a housing department of a local authority who spends years dealing with the housing crisis that successive Governments have caused and who has to deal with the public and the vast and growing waiting lists? Is it the view that because they are simply clerical officers and generalists we can shove them over somewhere on the other side of the city to do something else? Is it not the case that they have actually built up skills, knowledge and abilities in their particular area? To refer to them as generalists in that way is, in some cases, although not in all cases, bordering on insulting. Whatever the job, people build up a knowledge and expertise of their particular areas. This is valuable knowledge and experience and people should not be redeployed willy-nilly because of the need to meet troika targets, balance the books or simply to find a way to manage the chaos that has resulted from taking the knife to the public sector in order to impose the Government's austerity agenda. I have a specific question for the Minister, Deputy Howlin. If I am correct, there is an exclusion for staff from the Central Bank and the NTMA from these redeployments. Is this because they are such specialist people that they cannot possibly be redeployed, while other more generalist people can be redeployed? Why the exclusions? I am not against flexibility. I am not against an integrated public service. I want to see these things but they should not be imposed on people. I know of situations where this has happened. For example, people working in the hospital in Loughlinstown for the HSE were told they had to go to work in Finglas. These were mothers with children and families but they were told they would have to travel an extra two hours each way each day to get to work in what is supposedly a reformed but actually dysfunctional new medical card regime, which has been established essentially because of cuts. Under this regime no one can talk to a human being any more when they have problems with their medical cards. The reality is that the Government's reform policy amounts to fewer people doing more work for less money and now possibly being forced to travel further to work or forced to redeploy against their will. Any scheme should be completely voluntary. The Minister should talk to the workforce. I imagine many of them might wish to move on and develop their skills and so on or get experience in other sectors of the public sector, but it should be discussed with them not imposed on them. A scheme to allow people to work closer to home should also be included. That would be a good reform. If there was a scheme whereby we tried to move people closer to home in order that they did not have to travel ridiculous distances to get to work, with all the resulting congestion problems and all the stress this causes for those people, it would be effective and the Minister should seriously consider it. That could be an option for people that would improve their quality of life and morale which, in turn, might actually contribute to higher levels of productivity and enthusiasm in their work. If the Minister seeks a reformed public service he should support public sector workers rather than slash their pay, impose things on them, squeeze the life out of them - this is what is happening to many - or put them on the border of not being able to pay bills and mortgages. That is hardly conducive to a reformed public sector. This is what I suggest the Minister should do to try to amend the Bill.
