RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a shoddy attempt to muddy the waters on the European stability mechanism.  It is part of a systematic campaign by this Government to prevent serious discussion on the European Stability Mechanism, its contents and its far-reaching consequences for the citizens of this country in terms of further austerity when we enter a second so-called bailout programme.  Given the austerity provisions we will be required to commit to if we enter the European Stability Mechanism, it should more accurately be described as a burial programme for the Irish economy and society.No one has any objection to the accession of Croatia to the European Union.  We welcome it.  Similarly, inserting some protocol into the Lisbon treaty, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the Treaty on European Union noting the concerns raised by the public about the Lisbon treaty are welcome provisions.  However, I note that the concerns the Government chose to identify as what the public was concerned about in respect of the Lisbon treaty are not exhaustive or reflective of the actual concerns raised by those of us who opposed it on the first and second occasions.  This protocol identifies issues to do with the right to life, with taxation - the Government is primarily concerned with the issue of corporate tax - with the important issue of Ireland's involvement in the common foreign and security policy of the European Union and in particular, Ireland being slowly dragged into a European army and a European military apparatus, the militarisation of Europe and the connection to the NATO military alliance.  However, this protocol merely notes our concern in this regard and it does nothing to prevent us being slowly dragged into that NATO military alliance, as, of course, is testified to by the fact that Irish soldiers are present in the NATO operation in Afghanistan.Of course, other concerns were raised by the public at the time, one of which is particularly worthy of mention, given the current financial crisis in Europe.  The first people to raise the narrow mandate of the European Central Bank being copper-fastened - only concerning itself with inflation and not concerning itself with issues to do with employment and macro-economic stability - were those of us from the left who opposed the Lisbon treaty, who said this was a recipe for disaster, that the mandate of the ECB was too narrow.  Since then, other people are jumping up and down saying they want the mandate of the ECB to be broadened but, of course, at the time, when we raised the issue of the narrow mandate of the ECB, we were dismissed, ignored and vilified as being scar-mongers.  Of course, we have been proven to be right.  At the time of the Lisbon treaty, we also raised issues to do with the commitment of European treaties - strengthened in the Lisbon treaty - to foster and promote the privatisation of public services, to effectively make illegal the provision of State aid for public enterprises, all of which are extremely damaging provisions which undermine the ability of this State and other European states to protect themselves against the consequences of economic crisis and they undermine us in our efforts to find a way out of that economic crisis.  None of those expressed concerns is acknowledged in this protocol.  Most of all, I object very strongly to the mixing up of these issues of the accession of Croatia and the concerns of the Irish public over the Lisbon treaty with the European Stability Mechanism.  It is part of an attempt to cover up what is involved in the European Stability Mechanism.  This should be dealt with separately and there should be proper debate.  A guillotine should not have been imposed.It is disgraceful that the media have refused to engage in any serious way in a discussion of the contents of the European Stability Mechanism, which may cost this State up €11 billion or more to help recapitalise and bail out European banks or even more than €11 billion, as is becoming apparent with the growing crisis in Spain and in Italy.  The ESM staff and governors and its assets and property will not be subject to any legal scrutiny or any political or public oversight.  It is outrageous.  The ESM will be based on strict conditionality, that is, austerity being imposed on the Irish people for the privilege of bailing out European banks.  I strongly oppose these amendments being included in a Bill that is essentially about facilitating the European Stability Mechanism which is nothing more than another vehicle to deliver poisonous austerity onto the heads of the Irish people and other European citizens.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, that is what Denis O'Brien does.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what your friend Denis O'Brien does.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He does not want to talk about them in case they do not use their newspapers to support him.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As Deputy Higgins has already said, we all welcomed the enormous movement by people in the North - Catholic, Protestant and those of no religion - who in response to some of the most horrendous atrocities in the conflict there demanded an end to the sectarian violence that had blighted the Northern state for so long.  It was that pressure of people power uniting against sectarian atrocities that brought about an end to the worst aspects of the conflict in the North.  While it was not, sadly, an end to all the conflict, at least it created an atmosphere in which the main participants in that conflict stood down and peace agreements followed.  We all welcomed that and we all abhor the attempt by small numbers of people to return to or continue down the cul-de-sac of sectarian violence that blighted the North.While it is right and justified to condemn and criticise in the strongest terms groups that wish to continue down that failed and disastrous road, it is also worth pointing out - as we did at the time - that the structures that were established as a result of the peace agreement institutionalised politics along sectarian lines, not dissimilar to what has happened in places such as Lebanon and elsewhere and has at least helped to continue to fester sectarian sentiment rather than overcome it by having, for example, quota systems when it comes to voting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has had his chance and he will have it again.  It helps to move away from sectarian quotas which are included in the Northern Ireland peace agreement.  However, repressive legislation such as this is not the way to continue the momentum for peace and for breaking down sectarianism.  In many cases this legislation is used to target the wrong people.  I will not elaborate on Deputy Higgins's comments in this regard except to say that under the provisions of this legislation Mahatma Gandhi, if he were in this country, could be imprisoned for life for his campaign not to pay tax on the production of salt.  Under such a campaign of civil disobedience he would be liable to be put in prison for life and proscribed as the organiser of an unlawful campaign of civil disobedience.Deputy O'Brien pointed out that given the low number of convictions under this legislation in contrast with the large number of arrests and other uses of the legislation, it would appear it is being used more to gather information on organisations and groups with which the State has a problem.  When this extends to anti-war activists it begins to be of serious concern.  The Garda recently raided the home of the PRO of the Galway Alliance against War.  His house was raided at 8 a.m. with his wife and daughters in bed.  Vile language was used against members of the family and one of his daughters was vilified for being a member of Sinn Féin.  The gardaí claimed to be there because of an investigation over a protest that had taken place in Shannon Airport against the use of that airport by the US military.  They did not find the information they sought, but they seized three computers, two DVDs of peace protests in 2005 and 2006, and various papers.  They also complained that Mr. Farrell, the PRO of the Galway Alliance against War, had too many books on his shelves before they headed off with computers, including a computer belonging to his wife which contained sensitive academic and examination material belonging to students in the university in which she lectures.  They have still not returned those computers which do not contain any incriminating information on the activities of a peace organisation, but contain the databases containing contact details for the membership of the Galway Alliance against War.Was that raid carried out under the provisions of this legislation?  What does the Minister have to say about the use of such powers to raid in the early morning the house of an anti-war activist?  Will he return those computers and ensure this legislation is not abused in this way?  Will he ensure that legislation that would allow that to happen is not on the Statute Book?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What the Minister has just said is utterly dishonest.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He did not say that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was ended by the people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So it is no credit to the people.  It is never the people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about Gandhi's campaign?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will take that seriously when you deal with Denis O'Brien's tax affairs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked the same question of the Minister in the autumn.  As per the Minister's reply, I sought and obtained, and continue to receive, statistics on the number of contract and temporary staff in the public sector from various agencies operating under the aegis of his Department and, crucially, the comparison between the cost to the Exchequer of employing agency staff versus direct employees.It seems to me that a Government that is willing and able to impose brutal cuts and austerity on people on social welfare such as rent allowance and so on and on the incomes of workers should show the same zeal in terms of ensuring we are getting value for money when it comes to the massive amount of outsourcing that is resulting from the cuts in the number of directly employed people within the public service.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it the Minister's intention to have a centrally held record of the number of agency staff employed across the public sector and a comparison in terms of how much it would cost if those people were directly employed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Minister continues to cut numbers he will need more of them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need to know if it is saving money.
