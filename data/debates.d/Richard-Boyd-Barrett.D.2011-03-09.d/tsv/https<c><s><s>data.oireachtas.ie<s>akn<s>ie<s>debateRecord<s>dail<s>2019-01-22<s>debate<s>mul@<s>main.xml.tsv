RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The comments by Mr. Margaritis Schinas of the European Commission to the effect that Ireland will see a new hard border if Britain fails to approve the Brexit withdrawal agreement are extremely alarming and may suggest that the mask of EU solidarity with Ireland over preventing a hard border on this island is slipping a little. Equally worrying is the fact that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, said again today that without the withdrawal agreement, it will be difficult to stop a hard border. I would really like the Taoiseach to explain these comments. Who will put up this border? What does that mean? The agreement would seem to be bit of a dead letter at the moment but surely we have to make it absolutely clear to Ms May and the European Union that under no circumstances, irrespective of whether there is a deal, are we accepting a border. I would like to know what discussion the Taoiseach has had with the European Commission and Ms Merkel, or any other EU leader, on the suggestions that somehow a border will erect itself in the case of there being no deal.
