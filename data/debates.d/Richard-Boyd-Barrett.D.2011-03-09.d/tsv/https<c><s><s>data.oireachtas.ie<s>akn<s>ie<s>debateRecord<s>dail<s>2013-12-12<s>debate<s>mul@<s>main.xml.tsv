RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In my naïveté I used to think that public sector reform had something to do with improving the quality of public services. I have learnt definitively with this Government that it means nothing of the sort. This amendment seeks to slash the illness entitlement of public sector workers and amend a Bill that has already carved up the conditions of public sector workers. It comes on the back of a relentless and in many cases vitriolic assault on ordinary low and middle earning public sector workers who have become scapegoats for the economic crisis created by others. It is inevitably justified by the narrative of setting the private sector worker against the public sector worker. It is a completely bogus narrative although it is as predictable as the clock ticking that certain newspapers will wheel out articles assaulting public sector workers in their constant tirade attacking low and middle income workers. For the record, not that it will make any difference to the narrative that we hear here or read in the tabloid or rag media that passes for proper reporting, this distinction between public and private is utterly bogus. The real distinction is between low and middle income workers who, whether in the public or private sectors, have been slaughtered in the current recession, and those at the top of the public and private sectors who have been completely insulated and have continued to line their pockets, give themselves bonuses, pay themselves obscene salaries and are never subject to the caps or strictures put on the ordinary worker. Even when certain strictures are put in place they are flagrantly disregarded by the Government and the top executives in the health service or wherever the hell it might be in the banks. It is clear that what reform really means is making ordinary workers work harder, longer and for less, and relentlessly battering them with cuts. The result is that public services deteriorate and are seriously degraded. The Government said that it had successfully redeployed 10,000 people, which sounds wonderful but we need to see an example of how this works. The centralisation of medical card services, the redeployment of people to the centre in Finglas, has been a disaster for people applying for medical cards. It has been the mechanism through which, as a matter of default in a bureaucratic box-ticking exercise, people are denied the right to their medical cards and cannot find a human being to talk to because there is no local office any more where one can speak to a human being and state one's case. That is so-called public sector reform and is nothing other than a systematic degrading of our public services and of those who work in them. The Government deems it entirely appropriate and logical to take the sick and illness entitlement from public sector workers while demoralising them and causing them more stress and almost certainly making them more ill more frequently. What else would the Government do when that is the direction of policy? The highest level of absenteeism is in the health service. Is there any wonder about that when the Government has taken 10,000 health workers and €3 billion out of the system and workers are absolutely traumatised by what they must deal with, an impossible situation that they face when they go to work day in, day out? Is it any wonder that they get sick more often? Other workers have been mentioned, such as gardaí and firemen. What about community welfare officers who have to deal with desperate people coming in day after day begging them for money that the Government does not give them? The list goes on. The Government is slashing their entitlements and disgracefully, it is doing it retrospectively. Is it not absolutely amazing that we cannot retrospectively vary the pensions of previous Taoisigh, Ministers and all the rest with their massive pensions? We can do nothing about the disgrace that is going on with executives in the Central Remedial Clinic because they had contracts but we can retrospectively vary the sick leave entitlements of ordinary workers and be damned to their constitutional or legal rights. Those are the disgraceful double standards that operate in this country. The distinction is made between critical and non-critical illness. How exactly is critical illness going to be defined in these arbitrary powers now being given to the Minister to lay down the specifics of the new regulations for sick leave entitlements and so on? Will cancer treatments, which could be strung out over six or nine months, or a year, be defined as critical? I certainly hope they will but I strongly fear they will not. What about mental health issues? This is a major problem but there is an attitude among certain people on the Government benches that mental or stress-related illness is not real illness.The attitude is that we just need to put measures in place that will force people to go to work even when they are not fit to do so, and even though their unfitness to do so is often related to what this Government has done to their working conditions, pay and so on. If we were interested in actually taking a reform measure that might improve the stress that is put on ordinary workers at the front line of our public services, why do we not bring in a regulation giving people a voluntary opportunity to work near where they live, so they do not have to travel long distances across the city in congested traffic? Would that not boost their morale a little and improve the situation of absenteeism, make services more local and so on? That is a rational approach to public sector reform. Of course, this has nothing to do with public reform. It is just another assault, this time on workers who are sick and often on those who were made sick by the activities of this Government in raining down relentless cuts on their pay, conditions and resources.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have made general points around this issue in the previous debate but following on from the more specific aspects of this amendment, the figures the Minister gave were very revealing and confirm the argument I made to him earlier on this issue. The area where there is the highest level of absence through sickness is in the health service. That is no surprise. The percentage is higher, the numbers are higher and the cost is higher because the Government has butchered the health service. It is obvious. I spoke to a local authority worker before I came into the House about a study of ordinary bank workers - not the people at the top - I think in Bank of Ireland which reported that two thirds of sickness of among workers in banks has to do with stress. Why is that? Is it because bank workers are inherently more subject to stress? Not at all. It is because ordinary bank workers have been at the sharp end of the anger and indignation people feel about what has happened to this country. Of course, it was politicians and people at the top who were actually responsible but the ordinary bank workers feel the stress and must deal with it. If we broke down the Minister's figures on the health service, we would find exactly the same thing that the stress is induced by having to work longer hours, harder, with fewer resources, with more demands and more desperate people. I do not know if the Minister still does clinics but I am more stressed going into my clinic now than I was a year ago because there are more desperate people around.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do. That is exactly the point of being here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what we are supposed to do, that is, be conduits for the experiences of people outside the House and to bring those experiences into it and, if I might say, to puncture the bubble that sometimes exists around this House, so that the real human reality of how policy decisions made in here play out in real lives is brought back in here. Surely that is the point of democracy. I would not belittle it. Those figures deserve to be broken down even more to find out what are the illnesses that are leading to higher levels of absenteeism in the health service, higher levels among special needs assistants than in education generally, which speaks for itself, and higher levels among front-line gardaí than among those who are civilians, which again speaks for itself. The people at the front line having to deal with the consequence of the economic crisis and the impact of austerity on the ordinary members of the public, with whom they must engage, are more likely to be sick and the figures the Minister gave bear that out. I would not like to be at the housing desk in a local authority at the moment because the situation is desperate. These people are dealing with an impossible situation. How soul destroying must it be to be in the housing department of a local authority with people coming in day after day, more and more desperate because they are longer and longer on the housing list and are living in more deplorable conditions? What does that do to somebody's mental health? It crushes it. That is the reality and that is why people are getting sick. Even though sicknesses are being induced by circumstances beyond the control of workers, we are going to put in arbitrary dates and say that after a certain point, people's entitlement to full sick pay will be cut. That leads on to the point Deputy McDonald made. One may not be able to go back to work after two years. What used to be six months is now three months. These are arbitrary dates. If the Minister is saying he wants to take into consideration people's illnesses, then he would not have those arbitrary dates. He would look at what is making people sick and at their illnesses and would look at it on a case-by-case basis, as this Government so often does in other matters. Let us actually look at what is making people sick and at their illnesses. I accept the Minister does not want people to be out sick forever and to be labelled as sick. I suspect the vast majority of people who are on sick leave would rather get back to work, so let us assist them in doing so. That is the sort of reform we need but this is arbitrary and will undoubtedly hurt people. I refer to defining critical illness and the area of mental illness, which relates to the point about stress. Let us not yet again make mental illness the poor relation of sickness and not really take it seriously when, in fact, it can be extraordinarily debilitating. Let us not say it is not really critical. I am fascinated and worried by how the Minister will define "critical". There are lots of grey areas but will every person who has cancer and is getting cancer treatment be assumed, as a matter of course, to be critical?I would certainly hope that will be the case. It would be nice if the Minister said it was because we could be confident about one category, at least. However, I fear it may not be.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough. I will study the Minister's answers to these questions. As Deputy McDonald has said, illnesses like mental health conditions and depression arising from pregnancy have to be considered carefully. The same problem that applies to medical card discretion and probity could potentially apply in this area. I find it problematic that an onus is being put on people to prove how sick they are when they are at their most vulnerable. This has to be re-examined. There is evidence that in the case of medical cards, the default position has been to refuse people and force them to beg and cajole their way through an amazing amount of hoops to prove they are sick. They have to participate in the appeals process when they are sick and least need the extra hassle and burden. I am against the whole thing. The figures given by the Minister reveal the reality of why people are getting sick in the public sector. If he intends to go ahead with this proposal, fairness needs to apply in a couple of specific areas. I will listen to Minister's answer. I have to go to a meeting, so I apologise for not being present for everything he will have to say.
