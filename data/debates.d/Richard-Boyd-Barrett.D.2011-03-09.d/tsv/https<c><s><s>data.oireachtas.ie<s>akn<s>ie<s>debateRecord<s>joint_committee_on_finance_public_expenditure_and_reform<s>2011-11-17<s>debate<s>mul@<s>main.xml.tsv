RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the delegates for their contributions.  Like other speakers, I commend them on their voluntary involvement in the effort to deal with the State's financial crisis.  Having said that, my job is not to be nice to the delegates but to interrogate them.  I will begin with a simple observation which has probably struck many other people as well as me.  Why should we trust the fiscal council any more than we used to trust priests who were supposed to know about issues of which we knew nothing?  I get the distinct impression that economists are becoming the new high priests and that there is as little justification, given their comprehensive failure to predict was has befallen us, for investing them with wisdom as there was for investing priests with wisdom and knowledge or at least not questioning their credentials.It is a serious question.  People are asking themselves whether we have simply had some changes of face at the top while, fundamentally, the same people, politically and in every other area of society, are still running the show.  To be more specific, my view, with which the delegates may or may not agree, and I am happy to hear their opinion, is that an addiction to neoliberal economic thinking - there was a suffocating consensus around this thinking - was such that comparative economics was effectively done away with some time in the early 1990s.  There was only one debate and it focused on how to make capitalism work.  Everything else was done away with and pretty much everyone in mainstream economic, academic and other circles was part of that consensus.  Were our guests part of that consensus, which has failed us spectacularly?I am not merely asking a question about past history or about our guests' credentials in order that we might be able to take them seriously as people who possess the wisdom, knowledge or understanding necessary to deal with this crisis.  I am concerned because we have moved from a neoliberal expansionary consensus to a neoliberal austerity consensus.  I would like to be reassured that those before us are more than just a team of neoliberal austerity technocrats.  Europe is facing an extremely serious challenge at present.  Two elected Prime Ministers have just been replaced by austerity technocrats.  The markets and the ECB are happy with these individuals because they are going to implement austerity measures, regardless of what the populations of their respective countries think.  Are our guests part of the consensus to which I refer?  Do they have a mandate to, are they free to or do they even have the inclination to contemplate matters outside the austerity consensus?Some people - I am one of them - fear that we are moving from one extreme to the other and that this will be disastrous.  The neoliberal expansionary consensus is moving to an austerity consensus on the basis that fiscal rectitude and fiscal responsibility will resolve all of our problems.  There are those of us who fear that austerity measures will just deepen those problems.  I am not the only person who thinks in this way.  Paul Krugman, Joseph Stiglitz and the United Nations Committee on Trade and Development all recently stated that austerity is self-defeating, that we must move in exactly the opposite direction and that social transfers, fiscal stimulus and capital investment represent the only way out.  Like me, they are of the view that pursuing the austerity route will simply lead to a downward spiral.Some of the paragraphs in the council's report in which growth prospects are assessed contain comparisons between the projections of the ESRI, the Central Bank, the IMF, etc.  The comparisons to which I refer state that there are, for example, 1% or 0.5% differences in the projections provided by these entities.  On what are these projections based?  At university, when I was concerned with completing an essay quickly, instead of thinking about things from a lateral point of view I would assess the perspectives of two well-known writers on the subject and then try to base my analysis somewhere in the middle.  Some of what is contained in the council's report seems to echo what I did at university.  I hope there is more to it.  On what are the growth projections in the report based?  The projections issued right up until the crash indicated that Ireland's economy was going to continue to grow forever.  Those responsible for the projections to which I refer just did not see the crash coming.Despite slight variations, all of the bodies referenced in the report seem to suggest that growth is going to significantly pick up from 2013 onwards.  What is the basis for this?  The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council seems to accept and acknowledge - although it does not appear to dwell on this - that growth projections have been consistently downgraded during the past year.  It appears, however, that growth is, as if by magic, going to pick up again in 2013.  What do our guests say to those of us who believe that the reason we are being obliged to downgrade growth projections is precisely as a result of the implementation of austerity measures?  Austerity is crippling growth throughout Europe.  At present, every country in Europe which experiences a financial crisis moves into austerity mode and domestic demand collapses.  This happened in Ireland and Greece.  I am of the view that it will happen in Italy and then in Spain and France.  It will only then be a question of deciding who will be next.  No one will be spared.  In my opinion, that is the logic of what is happening.The one little bit of hope which led to optimism is that our exports are doing well.  However, prospects in this regard are now being downgraded as a result of what is happening in Europe.  If the contraction in Europe continues, that one bright spark of hope will be choked off and we will be left with the reality of a deeply depressed economy.  That will be the case not just here but throughout Europe.It was stated that in the context of the technical measures necessary for deficit reduction, etc., it is not the fiscal council's job to decide between taxes and cuts.  It might not be the council's job, from a political perspective, to deal with such matters.  However, I wonder about the logic of that.  I do not understand economics if they are not connected to human beings.  I see human beings as coming first and economics as being there to serve the needs of human beings.  When human beings come at the end of the equation, I become deeply worried.  Setting aside that moral point, is it not the case that if it is decided to cut rather than to tax, this can have real implications in the context of making future projections and estimating the impact of cuts on growth, debt, etc.?I wish to put a simple proposition to our guests.  Taxing people who have enough wealth to save - rather than to be spent or invested - frees up money that is not being used and puts it into the economy, while hitting those on low incomes who need their money to survive and who spend it in the economy with cuts has a clearly detrimental effect on consumer demand.  In other words, and ignoring the moral aspects involved, taking the first of these routes can breath life into the economy, whereas taking the second could have a damaging effect on it.  This is not just a social, moral or political question, it is also an economic one.What is our guests' view of the argument to the effect that the debt-to-GDP ratio is not as meaningful in this country because, to use the tiresomely popular term, Ireland is a small, open economy which is disproportionately dependent on foreign direct investment and on multinationals which repatriate a great deal of the profits they make?  Is it not the case that our debt-to-GNP ratio is a more meaningful method of measurement and that this shows that our economy is in a much bigger mess than is usually stated?  How would our guests respond to that point?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is not a supplementary question; I asked a specific question to which I did not get a reply.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On what basis are all the witnesses projecting a substantial pick up in growth from 2013 to 2015?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What if there is stagnation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have no doubt about that.
