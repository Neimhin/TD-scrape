RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Leas-Cheann Comhairle sure?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wanted to hear from the rest of the Opposition. This is a change in the speaking order but I will speak anyway. In the self-obsessed, self-serving bubble in which the Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Green Party Government seems to exist, the cut in the PUP does not really matter because those parties are more concerned with trying to hold together their stumbling Government, petulant-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think Deputy Sherlock is right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was saying that I think the Deputy is right. I said he was right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Sherlock should not insult me, then.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not an argument but this is a fundamental break from the normal speaking order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I genuinely do not want to delay proceedings and I know the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is in a difficult position but I agree with Deputy Sherlock. I do not know why he is giving out to me. This is our motion. We have introduced it and we want to hear what the other parties have to say before we respond.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we change the order now?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We could just revert to the normal order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I just make a proposal to the House? I propose that we simply move to Sinn Féin now and Solidarity-People Before Profit will come back after the other Opposition parties; in other words, after the Independent Group. That is the order we previously followed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are all in this together; give me a break. If the Government goes ahead with the cuts instigated for the PUP, not only will it do a great injustice to hundreds of thousands of workers who have lost their jobs and income as a result of the pandemic and the measures taken by the Government to address it, but it will also do something very dangerous in undermining the collective social solidarity that we need, now more than ever, to address the rising infection rates and the new restrictions that must be imposed, with more restrictions almost certainly coming down the line. The Government would be playing with people's lives and livelihoods in a very dangerous way if it did not restore the PUP. In the self-absorbed and self-obsessed world that people like the Tánaiste, Deputy Varadkar, seem to inhabit, where they are more interested in attacking the public health team in a cynical and politically motivated way, maybe €50 or €100 of a loss in income means nothing. It may be a trifle, irrelevant to the political and self-obsessed considerations that seem to drive certain people in this Government. For ordinary working people who are suffering, whose mental health has been affected and who have lost their jobs and incomes, €50 or €100 is the difference between keeping one's head above water and drowning in bills and loan or mortgage repayments that cannot be made or insurance costs. There are daily costs that are hard enough to manage at the best of times but it becomes significantly harder when one loses a job and income is cut to €350 and impossible when it is cut to €300 or €250. Members of the Government must step out of the bubble and get their heads around this. I got messages about this all day yesterday.For example, a musician said that he has his NCT coming up this week, and that costs €55. If he has to get his car fixed, it could cost him €200. He has the banks now crawling all over him because the Government has lifted the moratorium on mortgage repayments. He has his landlord crawling all over him who could evict him if he cannot manage the rent. What is that musician supposed to do? What is the taxi driver supposed to do? In the next few months, taxi drivers whose cars are more than ten years old have to decide whether they can afford a new car. They cannot because they have lost a year's income. Given the suitability test and the NCT that they have to take and the insurance they have to pay, how are they supposed to do it? They cannot do it. The Government needs to get their heads around this and get out of the bubble. The Government should note today the opinion polls, which show 63% of people are in favour of more severe restrictions to deal with the Covid threat. That is a big sacrifice that people are making, just as they have made all year. They will undermine the commitment people have to solidarity and to protecting our older and more vulnerable citizens and the front-line healthcare workers who are protecting us if they smash people's income and cut it to the point that they cannot manage. I urge the Government to think about this. They will be making a very dangerous mistake if they do not restore these payments. Nothing has changed since March and April in terms of the costs that people have. Nothing has changed in the rents or mortgages they have to pay, the insurance they have to pay, the childcare costs, the costs of feeding their family and all the rest of the costs that people have to survive, but the Government has cut their income at the same time and its measures mean hundreds of thousands more will lose their jobs. People are willing to accept those job losses if it means that we get out of this mess and save lives, but if the Government does this, it will be stabbing in the back the people who are putting themselves on the line. I refer to some of the Government's excuses for not doing this, for instance, the cost. Has the Government even bothered to listen to the fiscal advisory council? I am a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, which met the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC. Yesterday, in its statement, the council made it absolutely clear there would be no fiscal problem in restoring the PUP. In fact, if more restrictions were likely and if we continue in the period where there is grave uncertainty and large numbers of people out of work, they recommended maintaining and increasing the economic stimulus. I asked IFAC officials directly if there was a fiscal problem with restoring the PUP payments and they said that the Government has latitude. In fact, they were urging that money continue to be put into families, workers and households pockets for macroeconomic reasons as well as for reasons of economic justice and fairness. That argument, therefore, is simply nonsense. It is the Government reverting to type with a penny-pinching austerity ideology and a fundamental class prejudice about people who, through no fault of their own, must rely on social welfare payments to sustain themselves through this period. The Government should drop that nonsense, and drop that dishonest argument that there is a fiscal imperative that requires it to cut the PUP. IFAC does not think so. Frankly, they are not exactly agents of the radical left. If they are saying that, we can reasonably take it that from a fiscal point of view, it is entirely acceptable to restore the PUP. It is nauseating that the Tánaiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Varadkar, tried to present himself the other night on "Claire Byrne Live" as some sort of champion of the poor and the dispossessed. We heard him state the reason the Government cannot restore the PUP is consideration of all the other people on lower social welfare payments. That is a sickening argument. In fact, the Government should increase disability, jobseeker's and all other payments to the same rate as the PUP. The income that people on disability have to survive on is an absolute scandal as it is. Similarly, there are no jobs to seek for tens of thousands of people who are out there who would like to work but are on the jobseeker's payment. They should also receive the social solidarity of the PUP in the current extraordinary circumstances. On the grounds of fairness and maintaining the social solidarity, we need to deal with Covid-19 and, indeed, on the grounds of macroeconomic prudence to sustain our economy through this period, I urge the Government to restore the PUP and the wage subsidy payments or it will feel the wrath and anger of people. It will demoralise people and it will add to the heavy burden and hardship they are going through having to deal with this pandemic if the Government pulls the economic and financial rug from under the families and workers that we depend on to protect us against Covid-19. I would like to say a particular word regarding some of the groups hardest hit by all of this. Taxi drivers are due to have a drive protest on Friday. They have cancelled it because of the restrictions but they will be outside the Dáil tomorrow at 12.30 p.m. in small numbers to highlight their plight. Music, entertainment and events people, bar and restaurant workers, caterers and tourism industry workers, all of whom have lost their jobs and incomes as a result of the pandemic measures, need to be supported. If we are all in it together, the Government has no choice, morally or in any other way, but to restore the PUP payments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is now, incredibly, day 180 of the Debenhams dispute. The Taoiseach has promised that the Government would legislate to rectify the sort of situation that the Debenhams workers find themselves in. When does he propose to do that? Even if such legislation is enacted, it will not resolve the situation for the Debenhams workers. What proposals are provided for in the legislation that will surround the budget or are to be introduced in the short term to address the situation? The workers have proposed, among other things, that a fund be set up, financed by a levy imposed on companies to pay for redundancy. Given the failure of successive Governments to legislate for the Duffy Cahill report, why does the Government not take up the Debenhams workers' proposal and put some money into that fund in order that the Debenhams workers can get their two plus two, which can be paid for by the future contributions of employers who should, as a legal requirement, have to pay a levy into a redundancy fund?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Taoiseach knows, I have been shouting very loudly for a long time about the need to fund and support the arts and particularly arts workers in the current situation who have been starved of funding and supports to date. However, in one area of arts funding there has been great largesse and I call for an investigation into this. It is on foot of a dossier that has been produced by the Irish Film Workers Association. If these allegations are true, and very credible facts are put forward, there is a scandal in the Irish film industry that dwarfs the scandal of the FAI and John Delaney. It needs to be investigated as a matter of urgency. According to this dossier, a relatively small number of producer companies have received over the past five years €668 million in tax relief, money from the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, money from RTÉ, and grants and loans from Screen Ireland. Under law, that money is conditional on quality employment and training. The recipients of that money are required to sign a Revenue declaration that they comply with all legal and employment rights and issues such as the fixed-term worker's contract. The very same groups that are getting this money are, as we speak, in the WRC claiming that they have no employees, that only designated activity companies are employers and that even though they receive the money from Government, they are not employers. Incredibly - this is shocking stuff - I have a letter dated 1 September in which the auditors of, for example, the producers of "Vikings 5", "Vikings 6", "Badlands 3", and another "Badlands" production, confirm that during the period no income was earned from profits derived from the exploitation of those series. In addition, they have no employees even though they get the money from the Government that is conditional on quality employment and training. Even more incredibly, under EU law, Revenue is required to publish the state aid given to these companies. The Revenue documents indicate that for those four productions by those two companies, they were given either €40 million in section 481 tax relief, or €120 million. That is what Revenue is saying. We do not know if we gave them €40 million or €120 million, even though under EU law, Revenue is required to be very specific about the state aid that is given to them. That is scandalous and it needs to be investigated. If there is a shred of truth - the evidence is very credible - something very rotten is going on. Based on the allegations in this dossier, I want a commitment that the situation in that industry is investigated as a matter of urgency.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People elected the Taoiseach, Deputies, including me, and Ministers to this House. Of course, Ministers, Taoisigh and Cabinet members have significant additional responsibilities but they also have a huge number of public servants and civil servants around them. To have on top of this an extensive layer of multiple highly-paid advisers raises questions in ordinary people's minds, particularly at a time when hundreds of thousands of people are on their knees economically and financially, having lost their jobs and had their pandemic unemployment payments cut. We then have this extensive layer of multiple advisers, who some might say do not seem to be giving great advice at present. If we take the Tánaiste's outbursts at the public health team, one wonders whether it was a result of very expensive advice. It is just jobs for the boys and largesse for those who get the prize of power, which is being paid for by the public and really is doing nothing for ordinary people. That is the perception out there. Does the Taoiseach not recognise that this is the case? Frankly, even from the Taoiseach's point of view, these advisers often do more to confuse than assist in the business of government. The Taoiseach might do better to listen to members of the public and ordinary people outside the bubble of Leinster House advisers and Ministers, rather than paying extortionate salaries to a bloated layer of advisers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wanted to bring up Lesbos and the call that we would take 400 of those who are being evacuated after the fires there. We should consider seriously doing that. As awful and harsh as the situation we face with Covid-19 is, these are people who are fleeing absolutely appalling situations, who have been driven from their homes and live in appalling conditions in holding camps in Lesbos. We need to put out the hand of support. It is very much in line with the tradition of this country as a people who side with the oppressed and the downtrodden. We should bear in mind our own history of exile in that regard. On the economic and fiscal considerations of the EU relating to Covid-19, the Government in refusing our request, to date at least, to restore the pandemic unemployment payment has cited fiscal concerns.I want to be clear on this because I met representatives from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council yesterday at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight, and they made clear that the normal restraints of the fiscal treaty are off the table and do not impact the situation. In fact, they argued strongly that as long as the situation remained uncertain and there were high levels of unemployment as a result of restrictions, income subsidies should be maintained and it would be good to put as much money into the economy as possible. I asked explicitly whether the council would have a problem from a fiscal point of view if we restored the temporary wage subsidy scheme and the PUP, and the representatives basically said they had no problem with that and there was no fiscal difficulty because of the current extraordinary situation and the ability to borrow money cheaply. They were sanguine about the issue of debt. The Taoiseach should bear that in mind and consider what they are saying in terms of PUP restoration.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To follow on from that, I wish to add to the point I made to the Taoiseach earlier. The EU fiscal treaty rules have been waived in the context of Covid-19. Unless there is something we do not know, there is nothing whatsoever in those rules preventing the Government from spending the extra money that would be necessary to restore the PUP, the wage subsidy and other supports. As Deputy Paul Murphy just indicated, we could achieve this by imposing a solidarity tax. Considering that savings are growing among certain groups and profits are increasing in certain sectors, such as pharmaceuticals and IT, there is no reason whatsoever we could not impose a solidarity tax on those who are doing very well and use the proceeds to prevent our having to impose austerity, unfairness and hardship on people who have lost jobs and employment through no fault of their own as a result of the pandemic. I urge the Government to do that. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council said the deficit we could be facing at the end of the year is between €10 billion and €18 billion. This is not an insignificant figure but, considering that €64 billion was poured into the banks the last time we had a crash, it is a small price for ensuring solidarity and fairness for the hundreds of thousands of people who have lost incomes and employment as a result of Covid.
