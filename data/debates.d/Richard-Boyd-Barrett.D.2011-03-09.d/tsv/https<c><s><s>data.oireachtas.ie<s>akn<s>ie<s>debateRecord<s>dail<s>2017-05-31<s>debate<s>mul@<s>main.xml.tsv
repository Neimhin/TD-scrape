RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, I note that a further amendment to this Bill was submitted yesterday. I believe in debating everything to the fullest extent, whatever people want to say on Bills.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	However, I want to ask the Leas-Cheann Comhairle about the precedent here because to my knowledge we are always given a deadline to submit amendments that is often difficult to meet. We now have an amendment submitted in the middle of Report Stage, long after that deadline. I would like that explained to me because if that is setting a precedent whereby we can submit amendments in the middle of Report Stage, I would be very happy, but I want to know if that is the precedent we are setting. Either we have rules on this which apply or we do not. It is unprecedented in my six years in the Dáil that new amendments can be submitted well after a deadline has passed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yesterday, 30 May, according to the piece of paper.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For clarification, I want to stress that I have no difficulty with that. My point is about procedure, not the content. As this is the precedent we are setting, I want to understand how, in the midst of Report Stage, we can submit amendments. That is the precedent that has been set. I will be very glad if we can do that because that makes it an even more dynamic process, but that has never been allowed in my six years in the Dáil. I want to know precisely what was the procedure that allowed the deadline to be waved, which applied to every one of us, because I would have tabled further amendments following the debate last week. Up to last night, issues were raised with me by fracking campaigners on which I would have submitted an amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to know the procedure through which this happened. Was it just submitted and accepted? Did the Deputy have to go to the Ceann Comhairle and make a special case? What were the rules that allowed the deadlines to be broken? Can this be explained to me?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not an amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am reading it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But it is not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So we can all do that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is moving the goal posts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The purpose of the amendment which we discussed in some detail last time is to extend the ban on hydraulic fracking proposed by the Bill, which we support, to include offshore. There has been considerable debate and lobbying and so on, about this over the last week and concerns have been expressed that raising this issue would in some way frustrate the passing of the Bill. I wish to restate that we want this Bill to pass. We think it is a historic development that a ban would be imposed and we commend Deputy McLoughlin for getting it to this point. I do not believe there is or should be any doubt that this Bill will pass this morning. However, we see no reason why the arguments that apply to onshore fracking would not apply offshore. The toxic, polluting nature of the chemicals involved in fracking, which we have now accepted potentially pollute our water and impact on human health and would be damaging to the onshore environment, all apply to offshore. We have experience of this in California, in the Gulf, and elsewhere where marine life is being destroyed, where billions of litres of toxic chemicals that cause cancer are being poured into the waters off the United States causing unquantifiable damage to marine ecosystems and potentially to human health, and there are seismic dangers. Another point made to me recently - it is too late for this debate but I will submit an amendment - is that we should be making a case for this to our counterparts in the North through the North-South ministerial bodies. This was included in my original Bill on this matter, that it would be policy to call for and campaign for a ban on fracking North of the Border, because if there is fracking in Fermanagh, it will impact on the South.  I will press the amendment. The ban should extend to the offshore. I fear the Government and Fianna Fáil probably want to leave the door open to offshore fracking and that is why it is important to press it, as the arguments apply both onshore and offshore.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is in the rules that I am allowed to respond.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is, yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, it is the second.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are a lot of rules being bent today. We may as well have a free-rolling session.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope those in the Visitors Gallery and anybody watching are looking closely at the political machinations that are going on here. They are fascinating and a real glimpse into how this place works. It is true, and Deputy Eamon Ryan should put up his hands and admit it, that last week he argued we should withdraw our amendments, whereas he is now putting forward an amendment that goes even further in the same direction than ours. This is what goes on; this is the carry-on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sinn Féin is making a mistake. In 2016, I introduced a Bill to ban hydraulic fracturing. It was specific about the process. It stated, "...all other practices to extract hydrocarbon from coal seams, shale rock and tight sands in Ireland." Then a Bill came from Deputy McLoughlin, on which I commend him. He is representing his constituency. However, that Bill reflects pressure from Fine Gael for a diluted fracking ban that does not extend to the offshore. We have had nearly a year and a half to debate the offshore and plenty of opportunity to do this, but Fine Gael and, I suspect, Fianna Fáil made a political decision that they did not want a ban to extend to the offshore because their friends in the oil and gas industry would not like it. That is the reason. The Government has been forced into this ban by popular opposition in Leitrim and elsewhere, but it does not want the ban to go too far. It is important to stress that Fracking Free Clare has been in touch with me to say that we should press our amendments. It is worried about the definition of "fracking" in this Bill because it believes the definition does not cover other fracking-type processes that would have been covered by my Bill. That is the political game that is going on and we make no apologies for saying that the ban should apply offshore, where the onshore issues of climate change, polluting capacity, the toxic nature of these chemicals and the potential for seismic damage also apply. We must close the door urgently.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 2:In page 3, to delete lines 30 and 31.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 5:In page 4, line 17, to delete “Onshore”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend Deputy McLoughlin for getting the Bill to this point. I have no doubt it will pass, hopefully unopposed, through the Final Stage. It is very much to his credit that we have got to this point. The Deputy and others will accept that the biggest victory here is the victory of people power in Leitrim and across the State. Communities and environmental campaigners took up the fight and made it impossible for the political parties in the House to ignore the arguments made by campaigners and the justice of their cause in insisting that onshore fracking is banned. It would pollute the water, endanger human health and contribute to further climate change. It would impact on tourism and our pristine landscape. There is simply no justification for it and it was people power that forced the political system to acknowledge that fact. It is worth commenting on how far we have come in that regard. I remember when we discussed this issue at the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications, Climate Action and Environment, the Environmental Protection Agency was doing a report that, frankly, many of us felt was an absolute stitch-up. The two major consultants looking into the viability of fracking were both deeply linked with the oil and gas industry and the pro-fracking lobby. Incredibly, they did not even look into the health implications of fracking. That was where we were at. It is because of people power, pressure, persistence and determination by the environmental movement and by the communities who campaigned on this issue that we have got to this point. There is no doubt that it is a great victory. It is historic and it sets a precedent. We should be delighted that this is the case. In conclusion, I must disagree with Deputy McLoughlin's points about the offshore fracking. There is no question that all of the arguments that apply to the dangers of onshore fracking apply equally to offshore fracking. That evidence is now piling in from the experience of offshore fracking in the United States of America. A 2014 report, Troubled Waters, says that, "At least 10 fracking chemicals routinely used offshore in California could kill or harm a broad variety of marine species, including sea otters [and] fish...". Leatherback sea turtles and elephant seals in California and so on are being affected because of the chemicals being used in their key habitats. The chemicals used have also been shown to cause cancer and to impact negatively on human health. All of these factors apply just as much to offshore fracking. I am deeply worried because I believe that some of the biggest reserves are likely to be found offshore and the door is still open to that. The door needs to be closed. There is the pressing and urgent need also to deal with runaway climate change and the threat this poses to humanity and to the entirety of the globe. I disagree with Deputy McLoughlin on that point and I believe we should have gone further. That being said, it is a victory for people power. I do not know what I would say about the new politics that Deputy McLoughlin referred to, but it shows that the reduction in the dominance of the two or three major parties in the State has opened the door to change. It shows that parties from across the political spectrum can co-operate on the things they agree on and get results when, critically, working in conjunction with people from outside the House and allowing the voice of civil society really to influence our work. This to me is new politics. It is about listening to the voices outside and being messengers to the Dáil for the demands, campaigns, issues and the wisdom of those who are outside the Parliament and letting that impact on the work we do and the laws we pass. In that sense, it is a great victory, but there is a lot more to be done. We need to press on to ban offshore fracking and to other issues related to climate change and environmental destruction.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are not asking for extra seats but to be allowed to substitute.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is irrelevant. The point the Minister State makes is totally irrelevant.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will I get an opportunity to speak on it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We oppose this Bill. It essentially allows a sunset clause for companies that have engaged in inversions, which is a tax avoidance strategy by American multinationals, where, through a paper exercise, they switch their headquarters to here in order to avoid tax. It is part of the global tax scam being perpetrated against the citizens of the world by these multinationals, which this country has been actively facilitating. The behaviour of these multinationals in engaging in inversions and other tax scams in quite a shameful manner is the single greatest contributory factor to the spectacular and growing wealth and income inequality across the world. Yet again, as in the case of the double Irish tax mechanism, because we are put under pressure on these matters, we have to finally and very reluctantly do something but we make sure that we provide a get out clause for the companies that have been engaging in this activity to date. It is worth mentioning in passing that the double Irish tax mechanism continues to be utilised by companies such as Google and Facebook. They are still evading their proper tax liabilities. They are using the double Irish tax mechanism because, despite the trumpeted headlines about it being closed down, in reality, it was extended. The companies using the double Irish tax mechanism were allowed, and will continue to be allowed, to do so for a number of years. No doubt as the Minister said, and as alluded to by the previous speaker from Sinn Féin, this legislation will prevent it in the future but, in reality, it is giving them time to find new ways to avoid tax rather than being forced to apply these accounting standards now.I oppose this because it still facilitates the wider architecture of tax evasion by big multinational companies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Scamming.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am only joking.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is closely linked to tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have been there quite a few times.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have been there quite a few times.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do know that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do know.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do I not know that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister knows a lot about what I do not know.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Jesus, it is getting very personal in here, Acting Chairman.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not personalise it though.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is about accounting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are celebrating.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Thank you, Ceann Comhairle. Actually, I am going to wait. It is pretty noisy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we stall the clock for a minute?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not hear all of the contributions in the earlier part of the debate. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil are certainly supporting this, but I am not sure what other people are saying yet. The Competition (Amendment) Bill aids workers' interests and gives workers who need it the right to organise as trade unionists to improve their pay and conditions. It is great that we can come together and agree to pass a Bill that will do that. After the nice consensus we had on the previous Bill, I am afraid that I do not believe that the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank Bill 2017 is going to be good for workers, for the environment, for poorer countries or for the Chinese people. I do not think it is a very good way for us to invest €125 million. It is amazing, in a way, that there is such enthusiasm from the Government for this. Maybe it is not that amazing and is just in line with the Government's general philosophy and ideology.I would have thought it might have given it a little pause for thought when one looks at the sorry history of the IMF and the World Bank and what those institutions have done to developing world countries and debtor countries, which is effectively steal the natural resources, infrastructure and public services of poorer countries around the world; wreck the environment in many poorer countries; and undermine the position of working people and the less well-off in those countries. Why on earth we would want to participate in the creation of a new Asian version of the World Bank-IMF is beyond me. I suppose it is fairly typical of the pragmatic, as the Government would see it, approach to the way the world economy is organised that we just feel that this is the way it is so we must be part of it and we do not want to be left out of the party. That is more or less what the Minister of State said.  On the other hand, the Minister of State said that not to join the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank would raise questions about Ireland's position on China's increasing integration in the global economy and international financial architecture. He said that such a decision could impair Ireland's growing bilateral relationship with China with potential adverse effects for Irish businesses. Would it be such a bad thing if we were critical of the Chinese regime? I often find it humorous when the Government talks about its commitment to human rights on the international stage but we then deal with dictatorships like the Chinese regime, because that is what it is. It is a brutal dictatorship in a country with no democracy that ruthlessly crushes all opposition in the most bloody way; routinely executes people for often relatively minor crimes, as the Chinese dictatorship would see them; has no respect for the human or civil rights of its own population; brutally represses people in Tibet; and brutally treats much of its rural population, which is where we get very close to the issue of the Asian Investment Bank. It has already been indicated that some of the investments of the Asian Investment Bank are in areas like hydro power and it has not ruled out coal. Even though it pays some lip service to the Paris climate change targets and environmentalism, the bank has carefully ensured the door remains open for financing coal-powered projects, which are doing immense damage to the global environment in China and causing huge pollution that impacts on the health of the Chinese population, or hydro power projects in China, which have had a very devastating effect on rivers and have driven people out of whole swathes of the countryside they previously inhabited because of the impact of dams to develop hydro power projects. These projects have a very serious and negative impact on millions of Chinese people about whom the Chinese state does not give a damn. The Chinese Communist party does not give a damn about these people but just drives ahead with what it dictates are in the interests of China Inc. We are very keen to get involved in that and get a slice of the cake regardless of the callous and brutal disregard of the Chinese regime for the rights of its own people or minorities within China or the often devastating environmental impact of some of the big infrastructure projects in which the Chinese regime has engaged.  As a growing industrial and economic power, China wants to start to rival the other big blocs in the world in beginning to use its surplus of capital to start a form of economic colonialism much like the US and the western powers have used the IMF and the World Bank to embark on a new phase of economic colonialism. This is where they lend money to poorer countries like Bangladesh in order to do as the IMF and the World Bank have done, namely, to get those countries in hock, gain control of strategic influence over key infrastructure projects and natural resources, profiteer from them at the expense of those populations and draw those countries into the debt boomerang, as Susan George described it. The bank lends money to these countries in an apparently benign move to assist them but in reality, the bank gets them into debt and then exercises very significant control over how those projects are carried out, the conditions of employment of the workers, the need for privatisation as part of developing those infrastructure projects and crippling interest repayments which lock those countries into a debt cycle which cripples them. Susan George is one of the foremost international critics of what she calls the debt boomerang where someone throws something and it comes back and hits them in the face. That is what debt has done to the Third World. Investment that appears to be benign ends up being a mechanism to transfer massive amounts of wealth from the poorer countries to richer countries. In one of Susan George's seminal books, The Debt Boomerang, which was written in the early 1990s, she points out how this worked. It largely involved debt owed to the IMF and the World Bank. Between 1982 and 1990, the debtor countries, which are overwhelmingly very poor countries, paid back $1,300 billion to the creditor countries mostly through the IMF and the World Bank. This is an enormous amount of money for these countries. Did that reduce the debt burden of those countries or did it increase? Have a guess. Their debt actually increased in that period. After paying out $1,300 billion, they still owed more to the western countries that were the financiers and members of these global institutions like the World Bank than they owed when they took out the loans in the first place. These literally become mechanisms to suck out billions and as we move through the 21st century with inflation, we are talking trillions. When one looks at the fire-power of this Asian Investment Bank, they are talking about $4 trillion in investment per year and one can see that this becomes the mechanism to then suck out multiples of that over long periods of time from these poor countries, gain control of their infrastructure and resources, gain very significant influence over their governments and essentially blackmail the population of those countries.Of course, we have now seen echoes of this with the EU-IMF structural adjustment programme called austerity, which was imposed on us when we found ourselves sucked into this cycle, and we are still affected by it. Members should think about what happened with our strategic investment fund here. We have to privatise as part of those investments. We have €4 billion but we have to allow the market into those investments and somebody else has to make money out of it. We are tied into that because of the strings that are attached in fiscal treaties and so on with European arrangements to which, crazily enough, we have signed up. The severe negative impact is evident and affects, even as we speak, our capacity to invest in social housing, health care and all that. We are restricted and denied the right to invest even our own money in the social housing we desperately need, creating the incredible irony that Ireland could build more social housing in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s when it was poorer - virtually a Third World country but where we had control over our own investment and expenditure - than we can deliver in the early 21st century. We are beginning to get a taste of this, but the poorer countries of the world have been suffering from this since at least the 1980s and the 1990s. It has had a devastating effect on those countries. Now we are planning to do an Asian version of this, with China in the lead, India playing an important role and Germany, obviously, involved as one of the other big participants. We are a minor player in it but as the Minister indicated, we want to be seen to be part of the club with these big boys. It is interesting that the United States and Japan do not want to get involved in this because they see this as a potential rival to the World Bank and as part of the intensifying competition between the big economic blocs of the United States and the western blocs on the one hand and China on the other. Do not get me wrong. I do not feel sorry for Donald Trump and the US in its fears about the growth of Chinese economic power or a rival power to the United States but the point is that we should recognise all these big, super-economic blocs, which essentially are trying to engage in forms of economic imperialism and colonialism in their regions, as being a major problem for the world. They ultimately accelerate the flow of wealth from the have-nots to the haves, from the poor countries to the rich countries, from the working people to the big bankers, the big financiers and the big corporate interests that dominate in influence and with their positions in institutions like the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, AIIB, the World Bank, the IMF and so on. This is a power grab by a rising power, China, to get in on the act that has been monopolised by the IMF and the World Bank, and to rival it. In the competition that is intensifying between the US bloc and the rising Chinese bloc, the losers will be ordinary people in those countries, in China itself, in surrounding countries and the surrounding region and indeed the whole world with regard to the environment. They have a callous, cavalier disregard for the environment and the consequences, as well as the rapidly accelerating gap between the haves and the have-nots on a world scale. This institution will further accelerate and intensify that mode of organising global economic activity. That is what it is about, namely, about China getting in on the act and us facilitating that. I do not think we should. I think there are better ways that we could spend €125 million to do things that we need to do here. I am not saying we should not use moneys that we have to help other countries that need support and investment but not via institutions like this, which are all about squeezing as much back out as they possibly can. These institutions are not about benign aid or assistance and solidarity but are about lending money to get back extortionate interest and to gain control over governments, investment policies and countries' actual physical infrastructure and services at the expense of the people and the environment in those countries. I will conclude on that but these points must be made because this is a significant development. The sad history of the World Bank and IMF on the global stage over the past 20 or 30 years should really make us reconsider why we would want to get involved in another project of this sort, which is destined to do the same sort of damage that the IMF and World Bank have done.
