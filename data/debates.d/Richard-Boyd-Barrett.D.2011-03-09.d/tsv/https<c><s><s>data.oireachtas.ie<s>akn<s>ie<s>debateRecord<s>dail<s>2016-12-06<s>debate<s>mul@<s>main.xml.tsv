RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What discussions, if any, is the committee having on strategic development zones? I had a briefing yesterday at Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on the Cherrywood strategic development zone and what is, in effect, the building of a new town in south Dublin in my own constituency. This morning I was at a meeting of the Irish Glass Bottle Site Housing Action Group, which was discussing the strategic development zone on the Poolbeg Peninsula with particular reference to the Irish Glass Bottle Company site. Is the Taoiseach looking at the detail of the strategic infrastructure project areas? In particular, does the Taoiseach have a plan to ensure that, out of these very significant strategic development areas, we are going to get for the public the public and affordable housing we need to meet the disastrous housing emergency we now face? The evidence suggests we are not. The Irish Glass Bottle Site Housing Action Group tells me that NAMA will not meet its representatives even though it has asked it to do so several times. They want to meet the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, and they want the Irish Glass Bottle Company site handed over to Dublin City Council to ensure that we do not get a miserable 10% of so-called social housing, but rather get at least 75% public and affordable housing. Their fear is that NAMA is going to flog that site off to developers and all we will get is a miserable 10% when we are the ones who are putting in place all the infrastructure the private developers will gain from. Similarly, the local authority is looking for €100 million from the new infrastructure fund for Cherrywood so that we can get the 8,000 residential units there. Given that this was a site sold by NAMA to Hines, a US property fund, are we only going to get a miserable 10% of these 8,000 units for the public when we have paid and will pay hundreds of millions for infrastructure? They are going to make an absolute fortune. Should the Taoiseach not insist that we get a bigger proportion than 10% of Cherrywood for public and affordable housing? That 10% is a miserable figure which means these developers are getting a free lunch. I want some commitment from the Taoiseach that they will not get a free lunch and that the public will get something back on these strategic development zones.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Despite frequent rhetorical commitments by the Government to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, the 2015 report on emissions by the Environmental Protection Agency was damning. It showed that overall, emissions were increasing by 3.7% and that emissions have increased under every single major heading including agriculture, industry, transport, the energy industries and manufacturing. Does this not suggest that the huge emphasis that has been put on industrial wind as a way of developing renewable energy and reducing carbon dioxide emissions is a serious failure and a waste of money? Who, exactly, is looking at it? Given the huge investment in industrial wind and its centrality to our renewable energy plans, who exactly is in charge of wind and ensuring it is reducing carbon dioxide emissions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The litany of different people responsible for different aspects suggests to me that nobody is in charge of the overall plan regarding wind energy. This is the problem. My starting point is deep scepticism about industrial wind and the emphasis we are putting on it regarding reducing carbon dioxide emissions, which are not decreasing but increasing. We produce 22% of our electricity from wind and 80% of our renewable electricity is due to come from wind. Wind energy producers are getting approximately 80% of public service obligation funding. That is a lot of money, put up by the public. The Minister can confirm the figures. Who is deciding where the money, which is being paid by ordinary people and which does not seem to be delivering results, is going? Where is the overall strategic environmental assessment of the wind energy plan? Where is the cost-benefit analysis as to whether industrial wind is the way to go?I am deeply sceptical that it is the way to go. Many people say its net impact on reducing CO2 emissions is negligible and that we should be looking in different areas to develop more efficient forms of renewable energy that are better for the environment as well as looking at public transport, insulation, etc.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is exactly the point. It is an intermittent source which still requires us to have other sources. There are serious questions. Wind Aware Ireland, of which, excuse the pun, the Minister will be aware, suggests that, at best, wind can only impact approximately 3% or 4% of our emissions. Nevertheless, a massive proportion of the public money going into renewables is going into this area which seems to be having a negligible effect on CO2 emissions while serious questions arise in regard to the cost-benefit analysis of industrial wind as against a greater emphasis on insulation, passive house standards, free or heavily subsidised public transport to get people to use the system, afforestation, solar and all sorts of other areas. A focus on those areas would have a far bigger impact in terms of both energy security and reducing CO2 emissions, which we are not doing terribly well on.
