RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the ten minutes available to me, I certainly will not be able to cover the multiple issues that arise from the whole Siteserv-IBRC debacle in the necessary sort of forensic detail. I assure Deputy Regina Doherty that I hope to look at the issues in a reasoned manner.Whatever about the use of language, to mention the context of the Moriarty tribunal, the adverse findings in relation to Denis O'Brien and his relationship with a former Fine Gael Minister is relevant to this, particularly given that no action was taken subsequent to the Moriarty tribunal, when we were possibly talking about criminal activity. That is a serious issue and is not playing politics. It is one that must be addressed. The failure of the Government to act on the findings of the Moriarty tribunal raises very serious questions connected with this matter. I pay tribute to Deputy Catherine Murphy for pursuing this matter. It raises serious questions about the Government’s responsiveness to parliamentary questions and issues raised by parliamentarians about this and other matters and whether the Government’s attitude was to deliberately not pursue the matter, to obfuscate, to cover up or not respond at all as it should do. It has been dragged kicking and screaming over four years to finally launch the investigation that should have been launched in 2012. I am sorry the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Donohoe, has left the Chamber because this raises serious questions generally about the Government’s attitude to parliamentary questions and serious issues of concern. To give one example which the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport might consider, I have asked 50 questions or more about Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company-----

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked 50 questions raising issues of corporate governance to do with public assets, unexplained payments, expenses and so on, over a four-year period but no action was taken. There is a story there. This connects with the Siteserv issue. In the Minister of Finance’s statement last week, he said "any concerns around the [Siteserv] transaction were not known either to me or to my officials when answering parliamentary questions prior to June 2012”. I dug out a question I asked the Taoiseach in June 2012, when I said:I am simply summarising what was in the Moriarty report. It made serious findings about the circumstances in which Mr. O'Brien received the aforementioned licence [the Esat licence] and about the role a former Fine Gael Minister had in helping him to secure that licence. ... This is not simply an historical question and the Taoiseach should clarify his relationship and that of his party to Mr. O’Brien. I ask him to so do particularly as a live issue faces us yet again in respect of Mr. O’Brien’s recent acquisition of Siteserv plc and its facilitation by the writing down by Anglo Irish Bank of €110 million worth of debt to that company. This deal deserves considerable scrutiny and in the context of the controversial plans to introduce water metering and water charges, I note Siteserv provides contracting services to Bord Gáis, including the installation of water meters. The Taoiseach said:In regard to the question about the Siteserv position, I point out to Deputy Boyd Barrett that the Competition Authority looked at that merger to see if there were any anti-competitive practices contained therein and it made its decision approving that merger independently, as is its function and responsibility.There was no mention of the fact that the Minister for Finance had launched an investigation at that point into the sale of Siteserv. It was a case of nothing to see here. In his statement, the Minister essentially implied that because no further parliamentary questions were asked after April there was nothing for him to respond to in respect of the concerns he had about Siteserv. In fact, I had asked the Taoiseach about it in June. There was something to respond to. Even if the Taoiseach was not aware of it, which I find surprising, why would the Minister not inform him afterwards and inform a Deputy who had raised it that there was in fact an investigation at that stage and that the Department had very serious concerns about what was going on in Siteserv? Mike Aynsley pointed out in his interview with The Sunday Business Post that, contrary to the notion the Minister knew little of what was going on in Siteserv, from the last quarter of 2011 there were monthly meetings with the Department and all significant transactions were being discussed with the Department and the Minister would have been aware of them. There were numerous press reports in the aftermath of the sale and, indeed, in the run-up to the sale about serious concerns raised about the matter. One quite startling report was in the Sunday Independent on 8 April, before the parliamentary questions were asked, where Jody Corcoran writes about Denis O’Brien and Phil Hogan: "In due course, Siteserv will, no doubt, tender for state contracts, such as, for example, the installation of water meters at households around the country - a contract that will be granted by the Department of the Environment.” That is interesting. He goes on to say: “As both men are no doubt aware, it simply would not do for them to have either formal or informal meetings, nor, for that matter, for them to bump into each other over a burnt rasher, lest anybody get the wrong idea. You cannot be too careful these days." There were already suggestions in the public domain of an improper relationship between Phil Hogan and Denis O’Brien, water metering, the sale of Siteserv, the write-downs and so on.  Another fact that needs to be looked into in this matter is that Denis O’Brien got the money he used to buy Siteserv, as well as the €119 million lost to the State in the write-down on Siteserv, and possibly preferential interest rates, from Allied Irish Banks, AIB, another publicly owned bank.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That raises very serious questions. This is somebody who owes €500 million to one bank, where there are now allegations that he was not meeting the terms of those loans and was looking to renegotiate them, who gets an enormous write-down to his benefit when he takes over Siteserv, and the bank that lends him the money to buy the company is 100% publicly owned. Do we not need to look into the decisions to lend him money for that transaction and other big loans or write-downs, the question of Independent News and Media and the €100 million write-down, which, to some extent, benefitted Denis O’Brien? The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport put this in context. The big context is that in a period when child poverty rose and 137,000 children live in consistent poverty, Denis O’Brien’s wealth went from €2.2 billion in 2009 to €6.9 billion by 2015. That is a massive transfer of wealth from ordinary people into the pockets of the new oligarchs. That is a very serious context in which we need all the answers about the most important job this Government and the Minister for Finance had, the disposal of the assets and loans of the banks we bailed out, who they went to and did that involve enriching a tiny insider elite, as the evidence suggests it certainly might have.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Chair. This Bill seeks to address two central areas. I welcome the decision to replace the registered employment agreements that were struck down as a result of a court ruling. Similarly, the provisions in the Bill that seek to address the whole issue of collective bargaining are long overdue. Obviously, the context for this legislation is the fact that we have the second highest level of low pay in the OECD, which is a pretty dire situation, and the existence of the phenomenon of the working poor, which is linked to the fact that 16% of those who are living in poverty are working. The Government has been central in pursuing an agenda that involves the introduction of so-called labour activation schemes like JobBridge and Gateway. To my mind and the minds of many others, such schemes are exploitative because they essentially use cheap labour instead of employing people on a properly paid basis to do real jobs that need to be done by local authorities. In the case of JobBridge schemes, private sector employers are essentially able to avail of free labour. Like many people, I would certainly say that such schemes have been used as a mechanism to massage the unemployment figures, encourage a push to the bottom in terms of wages and conditions and further the low pay economy. It has already been mentioned that the phenomenon known as bogus self-contracting is another important dimension to the context in which we are debating this legislation. The abuse of the relevant contract tax system was particularly highlighted at the time of the Rhatigan dispute. Construction workers will certainly say that the absolutely flagrant, widespread and massive abuse of that system is absolutely endemic across the construction sector. Developers and big contractors use the relevant contract tax system as a means of exploiting workers in the most appalling way. In the Rhatigan case, workers discovered after six weeks that they were getting €5 an hour, in effect. They were forced to go out on strike. It was just appalling. It is worth remembering that the workers were fully vindicated when they finally went to the courts, which found that the abuses they claimed were happening were happening, that they were being exploited and that this system was being abused. It has been clear ever since when I have been talking to those workers and others concerned with this area that the Government needs to take urgent action to address this whole scheme. It does not seem that Revenue is making a serious effort to address this issue. One allegation made by workers concerned about it is that there is a massive loss to Revenue. The massive number of people employed under the relevant contract tax system is disproportionate. Of course there are real subcontractors out there. If they are examined carefully, it is clear that many of these people do not fit any serious criteria of being a subcontractor. The tenders they put in, often for public jobs, are a joke. Any serious examination of them would show that these people are putting in tenders that they could not fulfil without brutally exploiting the people who work for them. These subcontractors often use laughable addresses. I have a document showing the address of a contractor involved in a public contract for a development at St. Patrick's College in Drumcondra. The address of the contractor who was employing people to do a job at that college turned out to be an undertakers on the Lisburn Road. There is too much to go into there. This is a very serious abuse. These things have to be looked into. On the Bill itself, obviously the re-establishment of the registered employment agreements is a positive development. We are going to have to look at the details of this measure on Committee Stage to make sure it is fully robust.Whether a group is substantially representative is the key issue we need to consider to ensure that there are not too many hoops for workers to jump through in order to avail of these employment agreements to ensure decent conditions at a sectoral level or in the registered employment agreements. On Committee Stage we will need to scrutinise the Government’s claim that we cannot, for constitutional or legal reasons, establish union recognition where the employer is obliged to recognise a trade union. The Government will no doubt argue we cannot do that and this is the best way to get around it. There is, however, a substantial difference between proper trade union recognition and an employer being required to recognise a trade union, which should be a basic right for workers, and what this legislation proposes which is also potentially open to abuse by the employers.
