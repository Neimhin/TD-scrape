RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Despite the crippling austerity imposed by the Government on working people-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----it has failed to get a deal on the bank debt issue.  As a consequence, it is now a racing certainty that we will require a second so-called bailout and be forced into the ESM programme which is nothing more than another but institutionalised EU-IMF austerity programme.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Incredibly, despite that certainty - something even the Government's spokespeople more or less acknowledged in the last week of the referendum debate - the Government refused to have a full debate on the European Stability Mechanism.  That is just extraordinary.  We could be tied into this ESM and the austerity that will go with it for years because of the failure of the Government's policies and the failure to get a write-down of debt.  All the Government is allowing is a few hours of debate on the ESM.  Serious issues are contained within the ESM.  It lacks public accountability and public oversight and it will be immune from prosecution and investigation.  It could cost the State €11 billion or more to be involved in it-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----but the Government is imposing a guillotine.  This is what we get from a Government that promised more transparency and a new type of democracy - a guillotine is being imposed on the ESM Bill.  That is absolutely unacceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The guillotine should be removed on the debate and the public should be allowed to know the full facts about the ESM.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I had planned to say certain things but I must respond to Deputy White.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The idea that it was the arguments of the "No" side that led to the passing of the referendum is an interesting analysis.  It gives little credit to the arguments of the "Yes" side and is not borne out by the facts.  The polls showed that the percentages on the "Yes" and "No" sides did not shift from the beginning of the campaign to the end.  It looks as though the arguments pretty much cancelled each other out, from the beginning to the end.  Deputy White made an interesting political jibe but it does not stand up to scrutiny or to the evidence of polls taken consistently from the beginning to the end of the campaign.The issue was always the fear of the consequences of voting "No".  The Government and the "Yes" side traded on fear of the unknown, of the dire consequences of funds not being available to the State, of money not coming out of ATM machines and of pensions and social welfare not being paid.  That is the message the Government gave and that ordinary people got.  It is the message canvassers heard on the doorsteps from people who were intending to vote "Yes".  They were afraid.  Fear was whipped up relentlessly by the "Yes" side throughout the campaign.  A significant proportion of those who voted "Yes" did so with a heavy heart because they were angry at being asked to carry the can for the crimes of others in the Irish financial and political systems and for the greed of developers, speculators and others.  They voted "Yes" with a heavy heart because they were afraid of the consequences of a "No" vote.There were mixed opinions on the "No" side, but the United Left Alliance has a clear alternative.  Unlike the Government and the "Yes" side, we do not promise ridiculous fairytales such as investment, stability and certainty.  No one can promise those.  We did not promise them.  The "Yes" side did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will get to that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The "Yes" posters emblazoned investment and recovery and stability.  Certainty was a slogan.  That was a fairytale.  There is no stability.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do not promise stability, at least not in the short run.  The Government should not have promised it, but having promised stability, it should deliver it.  One would have to be living in a parallel universe to imagine that a decision taken last Thursday or the rushing through of the ESM would lead to stability. Can Deputy Durkan stand over that?There is rampant and well-founded speculation that if the people of Greece are not willing to take even more poisonous doses of austerity, which has already decimated Greek society and its economy, Greece will be forced out of the eurozone.  No one knows whether that will happen.  There is no certainty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a widespread belief that if Greece exits, as a result of being bullied out of the eurozone because it is not willing to accept more of the poisonous austerity that has done such damage, the result will be catastrophic for the wider eurozone and could spell the beginning of the end of the eurozone.  That is very likely.  It is also likely that a Greek exit would tip the eurozone further into recession and, possibly, into a depression.  No one really knows.  To suggest that stability and certainty lie on the other side of the vote is nonsense.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Certainty was repeated again and again.  We do not have certainty of funding.  There is no security.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of course Deputy Durkan is upset.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He does not like being disagreed with.  I understand that.  He will have his chance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I remind Deputy White that the United Left Alliance clearly set out an alternative.  Sooner or later that alternative will be debated, when the austerity agenda crashes further into crisis, as it is destined to do and as the foundations of the eurozone are shaken further by the disastrous strategy being pursued by Angela Merkel.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely, and I will say it again: default, default, default.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Durkan's sound economics-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They do not like hearing alternative proposals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some of us believe the alternative is to refuse to pay the gambling debts of bankers, financiers and bondholders and that alternative would substantially reduce the debt burden on the country and our deficit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would not.  In addition, we need to nationalise our banking system.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	By nationalising, the United Left Alliance means that as well as recapitalising banks, we would actually control their policies.  It is amazing that Deputy White and others on the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform bemoan the fact the banks we have recapitalised will not provide adequate finance to small and medium enterprise or give an adequate break to distressed mortgage holders who cannot make their repayments and are threatened with the loss of their homes but continue to insist we have nationalised the banks.  It was my understanding that if we nationalised the banks, we would control them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People who are democratically elected by the people, yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Deputy Durkan think it better to have in charge of our banks the same bankers who led us into the crisis and who are paid half a million euro a year?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We understand.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We believe the people, through democratically elected representatives, should control the financial system, so that we dictate the lending and investment policies of the banks and so that those policies are directed towards the social good, investment in small and medium enterprise and infrastructural projects, the development of strategic industry and enterprise and all the things that are not happening now. The banks are not putting the money back into the economy.  No matter how much we shovel money into the banks, it does not go back into the economy.  We throw up our hands and ask why the banks do not do this, that and the other, but we refuse to exercise control over them.It is not a question of exercising control over every nut and bolt.  It is about setting the strategic priorities for the banking system and telling banks that our priorities are distressed mortgage holders and keeping roofs over people's heads, employment and putting people back to work, and developing strategic enterprise and industry in order to put people back to work and generate real wealth, real growth and real revenue.  Is Deputy White saying we cannot do that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are not doing it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not la-la economics.  It is about setting the strategic priorities and enforcing them on the banking system.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are not doing it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where is the money going in?  Why are small and medium enterprises screaming week in, week out about how they are being starved of credit by the banks that we have recapitalised?  Why are they screaming if it is all working swimmingly?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why have trillions been put into the European banking system and still the money is not going back into the European economy, which is being suffocated?  The European economy is contracting and there is a major strike of private sector investment which has collapsed across Europe.  Those are the facts.  When are we going to wake up and assert control over the banking system which we have re-financed?  Do we not have the right to do that?  Is it not an absolutely urgent priority that we do it?  It seems obvious to me that it is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In response to what Deputy White said, when people ask where is the money, has he not noticed what we have been doing-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----for the past two or three years?  The money is in the banks because we put it into them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The money is in the banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.  The money is in the banks and it is about time we used it for the social good and the development of the economy and society.  Furthermore, we have argued there must be a more general redistribution of wealth in society because it is concentrated in the hands of a small minority who are either not spending the money or not investing it in the economy.  Figures emerged in recent weeks showing multinationals in Europe sitting on between €2 trillion and €3 trillion worth of uninvested profits.  Why are they not investing?  It is because they do not think they can make a profit.  Why do not think they can make a profit?  It is because the demand in the economy has collapsed and they do not think they can sell their goods.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We must short circuit that situation and get control of those resources.  That means tackling the wealth through corporation tax, taxes on financial transactions and taxing the obscene wealth of a tiny minority who control disproportionate amounts of wealth and reinvesting it in society and in the economy.  In contrast to that - a genuinely alternative approach to organising our economy - our Government, along with Mrs. Angela Merkel, cling on the dogma and doctrine of austerity which has failed miserably for the past four years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At least the Government was honest when it said there was nothing new in the treaty.  That is exactly the point.  That is precisely why we opposed it, because there is nothing new and it is carrying on along the same train tracks of austerity that have led us into this mess in the first place.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I say to Deputy White that we want something new.  We want an alternative strategy because the one that is being pursued is not working.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the catastrophes that have been inflicted on this country and on the Greek people as a result of austerity have not woken the Government up to the fact that austerity is not working and that this approach to the crisis is not working, perhaps the Spanish crisis will now wake the Government up to that fact.  The hole in the Spanish banks is likely to be anywhere between €100 billion and €250 billion, probably closer to the latter figure.  We will have to contribute to that fund, after contributing billions to bail out our own insolvent banks whose reckless gambling and speculation caused the crisis in the first place.  We will now have to bail out the Spanish banks, the French banks and German banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When will we stop bailing out the banks and start to adopt a different approach where we prioritise people, jobs, economic growth and employment?  The Government defends its position by saying that at least there is talk in Europe now of there being assistance to the banks that will not be channelled through the sovereign and will not be unloaded onto the backs of ordinary citizens and the books of member states.  That is the Government's big play after the referendum, that it is hoping that the ground is shifting in Europe and that we will be able possibly to ride on the back of whatever Spain gets in the hope that we can get a retrospective deal on bank debt.  However, Mrs. Angela Merkel responded to the Government's appeals only days after it had done what she demanded it do in passing the fiscal treaty and said: "Nein, nein, nein."  While that is German for "No, no, no.", it could equally be the 999 emergency number we will need to ring for the European economy if we keep going down the road of this disastrous austerity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At what point will the Government get it?  It has taken the best boy in the class routine to the most extreme lengths in pushing through this treaty when other forces in Europe are at least delaying it or beginning to question Mrs. Merkel's strategy.  The Government continues with the best boy in the class routine and only a few days after this country passed the fiscal treaty, Mrs. Merkel slaps the Government in the face again.  There has been no reward, no deal on bank debt, no change to the terms of the austerity arrangements and she has made it clear that Germany insists that ordinary citizens, working people - the vulnerable - will continue to pay the price of the crisis in the system.  All of the assistance will be strictly conditional - that is the key term: "strictly conditional" - on continuing with the poison of austerity inflicted on ordinary people.  When will the Government learn that trying to suck up to Mrs. Angela Merkel and the austerity boot boys of the troika is not working?  The more one encourages her to think there is no end to the punishment we are willing to take, the more she dishes out the punishment.  Despite saying the Government is supporting the forces in Europe that are now calling for a growth and jobs agenda in Europe, the reality is that by ramming the fiscal treaty through with such speed and now the ESM, in particular in the case of the latter which is not being discussed, it is undermining and sabotaging the forces in Europe that are beginning to challenge Frau Merkel.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, and now it is the ESM, which is not being discussed properly.  The Government wants to ram it through to prove again to Mrs. Angela Merkel what good boys and girls we are.  There will be no discussion on it despite the fact the ESM has profound implications.  Throughout the referendum debate the Government presented the ESM as if it was some sort of benevolent fund which was there to assist the people when there was so much more involved in it.  Whether one agrees or disagrees, it is utterly dishonest to suggest that is all there is to it, that it is just an insurance policy or a benevolent fund.  Serious issues arise from the ESM that must be debated properly.  It would be utterly dishonest of the Government to say the people of this country are acquainted in any serious way with the contents of the ESM treaty because they are not.  It has not been discussed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept the fiscal treaty was discussed at length.  The Government won the debate.  There is no question about that - through fear in my opinion - but the Government did win the debate.  However, it is dishonest to suggest there has been a full public discussion of the serious issues that arise out of the ESM because it is not just a benevolent fund.  It raises serious questions about the potential cost to the State of establishing the ESM in the event of a further bank meltdown across the eurozone, which is now looking seriously likely given what is happening in Spain and the knock-on effects we are likely to see in France and elsewhere.  To be honest, there could be a call on the State of €11 billion or more.  This is what the treaty allows.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise.  I did not know.  It is wrong to railroad this legislation through the House in just a few hours.  The Government should allow for a proper debate.  Instead, this is a continuation of the sucking up to Angela Merkel despite the fact that no matter how much the Government does so, she slaps it down and humiliates it.  She is giving it nothing.  When will the Government realise that sacrificing the interests of our society and of ordinary people in Ireland to please Frau Merkel is not working and we need to take a different tack?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The situation faced by those in Priory Hall and Belmayne and those whose houses were constructed with material containing pyrite is appalling.  This is not just about the tragic effects that has had on the residents, although the motion asks the Government to declare it will take the lead in providing the resources necessary to undertake the remedial works or transfers necessary to house these people in buildings of a proper standard and quality that are safe and to do whatever else is necessary to compensate them for the appalling position in which they find themselves through no fault of their own.The residents of Belmayne and Priory Hall and of houses containing pyrite are the tip of the iceberg and the United Left Alliance and the Technical Group are not the only people saying that.  There is considerable evidence that this is the case.  For example, the SEAI found that 93% of housing built between 1997 and 2002, which it examined, did not comply with regulations to reduce the risk of fire spread.  The director general of Engineers Ireland, John Power, described the findings as "truly appalling" and said that, "Priory Hall is symptomatic of what is likely to be a long line of disasters as a result of the lack of building control in this country".  That is the serious issue we are asking the Minister to address.  It potentially affects tens of thousands of people and results from a lack of compliance with building regulations by builders who were driven by nothing other than a profit frenzy to slap up substandard housing and apartments to make a fast buck regardless of the consequences for the people who bought them.The failure of builders and developers resulting from their greed was compounded by the disgraceful failure of the building regulations themselves and the authorities that were supposed to enforce them.  It is incredible that houses built without complying with the regulations were inspected and, in many cases, passed.  How could that happen?  Clearly, the regulations failed and successive Governments failed to resource a proper building inspection regime.  All of this was facilitated by politicians who were beholden to developers and builders and who were addicted to a political and economic doctrine of deregulation.  The same doctrine and dogma deregulated the financial sector and crashed the financial system.  When the same doctrine was applied to housing, it resulted in a disaster for the people of Priory Hall and Belmayne, those with pyrite in their homes and tens of thousands of other homeowners who may not even know the full extent of the problems in their homes and the potential fire hazard they may face because we do not know the full extent of this problem.This is the legacy of the Galway tent.  Fianna Fail Members should hang their heads in shame about what went on in that tent and what it led to by allowing cowboy builders and developers to run amok.  However, as the Mahon Tribunal report informed us, the political establishment generally was involved, particularly Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and they had a rotten relationship with builders and developers.All we are asking is that the Minister says he will do something for the residents of Priory Hall and Belmayne and those affected by pyrite and do more than what he proposes in his amendment to deal with the inadequate building regulations and inspection and enforcement regime.  When my colleagues and I spoke to builders on sites during the boom, they told us we were building the tenements of the future and there was no proper inspection regime on site.  They used to point to the old days - I do not know that much about building - when clerks of works were on site from the beginning to the end of a project monitoring every single stage of construction.  The State then moved to self-certification and deregulation and we have witnessed the dire consequences of that.  We need proper building regulations and a return to the regime where clerks of works are on site from the beginning of a project in order that it is not left up to profit-driven developers and builders to inspect themselves because that just does not work.
