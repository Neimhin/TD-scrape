RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I object strongly to the proposal to take the motion without debate. Everybody knows that the public is angry about what they are being made to face. They are required to count every cent and they are fearful of what they may lose.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People are fearful about the forthcoming budget and every cent is being scrutinised. Many are living in poverty. It is understandable that the public should demand full transparency and accountability for expenditure relating to this House.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Independent Deputies have attempted to raise serious issues about expenditure on staff and allowances from which party members can benefit but Independent Members cannot. These issues should be debated and scrutinised in Dáil Éireann in full public view.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why are expenses not vouched?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a positive thing that we have had this debate. Deputies on all sides need to take part in good faith in a serious debate about the desperate plight we are in and what we can do to get out of it. Most people find it pretty galling that these troika people come along every three months to tick all the boxes and tell us how well we are doing. If we are honest, we will admit that it grates on us. Regardless of the rights and wrongs of the credit the Taoiseach does or does not deserve, it does not really help the morale of the Irish people when German magazines tell us that our Taoiseach is the European of the year or when Time says it thinks we are wonderful. Frankly, the fact that some magazines in a country that is one of the key architects of austerity and of this country's plight want to tell us how well we are doing at a time when ordinary people are suffering does no more than rub the noses of the Irish people in it. If it is up to him, the Taoiseach would be well advised to refuse such an award. If anyone deserves an award, it is the ordinary citizens of this country who are being crushed by austerity. I do not want to waste much time on what austerity has meant for ordinary people because we are all aware of it. As we try to chart a way out of the crisis, we must start by dealing with the people and the situation they are in. If we do not start with the people and their situation, we are guaranteed to get the issue wrong.If we start with categories such as debt, deficit and growth - economic categories - rather than starting with where the people are and what they need in order to have a civilised, dignified, decent and sustainable existence, we will get it wrong. Frankly, I believe that is part of the problem. Not just in this country but across the world for the past 25 to 30 years, we have been pursuing a philosophy that does not start with the people and what they need. There has been a doctrine that states that if profits are made, they will trickle down and it will be all right for the rest of us at some point. It has not worked. There is not really an acknowledgement of the fundamental fact that the doctrine that has been pursued almost without exception across the globe has failed catastrophically and we need to rethink. We in this country are suffering particularly badly from the consequences of that, with disastrous levels of unemployment and huge numbers of our young and talented people leaving the country. When I hear people talk about our export success, I think the biggest export out of this country - and it certainly is not a success - is our young, talented and educated people. That is a tragedy. Those are the people who would help us recover, but they are leaving. It is a failure and an indictment of our system. The cuts in public services, which are sometimes euphemistically called reform, mean that disabled people have had to sit out overnight in front of the Dáil in order to retain their personal assistants, suicide is going through the roof and despair in our society is rampant. That is the reality and the starting point of where we are at. I put it to the Minister and - as it is not just the Irish Government - to the European leaders that the plan has not worked, however well-intentioned it might have been. I do not doubt that most of the people who pursued the strategy that has been pursued honestly believed it might work. It can be summarised as follows: bail out the banks, not particularly because we want to but because we think it is necessary to have functioning private banks in order to get the economy restarted; and pay for that with severe austerity affecting ordinary people, with the idea running behind it that if we cut costs in the economy, we will make ourselves competitive. The thinking was that these two things would lead to renewed lending and investment. We have pursued that strategy for four years and it has absolutely not worked. We have recapitalised the banks to an extraordinary extent and they are still showing no sign of lending. We have cut our costs and the result has been a contraction of our domestic economy. As the same prescription has been applied to the rest of Europe, the European economy is now contracting as well. That is a fact and even the IMF has now had to acknowledge that what it calls in its technocratic language the spillover effect and the multiplier effect have been much worse than expected. I am not saying "I told you so", but we said this two or three years ago, as the Minister of State knows. There should be some acknowledgement that the argument we and others, including Krugman and Stiglitz, made two or three years ago has turned out to be true, as the IMF is now admitting. The next question is, having acknowledged that the multiplier and spillover effects, which we could just call a vicious circle, have been worse than expected, is it or the Government planning to change course? The answer is "No; we are going to continue on the same road".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the alternative to this? It is hard to explain in three minutes, but I will say this. First, the debt is unsustainable. Our debt was €25 billion in 2007. That is our debt. All the rest is odious debt which results from the crisis and the recapitalisation of the banks. We cannot pay it and we should not pay it. We should tell Angela Merkel we cannot pay it and we will not pay it, either acting unilaterally or to force her to the negotiating table, but it simply cannot be done. The Government's argument all along has been that, if we do this, we will be cut loose and we will be left with a €15 billion or €18 billion deficit. That is not true. The Government should own up on this one. Most of the deficit it is talking about is debt interest next year. The Government has to admit this as it is in the troika figures. Currently, our primary deficit is €3.1 billion. That is what we actually spend over what we get in tax revenue. The rest is debt interest.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, if they will not give us a deal. We default and we are left with a deficit of €3.1 billion to cover. Can we cover a deficit of €3.1 billion? The answer is "Yes", through progressive income taxation on wealth, on profits and on higher incomes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We would increase the effective tax rate on incomes over €100,000 from the current levels, ranging between 33% and 39%, to a range from 35% up to approximately 60% at the top-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No; an effective rate of 60% at the top. That is more reasonable than attacking people on social welfare, the disabled or people on low incomes because, by attacking them, the Government has depressed the economy as well as pushing them into poverty. Why is it unreasonable to take €100,000 more in tax from somebody who earns €500,000 while it is not unreasonable to attack somebody who is on the poverty line? I just do not understand the logic. Second, as I pointed out yesterday in regard to corporation tax, despite gaining €61 billion in profits last year, corporations paid only €4 billion in tax, an effective rate of 6.5%. If we enforce the 12.5% corporate tax rate, the Government will get an extra €4 billion. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Employment, Deputy Bruton, responded to this by saying these allowances are for research and development and all the rest. I have the details in front of me but they are not transparent. For example, there is a €4 billion discount under the category "Other Deductions". Can the Minister of State explain what those other deductions are?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. A 2% wealth tax on the top 5%, excluding the family home and over a threshold of €1 million, would raise approximately €3.2 billion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To house people in empty houses would save us €500 million in rent allowance and generate rental revenue for the State. We should assert control over the banks so they write down the unsustainable mortgages of 160,000 people who are on mortgage relief, for which they have been recapitalised, and dictate their investment and lending policies in order that money starts to go into the economy, which it has not. It is our money that the banks are refusing to invest in the economy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It can be done if there is a will. Will the Government even discuss it?
