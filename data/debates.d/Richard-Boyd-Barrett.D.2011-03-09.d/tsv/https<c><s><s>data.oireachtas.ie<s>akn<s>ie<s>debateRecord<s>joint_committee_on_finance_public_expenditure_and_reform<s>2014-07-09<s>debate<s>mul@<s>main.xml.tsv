RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If premiums were too low, for example.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is even more scary.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My questions follow those points directly.  Some 75,000 policyholders have been shafted.  Many of them are small and medium enterprises and many are individuals.  Somebody has failed to see this coming.  If this discussion is to mean anything, we need to learn lessons.  It strikes me that the dogs on the street could have worked out that there was something wrong with a company if it was licensed in Malta although its shareholders were primarily Irish, it was selling exclusively to the Irish market, its main staff operations were in Ireland and, through its name, it packaged itself as Irish.  That is fishy straightaway as far as I am concerned.  I cannot believe somebody in the Central Bank did not figure out much earlier that it was fishy.  Why the hell would a company do that?  There has to be some scam at play.  It is trying to evade regulation, taxation, or both.  Surely that is obvious.  It is absolutely terrifying that the delegates tell me this is happening all over the place in Europe.  There are companies based in Ireland that do not do any business in Ireland.  Why are they here?  What is the reason for their being here?  There are companies selling insurance mainly in Ireland, such as Setanta, that are not licensed here.  I had an inquiry from the manager of my son's football team asking why there is such a radical difference between motor insurance premiums offered by various insurance companies.  There are staggering differences, yet the underwriters of the insurance are the same people.  Therefore, there is something fishy going on.  The regulatory regime has failed, both at national and European levels.  Is that not obviously the case?  Must we not seriously ask what went wrong, why we did not spot this and whether there is an endemic problem that could mean there will almost certainly be a recurrence?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have to interrupt Mr. Sheridan on that.  I heard the phrase "properly run" and must challenge it.  The point of regulators is precisely to deal with people who do not do business properly.To throw it back and say some firms do not behave as they should is not acceptable. Sure, if they all behaved as they should, there would be no need for regulation. The reason the Central Bank is there and we need laws and regulation is that we know there are many in cut-throat, profit-driven, competitive markets, including insurance, who do not play by the rules. There are cowboys left, right and centre. We had it with Quinn. I am only speculating, but it looks like this gang was up to the same thing as Quinn. It appears they were under-provisioning as they were using the money for other things, as Quinn was. Money that should have been applied to provision against losses was being used to leverage other business deals elsewhere. That is what he was doing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Surely, Mr. Sheridan cannot be serious when he says that companies should just behave better.  Surely, we must have a more stringent regime of regulation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If this committee is going to come out with useful recommendations, I put it to Mr. Sheridan that a simple thing we could learn where companies are doing there business here while being licensed elsewhere is to look at them straight away.  Is that not an obvious conclusion to draw?  We should go straight in and start looking at those companies and ring the alarm bells with the regulatory authorities in the countries in which they are licensed.  If it does not add up that they are licensed in one place and doing all their business here, should we not do that immediately?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure there are lots of legitimate people out there, but I cannot think of a reasonable explanation for a company selling insurance exclusively into Ireland, having its base of operations and employees here, and presenting itself as Irish all the while being licensed somewhere else.  If there are other firms like that, should we not be looking at them straight away to ensure we are not here again within a few months or a couple of years?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will pair with the Chairman.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Following on from Deputy Doherty's question, the Irish Brokers' Association said that the same treatment should have been applied to the customers and policy holders of Setanta that was applied to Quinn Insurance, but that was not the case, and that in the case of Quinn Insurance, policy holders got a clear commitment that there would be no loss.  What is stopping us from doing that?  Is it just because the company was in Malta?  If that is the case, I put it to the witnesses that this is crazy.  We say the regulatory failure was because the company was in Malta and it was the one responsible, but the ICF picks up the tab anyway.  We pay the bill and the company did all its business here but the policyholders do not get the same treatment as people affected by the Quinn Insurance case did.  Is that not unfair and inconsistent?  Can anything be done about it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there a divergence of treatment in terms of Quinn Insurance and Setanta customers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand.  First, that divergent treatment is completely unfair from the point of view of the policy holders.  It would probably be the case that if we had the responsibility for trying to sort things out and keep things going, or selling off the policies to somebody else who would maintain them so there were no losses to premium holders, there would probably be far greater motivation to salvage things in the interests of the policy holders than there might be in Malta which, to be honest, does not have any great interest in solving it.  I am not saying Malta did not make efforts - I have no idea what efforts it did or did not make - but it is fairly obvious that we would have made more efforts, because everything was based here and all the policy holders were here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I add to what the Chairman has said?  That is one element of the question, but there is also the issue of the odd location where the business seeks the licence.  Is that an issue?  There are a great many firms that do no insurance business in Ireland but are licensed in Ireland.  There are firms that do all their business here but are licensed in places such as Malta.  There must be some reason for businesses to do this.  Are insurance companies doing this because of the distance between where they conduct their business and the authority whose job it is to license and regulate them, the companies know that it is a bit harder for the regulator to regulate them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what I mean.  I am using the term "regulation" in the most general sense, of ensuring that companies are doing business properly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let me use an example of the problems that the Central Bank might face.  If a company does all its business in Malta, but the Central Bank in Ireland is the body that licenses it and is responsible for its prudential regulation, is it not harder for the Central Bank to keep an eye on it if it is doing all its business in Malta?  Similarly it had to be quite difficult for Maltese authorities to keep an eye on companies that operate in Ireland
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I suggest that we need to red flag the issue of companies that are doing all their business in one place but for some inexplicable reason are seeking the licence to conduct their business elsewhere.  This needs to be red flagged immediately and the existence of this phenomenon needs to be examined.  I have a final question.  Given the inconvenience and the losses that are being suffered by the policyholders, are there potential penalties or sanctions against the future involvement of these directors and shareholders in the insurance business or will they face general sanctions for what they have been responsible?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us say that they are in breach, that there is insufficient provisioning, that they were doing what the Quinn Group was doing, using moneys that should have been for the provision against claims for other things.  If they are guilty of these kinds of practices, what are the sanctions?  Would they be allowed to do business here or anywhere in Europe again?
