RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As part of my question I referred the Tánaiste to a statement that has been put together by activists in Egypt and internationally calling for an end to the brutal repression that is now being undertaken by the Egyptian military regime against pro-democracy activists, students and journalists. Many of the people who led the democratic revolution in Egypt are now in prison, are being prosecuted or are being viciously repressed by the Egyptian military. Will the Tánaiste sign the statement and add the weight of the Government to the international solidarity movement's call for an end to the repression in Egypt?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Tánaiste answer the question on whether he will sign the statement? We need action and not just words from the international community about what is going on. Democracy activists who were gathered in Tahrir Square to celebrate the third anniversary of the Egyptian revolution were targeted by snipers and 64 people were killed. That is what the el-Sisi military regime is doing to the very people who led the revolution against Mubarak. Many of them are now being imprisoned just for engaging in protest. An Irish citizen, Ibrahim Halawa, is still detained in Egypt. There is vicious repression. Whatever Egypt might say internationally about its commitment to democracy, in reality it is crushing the democratic revolution. The regime is hounding and persecuting journalists, students and human rights activists. Amnesty International and every human rights organisation say the situation is deteriorating to a terrible extent. Will the Tánaiste sign the statement and will Ireland and the international community add weight to the demands they put on the Egyptian regime to respect democracy and human rights?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that the Government is making some efforts in this regard and is saying the right things, but the problem is that these regimes are not responding. The Tánaiste rightly said in response to Deputy Nulty about Saudi Arabia that there are many regimes in the Middle East that on paper appear to be democratic but in reality are brutally repressive. The Tánaiste even suggested that some of them are more oppressive than Saudi Arabia, which would be pretty difficult. There is a strong element of truth in the Tánaiste's view. Other regimes are certainly as repressive in many cases. Under Mubarak, Egypt was one of the most repressive regimes, and it is reverting to type now under el-Sisi and engaging in absolutely vicious crushing of pro-democracy groups. A counter-revolution is taking place. There is no other word for what the regime is doing. It is crushing the democratic revolution in Egypt with the most vile and vicious means. The petition states that no country in Europe or the Western world with any influence should trade any goods, including weapons, with Egypt that could be used against the democracy movement. One could ask what we are doing to make that happen in terms of trade sanctions or whether any threat hangs over the Egyptian regime to the effect that if it does not listen then action will be taken. Otherwise, our words mean little.
