RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	According to Standing Order 26(2)(a), the Taoiseach orders the business of the Dáil on the Order of Business and arranges the sittings.  In that context, I want to ask the Taoiseach if the Dáil will have a chance to discuss the cannibal logic that the IMF-EU delegation, which is coming here in the next two weeks, is applying to our economy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That logic involves destroying our economy and our services, supposedly in order to save them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is sucking us dry to the tune of €9 billion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are looking for clarification.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Every time we ask, the Government Whip says "No".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We asked about the McCarthy report.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am extremely disappoint with that answer.  It is the same script that the communities that have been affected by these bus cuts have heard since the swingeing cuts in the provision of bus services across the city have been ripping through the bus service.The Minister should meet the people affected.  It is astonishing that we get this stuff, which we got from the previous Government, about the Minister having no operational control.  As I understand it, and the Minister may correct me if I am wrong, he must sign off on any route changes.  It would be incredible if he did not have to sign off.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Minister does not, it seems he should.Will the Minister meet the users of bus services — pensioners, those with disabilities, young people, and so on — who have been affected by these cuts and they will explain what is going on.  If he met them, he would discover that the line being spun by Dublin Bus is disingenuous and akin to the logic of the United States in the Vietnam war that we must destroy our bus services in order to save and improve them.  The Minister should take that back to Dublin Bus and do something about a situation where elderly persons in this city are being made prisoners in their homes because their bus services are being withdrawn.  One does not improve bus services by taking 200 buses out of the Dublin Bus fleet.Has the Minister read the Deloitte report?  The Deloitte report points out that the Government provides a lower level of subvention for public transport than most of its European counterparts.  It does not recommend cutting the number of buses in the bus service, but under the language of so-called reform and streamlining, cuts are what are happening.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put it to the Minister that there is a contradiction in his statement.  On the one hand he maintains it is about a review and streamlining services but then he admits that the constraints are all to do with the EU-IMF deal and the package of budget constraints that follow from it.  I suggest this is the truth of the matter: it is about the EU-IMF austerity package but it is glossed over with the language of a review.Is it not the case that if one takes 200 buses out of the Dublin Bus fleet one does not get a better service, one gets a worse service?  I call on the Minister to meet these people.  Although public representatives played a role in organising and facilitating some of the meetings, I assure the Minister this involves hundreds or thousands of ordinary residents throughout the city who wish to meet the Minister.  There need not be any public representatives present at the meetings.  These are ordinary citizens who wish to meet the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to explain to him how they are suffering as a result of these cutbacks.  I appeal to the Minister to meet their request.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	By not giving €9 billion to the ECB.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are giving it to them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend the people of Roscommon for coming out and protesting to defend their hospital.  I commend the people of Portlaoise who are mobilising to defend their accident and emergency services.  I want to encourage the people of Shankill and Wicklow and Loughlinstown to join the people of Roscommon and Portlaoise in protesting to defend their hospital's accident and emergency service which is coming under attack.  They will have the opportunity to do so this Saturday at 2 p.m. in Shankill.We all need to stand together against this madness.  The attacks on our hospital services are falsely being presented as something to do with health and safety.  This is nothing but a lie to cover up a brutal agenda of cutbacks and downgradings of public services and of vital hospital services in order to satisfy the greed of bankers and bondholders and to do the bidding of the IMF and their EU masters who are dictating to this Government that the lives of ordinary people and the services for ordinary people in this country should be sacrificed in order to ensure the EU, the IMF, the bankers, the bondholders and speculators in Europe, can make €9 billion profit out of the lives and services of people in this country.  The logic that this Government is applying to justify what it is doing to hospital services in Roscommon, Portlaoise and Loughlinstown, is like the logic the US applied in the Vietnam war when they said, "We are going to save your village by destroying it".  It is the same logic that is being applied here — "we are going to save your health service by closing your accident and emergency service; we are going to save your health service by closing and downgrading your hospitals".  It is nothing but nonsense and lies to cover up brutal and unjust cutbacks.  People will die as a result of this.  There is a choice and the choice is to make the bondholders and speculators who caused this crisis pay for it, not the ordinary citizens of Roscommon, Portlaoise, Loughlinstown, Shankill, Wicklow and the other places around the country whose hospital services are being attacked.I appeal to people that this is part of a bigger agenda.  We need to mobilise now against this mad, IMF-EU austerity package.  People will have the opportunity to do so on Saturday, 16 July, at 2 p.m., at the Garden of Remembrance, Parnell Square.  I hope the whole country comes out to stop this madness and these unjust cutbacks.
