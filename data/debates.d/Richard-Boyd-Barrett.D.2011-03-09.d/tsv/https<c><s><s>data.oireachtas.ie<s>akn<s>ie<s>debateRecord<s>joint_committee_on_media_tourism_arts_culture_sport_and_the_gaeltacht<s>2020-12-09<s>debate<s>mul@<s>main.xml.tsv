RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Chairman. In January 2018, a group of film workers who had worked for a long time within the industry came into the committee and said that there was a very significant problem with section 481 as it amounted to, in various years, €80 million a year plus grants or loans from Screen Ireland of €20 million a year, which over ten years is equal to approximately €1 billion. They pointed out, as people who had been working over that ten-year period or longer, that they had absolutely no rights whatsoever as employees and were in a completely precarious position, despite the fact that they worked for production companies that received moneys through section 481 and loans over a ten or 15-year period. Many of those people, since they came in here, have not worked again in the film industry and say that they have been blacklisted out of it. They have taken cases recently to the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, in respect of, among other things, breaches of collective agreements with Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, members. In one case at least, the Labour Court has found in their favour against a SPI member, which is one of the biggest recipients of funds under section 481.  The other key point is that section 481 specifically requires that the recipient, which is the producer company - I have the declaration here that is required and the designated activity company, DAC, is mentioned - and the DAC has to comply with all employment law as a condition of section 481 eligibility and has to "be responsible for compliance with all statutory requirements of an employer and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing shall be solely responsible in law for the employment, remuneration, taxes, immigration and work permits of all personnel retained for the purposes of the production of [insert film name]". That is very clear.I want to understand why the chief executive officer of Screen Producers Ireland then went to the Labour Court this year and said there was no possible relationship between workers who had worked on section 481 film productions and the producer company. I can quote the person for the witnesses if they wish. In other words, these are film productions that are getting money specifically on a legal requirement that they are responsible for the employment of people. Those same recipients - and I will not mention names but two of the biggest production companies in two cases that have happened this year - went to the Labour Court or the Workplace Relations Commission and said they had no employment relationship whatsoever with these individuals, even though in their statements they acknowledge those individuals have worked on successive productions for which they got section 481 relief. I find that shocking and extraordinary. I am a huge fan of film and I want to see more money going into the film industry but I find it unbelievable this is going on. I want an explanation. I would like to know from Screen Producers Ireland, SPI-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Loans totalling €176 million were given to independent film productions between 2006 and 2018. It has been reported to me that the recoupment rate of those loans in that period is €12 million. Do we, as members of the public and taxpayers, not require some explanation on how loans are being given out by the body in charge of the industry but we are only getting that low level of recoupment? I would like an explanation on that. I genuinely understand that film production is not always about profit and commercial return and I want to see a subsidised film sector, but that requires some explanation. Those are my questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are for Screen Producers Ireland and Screen Ireland, specifically for Screen Producers Ireland in terms of its position that essentially no employment relationship existing between its members and people engaged on its productions. How can they explain that and how are they going to the courts saying no such relationship could even exist?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the record, those were not answers to the questions I put. The ballot referred to was a ballot, and Ms O'Sullivan can correct me on this, of 790 people but there are 2,000 people in the industry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we ask additional questions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thought there were 15 minutes left.
