RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am strongly in favour of this country developing our renewable energy resources. It is vital that we meet, if not exceed, the target of 40% renewables production by 2020 in the context of the climate change crisis and the economic benefits arising from the development of indigenous energy sources. My concern, however, is whether the citizens of the State will reap the benefits of implementing that policy. We have heard about the proposed Dublin Array project which will see the construction of the second largest wind farm in the world 10 km off the Dublin coast and the controversial plans to install more than 1,000 wind turbines in the midlands to generate electricity not for this country but for the British grid. These proposals raise serious questions as to whether the regime we have in place will ensure the people will benefit from the development of our abundant wind resources. What tax regime will apply to these developments? Why is the ESB, for instance, not involved in the development of resources such as the Kish Bank? Have we examined international best practice in terms of proximity to the coastline where, for example, buffer zones of 22 km are observed by a number of the leading wind energy producers in Europe? What is the position in regard to royalty regimes? I am concerned that public consultation is not up to scratch. Some of us are of the view that there has been a giveaway of oil and gas, with no proper regime in place for the development of these resources. Will the Minister assure us that our wind resources will not be given away but will instead be developed to the benefit of the citizens of the State?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The question is whether we will benefit from this. Of course we should sell energy if we have enough of our own, but in a situation in which we have very difficult targets to meet and must massively increase our domestic production of renewable energy, saying we should sell it to England before we have enough of it ourselves is a somewhat spurious argument. These issues need to be teased out. In the midlands - and I am only asking the questions - serious issues arise with regard to proximity to people's homes. Are we looking at best practice for proximity to homes and to the coast in the case of the Dublin Array project? I have an open mind on these issues but I want to see best practice and proper public consultation and I want the Minister to say why there is a 22 km buffer zone for offshore wind energy in Germany, the Netherlands and other European states, while the UK and Denmark are also now considering bringing in a 22 km buffer. Crucially, I want to know what revenue we will get in the form of tax and royalties from the production of this energy. Will there be guaranteed security of supply to the domestic market? Will the energy produced go against our targets for the development of renewable energy or will they boost another country's targets if the energy producers decide to sell or mainly generate for other markets? These are serious questions that need to be answered. Before we can develop these resources, we need to be sure we will benefit from them and that they are being developed in an environmentally safe way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was not my point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is giving away our oil and gas, however.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Minister to watch the documentary film "Gasland" about the impact of hydraulic fracturing in some states in the United States. What it details is terrifying. Whole swathes of agricultural land have been poisoned and become unusable. The consequences of such activity for a much smaller country like ours where agriculture, tourism and the environment are extremely important could not but help the Minister to conclude that hydraulic fracturing is definitely not for this country, if it is something that should be pursued anywhere. If we have to find cheap energy sources, let us find them in renewables. Fracking is a no-no and would be a disaster for this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister should watch this one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Keep it that way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about Barryroe?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Minister not heard about Barryroe?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I intend to travel to Fermanagh to protest at the G8 summit later this month.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In addition, I will speak at one of the alternative summits, in Belfast, where the policies of the G8 will be critiqued on the day before the summit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am very concerned, as are others who intend to participate in these protests, about the enormous hype in terms of potential security threats surrounding the summit. I am very disappointed that the Taoiseach is echoing some of this narrative by alluding to possible threats from protesters. He referred to smashed windscreens, for example.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach threw it into the narrative.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the case that a broken windscreen does not scream with agony in the same way as does a child who is blown to pieces by a drone weapon deployed by the United States in Afghanistan?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us get these matters in proportion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no comparison between an unmanned drone blowing an innocent child to pieces and a broken piece of glass. The reason people are protesting with peaceful intent is that they find it stomach-churning that the leaders of the most powerful nations in the world would talk about peace and global justice while at the same time deploying these types of weapons to such devastating effect, thereby extinguishing the lives of innocent children and families. The bottom line is that the United States and its G8 partners are the major manufacturers, purveyors and users of weapons of mass destruction. Will the Taoiseach echo the concerns of protestors in his dealings with Mr. Obama, Mr. Putin and the leaders of the other powerful states that produce, sell and use these weapons? Will he argue that people are right to express concern about the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent on weapons of war and the means to destroy human lives? That is why people are protesting. As Prime Minister of a country that established its identity in the struggle against empire, the Taoiseach should speak out on behalf of those people. He should make the case that their concerns are justified. Will he also articulate the concern that the major recipient of aid, most of it military aid, from the United States is the state of Israel, which is using that aid to devastating effect in a series of attacks against the innocent people of the occupied Palestinian territories? Will the Taoiseach further undertake to ask President Obama why his Secretary of the Treasury vetoed a proposal to impose some of the burden of the financial crisis in this country on bondholders? Some of us in this House raised this issue two years ago and that particular intervention has since been confirmed. It has had a devastating effect on the ordinary citizens of this country. Moreover, as we have learned from what happened in Cyprus, it was not necessary. It was, in fact, possible to burn bondholders without the entire financial system falling apart. Yet we were spun the lie at the time that it could not be done. The critical intervention came from President Obama's Secretary of the Treasury that burning bondholders might impact on certain corporate interests in the United States. Will the Taoiseach challenge the Obama Administration on the devastating effect that has had on our citizens? Finally, will the Taoiseach demand in advance of the summit an assurance from the Northern Ireland authorities and from the Garda that peaceful protestors will be left alone, that there will not be phalanxes of robocops intimidating and terrifying peaceful protestors, trade unionists and environmental activists who want to travel to Fermanagh to raise these legitimate points? The Taoiseach must do so regardless of whether he agrees with those protestors.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They were from the locality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about Israel?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support the amendment. The people coming through the door of my office week in and week out seem to confirm the perception which is out there that there is a default position, or even an instruction, whereby if any excuse can be found to refuse a payment, then it will be refused. The perception is that the Government hopes that a significant number of people will simply give up and go away, while those who are willing to persist for the very lengthy period it takes to go through the appeals process, including oral hearings and so on, may eventually be granted a decision in their favour. That has been my experience and it is forcing large numbers of applicants into the appeals process. People are completely flummoxed as to why they were refused particular allowances, often, as Deputy Catherine Murphy observed, to do with disability. We, as local representatives, are just as flummoxed as to the reasons for such refusals. We write letters on their behalf and submit parliamentary questions and, in many cases, their entitlement is eventually acknowledged and granted. This must stop. The amendment is an attempt to force the hand of the Department to ensure appeals are dealt with quickly. This would also act as a discouragement to any tendency that is developing to refuse people on a default basis, whenever and wherever officials believe they can get away with it. Some of the cases I have encountered are truly awful. This week, for example, a woman came to see me whose respite care grant has been withdrawn. She has a severely disabled daughter who is going to Canada for three weeks to receive treatment. Her payment was withdrawn because the three weeks happen to coincide with the date on which applicants must be performing a caring role, which apparently is a particular day in June. In other words, because this woman's daughter will be in Canada on that date, her respite care grant is being withdrawn even though she cares for her daughter throughout the remainder of the year and will be caring for her for all the years ahead. That is astonishing. This person will now have to appeal the decision and I will make representations to the Minister on her behalf and so on. It makes absolutely no sense and is utterly unfair, unjust and unacceptable. I mentioned on a previous occasion - one of my amendments deals with such cases - a person whose children are paying his mortgage because he cannot manage himself and would otherwise lose his home. That money is being assessed as means by the Department, with the result that the individual's jobseeker's allowance has been reduced. That decision is also being appealed and will take just as long as all the other appeals. I urge the Minister to accept this very reasonable amendment. The current delays in appeals are unacceptable and the level of refusals is frankly suspicious. Something must be done to prevent this unfairness being inflicted on people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Section 10 represents an effort on the part of the Minister to undo the damage that was done in the last budget. It is prompted by the protests of lone parents and organisations representing them, including SPARK and One Family, and points made on their behalf from the Opposition setting out how retrograde was the move to phase in the elimination of the one-parent family payment when children reach the age of seven. Prompted by those protests and expressions of concern, the Minister said she would not go ahead with the provisions unless we had a Scandinavian model of child care. That was a correct acknowledgement of the concerns that had been raised with her about the impact of this budget measure on lone parents, a group which, as the Minister is well aware, suffers disproportionately from deprivation and poverty. Self-evidently, as many of us thought would be the case, we do not have a Scandinavian model of child care less than one year on and are very unlikely to have one any time soon. While section 10 is an attempt to undo the damage and fill the gap, it does not fully address the problem. Given the fact that we do not have a Scandinavian model of child care, it raises the question of why we do not simply reverse completely the move that was made in the last budget. That is what we should do. One of the reasons is that in the transition payment the Minister proposes, she defeats the very purpose of encouraging and incentivising people to work, which she would generally promote. As the Department's officials acknowledged in a briefing to Opposition Members and representatives of lone-parent organisations, lone parents who are working and earning €200 per week will lose €39 per week. That represents for them a direct disincentive to work. It simply cannot be justified, particularly when lone parents suffer disproportionately from disadvantage and poverty. How can the Minister justify it? It is utterly unfair. Parenting is work. It is not sitting around doing nothing. Being a lone parent is double work. A lone parent does not have the supports one might get from a partner. There are all those extra difficulties. If people see a financial loss as significant as the one that will result from the Bill when they are working, it will be a direct disincentive to work as well as imposing significant hardship. It cannot be justified. While my amendment has been ruled out of order as it proposes a charge on the Exchequer, the Minister could amend the section to provide that people who are working do not suffer financially when making the transition to the new payment. They should not see a reduction in their incomes. If they do, it is a disincentive to work. That is self-evident. It is not the case for people who are not working as they will get the full payment, which is the result, as I understand it, of the difference in the income disregard for one-parent family payment and that for jobseeker's allowance. It is wrong and the Minister cannot justify it. She must address the problem. SPARK raised a further issue in this context. There seems to have been no consideration of how maintenance payments will be treated in assessments of means. SPARK has urged the Minister to consider this issue, which may have a hugely negative effect on lone parents' incomes. SPARK says this issue illustrates how little impact-assessment research has been carried out as to how the changes the Minister is making might affect lone-parent families.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has not really addressed the substantial issue that has been raised by a number of Deputies and which is the basis of my amendment and argument. The argument was put to me by SPARK, bearing in mind the impact this legislation will have on lone parents who are working. It will hurt them financially and act as a disincentive to work. The measure is going in precisely the opposite direction to the direction the Minister claims she wants to go. When she states we all need to address seriously the question of lone parents engaging with work, education and training, she should start by acknowledging that a very significant number of lone parents want to do so. In so far as they have been given the opportunities, incentives and supports to seek work or training, they have sought them. The number engaging has fallen recently given the impact of the recession and cuts, yet approximately 36% or 37% of lone parents are working. The percentage was considerably higher some years ago. It is obvious that if the Minister wants people to work, she should incentivise their doing so. One of the best incentives is to have well-paid jobs available such that going to work would be beneficial financially to one's family. I acknowledge there is not much work at present. It certainly flies in the face of wanting to move in the direction of incentivising work if lone parents are to be hit and hurt financially if they are working when their children reach the age of seven. The Minister cannot justify or stand over this. She has not addressed the specific problem. When one asks the fair question as to why lone parents suffer disproportionately from poverty and disadvantage, the Minister implies it is because the lone parent family system was too passive and did not encourage or assist lone parents in engaging with education, training and employment. There is a much more fundamental answer, namely, the cost of child care. The latter is the difficulty. The Minister acknowledged this. As a result of the lobbying and protesting of lone parents' organisations after the budget announcements, and having thought about the matter, the Minister said the Department would not go ahead with its proposal unless we had a Scandinavian model of child care. She acknowledged this. The answer is that one must have the supports and child care, but we do not have them. The Minister states there are 6,000 new places for after-school care but this is against a backdrop in which the Department estimates the budgetary changes will affect 63,000 claimants.Of course it is an improvement, but 6,000 is a tiny drop in the ocean compared to the number of claimants who will be affected by the changes the Department proposes to make.  We need incentives for people to work, of which the most important is the availability of good, well-paid jobs, and there are not many of them. That is not the sole responsibility of the Minister's Department - rather, it concerns the Government - but it is what we need. We also need child care to enable people who have shown their willingness to work to do so. A high proportion worked when it made sense for them to do so or when jobs were available. The system may not be working for some people. We need to improve it and it could be more proactive. That is not just true of lone parents, to which the Minister alluded; it is true of many groups in our society. Many people who want to work are not getting the help they need. They want to get back into work and be retrained and educated, but are not getting the help and assistance to do so. We should be proactive in giving people assistance, but the problem is that there are people, such as lone parents, for whom it is difficult because of the lack of supports and financial incentives. Will they be subject to the very draconian amendments the Minister has tabled in terms of reducing or even cutting off payments if they do not engage with the system? I presume they will be subject to them. That is pretty serious, given that the cuts that have been imposed by the Minister are acting as a disincentive for people to work when it is already difficult for them to do so. They will be disincentivised and hit financially. If they cannot sustain work for whatever reason they could potentially be subject to draconian measures and be further punished for things that are not their fault. Parents are struggling to bring up children in difficult financial circumstances.  The Minister has not addressed the key issue. Lone parents want to work but it is difficult to do so, and it is more difficult when they lose money because of the fact that they are working, as is the case with the transition payment. It is better than what was announced in the budget but it is still a problem. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister says we need an active rather than a passive social welfare system. I agree and suspect most of us do. This amendment concerns the difference between what the social welfare system can do for or to one. It is all about what it can do to one, not at all what it can do for one. That is what needs to be addressed. Other speakers have said people want the education courses, training and the jobs. One does not have to go far to find this out. One has to go as far as talking to just about anybody who has lost his or her job in the past three or four years, which is the majority of those dependent on social welfare. They want to get back into work and education and training. They want assistance. The amendment concerns punishments and so on, which is not the best incentive. In fact, it will get people's backs up, but there is also a real danger that it will end up as a box-ticking exercise. There was an element of this in what the Minister said. How many meetings did she say she had had this year with what we now call "customers", which is an interesting term? Will it end up as a statement about the number of meetings held with customers? Will it be a box-ticking exercise, after which the Minister might say, "We had 25,000 meetings with customers this year. We are doing really well in activating people. We have got so many people on this or that course"? What happened at the meetings held? What were the courses for? Where did they lead to?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Many of them are, which shows that they do not need the stick as much as they need the carrot. This is all stick and no carrot. The Minister needs to examine that issue. If she really wants to help to activate people, instead of Departments inflicting punishments on people, she could set up local employment fora and bring in people on social welfare to ask them what she could do for them to help them to get back to work and be trained. If the Department gave people what they asked for and wanted, she would go a lot further in creating jobs.
