RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is Ms Killian referring to the ELA?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank our guests for their presentation, which was very helpful and illuminating.  I look forward to studying it in greater detail.  Our guests are grappling with an issue that is quite pivotal to our future.  There remains a great deal of confusion in respect of our national debt.I wish to obtain clarification on the scale of our national debt and what comprises that debt.  On the basis of the table provided by our guests, our total national debt - which does not include ELA and other things - is €198 billion.  Interestingly, this is greater than the figure, namely, €183 billion, provided by the Government in respect of 2012.  Will our guests indicate why the figure they have provided is significantly higher than that of the Government?  The Government's figure is, of course, due to rise in the period to 2015.  According to our guests calculations, it appears that more than 60% of the national debt is bank-related in nature.  That does not surprise me in the least but it is a very telling fact.  We are soon to vote on a treaty under which we will be required to pay down that debt over a specified timeframe.  This will come at a heavy cost to both the economy and our society.  Will our guests confirm that if bank-related debt were removed, we would be well within the 60% debt-to-GDP ratio and that we would not require any austerity measure?Our guests stated that the €83 billion in Government bonds are currently being sold on the secondary markets for amounts that are considerably less than face value.  These bonds relate to debt issued up to 2010.  I am trying here to disentangle the bank-related debt from the debt Ireland had previously.  How much of the €83 billion in Government bonds to which I refer is money that was borrowed up to 2010,  but after the crash, in order to recapitalise the banks or as a response to the financial crisis?In the context of the fiscal treaty, debt levels in 2015 will, according to the Government's figures, be €206 billion.  The figures provided by our guests indicate that actual current debt levels are higher than indicated by the Government.  The figures I have from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council indicate that in 2015 the gross debt will be €206 billion and that the average interest rate on that would be approximately 5%, which will mean €10 billion in repayments in 2015.  Can the witnesses confirm that is roughly what we are talking about in terms of repayments on the national debt, or is it possibly more given that their figures seem to indicate the national debt is higher than what the Government has indicated?  Is it their understanding that the requirement in the treaty to repay one 20th of the gap in debt between the 120% debt level we will have in 2015 and the 60% debt level required in the treaty will be approximately 5% of €100 billion annually, and that in the first year, based on those figures, it will be approximately €5 billion in terms of debt repayment - €10 billion in interest and €5 billion to pay down the principal in year one?  What would the witnesses say about those calculations if they think they are wrong?I wish to ask Dr. Garvey a question on the growth issue.  If I understood him correctly, he said that the shift towards at least talk of growth in Europe is unlikely to translate into real growth given the debt overhang because the scale of the national debt will preclude public investment to any significant degree and the degree of household debt will act as a constriction on people wanting to spend.  Therefore, we are banjaxed at the level of demand and at the level of investment because of the level of debt.  Is that more or less what they are saying?  Is the logical conclusion therefore that if we do not have significant debt write-down, there is simply no way out of the current economic crisis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The question to which that is connected, which the witnesses did not address, is the point about the debt in 2015 and the interest to be paid on it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The debt is set to increase and we will have to pay interest on that.
