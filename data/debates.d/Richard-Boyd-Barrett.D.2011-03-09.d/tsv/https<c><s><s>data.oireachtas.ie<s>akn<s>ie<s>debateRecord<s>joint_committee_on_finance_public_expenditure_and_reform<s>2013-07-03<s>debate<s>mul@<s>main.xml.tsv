RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we taking all the motions together?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I find it extraordinary that there would be any effort to block a request to bring representatives of multinationals such as Google, Facebook and others, which have been accused in a number of quarters internationally-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I find it extraordinary that there has been an attempt to block a simple request to bring before the joint committee representatives of a number of multinational companies, including Google, Facebook and Apple, which have been accused in a number of quarters internationally of engaging in aggressive tax avoidance, in order that members will be able to ask them questions on the matter. It beggars belief that we could discuss global and multinational tax architecture and its relationship to this State and our role in it without asking some of the key players based in this country to come before the joint committee to express their views on the issue. This does not make sense. We are asking people who are at one remove to give us what is supposedly expert analysis of the issue, rather than questioning those who are at the centre of the issue, namely, the corporations. Nobody knows more about this issue than the multinational companies, although it remains to be seen whether they will provide honest answers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will repeat what I said. I used the words "it remains to be seen".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not a presumption.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not accuse anybody of dishonesty. I stated it remains to be seen whether they would be dishonest.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It remains to be seen whether the multinational companies would give us the inside track on their tax avoidance strategies. The companies at the centre of these allegations are based here and Ireland has been directly accused in the United States, Britain and elsewhere of facilitating aggressive tax avoidance by multinational companies. It defies belief that there does not appear to be a willingness to discuss increasing taxes on these companies when the country is beggared with taxation and austerity measures. That is bad enough but the fact that we cannot even talk about it-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. It is beyond belief that we cannot discuss the issue and bring the people at the centre of this controversy before the sub-committee to ask them some questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Vótáil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move:That the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform sub-committee on global corporate multi-taxation architecture shall as part of its terms of reference invite into the committee to give testimony and answer questions representatives of multinational corporations based here in Ireland, including representatives of Apple, Google, Facebook and other such corporations as the sub-committee may deem appropriate.The Chairman indicated we should not be forced into bringing in multinationals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was a comment in earlier discussions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chairman made reference to a crisis situation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am the only person you interrupt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are facing a crisis in this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What comment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chairman made a statement earlier relating to the issue of inviting multinationals when in a crisis situation. I cannot remember the exact wording.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I paraphrased the Chairman.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did. We can read the record and see what the Chairman said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. That is the exact comment. That was in the context of a discussion of whether we should bring in representatives of multinationals. We should be crisis-driven because our public finances are in the most severe crisis they have ever faced.That crisis faced by our public finances is precisely the reason we need to have the multinationals that have been accused internationally of engaging in aggressive tax avoidance in before this committee to answer questions about that. We owe it to the citizens of this country who are being crucified with unjust and unfair austerity measures and taxes, which they cannot afford to pay, to bring in super profitable, super wealthy multinationals against which serious allegations are being made about their failure to pay their fair share in taxation. We owe it to the people of this country to do that. I must comment on the unprecedented mobilisation of the political establishment in this country, reflected in this committee today, where Fine Gael, the Labour Party, Fianna Fáil and some Independents have banded together to protect the multinationals in this country from even being asked questions about their tax affairs. It is simply extraordinary. Can we not at least explore this? The idea that we would look into global multinational tax architecture and how it relates to this country without inviting in the key subjects of that discussion, the multinationals, to ask them questions about their tax affairs beggars belief. It makes a farce of this committee and would outrage the people of this country if they were to find out that we could not even ask them those simple questions. In recent times there has been much talk about group-think and how group-think has led us to the disastrous situation in which we are now. I have never seen a more profound example of group-think, where one is not allowed question the consensus, than what we are seeing around the issue of corporate tax and the multinationals. One cannot even ask questions, never mind change the policy. It is beyond belief.  All we are asking is that they should be part of this investigation. It is absolutely clear that the proposer of the amendment to Deputy Pearse Doherty's motion and those who are almost certainly going to vote against this motion do not want the multinationals brought in here. If Deputy Donnolly was right in saying this was always envisaged, what is the problem with my motion proposing that it would be part of the remit of the committee? That is all it states, it does not state in what order. It states that it would be part of a remit of a committee looking into multinational taxation and its relationship to this country that at some point we will ask those people in. We could do it at the end of the phase or at whatever point we consider acceptable. What those who are opposing these motions are trying to do is to prevent that happening. That is shameful. It is a conspiracy of silence. It is a cover-up of an issue of immense importance. Some estimates indicate there is €80 trillion of these profits floating around the world. If even a small fraction of that were to go back into the revenue of cash-starved states like ours, the United States, Britain, Europe, which are desperately in need of funds and finances to re-kickstart their economies, it would be helpful, but the fact is that we cannot even talk about it. We cannot ask these people questions. We are shivering with fear in the face of the multinationals, so much so that we cannot even bring them in to ask questions. It beggars believe. I intend to press the motion. Regardless of what this committee does I intend to press this issue and keep pressing it at every possible opportunity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am pressing it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move:That the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform sub-committee on global corporate multi-taxation architecture shall invite in chief executive officers and other appropriate senior executives of multinational corporations and financial institutions to give information and answer questions in public session on their company's taxation policies and procedures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have made most of my points so I will be brief. Some of us believe that we are talking about wrongdoing. However one defines it, aggressive tax avoidance by large multinationals is wrong. Whether or not it is illegal is of secondary interest to me and, I suspect, to the majority of people both here and abroad. People think it is morally wrong that corporations can make obscene profit levels and pay little or no tax, when ordinary people are screwed to the wall. That is why this is a very important issue for people. Some of us believe that addressing this issue is the key to dealing with the European and global economic crisis. Not everybody agrees with that but some of us happen to believe it. This Government has defended a lot of its actions in recent times on the basis of safeguarding, improving and rehabilitating our international reputation. Both the Government and Fianna Fáil are opposing us on this matter but our international reputation has been seriously damaged by the allegation that we are operating as a tax haven to facilitate aggressive corporate tax avoidance by these multinationals. Our reputation is being further damaged by the refusal of this committee to even bring these guys in for questioning. We are on our knees before these people. This is my last point. I wish to pass my condolences to Deputy Higgins on the death of his mother. However, if he were here I know he would say that this is an example of the dictatorship of the corporate markets. That is what it is and I do not think we should submit to that dictatorship. I know Deputy Higgins would say that if he were here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that for the select committee or the sub-committee?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I ask one question? I accept that we have now made a decision on the multinationals. Outside the issue of the multinationals, is it still open to the sub-committee to make other suggestions not related to multinationals?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Thank you for listening to me, Chairman.
