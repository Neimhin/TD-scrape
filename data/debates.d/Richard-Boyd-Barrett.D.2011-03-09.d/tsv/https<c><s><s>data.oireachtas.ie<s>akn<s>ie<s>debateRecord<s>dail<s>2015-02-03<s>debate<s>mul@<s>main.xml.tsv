RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to ask about the issue of the working poor and what is contributing to this growing phenomenon. I had one of the JJ Rhatigan workers telephone me yesterday----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am talking about low pay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are widespread allegations arising out of the JJ Rhatigan dispute about the abuse of bogus sub-contracting and the abuse of the RCT-1 system in the construction industry. The allegation that was made to me yesterday was that the net revenue from the RCT-1 system is in negative figures. We are getting less than nothing----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was based on a parliamentary question. The point is that the abuse of the sub-contracting system in the construction industry, which has been at the back of this dispute, is widespread in the industry and is contributing very substantially to driving down wages in the industry to poverty levels. Is there going to be an investigation by the Government into this abuse?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have questions on two tranches of legislation.First, given the miraculous appearance and disappearance of deadlines around water charges, a phenomenon that is now nearly akin to the moving statues, could we get some clarity from the Taoiseach as to when the new water services Bill will be published and when it will be debated? Can we get an absolute commitment that it will not be rammed through, guillotined, or decided in an overly short or contracted debate, rather that there would be adequate time for us to look at the legislation, to debate it and to scrutinise it, as it should be? Maybe he could give us some indication, because there is no clarity to my mind as to exactly what is going to be in this piece of legislation.  My second question is on the aftercare Bill, the draft heads of which were discussed last year. This Bill relates to young people who are in State care and are then released from State care and have nothing. Many of them have no supports and many find a direct route into homelessness and drug and alcohol problems, and we find them on our streets. Could the Taoiseach tell us when the aftercare Bill will come to this House?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sounds like the troika.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need to know when to organise the protest.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should just give us the heads and the date as soon as he can. We have to make up the posters.
