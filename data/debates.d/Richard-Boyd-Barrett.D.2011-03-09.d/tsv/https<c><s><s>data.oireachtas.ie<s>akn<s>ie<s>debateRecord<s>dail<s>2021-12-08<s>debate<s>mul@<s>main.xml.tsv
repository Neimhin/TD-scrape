RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Regional Group, including Deputy Naughten, for tabling this important motion on the critical subject of the development of our offshore wind energy resources. There is no doubt but that we need to develop our renewable energy resources quickly. A key part of that will be the development of our offshore wind capacity. Particularly given our huge maritime area and geographical location, we are well placed to play our part in moving away from fossil fuel energy, which we know is threatening the sustainability of life on our planet. There is an existential crisis so it is critical to address the problem. We are also aware that there is a major problem with the availability of energy generally and its cost, which we have seen ratchet up in a dramatic way. This is having a huge financial impact on those who can least afford it. There is a lot at stake, and there are many good points in this motion. The simple fact that we have to discuss the detail of this motion is terribly important. There is a lot to discuss. Often we have been quite general in our approach to these issues. This is an attempt to get serious about the discussion. It is absolutely correct to call out the danger of a developer-led approach to developing our maritime area. I will talk about that a little more later but now want to make more positive points on the motion. It can facilitate more balanced development, including balanced regional development, to benefit other parts of the country and without concentrating everything in Dublin. That is a strong point that we need to take very seriously because we have unbalanced development in this country that needs to be addressed. The issue of community gain or social benefit, as I would rather like to put it, from the development of our marine resources and our energy resources is also critically important. Well done to Deputy Naughten and the Regional Group for doing that. However, a number of questions need to be answered and I do not have all the answers in this regard. These issues need to be discussed. Having spent a good deal of time dealing with the Maritime Area Planning Bill recently, to which Deputy Whitmore alluded and also tabled many amendments, I have major concerns about the developer-led approach. We know a developer-led approach to development onshore was not good and often led to the wrong types of developments in the wrong places, was not properly regulated and, at its worse, did extreme economic damage to this country and precipitated the greatest economic crash we ever saw. In that case, it did not produce cheaper housing, which became more expensive. It did environmental damage and so on. To address onshore wind energy, what we do not need is a repetition of what happened at the Derrybrien wind farm. If we do not do proper environmental impact assessment in trying to meet the imperative of developing renewable energy, we can cut off our nose to spite our face. Coillte gave over a mountain, cut down the forest for the building of wind energy and a mountain collapsed because nobody had done the proper assessment. We are still paying heavy fines for it. There was also the recent case in Donegal and we still do not know what full cost impact that could have, either environmentally or financially.  I find it deeply concerning that Wind Energy Ireland, an association that has been mentioned a number of times today and, indeed, some of its arguments have been used, is arguing, in its documents on the development of offshore renewable resources, explicitly against a plan-led approach and explicitly for a developer-led approach. Why would it not do that given that it is a commercial corporate interest? It is interested in making money. We should not assume just because it is building wind turbines that somehow it has a more benign attitude towards the potential impact of what it does on the environment when money is the imperative. I am deeply concerned it is explicitly arguing for that approach. We must not bend to that approach. I am particularly worried, given our previous record of failing to comply with environmental directives for onshore development, that we have only just over 2% of our marine area designated for marine protection, while Germany has 45%, France has 45% and most countries in Europe have a far higher percentage designated than us, and EU directives explicitly require us to have that network of marine protected areas and to take an ecosystem approach. Let us be clear, the protection of biodiversity and addressing the biodiversity crisis cannot be the poor relation of addressing the climate crisis because the biggest carbon sink, bar none, is the marine. We cannot afford to destroy the marine supposedly in the name of addressing the climate crisis because we will sabotage our efforts to address the climate crisis and potentially do damage to the marine. That cannot be allowed to happen. Again, I do not know all the answers but we need to discuss in detail the question of the viability of further offshore floating wind - fair play to the proposers for referring to this in the motion - where potentially there can be less impact on communities but we get all the benefits and even slightly increased costs can be counteracted by the fact there is greater availability of wind further out at sea. Floating offshore wind has been developed in Scotland, Japan, Maine in the United States, Portugal and so on. I have heard officials say it will be a few years before we can do that here but I do not accept that and I want to know more about it. I do not like the fact that the major sites earmarked for development, potentially bypassing the need for protecting marine areas, the so-called relevant projects, are selected by the developers without having the proper environmental screening and marine protection that we are required to have. I commend the motion but it must be the beginning of a much more in-depth, detailed conversation about how we balance the imperative to develop our offshore renewable energy while protecting our precious marine resources.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Huge numbers of musicians, performers, entertainers and taxi drivers who, as a result of the dramatic reduction in people going out and the new measures on numbers and percentages in theatres and venues which impact on the night-time economy, are applying for the much-trumpeted restoration of the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, are receiving letters denying them it because they had signed on for jobseeker's allowance last week and because they are on the part-time self-employment scheme, the whole point of which was to allow people to earn a little and get some support. All of that ability to earn is now gone because their industry has been decimated coming into Christmas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People are taking massive hits on their income and they are being denied access to the PUP. What is the Taoiseach going to do for these groups of people who have been bit by measures the Government has taken?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why then are people being denied it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to follow up on the question Deputy Connolly asked earlier. As the Taoiseach knows, Deputy Connolly and I are very strongly in favour of the vaccination programme. We think people should get their boosters and we agree about the injunction to protect life and limb. However, there are human rights considerations for the small number of people who cannot be vaccinated for health reasons or who have not yet been persuaded, sometimes because they do not really understand the issue. I just want to draw a contrast with the North of Ireland in this regard. The North is avoiding that issue of discrimination against that small group by giving people options other than the vaccination certificate, namely, testing, in order to allow them access theatres, bars, restaurants and so on. In fact, that is the case in most of Europe. The Government should consider doing that because, even though I am absolutely a believer in the vaccination campaign, that sort of divisiveness and finger-pointing at a relatively small group is not helpful. It smacks of the mandatory approach that the WHO has warned strongly against and which I think is counterproductive. I ask the Taoiseach to consider that so we can end that sort of divisive situation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People looking to get appointments with the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, on immigration matters are unable to get any. I am inundated with complaints about this matter. I submitted parliamentary questions on it, through which I was informed that the INIS was registering 1,000 customers per week, implying that there was no problem, but I have had repeated confirmations from people that this cannot be true because when they go on, there are no appointments being released. People are going on at midnight and early in the morning but there are no appointments. There is a suspicion that companies, English language schools or others are block booking all of the appointments. I do not know whether that is true. I am simply saying that there is a concern. What is the case, however, is that people cannot get appointments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. It is a serious and widespread problem. I see that other Deputies are nodding their heads. This issue needs to be addressed. We are not getting the truth of the matter when we submit questions to the INIS and the Department of Justice. Will the Taoiseach address this matter? I do not know whether he can tell us anything now but I urge him to address it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I remain baffled as to the hesitation, reluctance and inaction that the Taoiseach is demonstrating when it comes to the issue of ventilation, air quality and air filtration. He said earlier today that he would do anything to protect life and limb, yet we know that providing minimum standards in terms of air quality and systems that can purify the air could potentially have a dramatic effect on the ability of this disease to transmit in the particular settings and particular types of buildings where it has been prevalent, such as school buildings of poor quality, nursing homes that are old and often not well ventilated, hospitals and so on. The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, supports our Bill and the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, has been saying this for a long time about the hospitals. I do not understand. It is a win-win for the Government. We could significantly reduce the impact of other measures and potentially get beyond this grim situation we are in if we took this issue seriously. The Taoiseach was talking about health and safety in workplaces. The amount of resources that would be required to do this would be a tiny fraction of the amount the Government is having to spend on income supports, yet the Taoiseach seems to be slow, reluctant, hesitant and dismissive. I do not understand it. Perhaps the Taoiseach could explain.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not just schools.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry, as I am slightly late to the debate. I support Deputy Cullinane's amendment. We are not, as Deputy Bríd Smith indicated in the Second Stage debate, supportive of this legislation. That is not in any because we are reluctant or reticent about protecting public health. We think it is critical to protect public health. From the beginning, we have been 150% in favour of promoting vaccination and it is clear that vaccination has reduced the likelihood of illness, hospitalisation and death. At this stage, we would strongly encourage people to take up the vaccine. What is frustrating is the incoherence and often arbitrary and sometimes directionless approach of the Government when it comes to dealing with the pandemic at the stage we are at now. At this point, I seriously ask the question of where the strategy is heading. Where exactly are we going with this? What is the objective of what we are doing at the moment? I seriously wonder about it and I do not think it has been properly explained. People are right to call out the fact that at the outset of the pandemic we used to have reasonably regular briefings, which we had to ask for, with the key Ministers and the public health experts to thrash out what was being proposed and the basis on which decisions were being made and we had opportunities to question those measures. That is all gone now, and we just have the Government seeking to have quite draconian powers without much accountability in terms of the decisions that are being made. I have a significant problem with that, in particular because I do not know quite where it is going. Today, the Taoiseach was quick to have little gibes at some of us about the fact that we were for zero Covid but now we are not for this. If for no other reason, I want to explain our rationale on that. Our rationale is very simple. At that stage we did not have more than 90% of the population vaccinated. We were very keenly aware-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, and the amendment is about the need to scrutinise decisions and powers that the Minister wants to give himself in this Bill. Is that okay?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does, because I am concerned about the lack of a clear rationale for some of the powers that the Minister wishes to have. I want to explain that we need a rationale for a policy and a strategy. It is not clear at this point what the rationale is because at a particular point in the evolution of this pandemic, everybody believed that there was a possibility that if we got to a certain level of vaccination – the figure that was being floated at that time was about 70% - or immunity through natural infection, that we would reach a point where the R number of Covid-19 would start to decline. Essentially, it would go below one and we could seriously consider the possibility that the disease would fizzle out. That was the belief at the time. We have now discovered that that is not the case; that even with 95% vaccination, a figure nobody ever dreamed possible, that we are not looking at the possibility of the virus disappearing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Because we do not give draconian powers to the Minister with a lack of accountability to this House unless we know where the strategy is heading.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In particular when the Government is not giving clear answers. What is consistent in our approach to this is that when we were campaigning for elimination as a strategy, prior to there being mass vaccination, the whole point was to reduce the likelihood of long protracted periods of very harsh restrictions and rolling lockdowns that went on for long periods precisely because we saw it as a mechanism to reopen society. That is what everybody wants to know, how we reopen society but do it safely in a way that we can cope with Covid-19 and protect lives and health. What I do not understand in that regard, for example, is the reluctance and unwillingness to have a serious discussion about air quality, ventilation and so on, but the Government is very quick to give itself certain quite draconian powers without a clear rationale of where it is heading. I would like to hear from the Minister where he thinks it is all heading in terms of how we are going to get back to some level of normality and how these powers are designed to achieve that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will do so clearly. I do not believe in giving wide-ranging powers to the Minister without accountability to this House unless he can give us and the wider public an evidence-based argument that is convincing about what exactly the purpose of all of this is and how it is part of an integrated strategy to cope with Covid-19. That is distinctly lacking. What we end up with then is a Government essentially looking around to point the finger at other people and particular groups and incoherent messages about where the real problem is rather than take responsibility itself for the things it could and should do in order to cope with Covid-19. That is a political exercise rather than an exercise in trying to find the best way to cope with this extremely difficult situation. That is the reason we will be opposing the Bill and why at the very least the amendment that Deputy Cullinane has put forward is a way of insisting there is some level of accountability and that the Minister does not get a blank cheque when he is not convincing people about where all this is going. In our view, he is failing spectacularly to take measures that it seems to us are a no-brainer in terms of developing our capacity to cope with this situation, whether it is air ventilation, having targets to get ICU up to the level it should be at, staffing resources for public health teams or maintaining on a permanent basis the health capacity, resources and infrastructure that we need to cope with Covid-19. On all of those fronts, we think the Government is failing, but it is quite quick to give itself power to take draconian measures that essentially point the finger at others rather than itself in terms of responsibility to do the things necessary to cope with the pandemic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a simple question for the Minister of State. Does he think that average rents in Dublin of €2,000 a month are acceptable? Does the Government think it is tenable to have average monthly rents of €2,000 or that areas such as mine have average monthly rents of €2,200? Does the Minister of State think that when the average industrial wage is about €35,000 it is tenable for the average rent in Dublin to require €24,000 or more in after-tax income to pay it? You only have to ask the question for it to be obvious that it is not tenable. However, the Government does not have a proposal to deal with it. It proposes to allow further increases to those rents. However you cut it - the Government says it is minimal or it is this or that - it is still allowing for further rent increases when rents are untenable. We need to remember every single time we discuss this matter what its human consequences are. If you are without a roof over your head and you are on average or even above average earnings, and certainly if you are on below average earnings, you are in deep trouble if you go out looking for rental accommodation. It does not matter if you are working or have a family. Every week in my constituency, I see families, where the parents are working and the kids are at school, who cannot find or pay for accommodation at current rents because the housing assistance payment, HAP, limits do not go anywhere near that level. They may not have a roof over their head for many reasons. Maybe the landlord decided they had to leave because of grounds of sale or he is bringing a member of the family in or the situation is intolerable at home because of overcrowding. For how long can people live with their mother, father, grandmother and so on? There could be separation or domestic violence. If you need somewhere to live and you simply cannot pay that money, you are, by definition, in serious trouble. These people come into my clinic, as happened this week when a man just sat down and broke down in tears because he had been given a date to leave. He was looking for places and he cannot find anywhere because it is just not affordable. What is the Government proposing to do about this? Please do not tell me that a couple of thousand cost-rental units next year will solve the problem or tell me about the amount of affordable housing. Between 60% and 70% of people, if not more, have earnings of the sort I am describing, where rents are just not payable. I do not want the Minister of State to tell me that what he proposes will see reductions in rent at any point in the near future. They will not. The market is not going to right this, so we need a radical intervention. The very least the Government can do in this situation is to say there will not be further rent increases. I will be honest and say to the rest of the Opposition, and I am not trying to score political points, that in my opinion that is not enough either because it does not do anything about the new accommodation that is going to be built. We are relying greatly on the hope that there will be a significant increase in supply - there will probably be some increase - but there is nothing at the moment to stop the new supply that comes on stream being charged at whatever rent people like. They can charge anything and nobody is making a proposal to do anything about it. The Government should at a minimum support what Deputies Nash, Ó Broin, Cian O'Callaghan and the rest of us have been calling for, that there be no further rent increases in an untenable situation. However, we will have to go further or this will go on and on. We need to set rents at affordable levels. It is done in other countries. It can be done and it should be done. It has to be done. Otherwise we are not going to solve this problem. If somebody else can give me a solution that will achieve what needs to be achieved, I am all ears. However, there is no proposal on the table from the Government that offers any solution that will bring rents to levels that are affordable to ordinary working people in the short to medium term, or indeed the long term. There is just no proposal. As we grasp that fact, this miserable situation which is imposing horrendous suffering and anxiety on people and their children week in, week out will simply continue. I am all ears but I want to know if the Minister of State thinks those rent levels are acceptable. If not, what is he going to do about it? What is his proposal? At the moment, there is none. As I said, I do not want him to tell me a couple of thousand cost-rental or affordable units will solve that. It simply will not do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Every single day that I walk into my constituency office in Dún Laoghaire, staring me straight in the face, right across the road is living proof of the failure of the Government and successive Governments to deal with the ruthless, vicious landlords to whom Deputy O'Dowd just referred, and to protect tenants from what they are allowed to do under law by successive Governments. That is the multi-unit apartment complex that I have talked about here for four years, namely, St. Helen's Court. It stares me in the face, and I meet the people in there every day. When I look at it, it ticks every box of the failures of the Government to protect tenants and to deal with these types of landlords. Successive attempts by the vulture fund owners to drive people out were based on various grounds, but they have finally legally succeeded in doing what they sought to do at the beginning of the pandemic. The pandemic emergency measures saved the tenants for a while, but they are now legally evicted since the spring of this year. They are overholding because they have nowhere to go, but they are being evicted on grounds of sale by a vulture fund. A vulture fund does not need the property for itself. There is no justification at all for this fund to put these people out. They are decent, ordinary working people, some with families, some pensioners, some with serious health issues, people who have been working all their lives and they are just out. They have nowhere to go. There used to be 20 tenants in there, now two thirds of them have gone out of fear, anxiety and stress because there were successive attempts to evict them on grounds of sale or refurbishment or in one case it was not quite decided whether it would be for sale or refurbishment, but they were going to get the person out anyway. It was a case of just any excuse to get people out so they could maximise the value of the property. Two thirds of the property is empty for the past two years and it has been allowed to just sit there when there is a massive housing crisis in the area. Families are being made homeless week in and week out. They are trying to drive the remaining tenants out, but the perfectly good units where they have succeeded in getting the tenants out have been left empty for two years. It is obscene. It is the definition of obscenity, greed and ruthlessness. I am sure this goes on in many other places across the city and the country. Time and time again I have come in here and challenged housing Ministers on what they are going to do about situations like this. What are they going to do to stop this obscenity, this gross injustice, this horrendous unjustifiable action that is being done purely for greed, for money? The answer is nothing. Nothing at all. There is nothing in this Bill that will do it for them either. I honestly do not understand it, except that the Minister thinks it is okay for these people who are driven solely by the desire to make money to do this to human beings. He allows it to happen. He makes excuses and justifies why he does nothing about it. We just keep going around in circles. The spin will continue and the pretence that we care, but nothing will be done.Once again, the Opposition has put forward amendments to try to prevent this from happening and the Government will find excuses for why it is okay to do it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 2:In page 4, lines 23 and 24, to delete “, or such other percentage as may be prescribed,”. Amendments Nos. 2 and 3 concern large-scale residential developments, LRDs. The Bill is the replacement for the strategic housing development, SHD, legislation and requires that not less than 70% of any large-scale development should be either homes or student accommodation, or homes and student accommodation. It then provides a get-out clause, which suggests it could be any other percentage that may be prescribed. We are seeking to delete that because there should not be any wriggle room in the need to provide the accommodation that is desperately needed to address the accommodation crisis, the housing crisis and the student accommodation crisis. We have many other concerns regarding the legislation's ability to address the failures of the SHD model, and we will discuss those later. In this regard, we want to make sure there is no wriggle room in the proportion of the development that has to deliver accommodation.For the floor space that is not used for housing, which may be necessary in a large-scale development, what goes into that floor space should be dictated through a proper consultation with the local community and what it feels is needed in that space that is not being provided or used for accommodation. It should not just come down to what the developer might wish to put in there, with a focus on how it can maximise its profits. If we are building large-scale housing developments, we want to make sure the services that will be provided as part of those developments will be beneficial to the community and will be what the community wants. The community should determine those things. That is the point of these two amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We could do with a replacement for the HSE as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 3:In page 4, line 25, after “development” to insert the following:“with regard to the LRD floor space not used for the purposes of housing, a public consultation shall take place with individuals and community groups which the planning authority shall have due regard to in determinations of the granting of permissions for such floor space”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have a similar amendment but we support Deputy Pringle's amendment. I am surprised they are not grouped. Deputy Pringle's is a bit more fleshed out. It relates to the earlier discussion about the non-residential space in these large-scale developments. The point about these developments is that they are large scale and they have big impacts on towns, communities and populations in a way that relatively small-scale developments do not. They need to be viewed differently because they can fundamentally alter the character of an area. They can alter the landscape of an area and significantly impact in a lasting way. To go slightly off the point, some would say that the biggest disaster that ever happened in Dún Laoghaire was Dún Laoghaire shopping centre. I actually quite liked it when I was a teenager but arguably it has become a major problem in the town's development. One can never perfectly legislate for these kinds of things but with the benefit of experience of the wrong kind of development often happening and the SHD being a particular model which has failed and done so quite spectacularly, we need to learn some lessons to try and do it better the next time around. One lesson is that with large sites, where there is potential for a big development impact, we cannot see it in terms of waiting to see what the developer hits us with. Then we are on the back foot from the word go because sites are sitting there for ages and often people do not know even who owns them. Then out of the blue - bang - there is a massive big development that is going to fundamentally impact on the people not only in the immediate vicinity but also on the entire town and that could fundamentally change the character of the area and impact on large numbers of people. We have to have a different approach to that kind of development than we do to the common or garden small or modest development. That means one gets the community in on the ground floor rather than having the community on the back foot reacting. Then there is an adversarial thing where people accuse one of always being a naysayer and serial objector. It is adversarial and confrontational from the word go. We need to change that.  I will give an example. I appreciate that the supporters of the Government are keen to say that this is a positive change and that they are bringing it back to the local authorities, that it is what we called for and it is. I accept that. Credit where it is due. However, things were not perfect around large-scale development before either. The SHD process was particularly bad but things had not been perfect before that. Therefore, returning to the pre-SHD status quo is not good enough. One can say the planners are good. Of course they are but the planners are also reacting to the proposals by private property owners who are primarily motivated by the concern to make money out of the site. Let us be honest here. These people are not primarily developing these sites in order to benefit the local community. That is not their purpose. Their purpose is to maximise the value of the site. They often have no connection whatever with the community but have come in because they see an opportunity to make money. There was a point about who knows what and whether they have good judgment and that we should not tie their hands when it comes to the site's viability. Think about some of the disastrous decisions these developers make simply on the basis of how they think they can make money. They cannot even get that right and they build stuff they cannot even make money out of. I would give the example of the Seamark Building on Merrion Road. I keep talking about this because it has been there for ten years. I pass it and it drives me absolutely ballistic every single day. This massive building built by McNamara is right beside St. Vincent's Hospital. It should be part of the hospital but it is just sitting there empty. It is an absolute disgrace. What a big mistake that was. Would the local community have ever suggested building that? They absolutely would not have suggested it.  The most recent example in my area is St. Michael's. One of the big SHDs that really broke the camel's back for many in Dún Laoghaire was a plan for a massive development on the St. Michael's Hospital carpark. First, it is shameful that the carpark of a public hospital - even if it is owned by a private religious charity but which we all pay for as it is our flipping hospital - was allowed to be sold to a developer. Then a big SHD was proposed. Everyone was going ballistic about it. It went to judicial review and then because, I think, the developers knew that the judicial review would not go well, they pulled out. Now, with this proposal, they would just put in a new application for a SHD on the site and that is allowed. This is a critical site. We in Dún Laoghaire will be dealing with another SHD, despite this legislation, on an absolutely critical site for the future development of Dún Laoghaire. This is on a historical, heritage site, overlooking the harbour, right next to the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council buildings. The people of Dún Laoghaire and the community organisations have ideas about what could be done with that site and always have had.As for what is going on some of the areas adjacent to that, in and around Eblana Avenue and so on, people have long thought we could do brilliant things for Dún Laoghaire. We have already got the abomination of Richard Barrett's Bartra co-living development going up just around the corner. It got in under the wire and is now towering above Dún Laoghaire. Potentially, the group could still get an SHD on a site around the corner.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is saying he is sort of sympathetic to the issues raised but all we are being offered in the Bill is that, once an opinion has been given following the meeting, the public will be aware of that opinion. Across the board here everybody is saying it would be better to get communities in at the ground floor on these large-scale projects. I could not understand why our amendment is different from Deputy Pringle's. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a bit further on. Maybe I am missing something. It is amendment No. 10. Deputy Pringle's is more detailed. I am not saying mine is better. I am trying to figure out the difference, what we are talking about here and what a structured pre-planning consultation with stakeholders, community groups and resident groups would look like. From my experience of listening to people talk, and the Minister is echoing it from his experience, I can offer advice if he wants to do away with the constant antagonism that exists between communities and sites where people suddenly feel as if they have been unleashed on them and they are on the back foot. It is almost a knee-jerk reaction for people to say "No" because, particularly when it concerns significant sites in their area, they have often been chatting for months or years saying it would be great to have such a thing on that site. There is local knowledge about some of these sites, what is needed in an area and what would be good or appropriate. That local knowledge would benefit the pre-planning process and plans for proper development in a community or area and avoid much of the antagonism and protracted processes, if the Minister got people who are familiar with and have a stake in that site having input from the word "Go". The Minister should support the principle of these amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are getting a right tour here.
