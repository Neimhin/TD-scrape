RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Chairman, are Mr. McCarthy's responses supposed to be the responses to our questions the last time?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked the last time about fire safety and I know it is not our primary topic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can come back to it. With regard to the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, I asked last time how the Department would deal with the fact that approximately 75% of the original Rebuilding Ireland plans to deliver social housing between now and the end of the programme are based on the scheme. I asked if this would be reviewed, given the near-certainty that this is not possible. I contend it is certainly not possible to reach that target. Is there any recognition on the Department's side that the targets envisaged for the delivery of HAP cannot be reached? It is important. The 110,000 figure was given for social housing of various sorts, including direct builds, those from approved housing bodies, the HAP, the rental accommodation scheme and so forth. The figure approximates to the number of families or households on the housing list. I presume that is why the figure was given.To deal with the housing and homelessness crisis we need a plan to eliminate the waiting list. Is the plan to eliminate the list and does the Department have a plan to do so? If the majority of what is proposed in Rebuilding Ireland is dependent on the housing assistance payment scheme, which I perceive to be the case, is there now a recognition within the Department that a substantial portion of that plan cannot be achieved? To demonstrate this, I would like to give a couple of examples.  A family of two adults and two children on a single income of €41,000 does not quality for HAP because of the thresholds, which I also asked about. The minimum rent for a three bedroom house in south Dublin, which this family would need, is €2,350 per month or €28,000 per annum. As I said, the family's net income is €41,000 per annum. They also receive €3,360 per annum in child benefit, giving them a total income of €44,360 per annum. As the family does not qualify for the housing assistance payment, after they have paid their rent they have €16,000 per annum remaining for all other expenses. Some 63% of this family's income is spent on rent and they do not qualify for housing support. For a family of one adult and one child in receipt of one parent family payment or jobseeker's transition payment, the income per annum is €11,585 plus child benefit of €1,680, giving a total of €13,265 per annum. The minimum rent for a two bedroom apartment in the Dún Laoghaire-south Dublin area, which they would need, is €1,800 per month or €21,000 per annum. The housing assistance payment for this area is €1,250 per month or €1,500 if a person or family is homeless, which equates to a maximum payment for a homeless person or family of €15,000 per annum, leaving a deficit of €6,650 per annum. It should not be forgotten that as part of the HAP scheme people have to pay 16% in rent to the local authority. The total rent payable by this family is €9,000 per annum or 68% of their income. These people cannot even access that accommodation. It is unavailable to them. What does the Department propose to do about this? Does the Department have a plan to address it? Is there a recognition within the Department that it does not have a solution to these issues and that the degree to which the housing plan is dependent on HAP needs to be radically re-examined and similarly the thresholds to allow for housing support for people whose income is a little above the thresholds? In regard to the statistics around delivery under HAP, including the 12,075 delivered in 2016 and the 15,000 it is projected will be delivered this year, how many of those are recategorisations of people on rent allowance? At first glace one would think 12,000 new social housing units were delivered last year and a further 15,000 will be delivered this year but if the majority of them, as I strongly suspect, are recategorisations of people previously in receipt of rent allowance and are therefore still in the same private rented property with the same landlord and the same insecurity, critically, because we now know that HAP does not guarantee security, then that is not social housing provision. It is not new social housing. It is not social housing at all because there is no guarantee. In regard to the 10% social mix and so on, the biggest housing developments in the Dún Laoghaire area in recent times are Honeypark and Cualanor, which are being built in two phases, one under the 20% provision and the other under the 10% provision.There are 848 units adding up to 108,000 sq. m. Are we measuring in units or in metres? Is there a real social mix here or is it a question of land? In Honeypark the Part V requirement should have added up to either 169 units or else 21,692 sq. m. under the old 20% rule. What we got in reality were 80 social and 63 affordable units with a square meterage of very considerably less than 10%.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will conclude on that particular point. What we got in the second phase was two units and 1,000 sq. m. short of the 10% rule. In neither phase were any of these units houses. They were all apartments. There were both houses and apartments in the overall development but the social allocation only got apartments, smaller apartments. Where is the social mix in that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The second phase was under the Rebuilding Ireland plan. That is taking place now, Chairman.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to know if we will be getting 10%.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are there provisions, whatever method is used to decide the level of affordability, to prevent investors, even those potentially connected with the developer, from buying up the affordable housing units and then waiting for them to gain value before flogging them at a higher price?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was not my question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is to stop investors from buying up all of the affordable housing units at whatever level the price is set?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But that is not clear.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Department needs to play a role in this. I have just read a report where a former senior executive in NAMA has gone into a fund with Hibernia Reit and another gang called MKN Property Group. They bought property in Tallaght. Supposedly some of it is for social housing. This is someone who has a conflict of interest having come from NAMA and big vulture funds coming into the affordable housing business and making money from it. What is to stop these people coming in and buying up supposedly affordable housing in Cherrywood, for example? I suggest there is nothing at all.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Unless the Department tells them they cannot sell to these people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Department is answering questions on the HAP scheme. I asked a very specific question about it. How many HAP tenancies were delivered last year? Has the Department checked this year to see how re-categorisations there have been of rent allowance recipients?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is, however, no security. We will get the Minister to answer that question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When and where?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister could make it here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I visited a large estate last Saturday - I will not name it because to do so would cause panic - in which there are 1,000 timber framed multistorey units, which are a major fire hazard. I was accompanied by two people who have expertise in this area and were of the view that these units are a fire hazard, which was brought to the attention of the authorities some time ago. There may be many more of these Celtic tiger buildings - Kevin Hollingsworth says there is - which are not all council houses wherein there are no fire breaks. What is being done to address this problem?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not trying to do that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----but I am very worried about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who would make these inspections?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was one very specific question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked if, notwithstanding the Minister's target around taking people out of hotels, in some cases hotels are better than hubs.In some cases hotels are better than hubs, in particular if the hubs are long distances from where people's children go to school. We must not let a target trump the best interests of children and families by insisting that they go to hubs when a hotel, while far from ideal, might actually be preferable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So it is okay to send children 12 km to go to school?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The mother and children are the best-placed people to tell us that rather than us telling them what to do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are travelling 10 km or 12 km.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I brought to public attention the Robin Hill apartments, which to my mind demonstrate everything that is going wrong with policy. NAMA sat on 15 empty units in this development for a number of years. The council tried to obtain those units from NAMA but it was refused them. NAMA sold the development to Cerberus, people are now being evicted and the 15 units remain vacant. Also, the purchaser is bypassing rent control legislation under the guise of refurbishment and it is exploiting other loopholes. Is the Minister aware of this situation, which has been well publicised? I previously asked the former Minister, Deputy Coveney, to look into it directly. Is anything being done to obtain these 15 units and to stop the eviction of tenants from properties that were NAMA-owned and later sold to vulture funds? Also, is the recently concluded sale of Project Gem, comprising the sale of €3 billion of assets by NAMA, in which there may be multiple Robin Hill examples, being examined? I appeal to the Minister to re-examine the Project Gem sale, and to look into the Robin Hill issue. On the social mix housing provision, the Minister's response is not satisfactory. There is an inconsistency in the Government's stated view that it supports social mix while at the same time it provides in legislation that only 10% of a private development must be social housing while on public land the public provides 66%. The public is being shafted under the guise of so-called social mix. There is no consistency in it. I do not know how the Minister can justify that inconsistency.  The site of the former Shanganagh prison was originally earmarked for 100% social housing but now 66% of it is to be given away.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not true. It was given by the Department of Justice and Equality for social housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need to stop contracting companies in to build for the councils. That is what we always did in the past.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like that, but in the absence of that what previously happened is that councils built council estates, bringing in McInerney, Collins or whoever it was to build these estates. We did not have to give away two thirds of our land to get houses built on it.
