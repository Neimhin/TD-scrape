RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to share time with Deputy Barry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the face of the worst housing and homelessness crisis in the history of the State, an absolute disaster in the public health service, a chronically under-resourced education system and a crisis in our infrastructure on a whole range of levels, this economic statement is pathetic. It does not even get close to providing the resources and the investment necessary to deal with the dire problems our society and economy are facing. In the name of economic prudence and stability, the Minister, and Fianna Fáil before him, sacrificed the people. The human and social hardship of that is well known in homelessness, poverty, deprivation, people waiting years in pain for vital operations, as well as children with special needs not being able to get assessments, a crisis that rolls on even when they have passed the legal requirement to have those assessments made. At all sorts of levels, human beings are suffering. Even in the Minister's own narrow terms of economics, the chickens are coming home to roost, however. The social pain and sacrifice that the Minister inflicted on human beings are causing even the Government a major economic problem.The Government cannot get the workers to stay in the country to employ them in the health service, even though it is trying to recruit them, because it slashed their pay and because it cannot provide an affordable roof over their heads. The Government cannot provide for the housing needs of citizens now, and there is no prospect of it being able to do so in the future with the level of investment going into housing. The chickens will come home to roost in education when the quality of our education is being degraded by a lack of investment and the high pupil-teacher ratio. There is also the wider infrastructure of public transport, broadband and renewable energy resources that could reduce the cost of energy in this country. Against this background, the famous fiscal space of €500 million is pathetic. It just does not go anywhere near what is needed. This means all those crises that are not just a social problem but an economic problem are going to get worse and the Government will be in serious trouble in a few years, as if it is not bad enough for large numbers of citizens as we speak. The Minister will respond to all this by saying it is easy to criticise, but what is the alternative, we do not have the money and this is the best we can do. We seriously need to start having an honest debate about this. The elephant in the room of the Irish economic story is that during all of those years when human beings were suffering, profits went through the roof.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is the story that is not being told. They went through the roof to astonishing levels. In 2011, gross trading profits were €73 billion. Does the Minister know what they were in 2015, according to latest figures from Revenue? They were €144 billion. Is that not extraordinary? How much tax was paid on that €144 billion in 2015? It was €6 billion on €144 billion pre-tax profit, before all of the allowances, deductions and loopholes that allow them to write down their tax liability, including managerial expenses and research and development tax credits, so they end up paying nothing. In the case of the banks, it was literally nothing. In the case of the vulture funds that gobbled up all the property the Government gave to them, it was literally nothing. They pay 5% and not 12% or 12.5% tax. What about the 1,330 individuals in this country who have more than €20 million to €50 million each, which jumped 6.4% last year? The Government will not talk about taxing them or financial transactions. What about €6 billion in debt repayments we will make this year, which add up to 14% of Government revenue? These are the elephants in the room. If the Minister tapped these resources we would have the money to deal with the social crisis and the economic crisis being faced by the State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We disagree with two of the proposals. What is the procedure for dealing with them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We disagree with the motion on Standing Order 147 and the proposal to put the motion on defence to a vote. I can explain the reasons we oppose the proposals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As for the motion on defence, I was speaking in the Chamber and could not attend the meeting of the business management committee. However, I understand a number of Deputies made clear at the meeting that the motion, which would result in the deployment of the triple lock mechanism for only the fourth time, in this case to change the status of the Naval Service's role in the Mediterranean from a humanitarian mission to deployment in search and destroy activities, is a fundamental attack on the neutral position of the Naval Service. It should not be pushed to a vote before sufficient time has been provided to debate it and the public is made fully aware of the proposal. The motion re Standing Order 147 proposes a significant change in the ability of Opposition parties to introduce Private Members' Bills. Under this proposal, such Bills may be ruled out of order on the ground that they are substantially similar to another Bill. This is completely unacceptable. What does "substantially similar" mean? This change will be used as a means of reducing the capacity of Private Members and the Opposition to introduce Bills. We do not accept the motion being rushed through the House without debate. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could I speak on the same issue?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could I speak on the same issue?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could I speak on the same issue, a Cheann Comhairle?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, I asked to come in on a similar issue to Deputy Gino Kenny. The Ceann Comhairle did not allow it but he then let several other people do exactly that on other issues.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the same issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not, actually.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not. I am making a point of order. This is the last day of the Dáil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is the last chance we will have to question what is on the Dáil schedule.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A report has been produced about Deputy Gino Kenny's medicinal cannabis Bill-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----where it has been stated that this Bill is going to be stopped even though it was passed democratically last December.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a subversion of the authority of the Dáil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The health committee has no right to decide that a Bill that was passed by this House is not going any further.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are not on that committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to respond briefly. For the record, it is not an all-party committee. The party and group that put forward this Bill is not represented on the committee. I think there has been an absolutely outrageous sabotage of this Bill for the most spurious of reasons. Medical evidence from doctors, the Irish Medical Organisation, Professor Mike Barnes, Professor David Finn and many other people who are experts in this area has been distorted and denied. Instead, the committee has relied on expert evidence from the pharmaceutical industry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will finish on this point. The procedural clarification given by the Ceann Comhairle was necessary because the message that went out from the Chairman of the committee and other members of the committee was to the effect that they had a right to stop this Bill from proceeding to Committee Stage. They do not have that right. Only the Dáil has that right. In fact, Standing Order 141 suggests that once a Bill goes past Second Stage, notwithstanding the right of the committee to scrutinise it or to refer it back to the Dáil, it will go to Committee Stage. Many other Bills, including Deputy McLoughlin's Bill, have been substantially changed on the basis of legal advice, but have still gone to Committee Stage. In this case, the Bill is being sabotaged by all the representatives on the health committee. The Deputies who put the Bill forward-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Was it unanimous?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Was it unanimous?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was sabotage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point is made, a Cheann Comhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have already brought shame on this State and shredded our tradition of military neutrality by facilitating 2 million US troops in going through Shannon Airport to conduct a disastrous war that led to more than 1 million deaths in Iraq, millions of people being displaced and the disastrous crisis we now see in Syria. Now the Government wants to compound the shame and shredding of our neutrality by trying to implicate the Naval Service in the filthy, xenophobic, racist policies of fortress Europe. These policies have led directly to 14,000 men, women, children and babies drowning in the Mediterranean Sea in the past two years. More than 30,000 have drowned over the last four years. This motion seeks to sully the heroic and brave record of the Naval Service, which has rescued some 16,000 people from the consequences of fortress Europe. The Government wants to sully that record by implicating the Naval Service in the xenophobic, racist and murderous policies of fortress Europe. That is what the Government would be doing. This motion is an extension of the filthy deals that the European Union has done with Turkey - and is negotiating with Libya and with Afghanistan - to deport, force back and keep out desperate people who are fleeing from the consequences of the actions by this Government's friends in the US, Britain and France. When they were bombing Libya they said it was about protecting civilians but in fact it was about regime change and destroying Libya. It led on to precisely the refugee disaster we currently have. Having done that and having not spoken out against it on behalf of this country, the Government now wants to take measures to collaborate with the militias in Libya to force people back into the disastrous mess that was created by western powers. This is what the Government is doing with the desperate Syrian refugees who would not be refugees were it not for the fact that Ireland and others facilitated a war in Iraq in the first place. That war led directly to the destruction of Syrian society and is producing the disastrous humanitarian consequences we now see. The Government has tried to do this at the last minute. We did not hear about this motion at the Business Committee yet it is something that strikes, fundamentally, at Ireland's neutrality. The Government has tried to push it through without any real background. This measure would move the Naval Service from doing humanitarian work to doing what is, effectively, military work and protecting filthy fortress Europe. In the last minute remaining to me, I must say how this sort of cynical policy also has consequences for other Irish military personnel. We have seen what happened in Camp Ziouani with Irish troops in the UNDOF mission over the last weeks. They came under fire from Syrian rebels. Although it was not directed at the Irish troops it seriously endangered them. On 23 September 2014 I challenged then Minister, Deputy Coveney, about pulling our troops out of that type of situation. I had said that putting our troops in behind the Israeli side of the separation zone in the Golan Heights would lead the troops into potential danger from some of the militant groups in the area. This is what then Minister for Defence, Deputy Simon Coveney said in response to me at the time:Commentators are talking about ISIL and Islamic State and US bombing in Syria. It has been made clear to me that the rebel forces and militia in the Golan Heights are not ISIL or Islamic State, but what is called the al-Nusra Front, which is an offshoot of al-Qaeda. They have different objectives and we are unlikely to see any bombing happening in that place.I pointed out at the time how extraordinary it was that al-Qaeda had suddenly become our friends, according to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, but it was unlikely we would see any bombing. Then we see in recent weeks Irish troops being forced on five different occasions to go to ground, fearing for their lives, because they are caught up in this cynical hornet's nest of Israel, Saudi Arabia and Turkey backing al-Qaeda affiliates, which are putting our troops in danger. What is the Irish Government doing? There is the cynical implication of Israel in all this, which is publicly humiliating us, by the way, while at the same time co-operating with the al-Qaeda affiliates which are putting our troops in danger. The Government is destroying what is left of our neutrality, endangering Irish personnel in Syria and the Mediterranean and tarnishing our international reputation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given that it is the second last day of term before the summer recess, People Before Profit and Solidarity will not stand in the way of legislation that might do anything to facilitate the continued provision of desperately needed housing to increase the famous supply we all know to be necessary to deal with the catastrophic - I do not think that is an exaggeration - housing and homelessness crisis in which we find ourselves. I do not think anyone of good conscience could do anything that might hamper the delivery of housing that would have any impact for families who desperately need roofs over their heads, particularly if, as I understand it, two of those developments are social housing developments, as Deputy Ó Broin has said. Having said that, there are concerns that this legislation might facilitate land hoarding and we need the Minister's absolute assurance that it will not. He should seriously take on board the amendments that have been tabled that are designed to ensure this does not happen because land hoarding is a central part of the crisis we now face and of the crisis that preceded it in 2008. We therefore need his assurances in this regard and need him to answer the questions that are put and provide justifications for refusing these amendments if that is his intention. I understand he is considering one of the amendments. Frankly, as I do not see any problem with any of them, we need an explanation as to why he will not accept amendments that are designed to safeguard against land hoarding. As an aside, I do not know how these developers who engage in land hoarding can sleep at night, given the situation we now face. It is obscene that people are deliberately manipulating and exploiting what is an enormous social crisis just so they can increase the value of their investments, property and developments while people sleep in cars and couch surf, families are split up and people rot on housing lists for a decade or more. That people perceive this dire situation as an opportunity to increase the value of their investments is shocking, but that is the immoral world of the market and of capitalism: conscience is thrown aside in the filthy pursuit of profit at all costs. Some assurance that allowing for these extensions of planning permission will not facilitate that is absolutely critical. That being said, we could not and will not do anything to block any delivery of housing that is urgently needed. However, given we are debating Second Stage of the Bill, I must say that this week we have been subject to what I think it is fair to describe as an absolute avalanche of legislation, with stuff being thrown at us left, right and centre. Some of it may be useful, as in the case of the Bill before us; one's head would be dizzy trying to figure out the content of other stuff coming before the House. We have just had a motion passed, without any serious public debate, on another issue that could have very serious implications on another area of concern to the public.I do not like this method of doing things, with an avalanche at the last minute to do some things that might be worthy and some things that might be very dubious and which people in this country might live to regret. I want to flag that fact. If we are going to engage in a type of emergency legislation at the last minute, I would like to see legislation which deals with the most urgent issues rather than some of the legislation that went through this week. This Bill is attempting to do that at some level. There is no more urgent issue than the issue of housing and homelessness. I cannot see why we should not include an amendment to Part V. The decision of the Government to reduce social and affordable housing from 20% to 10% as a condition of any development could have gone into this Bill as well. I said last week that this is critical. We can look at what the Minister has just cited in terms of what is happening over the summer. Of the 75 developments he says could be blocked if this legislation does not get through, only two of them are social housing. That tells its own story. To my mind that means that 73 of those developments, or at least a very high proportion of the 73 other developments that are not specifically social housing, will be unaffordable to the people who need housing. Surely one of the lessons of the previous crisis is that even if supply is massively increased, as happened in the years leading up to 2008 when there were 70,000 to 90,000 residential units per year being built, it does not in any way guarantee that the housing and homelessness crisis will be stemmed or the housing lists reduced or that ordinary people in this country who need a secure, affordable and permanent roof over their head will benefit. I wonder if there is any acknowledgement of that fact. Is there any recognition on the part of the Minister that the major expansion in the construction and delivery of housing that he hopes will happen does not in any sense guarantee that we will solve the housing crisis? We have the very recent experience of a massive increase and expansion in the supply of housing and that did not solve the crisis. It led to a massive economic crash, ghost estates and people taking on debts they simply could not afford, but it did nothing to deal with the housing crisis. The Deputies in this House who have been around for a few years know that the housing list continued to lengthen during the period 2005 to 2008. It did not get shorter when we had a record delivery and output of housing. The list got longer. It accelerated and got worse after 2008, to the disastrous level we are at now. It is simply not the case that if supply is increased, demand is met. These graphs, the equivalent of which can be found in leaving certificate textbooks, do not work in reality. That is not an ideological assertion but a simple statement of fact about what happened in the years between 2004 and 2008. The massive increase in supply did not meet demand. There is no reason to believe it is going to meet demand this time. In fact, there is every reason to believe it will not when one looks at what is happening with house prices and with rents. Stuff will be delivered and it will be unaffordable. If it proceeds as it did before, particularly now when the real value of wages for huge numbers of people has fallen, I foresee another credit bubble. How else can it happen? I just cannot see another outcome. The real value of wages is now less than it was in 2006, 2007 and 2008. How are people going to afford this stuff? Either they will not be able to afford it or they will have to borrow money they cannot afford, risking a repeat of what happened previously. I would like to hear some response to that. I believe there is no response to it. The only way the expanded output the Minister is hoping for will deal with the catastrophic situation we are now facing is if price is controlled. That can only be done if the State provides the housing. I hear some people say that we need an affordable scheme. We do, absolutely, but we must remember that the previous affordable scheme was a disaster. It did not work and did not deliver affordable housing. I would like to know how someone is going to do it now if it is not the local authorities deciding what is affordable. If it is in any way linked to the market and some sort of notional discount from the market, it is going to be unaffordable in all the places where the demand is most acute. I simply cannot see how it can be any other way. When I hear terms like affordable rental, a chill goes down my spine. What is affordable rental? It is something called the differential rent scheme. That is what council rents are. What is this other category of affordable rental that we think we are going to come up with? Council rents are affordable rental and are linked to ability to pay based on income. If the income goes up, the rent goes up. If it goes down, the rent goes down. The level of rent is set as a proportion of how much it is reasonable to expect someone to pay in rent given their income. That is affordable rental. Why would there be another category of affordable rental? It will be rent that is set by the developers and the market. We can debate if there should be a 5% or 10% discount on that, but it would be way in excess of what ordinary people can afford. Even if the Minister will not do what we are asking, and I hope that he will, he has to realise that we have to double, if not treble, the planned output of council housing, delivered by the councils and ideally with a State construction company marshalling the workforce with the skills to deliver it on our terms. The plans should be dictated by this House rather than the vagaries of the market or what the vulture funds feel like doing. I hope we will do that. At the very minimum we should have a higher proportion of what is being given to the developers in the case of these 700 sites or in the case of the big developments that are beginning to take place. I have mentioned Cherrywood. There are 8,000 units in that development. If we got even 30% of Cherrywood, we could pretty much solve the housing crisis in Dún Laoghaire, but 10% of it is not going to go anywhere near to dealing with it and the prices would be worse at the end of it. Will the Minister not do that? When this was being debated before, there was talk of legal advice from the Attorney General. It was suggested that 10% is okay but if we go above 10% we are in danger of infringing private property rights. I would love to hear the argument around that and how 10% is not infringing property rights but 20% or 30% is. That does not make any sense to me. The argument used against rent controls was that it could not be done, and then suddenly it became possible. If any kind of rent control is possible, it should be a more substantial rent control that brings rents to affordable levels. At a very minimum in this specific legislation, the 10% threshold could have been increased or an injunction placed on local authorities in order that they would have had to have gone for more than 10% of the private developments that are being built. The Government could have changed NAMA's mandate, although that horse has more or less bolted. In so far as the agency has any assets left, the Government could have said "NAMA is not going to sell any more property to vulture funds because we know what a disaster that has been". Does the Government even acknowledge that what happened with NAMA was a big mistake? It could cover itself by saying that when NAMA was first set up it seemed reasonable to mandate it but that, in the face of a massive housing crisis, the idea that the State should unload large amounts of properties to vulture funds that sit on them, evict people and ratchet up rents, was not the greatest and that maybe the practice could be stopped. We could have legislation that declares a housing emergency for the next three or four months and that all economic evictions will stop. The Government could say it will ensure that the position will not get worse. That could have been done in this Bill. It could have closed the loopholes that have been exposed in the Planning and Development (Housing) and Residential Tenancies Act 2016. We have discovered that it is possible to get around the 4% cap on annual rent increases in a series of ways, which is what vulture funds are doing at the expense of tenants. The Government could have adopted emergency measures such as the compulsory purchase of empty lands and properties. That matter needs to be dealt with as a matter of urgency. I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about fire regulations in view of the horror of Grenfell Tower and the possibility that we could have similar situations here. I spoke to the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Doyle, about this recently. Is the Minister engaging with the concerns flagged by people such as Noel Manning, a fire safety consultant, about the inadequacy of the fire regulations? I am not an expert but Mr. Manning has stated that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government has known for years, and has received submissions to the effect, that the existing fire regulations will not deliver on the requirement to ensure that between units there is fire resistance to the degree of 60 minutes. We saw evidence of this in the Newbridge fire. The fire spread in houses that were signed off as compliant with fire regulations showing that those regulations failed. When will we get a clear response in respect of those very worrying allegations? When will the fire regulations be amended in order to ensure we do not see a repeat of the Grenfell Towers fire? This should happen as a matter of urgency. I would have liked to see urgent legislation - this could have been done in a number of ways but it definitely could have been included in this Bill - to protect school playing fields that are being sold off by the religious congregations in order to pay off debts relating to the abuse that took place over many years. I have mentioned Clonkeen College in my area, the playing fields relating to which have been sold off, on several occasions. Approximately 80% of school playing fields that have been used for years by schools and that are owned by these religious congregations are zoned residential so, effectively, there is no planning protection against the Christian Brothers seeing these as a financial asset and flogging them off and degrading the facilities available to our schools. Those are some emergency measures I would like to have seen in addition to what is being done to deal with the urgent social crisis around housing. I would have liked issues such as fire safety and school playing fields to have been addressed also.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was close though.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The subject of his question has been covered.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have told the Minister on several occasions that the housing assistance payment, HAP, which forms approximately three quarters of the delivery of social housing that the Government is hoping to achieve between now and 2021 is a fantasy and a mirage which will not materialise. It is a nightmare for people to try to find HAP tenancies.I have asked the Minister and tabled parliamentary questions about it, but I have not received accurate answers, or any answer, about where the place finder service is located in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown to assist homeless persons and those in difficulty in seeking housing to find HAP tenancies?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is where scripted answers really are exposed. This is the same answer I received from the Minister on 27 June, in which it was stated the place finder service had been operating in the Dublin local authority areas since 2015. He went on to say they included Dún Laoghaire, but that is not true. This is a fact and it is referred to on the websites of the Dublin homeless executive and the Citizens' Information bureau, but I asked a member of my staff to ring the number. When one rings the number of the Dún Laoghaire branch and asks for the place finder service, one is asked, "What is place finder?" They do not even know what it is. We rang the homeless section directly in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and were told clearly that there was no place finder service in Dún Laoghaire. We then emailed the central service on 14 June but received no answer. I wrote to the Minister about a week ago detailing all of this information, but there has been no answer. Whoever wrote his answer is wheeling out stuff that is just not true. If that is what I get when I telephone the place finder service, what must it be like for somebody who is homeless with kids who is in and out of a hostel and is given the run-around as he or she looks for something that does not exist?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wrote to the Minister on 6 July, detailing the problem and received a response yesterday from Luach Hardiman who I presume works in the Minister's office conveying apologies for the delayed response and saying he would bring the matter to the Minister's attention. I assume he still has not done so. I have detailed how we go through all of the instructions for the place finder service which is supposed to help homeless persons find HAP accommodation, but it is not available in Dún Laoghaire. That has been confirmed by the homeless section in Dún Laoghaire which has also confirmed that it goes through the central placement services which are located in Dublin. When we rang them, we were told the Focus Ireland workers could hardly find any HAP accommodation because landlords were not interested.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is very important, if the Minister gives me two parliamentary responses to the effect that there is a place finder service operating in Dún Laoghaire, but when I ring the county council the staff have to ask what it is before the homeless section tells me there is no place finder service. People in trouble need a place finder service which we want. Will the Minister set up a dedicated place finder service in Dún Laoghaire to assist people find the HAP accommodation he believes is available?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am saying there is no place finder service in Dún Laoghaire.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are told to ring Dún Laoghaire County Council.
