RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is an exercise of the most cynical game-playing by the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Frankly, Government Deputies are smirking through their words because they know that it is cynical game-playing and politically motivated spite essentially-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----against the fact that an Opposition party put forward a no confidence motion in a Minister. It is important for people to know that Deputy Pringle, at the Business Committee, proposed an alternative that would have saved the €25,000 it will cost to move us at short notice over to the convention centre when we had decided we would be sitting here today.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not interrupt the Deputy. Notwithstanding the political differences he may have with Sinn Féin and the Opposition over the motion, a proposal was put forward by Deputy Pringle at the Business Committee to save us having to incur additional cost and the impact on staff of having to move to the convention centre today. The Government did not accept that, purely for political reasons, precisely because its Deputies wanted to be able to get up and play political games in here and point fingers at people. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was said that the argument was most vociferously conducted by Deputy Griffin in pretty much the same breath as he said we should effectively do away with the Business Committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the real agenda. The Government wants to do away with any cross-party co-operation on how we set the schedule of this Dáil-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----because it wants to steamroll whatever it wants to go through the House, regardless of the feelings of the rest of the democratically elected Opposition.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was late to the Chamber and missed the Minister of State's reply. I take it that he is saying that the CSO, for public health reasons, feels it cannot go ahead with the census. That is perfectly understandable in the current circumstances. However, the Government could use the interregnum to prepare for a census to take place a year later and ensure we use the information provided by it. The census offers an enormous wealth of information that is underutilised much of the time. It provides us with enormous detail about the changes that are happening in our society and the changing needs of our society. If we use that information properly, we can plan for the future. Unfortunately, there is often no joined-up thinking in terms of the information that is provided. The census tells us about birth rates, for example, and it should tell us about the infrastructure we need for childcare, education and housing. It should allow us to plan for those things, if we are using that information properly and linking it to our policy objectives and plans. However, that does not happen. Looking back to the 2016 census, one of the things it told us was that there were a lot more people living in households, which should have told us that we had a housing problem we needed to deal with and plan for, if we did not know that already. It told us that we needed to plan for things like childcare provision and infrastructure, of which we are desperately short. We have not used the information the census provides us with to plan properly for the needs of our society, particularly in areas like the provision of housing, decent school infrastructure and childcare infrastructure.
