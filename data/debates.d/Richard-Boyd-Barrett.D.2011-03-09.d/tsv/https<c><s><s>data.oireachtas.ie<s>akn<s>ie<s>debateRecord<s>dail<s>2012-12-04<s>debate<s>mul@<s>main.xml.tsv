RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The whole country knows the Government is sharpening the knives to inflict even more suffering on struggling families, pensioners, students and those who depend on the health services. People also know from yesterday's events that Ireland's European Union partners are completely unimpressed with the Government's slavish obedience and willingness to impose such suffering on its own citizens. They intend to give us no debt relief whatsoever. The people of this country are looking into a dark and endless night of austerity and suffering if the Taoiseach continues down this failed path. When workers, unemployed people, pensioners and community groups assemble to protest outside the Dáil tomorrow afternoon against what the Government plans to do to them-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----will the Taoiseach go out and tell them how they are supposed to pay their bills? Will he tell them which meals they should skip or that their children should skip to pay the Government's home taxes, its car tax increases, its new taxes on pensions, its cuts in child benefit and its increased registration fees? The Taoiseach has proven to be highly adept at using other people's money to pay off the loan sharks of the international financial markets. Will he go out tomorrow and tell these citizens how they can use his skills to pay off the street loan sharks from whom they are obliged to borrow money to pay for groceries and bills? Perhaps the Taoiseach might offer to swap places with one of those families who are dependent on family income supplement or social welfare----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and live on what they live on for a week. If the Taoiseach is not willing to do this, will he stop and tell the troika that we cannot take any more?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will he tell it that the poor, the pensioners, the unemployed and the working poor of this country cannot take any more? Will Taoiseach finally stand up for the citizens of this country instead of protecting the interests of bondholders and financiers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not matter what school one attended because any schoolchild could work out that if one has nothing, one cannot pay any more and 1.3 million people have €50 or less at the end of the month after paying for essentials. How will they pay €300 or €400 in home tax? How can they pay hundreds of euro extra in car tax? How will they deal with cuts in child benefit or other cuts and austerity taxes the Government plans to impose on them? Simple mathematics makes it clear this cannot be done. This is a recipe for driving hundreds of thousands of families into poverty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach states he has no choice but there is a choice. The Government should impose the taxes on those who can afford them and tell the bondholders and financiers that the ordinary citizens of this country cannot take it any more. If he intends to persist with this madness, I again ask the Taoiseach whether he at least will go out tomorrow to explain to those pensioners, workers and ordinary struggling families how they are supposed to pay their bills or live as they must for a week or two to see how he manages.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This House is the ivory tower. Will the Taoiseach go out tomorrow?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have heard this for four years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should read our pre-budget submission.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There has been zero net jobs growth.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are being exported.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If it is the Taoiseach's intention to invite President Obama, I ask him to raise two matters with the President. Given the Taoiseach's comments on corporate tax, I am disappointed that he is still continuing to hold the line and treating the issue as a sacred cow. In the context of the American Government's examination of this matter, would it not be useful to have substantial co-operation between Europe and the US on increasing the corporate tax take and breaking from the policies of tax piracy and tax competition between Europe and America and within Europe that are destabilising the global economy and robbing states, be it this one, European states or the US, of revenues that they could use for stimulus programmes and employment? This type of co-operation between Ireland and the US would be more beneficial to the citizens of both countries. I seek a specific answer on my next question. If President Obama is to be invited to the South during the G8 Summit, will the Government also invite some of the representatives of the victims of US foreign policy so that we might at least have some balance in the debate on America's role in the world? Several times, I have mentioned that the deputy speaker of the Gaza Legislative Council, Dr. Ahmad Bahar, has asked me to ask the Taoiseach whether he can visit this country to meet the Taoiseach and Irish parliamentarians.I propose that the Taoiseach invites him-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----when President Obama attends the summit. At the same time, could I ask him to invite representatives of teachers and doctors who are being persecuted by the Bahraini regime when President Obama is at the summit?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is US foreign policy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It relates to US foreign policy and it is entirely in order. I am asking the Taoiseach to ask some of those countries that have been at the wrong end of President Obama's foreign policy and who are suffering as a result of it to have an opportunity to give their side of the story during or around the time of the G8 summit while President Obama is in the country. They want to ask the President why the United States refused to endorse their observer status at the United Nations and why it refused to denounce the behaviour of the Bahraini Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could the Taoiseach not do that? That is a serious request that the Taoiseach would do so if he is inviting President Obama to the country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I mentioned two.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At 6.5%.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will there be no invitations for the Bahrainis or the Palestinians?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is, in Ireland's capacity as Presidency of the EU.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	From Bahrain and Palestine.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There can be no more opportune time than when the G8 summit is taking place in this country at the same time as Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Union, and when we might have the President of the most powerful state in the world might be visiting this country, to raise issues of global and international importance. We can agree on that. I ask the Taoiseach to raise, not necessarily at the same time and not in a confrontational way, two urgent matters of international importance in regard to the Middle East where Ireland has a particular role. We have a very strong connection to the doctors being persecuted in Bahrain because many of them were trained here and the United States has failed to say what should be said about the persecution of the democratic movement in Bahrain and the persecution of doctors trained in this country. First, I ask the Taoiseach to invite here some time next year representatives of those who are being persecuted to give their side of the story. Second, I ask him to invite a representative of the Gaza section of the Palestinian Legislative Council whose members have asked to come to this country to meet-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is part of the question on the G8.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In fairness, a Cheann Comhairle, and with due respect-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question is about the G8 summit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question is about the G8 summit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To ask the Taoiseach about his intention to invite US President Obama here given the G8 summit taking place.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Come on, a Cheann Comhairle. Deputy Adams just raised the Middle East.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It will take me 30 seconds to finish asking my question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Into what?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You did not interrupt Deputy Adams when he asked about that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I finish?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Regarding the possible visit of President Obama and the G8 summit, I ask the Taoiseach if he will invite also representatives of the legislative council in Gaza, including the health minister in Gaza who is an Irish citizen and who was trained here - the Taoiseach might not know that - to give them a chance to discuss their side of this intractable conflict.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why not just invite them?
