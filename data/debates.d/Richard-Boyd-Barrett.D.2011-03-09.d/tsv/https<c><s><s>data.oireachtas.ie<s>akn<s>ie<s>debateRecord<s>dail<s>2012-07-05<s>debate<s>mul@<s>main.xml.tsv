RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I was saying, I am sure the Minister is familiar with the plays of Seán O'Casey, in which he depicted the squalid tenements and poverty-ridden conditions of working class people at the beginning of the century.  I put it to the Minister that the Government's cuts in rent allowance and the new housing policy threaten a return to those slum tenement conditions we thought we had left behind.This week in the Visitors Gallery, I have about 30 families who are threatened with homelessness or who have been made homeless a result of the cuts in the rent allowance cap.  It would not be a problem if the Government provided council housing for the 96,000 people on the council housing list.  However, in June of last year, without making any public announcement, the Government decided to abandon the direct provision of council housing.  As a result, no council housing will be directly provided by local authorities in the future.  It is a veritable counter-revolution in social housing policy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister admit that the Government has abandoned the direct provision of council housing?  Does he accept that this decision and the cuts in rent allowance caps is a policy that is disastrously failing the 96,000 people on the housing list and represents a massive waste of taxpayers' money?  Will the Government abandon the policy and revert to the direct provision of council housing and tell the people in the Gallery and the 96,000 people on the housing list when they will get a secure council house of their own?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the Minister's response but I wish to put the following points to him.  I asked a parliamentary question this week and got a response from the Minister on how many social houses would be provided in the next year.  He said it would be approximately 4,500.  However, they are not council houses.  They are what is now called social housing.  In other words, they are either provided by voluntary housing associations or through the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, involving private landlords, all of which represent money going out of the public coffers to non-public bodies.  That seems to me a waste of money.Whether we acquire the NAMA houses or provide them directly through building the houses, the only thing that makes sense is for the State itself to provide council houses so that we save the €500 million a year in rent allowance payments and get an extra €250 million in extra tax revenue.  Even the troika could see the sense in that approach.  Why has the Government said it will not provide council housing anymore and is outsourcing it to NAMA, RAS and voluntary housing bodies?  The condition of some of the accommodation provided by the latter that I have seen in the past week is deplorable, but that is not the case with all of it.  Some voluntary housing associations are, in effect, big business and they are putting people into squalid conditions.  The State should be responsible for housing people.  Will the Government tell people on the housing list when they will be housed?  Will they have to wait ten or 11 years, which is the current situation, to get a secure council house?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has been announced that the European Stability Mechanism will recapitalise banks directly.  Will this require a change to the ESM treaty and an amendment to the European Stability Mechanism Act 2012?  If so, is that amendment likely to be brought before the House soon?
