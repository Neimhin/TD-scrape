RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of our many concerns is that the national marine planning framework, NMPF, is not fully compliant with the directives.It sets out fairly general policy objectives, some of which are laudable while others are not so laudable in the case of liquid natural gas, LNG, storage and infrastructure. However, it is not really a plan. It is not ecosystem-based and it does not guarantee that the load the sea can take in terms of development is fully considered in the round on an ecosystem basis and, therefore, there is the potential to massively overload the marine environment with inappropriate developments because it is not really specified. It is about general objectives. Our concern is that the DMAPs arising from that must ensure that the gaps we believe exist in the national marine planning framework are plugged properly. It is not even clear to us that the DMAPs must be fully compliant with the marine spatial planning directive and various EU directives. Could the Minister of State tell us where in the Bill can we find the requirement to be fully in compliance with the marine spatial planning directive and other directives specifically in terms of DMAPs? Given our concerns in this regard, this is an attempt to ensure that all the necessary study and public consultation are done and all the concerns for environmental sensitivities are fully explored and we have the necessary consultation around heritage with the Minister and consult the public fully regarding the development of any DMAP because we see the DMAPs as plugging the gap for the lack of detail in the national marine planning framework.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State accepted the last amendment in this vein. The logic is clear in our seeking to put in "coexistance" instead of "colocation". The thinking behind this proposed amendment is informed by an ecosystem approach. Can things survive together in the same area without a significant impact on ecosystems and on biodiversity? Could a particular type of development in a particular area have a negative impact on other things we seek to protect and preserve? We do not want an imperative in this Bill to colocate, for example, liquefied natural gas, LNG, terminals with a marine protected area. We have to have both. We want coexistance that guarantees the continuation of vital ecosystems, marine biology, and livelihoods that might be made in that area by particular groups. That is the logic behind the proposed amendment. The Government accepted this in a previous amendment. Maybe the Government can indicate that it is going to do so again. On the known knowns, the known unknowns and the unknown unknowns, that is vaguely humorous on one level. However, it is quite serious on another level. I am still unclear on this, but it seems that anybody, or at least quite a few people, can do a DMAP. These people might want to do a DMAP for very different reasons. I am concerned and confused about that. What is the objective of that particular DMAP? If, for example, a Department is particularly concerned about developing industrial offshore wind, that would be its objective. It would want to do a DMAP to facilitate that. However, that could have significant knock-on impacts for heritage, for protecting fishers’ livelihoods, for impacts on the local community, for marine biodiversity, and so on. The lead body would have a particular objective. In that context, arguably, it might not have a hell of a lot of interest in filling in the gaps on the known unknowns or, even more so, the unknown unknowns that are not set out in the national marine planning framework or that sort of detailed knowledge of a particular marine environment. We are trying to get an acknowledgement that those known unknowns, and even more so the unknown unknowns, are often things that are only known by people who really live and operate in the area and thus have knowledge and experience of a particular marine environment, whereas a Department that has the objective to do a particular thing may not know any of that stuff and would have gaps in its knowledge. Therefore, we want it written into legislation that before we decide that such a body is going to do the DMAP because it has a particular objective, we want to know the following. First, what is its objective, on which there would be consultation. It should not just be up to the Minister to say a body can do the DMAP. Second, we want an acknowledgement, as part of the decision-making process, of what we do not know and have to find out before we make a decision about whether a particular body is competent and whether its objectives are acceptable and appropriate for this particular marine environment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	"Significant" is a get-out clause because what is "significant"? We think that any amendment to a maritime spatial plan, MSP, or a designated maritime area plan, DMAP, should be subject to the same level of scrutiny and all the sort of requirements that the preparation of an MSP and DMAP would involve. These are the public consultations and the full compliance with all of the directives and all of the matters that we have discussed, whereas if one has a category of not-significant amendments, these could potentially allow amendments that some might think significant, but can be classed by a Minister as not being significant, and therefore get around the necessary protections and so on, that we are very keen should exist in protecting our marine environment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where is this, please?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Only to say that defining "trivial" and "insignificant"-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Have we commented on this amendment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In plain English, what is happening here?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Chair repeat what he has just said?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 115 is our amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is very hard to keep up with. The Minister of State's amendment No. 112 seeks to delete the reference to "the Minister" and substitute the words "subject to section 31". Section 31 relates to the appropriate assessment and strategic environmental assessment. Will the Minister of State explain very simply what he is doing here? The words "the Minister" are being taken out and replaced with "subject to section 31". What exactly is the change? I am just trying to get my head around it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But the Minister of State is seeking to substitute the word "Minister"-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The amendment seeks to delete "the Minister".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In page 40, line 3-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How will it read now?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, so in plain language, this is saying the Minister can only give a direction if is subject to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----all the appropriate assessments and the environmental assessment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I get it, yes. Can I just ask then-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am okay in the sense I understand it now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry, not quite.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The issuing of that direction is subject to appropriate assessment and strategic and environmental assessment. Does that involve all the necessary consultation with the public and so on and notification of the public that the Minister is making such a direction to the competent authority?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It actually is not that clear, to be honest. It says it will be subject to the habitats and birds directives and Directive 2001/42/EC. Does that include notification of and consultation with the public in terms of the issuing of the direction? Will the Minister of State clarify that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, I get it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, so for want of doubt, the section is being inserted in addition-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----to the existing section 31.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, and I see what the new section is doing. It must give explanations, essentially, to the public body that has been designated around why it is giving this direction and so on and so forth. Does it have to consult and notify the public about the intention to give a direction to the public body in this new section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Thus it is only where there is a failure to comply.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is not some new direction.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, but is there a requirement to notify people of this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To comply.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would it be reasonable to ask, in the situation where such a direction is being given, that there be public notification of that fact?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just asking.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the problems we have had in several areas is the failure to implement EU environmental directives properly and proactively. Ireland has been caught out significantly for that, with Derrybrien being the obvious example. Ireland is paying €15,000 a day in fines as a result of that. I suspect we will find ourselves in serious trouble over the Donegal landslide. There is a difference between doing our best not to breach a directive and proactively trying to implement it. Many of these directives are very proactive. They are trying to achieve positive objectives rather than just limit damage. We think the wording we have proposed is better in that it states that we wish to pursue proactively the objectives of these directives rather than just limit potential damage. Damage limitation is not the right basis on which to pursue environmental objectives.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the final point made by the Minister of State, will the notification be after the direction is made or before notifying the public that there is an intention to make a direction? That may be specified in the wording of the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In an effort to fully interrogate that, why would one not, at least, notify an intention to make a direction?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to be clear on this. In the context of the power of the Minister to issue a direction, is the only direction a Minister can give under this section a direction to comply with something he or she believes the competent authority is not complying with?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister cannot issue a direction for any reason other than compliance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should wage war against clichés, by the way. Never say "kick the can down the road" again and never ever say "best in class".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point is that it is consistent and compatible. That is a more proactive approach and the Minister of State should consider it. His point is that the rest of amendment No. 115 is unnecessary and already covered. I think that is what he is saying and we will consider his comments on that. However, the particular phraseology of "does not contravene" is definitely minimalist wording. I repeat the point made earlier that we have been guilty of a minimalist approach and we have been caught out badly on it. There has to be a proactive approach to achieving the objectives of directives. Directives are not just guarding against doing bad stuff; they are also trying to set out to achieve things that we are quite short of achieving in many areas of environmental endeavour. It is a reasonable consideration to change that wording and I ask the Minister of State to reflect on that aspect of amendment No. 115.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I come in?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is actually new. I have a new point to make.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On another of the words in our amendment No. 115.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have not. We are just discussing it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The other important word in our amendment is “objectives”, which is not in the Minister of State's amendment. It is not just “consistent” and it is not just “compatible”, which we have discussed. We say “objectives” and the Minister of State does not. The directives have objectives. That is the other point we would make.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like an understanding of how the database is going to work, in slightly more plain English, in terms of authorisations and how the database will be built up. What are we trying to achieve with the database?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Alarm bells are ringing immediately. Best in class at doing what exactly? This is a database for the authorisation of consents.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What will be contained in the database?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it just authorisations of consent that are contained in the database?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is all the relevant information around those authorisations and consents available?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does that include transparency around lobbying submissions and everything else?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For a start, I do not think that is good enough.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what I am saying. Will every input into the process be included?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That would obviously include lobbying, would it not? That is an input.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State said it would be a one-stop shop. That is two stops.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With regard to the forward planning aspect, this is only about authorisations so it is post facto. Would a database not be a place also where we build up information on matters that could be relevant to any planning application or objective for planning development protection of the marine environment, even in advance of particular consent or particular applications? This is especially the case if the Minister of State is using the phrase "one-stop-shop". Surely this is exactly it. There is nothing wrong with duplication with the lobbying Act if it is all in one place. There would be a one-stop-shop where people could go and get all of the information that might be relevant to a particular marine area and live applications, as Deputy Gould said, and not just a list of the consents that have been given.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is pretty concerning, I have to say. Perhaps the Minister of State will clarify what requirements exist under the State Property Act to notify the Minister, the Oireachtas and the public about the sale of public property, in this case marine property. Look at Coillte's record of disposing of property, one instance of which I stumbled upon in the past week with regard to selling 36 acres of forest in Enniskerry. There are many more examples and even more egregious examples of Coillte disposing of property. It seems to be able to do it without any requirement to notify anybody. The idea we are proposing a mechanism whereby MARA or any other body would be allowed to dispose of public marine property without significant scrutiny, notification to the Oireachtas and public awareness would be extremely worrying as far as I am concerned.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I may have missed it but where is the delegation to MARA limited to administrative functions? That is not how I read the amendment, which provides:The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform may, with the consent of the Minister and the MARA, delegate to the MARA, subject to the conditions (if any) specified in the delegation, any function of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform under the State Property Act 1954 to sell or otherwise dispose of any part of the maritime area that is State-owned.That does not in any way limit MARA to purely administrative powers or say that the power remains with the Minister. The amendment says the two Ministers can agree to delegate all their powers in relation to disposal of State-owned maritime property to MARA and that will not change until the Minister explicitly makes a decision to revoke that delegation of power. That is extremely worrying and unacceptable. In relation to Deputy Higgins's very good question, in what way is MARA accountable? A local authority is accountable for the disposal of assets. There are votes of elected representatives and that gives the opportunity to the public to be aware, to consult and so on. Where is that accountability here? I do not see it. We have not got an answer to the question I asked in my initial contribution. Could the Minister of State spell out the conditions that surround the decision of the Minister under the State Property Act to dispose of publicly-owned territory, land or property? From what I can see, whatever conditions exists are wholly inadequate, judging from the experience of Coillte, which seems to be able to dispose of property without anybody knowing. I found out a week ago it is selling a forest and still have not got an answer from Coillte, the Minister or anybody as to why-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is relevant. Coillte disposes of land-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is relevant to the disposal of environmental assets. I have to insist on that point. What bit of our maritime area, extending to the exclusive economic zone, EEZ, and including the foreshore and so on, is not State-owned? I would have thought it is all State-owned, unless we have privatised parts of our maritime area and seabed. I did not think we had but maybe it is already happening. What part of the maritime area, which is between seven and ten times the size of the land mass of this country, is not State-owned? Does this relate to every bit of the maritime area?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the Minister of State's acknowledgement of our concerns. However, to me, there are few things more important than clarifying this point. I would also like him to answer some of our other questions on this point, as much as he can do in this meeting. Notwithstanding his generous willingness to consider our concerns, I could not support this amendment or this section in any shape or form until our concerns are clarified. Amendment No. 123 includes the word "sell". I take the point about what the Minister can do and so on. Will the Minister of State clarify what area he is talking about in reference to this amendment? Will he explain what is referred to by "any part of the maritime area that is State-owned"?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That does not comfort me in the least.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister of State give an undertaking to do so?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there anything he can tell us today about those thresholds?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can he or his officials tell us anything about what the current thresholds are for the disposal of State property?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that. Will the Minister of State also provide clarification on what area he is talking about in amendment No. 123? Is he referring to everything?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is only out to 12 nautical miles? Is the EEZ not covered?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would be helpful to have clarify on this point. The 12 nautical miles is State-owned, is what I am hearing. Who owns the parts that are in our maritime territory beyond the foreshore, or what was the foreshore? It will not be the foreshore any more, which is another point. There will not be a foreshore after the Foreshore Act goes and the 12 nautical mile zone, or 22 km zone, is gone. What area are we talking about?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That will have no legal standing after the Foreshore Act goes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who has ownership rights?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A reasonably detailed briefing on all of this would be very helpful to the committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are not at all going around in circles.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I object to that comment, Chairman. This is about State-owned property. It is very important and we have the right to discuss it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who will not be allowed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I strongly support amendments Nos. 130 and 131. While I understand the Minister of State may not be able to, or believes he cannot, specify all the details about who might be on the board, he will understand that our major concern is that State actors have certain objectives. That is not to in any way impugn the representatives of Departments, but civil society representatives and experts need to be hardwired into this process and the establishment of a potentially powerful body, which will deal with a huge area of our marine territory. We need people who are really expert. Departmental officials may or may not be expert, but we need people we know are expert and we need some representatives of the stakeholders we know will be affected by this. We know the fishing industry is going to be affected. This is critical. I hope the Minister of State will indicate that he accepts our general proposition, or the proposition behind these amendments, and that he will consider wording in the legislation that would, without being absolutely prescriptive, give us assurances that civil society representatives, expert voices and key stakeholders will be included on the board.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Except for the fact that I am radically opposed to the use of clichés, I would say we need to be the best in the class here. In all seriousness, could the Minister of State explain why the term "if any" is used in his amendment and in the Bill in terms of the appointment of other persons for the board? For example, if the membership of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, did not include doctors and scientists, but was only guaranteed to include departmental officials, we would be a little worried about the protection of public health. This is the protection of marine health, which, by the way, is public health as well. It is the sustainability of human existence, etc. It is fairly important. On the idea that it would not be absolutely hard-wired into the board membership to have people who are expert in marine biology, I take the Chair's point. We would have to think about how you would do it, but it is a fair point that there would be somebody who has real knowledge of working on the sea, such as a fisher and not merely someone claiming to represent fishers. I refer to the appointment of persons who really have that expert knowledge and that we are certain, not if they might be there if somebody such as the Minister may decide they will be there. It is that they will be there. They are guaranteed to be there and that knowledge and expertise will be brought to bear on the composition of the board. I do not understand the Minister of State's fear of imbalance. I do not see what the fear is in that regard. I do not get it. Could the Minister of State elaborate on that point? How could it be anything other than a positive contribution to the composition of the board to have the experts from university in those key areas and experts in the EU law? An important component of Deputies Gould and Ó Broin's proposal here is that we have somebody who really knows back-to-front EU law, knows the directives back to front, and is sure that decisions being made by the board are compliant and, indeed, even better, consistent and compatible with the objectives of the directives in a proactive way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the analogy with NPHET is not perfect, I take the Minister of State's point. However, the broad thrust of what I am saying is that we would not like to think that people whose responsibility is to protect the marine environment do not have, as a matter of course, expertise in the marine environment, marine biology and EU law, including EU directives. We are in uncharted territory. We made many mistakes in respect of planning on land over the years. It has taken a long time to address this and there is still a long way to go to get it right. Let us get on the right foot with this extremely important legislation and this undertaking whose aim is to plan for, develop and protect our marine environment. The thrust of these excellent amendments is to ensure that people who really know their stuff and are to some degree independent of the Department will be included. It is not an unfair comment or a criticism of departmental officials to say they are constrained. They have certain objectives for their Departments and so on. Having people who are independent and who have expertise is critical. I do not understand why the Minister of State would object to this. He has not really commented on the use of the phrase “if any” in his amendment. In addition to departmental officials and county or city managers, there could potentially be no members with the sort of expertise or knowledge that our amendments are seeking to capture. Our proposal is fair and reasonable and I do not see the argument for imbalance or anything of that kind. This is a positive addition to the composition of the board.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would certainly have to absorb fully what is being said regarding the functions of the board and consider that. I hear what the Minister and the officials are saying, but I am not sure what I think of it, to be honest, so I reserve the right to submit amendments on Report Stage on this aspect. I was chatting informally with the officials outside and they were saying that they would dig out some material to give us comparisons regarding how other agencies might work. I would appreciate that. However, if we were to use an analogy, which I think the Minister of State used a little while ago, of the planning department in a local authority making decisions about planning applications, that is correct and the elected representatives are not involved in the process. The elected representatives, however, have the opportunity - I think monthly - to bring forward observations on any application and through that process to feed the views of the public and stakeholders into deliberations that the planning department might be having regarding granting consent for a particular development proposal. I am not saying that is a perfect analogy either. I am just pointing out that there is at least in that instance a mechanism in place for some input into and oversight of the deliberations on the granting of consent in particular cases. Perhaps the Minister of State might like to clarify this point, but as the legislation stands, it seems that consent will be granted for applications by the full-time MARA team. I would certainly have to think about that aspect and what is important in this regard when issuing consent for applications, because my gut feeling tells me that we still need to be guaranteed that we will have the sort of expertise and a degree of independence inherent in the making of those types of decisions. The Minister of State is saying that the board does not make decisions, but the team does. The question is how we can ensure that there is that degree of independence and the possibility for people to just be a bit contrarian.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They do in our local authority.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We must be ahead of the game in Dún Laoghaire.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will think about that.
