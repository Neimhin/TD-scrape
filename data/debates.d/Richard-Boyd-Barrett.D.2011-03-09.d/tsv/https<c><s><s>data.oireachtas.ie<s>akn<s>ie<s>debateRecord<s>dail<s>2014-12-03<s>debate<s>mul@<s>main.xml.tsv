RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Very often when some of us on this side of the House rail against unfair water charges, property taxes or what we believe is the Government's failure to adequately fund public services such as housing, health and education, the Minister regularly cites the phrase "there is no pot of gold" in terms of there being an alternative source of funds that could be taxed to avoid this unfairness and give us the resources we need to invest in public services. The Credit Suisse report suggests there is a large pot of gold in the hands of a tiny group of people. I would like to know if the Minister has seen the report and, if so, his views on it and whether he believes it indicates the need for a wealth tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When the Government wants to impose a property tax or force people to pay unjust water charges or the Department of Social Protection wants to means-test them, it is possible to put in place an invasive process to find out the value of people's property and so on, yet when it comes to finding out about the personal wealth of the super rich, we are told the process of compiling accurate information in that regard would be very complicated and difficult. That is not acceptable. We should find that accurate information. If the Credit Suisse report is even 50% right, it is shocking that the top 5% of people in this country hold 40% of the wealth, which amounts to just under €250 billion. Even a 0.5% tax on that amount could provide an alternative to unfair water charges, property taxes and other austerity measures. There are 88,000 millionaires, including 5,000 who have between €5 million and €10 million and 3,000 who have between €10 million and €50 million. This is extraordinary wealth, yet we are being told the imposition of a wealth tax would be too complicated a process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will explain later.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In terms of a tax on the family home and a tax on wealth - in other words, people who have multiple homes or commercial investment property and large cash reserves and other financial assets - it would not be that difficult to work out the difference between the two. The Central Bank's view is that wealth is half financial and half asset related. For 90% of the population, a significant amount of their wealth would be accounted for by their house, if they had one. On the 5% of the population who hold 40% of the wealth, it is fair to assume that the vast bulk of this wealth which amounts to €250 billion is not accounted for by their family homes. Most of it is multiple property assets that are revenue producing and financial assets, shares and so on. A distinction, in terms of a wealth tax, must be made between the family home in which people need to live and revenue producing commercial property and other assets which are generating, on average, profits of 3%, 4% or 5% per annum. Even a 1% tax on this wealth would not impact on those involved. They would still be super rich, but we would have a lot of revenue to offer alternatives to unfair water charges and property taxes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Separate them out.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Rents in Dublin have risen in the past year by 17% and by 8% and 7% in Cork and Galway, respectively. They are spiralling out of control. This is related to the concentration of wealth that I mentioned and, specifically, the increasing concentration of commercial residential property in the hands of big corporate investors. It demonstrates the folly of the big sell-off of many NAMA properties and other residential property and loans to the big corporate interests that do not give a damn if people are priced out of the market as long as they can make money.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a rapidly spiralling housing and homelessness crisis. A major proportion of the income of ordinary people is going towards keeping a roof over their head, which is adequate proof that the Government's policy in this regard has failed dramatically and that radical action is required. Construction 2020 and other pie in the sky projects will not cut it any more. People just cannot afford to put a roof over their head. This is because the process has been left to the market and the Government made a critical decision to allow NAMA and other bailed-out financial institutions with property portfolios and so on to flog them to big corporate investors who do not give a damn about affordability; they only care about how much money they can make. The State should intervene in the market; it should control rents, take back some property and charge affordable prices, instead of charging on the basis of making a profit, as the people involved in the market are doing. If we do not do this, the issue will get out of control. As the National Competitiveness Council has indicated, workers will be forced to go on strike in order to have their pay keep pace with accommodation costs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that there is a supply problem. We should immediately use €4 billion of NAMA's cash reserves to start a massive public works programme involving the construction of affordable housing. It is not that NAMA is creating this problem but that it has no interest in solving it. More to the point, the people to whom NAMA sells these assets have no interest in the problem. I am not making a moral judgment; I am simply making a statement of fact. Big corporate investors in property do not give a damn about affordability or the housing and homelessness crisis. The Minister's job is to give a damn about these things. They will charge market rents or what they can get, even if it makes property unaffordable for significant numbers of people. Those who increasingly control the private rented sector and the property sector do not give a damn about whether ordinary people on low and middle incomes can afford property. As long as they can rent stuff to the people who can afford it, they will make money. The Minister's job is to make sure housing is affordable. That is basic. The economy cannot function if substantial numbers of people in the economy cannot put a roof over their heads. That is elementary. The State has failed to intervene by taking control of rents, prices and enough property to make sure rents and prices are kept down.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who can afford to buy them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister’s budget and particularly its changes in income tax and universal social charge, USC, disproportionately favoured those on a higher income. People on €70,000 or more gained between four and six times more than people on the lowest incomes. I have probably made this point since the budget was announced. How can the Minister possibly justify and stand over this unfair budget, given the staggering levels of child poverty, homelessness and the expressions of anger shown on the streets against water charges by those who cannot pay them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	According to Social Justice Ireland, an unemployed couple got €1.51 a week or €78.52 a year back in the budget while a couple with two earners on €125,000 will receive an extra €23.57 a week or €1,255 a year. A couple on €125,000 each, very wealthy and comfortable, got 12 times more in the budget than somebody on the lowest income. How can the Minister say that is fair? One can argue on some sort of technical grounds that we have a progressive tax system. Even the Minister’s budget examples showed that somebody on very low earnings was getting back a quarter of what somebody on €70,000 or more was getting. I do not know how the Minister can say that is a fair distribution of whatever extra resources he had for tax breaks or concessions in the budget.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is Social Justice Ireland.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am saying the budget disproportionately favoured-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister should not be disingenuous. The question is very clear. Why did the Minister’s proposals for income tax and USC, as they stood when the question was tabled, disproportionately favour those on higher incomes? With what moneys the Minister had available to give back to people, why did he disproportionately favour those on higher incomes over those on the lowest incomes? It is a very straightforward question and the figures come from Social Justice Ireland to suggest that the Government decided to give 12 times more per week to a couple, both earning €125,000 a year, than it gave to a couple struggling on the poverty line. The Minister’s examples in the budget document showed that the people on the lowest earnings who are paying tax got back one quarter of what somebody on €70,000 got. I do not see how the Minister can say that is fair when the people who for the most part are out on the street or expressing their outrage about their inability to pay water charges are saying they cannot pay these bills. That is the issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The money can be allocated to social welfare.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know that some of the things I wish to say are in order and I will find out if the other things are in order when I say them. The substantive issue here is the Minister's amendment. I understand that this amendment will give power to the Minister to authorise payments from the Central Fund to pension schemes that were insolvent but predate the passing of the 2013 legislation. If I am correct, the aim is to address the problems that arose at Waterford Crystal but I did not see a copy of the Minister's speech and I did not hear all of it. If I am correct about this amendment the workers will welcome it. I spoke to some of the workers before coming into the House and I believe negotiations are going on to resolve the terrible situation in which they find themselves. It is appropriate that this should be discussed in the Dáil today because I was informed of another tragedy this morning. One of the Waterford Crystal workers died this morning. He had 40 years of service at the company but, because this matter dragged on for six years, he will never get his pension entitlement.Whatever changes are made or whatever deal is concluded in respect of Waterford Crystal will not benefit him. I was informed by the same Waterford Crystal worker that in total 20 Waterford Crystal workers have died since the closure of the plant in 2009 and, equally, none of them will benefit. Their widows are distraught after the deaths of their partners and so on. Whatever comes out, they will not benefit from it. What they got on the basis of what was left in the scheme was in the region of between 18% and 28% of what they were entitled to, far short of what they should have got. These people worked for years, contributed to the scheme and had an expectation of their pension entitlement at the end of it. However, for six years now they have got only a fraction of it and some will have got nothing because they have passed away since. That is a rather tragic and awful situation for workers who worked hard all their lives with a legitimate expectation of a decent pension at the end of it. As I understand it, this amendment tries to deal with this situation retrospectively. It relates to the primary legislation and involves what the worker I was talking to this morning described as the miserable and cynical figure of 50%. That is the limit in terms of what can be paid out. Perhaps the Minister can clarify the matter in her response because the legislation passed at the end of 2013 referred to a figure of 50%. This legislation refers to the same figure and, therefore, I assume in so far as the Minister is attempting to deal with situations that predate the legislation, the 50% figure still holds. The Waterford Crystal worker put it to me that this was cynical given the Robins case ruling, in which a 49% payout was deemed inadequate by the European courts in respect of discharging the requirements of the directive. These requirements are not specific but when the courts were asked to rule on the matter they determined that 49% was inadequate. In response, the British Government introduced a figure of 89%. By contrast, we have picked a figure 1% over the 49% which the European courts deemed inadequate. The worker I was talking to today asked why was it that our Government seems to have less respect for the people of Waterford Crystal or for that matter any defined benefit pensioners and why does it deem them worthy of less decent treatment than the treatment of pensioners across the water by their government. That was the point made to me on the telephone by a Waterford Crystal worker this morning. Perhaps the Minister can come back to me on the matter. I am passing it on from the horse's mouth. Certainly, we must deal with these issues and I am keen for clarity. I accept the bona fides of the person I was talking to who, by the way, is one of the pensioners affected. At the very least this deserves a proper discussion. The appeal he asked me to pass on to the Minister was to the effect that the Waterford Crystal workers should be treated decently in the negotiations which, I understand, are ongoing. As far as the pensioners involved are concerned 50% is not good enough. We should be considering something approximating the British figure of 89% of entitlements in respect of the support the Government should give for insolvent funds. There is another amendment I wish the Minister had included in the Bill. We will probably get a chance to discuss it later. I am keen to see an emergency measure to deal with the area of rent allowance. This is an emergency. The Minister has brought in late amendments to deal with other matters and I am keen to see similar emergency measures to deal with the crisis of rent allowance, since the associated caps are directly leading to the homelessness crisis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are discussing the amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will make the point later. I am explaining that I would have preferred to have seen other amendments to deal with the issue of rent allowance, because it is an emergency.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To date, we have not had an emergency response from the Government and we need one urgently.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was not downing Ireland.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Rents have increased by 17%
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As we discussed earlier, this Government amendment relates to defined pensions and cases of double insolvency.The Government amendment is broadly to be welcomed. It is rather technical and, therefore, the Minister of State should feel free to correct me if I am wrong. As I understand it, the amendment allows the Government to discharge moneys from the Central Fund to assist in situations that arose prior to the passage of the legislation in 2013 in which a pension fund or company became insolvent and the pensioners were left without proper pension entitlements. In particular, by allowing for this to apply in cases prior to the passing of the legislation in 2013, the Government can support or top-up insolvent pension funds in cases such as Waterford Crystal. Broadly, that is a good thing. The problem is not so much with the amendment but the whole situation, since there is a limit of 50%. This means if a pension fund does not have the assets to give people the pension entitlements they had expected, then the State will top up payments to the level of 50% of those entitlements. This is on foot of a judgment in a case taken in the United Kingdom, Robins v. Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, in which 49% was offered. The relevant European Union directive does not specify the percentage but the complainant in the case claimed 49% was inadequate and on foot of the judgment the UK Government passed legislation which meant that the figure covered would be 89%. I spoke to former workers of Waterford Crystal this morning. The deal is still in negotiation. They maintain the 89% figure in the UK is far superior to what people are being given here. I made this point to the Minister earlier. She responded that the figure was 100% up to €12,000. The Minister of State or the officials can correct me but I assume the figure is 100% up to €12,000. Let us consider the example of the worker with whom I spoke this morning. His pension expectation and entitlement was €20,000 per year. The Minister said that qualifying pensioners would also get the State pension and that this makes a major difference. She suggested that the Irish State pension was far superior to the British pension and, therefore, if we total everything it is not such a bad deal. On foot of the Minister's comments I talked to the Waterford Crystal workers again. They pointed out that the judgment or the directive stated specifically that in arriving at an acceptable top-up level state pension entitlements were not to be considered and that they were irrelevant. The Waterford Crystal workers were categoric on the matter. They maintain the directive stated that the level of the State pension was irrelevant and that the case had to be judged on its own merits. Against this background 50% is rather miserable because it is only 1% above the figure deemed unacceptable in the Robins case, as against the decision in the United Kingdom where a figure of 89% has been agreed. Let us remember these workers worked for 30 or 40 years while paying pension contributions in good faith and in the belief they would get a decent pension at the end of it. However, for the past six years they have been left high and dry not knowing what they will get but probably only a fraction of what they had hoped for. They maintain that the 50% figure is rather miserable compared with their legitimate expectations. The amendment is positive in that it maintains we can secure an agreement retrospectively. However, the 50% figure remains and the workers want the Government to be fairer and more reasonable in any deal. The decision will be taken elsewhere and I understand the negotiations are ongoing. The workers asked for that point to be made in the context of this legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have another brief point. I explained to the Minister that one of the Waterford Crystal workers died this morning. A total of 20 have died since the factory closure. The Minister said their estate or entitlements in respect of pensions would probably remain, although she was a little uncertain about it. She reckoned their widows would still be entitled to these things. I seek two points of clarification. There is nothing we can do now for the workers themselves. It is a tragedy. Even if their spouses are entitled to whatever is finally agreed, the workers did not benefit from all those years of contributions. Furthermore, I was talking to the workers over lunchtime. They sought some assurances because the matter is still a little unclear for them. I am unsure of the details and perhaps the officials know better, but they have concerns that this will be the case and that whatever package is finally agreed, there will be no difference between what the spouse gets and what the worker would have got if he were still alive to get his pension entitlement. They are hoping they will get assurances on these matters and they were somewhat concerned that this might not be the case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Before I make my contribution, on a point of order, is it a mistake that my amendment No. 5 is in the next grouping rather than this one?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am curious because amendment No. 5 is in exactly the same place.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that but I do not understand why amendment No. 5 is not in the first grouping because it is more closely connected to the first grouping.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would be great if, during the course of the debate, I could get some sort of explanation. It does not make a lot of sense. It is in the same line space and on the same issue as the first grouping. While it is not a major issue, I am a bit confused as to why that is the case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Both of the others mention poverty reduction and the impact of this budget in terms of poverty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was a little surprised earlier when, although I did not catch all she said, the Minister suggested we were not doing too badly on international comparisons when it came to poverty, or possibly poverty reduction. It would be helpful if, when she responds, the Minister repeats what she said. I was baffled by that statement because the evidence in front of our eyes, and the reports and statistics that are available to us, and that have been fairly well publicised in recent months, including since the budget, suggest we are doing extraordinarily badly in terms of the extent and level of poverty in this country. Specifically, there is very harsh criticism of this budget in terms of its failure to deal with poverty and, in some cases, its worsening of the gap between the poorest sections of our society and the better-off sections. According to Social Justice Ireland, 750,000 people are living in poverty and an extraordinary 28% of children are living in poverty, which is more than one in four. Those are shameful statistics.It is not just those who are dependent on social welfare who are affected but the working poor. A total of 16% of the adults in this country with an income below the poverty line are working. The phenomenon of the working poor is rife in our country. In respect of how the budget has played into this, Social Justice Ireland points out that the rich-poor gap has widened by €499 as a result of the recent budget. The rich-poor gap is the gap between a single unemployed person and a single person on €50,000. A person on €50,000 is not super-wealthy, in my opinion, but the gap is pretty amazing. According to Social Justice Ireland, that gap between the person on the lowest income and the person on €50,000 has widened by €499 per year. Social Justice Ireland says it is a multiple of that for higher incomes and that the gap has widened even more. That is pretty extraordinary and pretty shameful. I addressed the Minister for Finance earlier this morning on the shocking report produced by Credit Suisse about the distribution of wealth in this country. It relates directly to this series of amendments and this discussion, because the gap is truly staggering. The report, whose base statistics are confirmed by the Central Bank of Ireland quarterly reports, shows that net household wealth in this country has increased consistently since 2009, much to the surprise of many families, I suspect. The only year it went down was 2008, which was the year of the crash. It has increased consistently from 2009 until today. Net household wealth has increased by 13%. I suspect most people would be baffled by that. How the hell can we be in a situation in which people have been hammered with income and social welfare cuts and are struggling to pay their bills, and in which we have the level of poverty I have just described, while, incredibly, the Central Bank's figures show that household wealth has increased? How does one explain that? There are more poor people, but the gross amount of wealth in the country has increased. Of course, it does not take rocket science to work out what has happened. Most people have got poorer, but a small number of people have become much richer. In other words, there has been a transfer. That is what the crisis has actually been about. It has not been about a shrinking of overall wealth in Irish society. It has been about a transfer from the poor to the rich. This is what the Credit Suisse report suggests in the very strongest terms. I invite the Minister to look at a graph that can be found on Social Justice Ireland's website. It is a pie chart showing the estimated distribution of wealth in this country. It breaks it into deciles, one of which is the poorest 10%. On the graph, one cannot even see that decile, because their share of national household wealth is so small that it does not even show up on the chart. It is 0.1% of the national wealth. The national net wealth is €508 billion. That group has 0.1% of it. The bottom 40% of households in terms of income have less than 5% of that wealth between them. One then looks at those in the top 5%, who have over 40% of that wealth. The top 10% have 58.5% of that wealth. To put that into context, over 40% of that wealth equates to just under €250 billion. There has been an extraordinary concentration of wealth in the hands of the top group at the expense of the people at the bottom. That explains the extraordinary level of poverty. Against that background, one asks what the hell are we doing in social protection and what the hell are we doing in this budget to address a staggering growth in the gap between rich and poor. The poverty statistics for families, children and even working people are utterly shameful, to the extent that hundreds of thousands of people have come out on the streets begging the Government not to ask any more. They are telling it that they cannot take any more and they want fairness. The Government says it has no alternative and that it is tough and hard but these figures suggest that it is not tough or hard for a super-wealthy minority who are hoovering up the wealth literally out of the pockets of the poorest and least well-off in Irish society. The figures suggest that whatever the Government is doing in its budgets facilitates that. This goes right up to the most recent budget, which sees the gap between rich and poor growing by €499 per year, according to Social Justice Ireland. Is the Tánaiste aware of these critiques and statistics? What is the Government doing to reduce the gap between rich and poor and to give back to those who are struggling in order to bring about, if not equality - because that seems like a pipe dream when one looks at this stuff - then at least a reduction in the gap? What is it doing to give back to those who are suffering, struggling and barely keeping their heads above water, and in many cases, sinking below the poverty line?  That brings me to the final point about rent supplement and the failure of the Tánaiste and the Government to bring this into this social welfare budget. One important mechanism through which this transfer from the poor to the rich is happening is the cost of accommodation. In the past two years, rents have increased by 17% in Dublin, 8% in Cork and 7% in Galway. Rents are spiralling through the roof, but the rent supplement has been slashed and there is a refusal on the part of the Government to raise the rent caps to the levels of actual rents. If those are the levels of rent increases, the rents they are charging the people they find who can afford to pay them mean that people who own rental property are making a fortune. They are literally creaming it, so if one wants an explanation as to why we see this staggering growth in the gap between rich and poor, it is because those who own lots of property and existing wealth are using that to extract extraordinarily high levels of rent, accommodation costs and inflated property prices from those who can barely afford to put a roof over their heads. I suspect that this is one of the major conduits for the transfer from the poor to the rich. This raises the question of why the Minister for Social Protection and the social welfare budget do not take emergency measures to address that problem. It is a very serious question when one considers the levels of poverty, the crisis of homelessness and the fact that families are being driven into homelessness on a daily basis and are then unable to get out of it because of the spiralling levels of rent, the inadequate level of rent allowance and the inflexibility of community welfare officers to sanction breaches of the rent allowance cap. These are questions that are of an urgent nature, which raise the question of the morality of this budget and the entire social protection system in its failure to address these gross inequalities.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no need for jabs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Come on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is much to say on the Minister's comments, but we will have a chance to address them when discussing the next group of amendments, as it is very similar to this group. I still do not understand why all these amendments were not grouped together, but perhaps someone can enlighten me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I still do not understand why these amendments were not grouped together, as they are all very similar. The Minister has left the Chamber and the Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, has taken her place, so this is a good cop–bad cop scenario. I now expect a slightly more reasonable answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister threw around many red herrings, and that is not a serious way to conduct a debate. She suggested that we do not care about people finding employment; she cannot be serious. We all want to help people get back to work, but there is a serious argument suggesting that the poorest people in society, those depending on social welfare and the working poor, have disproportionately taken the impact of cuts and austerity in recent years and have done so again in the budget. Against this background, significant tax breaks were given to people who, frankly, are not struggling to pay the bills or a keep a roof over their heads. It is legitimate to pose questions on this, particularly when the people in question earn over €70,000, and say the measures are not reasonable. Everyone in this House wants to help people get back to work, but we have serious questions about some of the back-to-work schemes and the low-paid work they can entail. Notwithstanding the fact that there will be differences of opinion in the course of this debate, I ask that the Government be serious in response to questions that are raised by Deputies and reputable non-governmental organisations, NGOs, such as Social Justice Ireland and UNICEF. These questions relate to chronic levels of child poverty, poverty generally, poverty among the working poor and the obvious related matters of homelessness, the housing crisis and rent supplement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 5:In page 3, between lines 10 and 11, to insert the following:
“Poverty reduction report
2. The Minister shall, within two months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on the impact the measures in this Act will have on poverty reduction.”.We are going over some of the same ground, but it is an important area and I have some additional points to make in light of the Minister's responses to points made earlier on this side of the House. I appreciate the words spoken by the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, as they mean we can dispense with red herrings about who wants to get people back to work. We all want to get people back to work. Many similar points have been made on this side of the House on the issue of whether we are taking sufficient action on dealing with poverty. Did the last budget take sufficient action on dealing with poverty? We must address the chronic levels of poverty we face and the growing gap between the rich and poor. As Deputy Coppinger said, there was something implicit in the Tánaiste's response to our points. The Tánaiste implied there was a choice between, on one hand, giving people an incentive to go back to work and assisting those who earn between €30,000 and €50,000 and, on the other hand, being more generous in dealing with poverty reduction for those dependent on social welfare.That is implicit in what the Minister said. One could construe it as divide and rule, but let us suppose that is not the case. Either way, I do not accept that we should set these two things off against one another. In many cases we are referring to the same families, in which one person is working and another is not and may be dependent on social welfare. Therefore, I do not buy the distinction, nor do I believe it is an appropriate comparison. The comparison that many of us are making relates to the benefits that have emerged from the latest and most recent budget. The give-backs to people on earnings of €60,000, €70,000, €80,000, €100,000 and more have been multiples of those that have gone to people on the lowest incomes and on what we might describe as the incomes of the working poor or those on the average industrial wage. What those earning less than €36,000, which is the average industrial wage, got back right down to the people at the lowest levels of income, was either negligible or a small fraction of what went back to people on incomes of €60,000, €70,000, €80,000, €100,000 and more. In a situation where those on the lowest incomes are living in poverty, is that fair, just or legitimate? Many of us maintain it is not. It is not a question of us being disingenuous and it is important to state as much because this is set out in the Budget Statement. I will advert to the examples given by the Minister for Finance which set out the position clearly:John is single and working full time on the minimum wage. John will see a gain of €173 in his annual net income due to this Budget.Further on the document states:Laurna is single, no children and self-employed with income of €120,000 per annum. She pays a pension contribution of 5% of her gross income. She will see an annual gain of €687 due to this Budget.This is directly from the Budget Statement. Someone on €120,000 gets €687 more while someone on the minimum wage gets €173 more. How can one say it is fair when the person on €173 is in the poverty statistics? These people are the working poor. How can this possibly be justified? I refer again to Social Justice Ireland and the examples in its budget critique. Social Justice Ireland maintains that a single person who is unemployed got back 90 cent per week in this budget, but a single person on €75,000 got back €14.30. The person on €75,000 got 14 times more in his weekly pay packet or income than the person who is unemployed. The critique states that an unemployed couple got back €1.51 per week, a total of €78.52 per year, whereas a couple with two earners on €125,000 will get an extra €23.57 per week or €1,225 per year, several multiples of the increases for those on the lowest incomes. We seriously question this. The Minister asked whether we noticed the 1% extra on the universal social charge for those earning over €100,000. We did notice it. The rumour was that the 1% figure was a panic measure brought in on the Monday after 100,000 people took to the streets on the Saturday. Had that 1% not been introduced, the multiplier for those earning over €100,000 would have been through the roof. The measure curtailed the gap somewhat.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Regardless of when it came about, I am simply reading the report. Perhaps it was in the Irish Independent and so on, but that is what the report said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They attack us too. Anyway, there were reports to that effect. Even if we accept that it was a legitimate attempt to curtail the disproportionate benefits that might accrue to the people earning in excess of €100,000 per year that would have resulted from cutting the top rate of tax, it did not do enough in that regard because the people earning over €70,000 and certainly those earning over €100,000 and €125,000 still got multiples of what was given to people who are on the poverty line, the working poor and those on or under the average industrial wage. That is not fair. Arguably, it would not be fair under any circumstances but it is most certainly not fair when we know that the coterie of people between the average industrial wage and those on the poverty line cannot pay their bills at the moment. They are struggling to pay their bills. They are making cruel choices between which bills to pay, paying off debts and trying to keep a roof over their heads, although in many cases they are unable to put a roof over their heads, resulting in a disastrous housing and homelessness crisis. There are other things; it is not only about income tax. When we are considering social protection we should examine other measures in the budget, although they are often treated separately. A total of €95 million was given in corporate tax breaks. In the context of the overall arithmetic of the budget it does not seem like much, but €95 million would have meant a great deal to the people on social welfare or the working poor in terms of providing a greater give-back rather than giving more corporate tax breaks to people who already pay some of the lowest levels of tax on profits anywhere in the advanced industrial world. How do we justify that? These are serious questions that we must answer. All of this is following the changes between 2008 and 2015, when those dependent on social welfare lost 12.5% of their income and the working poor lost 11.3% of their income. I still do not fully understand the Minister's reference to statistics indicating how we are doing okay on the international poverty comparisons. I simply do not get it. I suppose the Minister is getting her figures somewhere and I imagine they are from reputable organisations, but UNICEF and Social Justice Ireland are reputable too and they are not making it up. I am keen to know how these things square up. UNICEF stated that 28% of the children in this country are living in poverty. Is UNICEF wrong? Is this true or not true? My experience and the empirical evidence - I doubt if the experience of the Minister of State is much different given his constituency with Pearse Street, Ringsend, the south inner city and so on - suggests many people are in deep trouble. The term "poverty" is no exaggeration to describe the situation that many people are in. They are unable to cope, they do not know whether they can afford a roof over their heads. All of these things are realities and the UNICEF statistics seem to bear them out. Another important point in the UNICEF report is that despite the global recession some countries have actually reduced child poverty while other countries have not. Shamefully, according to UNICEF, we are in the group that has not and I would like an explanation for that. Some 18 countries have seen a reduction in child poverty since 2008 while there were increases in child poverty in the remaining 23 countries analysed. We are among the remaining group of 23 countries. This is what UNICEF has said. Has UNICEF got it wrong? If that is what the Government maintains and if it believes the UNICEF statement is not true then I would like to hear it. The research also shows that the proportion of children up to the age of 17 years living in jobless households nearly doubled in Portugal and Spain. The corresponding figure almost tripled in Denmark, but the largest absolute increases of above 5% were in Ireland, Bulgaria, Greece and Spain. We are in the worst place in terms of the international league table when it comes to child poverty and failing to reduce it. In fact we are seeing it increase along with the number of young people living in jobless households.All of these things have deteriorated while, notwithstanding the recession, other countries have managed to insulate the poorest sections of society from the economic damage. That is presumably because they have put the costs a little bit more on those that could actually afford them. That is the conclusion I draw. I do not expect the Minister or Minister of State to comment in detail on the proposal now, but I expect them to take it seriously at least when there are reports showing a staggering concentration of wealth in the hands of a tiny group of people. I would like to hear from the Government, but in particular from the Labour Party, that this will be given serious consideration in the context of a report that shows 5% of the population have more than 40% of the wealth, or close to €250 billion. This is from the Credit Suisse global wealth report produced in April 2014. The Minister should look at this shocking report. I acknowledge that these are estimates, but they are very credible ones produced by a wealth asset management company with an interest in knowing where wealth is, how much countries have and how it is distributed in order to punt the information to wealthy investors around the world. The people who produced the global wealth report tend to try to obtain the best and most accurate information and have detailed their methodology in the foreword. The figures show that the staggering wealth inequality here is on a par with what is happening in most of the rest of the advanced industrial world. These staggering gaps in the distribution of wealth are consistent across the advanced industrial countries. It is a shame not just for Ireland but for the whole world that one can have this concentration of wealth. Anyone who is interested in equality, social protection, fairness and all that kind of stuff must take this seriously and address it and not tell us that it is too complicated to find out where the wealth is. The Department of Social Protection will really put someone through the ringer when it comes to means testing but it appears things are different when it comes to the wealthy. My final point is on rent supplement and all the rest of it. The Minister says the Government has moved from a failed position of outsourcing and privatising the provision of social and affordable housing as pursued over recent years - vigorously so by Fianna Fáil with disastrous consequences. Fianna Fáil effectively privatised the housing market and we went from a situation where in the 1950s and 1960s a very significant proportion of any housing built in any one year was built by the State. That meant there was an adequate stock of affordable subsidised housing while acting as a regulatory ballast on the overall housing market. That continued until the 1970s and was abandoned in the Thatcherite era of the 1980s with disastrous consequences. The privatisation of the housing market led to the bubble because it put all the control in the hands of developers and banks who did not give a damn about affordability, the stability of the housing market and the provision of social housing. There is no doubt that the neo-liberals in the last Government and around the world pursued that with disastrous consequences. People should be honest about this stuff. When the current Government took office in 2011, it decided to continue down the same road and produced a document in July that year which stated that the direct provision of social housing was a thing of the past. It said we would not do it any more and that stuff would be outsourced. The document was produced by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. I remember putting out a press statement at the time to say it was a disaster. The idea of HAPS was already in the pipeline in that document. While the term "HAPS" was not used, a reference was made to a move to housing support as opposed to direct housing provision as the Government said it did not have the money to build social housing any more. This has led to the claim the Minister just made when she said that her Department provides 70,000 homes. This is a ludicrous claim, but it follows from a policy set out in 2011 and still pursued through the HAP scheme which is saying that housing assistance payments and recategorising people on rent allowance is the same as providing them with a council house. That is not going to fly. The Minister of State knows that. If the Minister and Minister of State wanted to argue that they could not do anything else as the scale of the problem is too difficult, it would at least be an honest answer. I would not accept it, but it would at least be honest. To say that a housing assistance payment or rent allowance is the provision of a home is not correct, however. It is not the same. It is not secure and there is no pathway to be able to buy the house in the end. One is at the prey of a landlord who can pull out of a HAPS or RAS agreement at any time. There is a range of differences in terms of responsibility for maintenance and the demarcation lines between landlords, tenants and the local authorities. There is a whole range of problems. If this is what we are now describing as social housing, the quality of it will be lower, there will be major problems in terms of maintenance and we will be prey to landlords and market rents. It is not the same and it is not the answer and we should not pretend otherwise. It sounds good on the face of it to refer to 110,000 social housing units being provided by 2020, but 75,000 of those are referable to the reclassification of people currently on rent allowance who will stay exactly where they are in the private rented sector if landlords will sign up. Many landlords will not, which is a problem we will discover in a year or two. In relation to the other 35,000 units, we have not had a breakdown. We know it will be a mixture of public private partnership arrangements, leasing arrangements, refurbishments and some direct builds. How much and by who? Will it be the voluntary housing associations? How much will be leasing arrangements and what are these public private partnerships? How do we know they will be different from the public private partnerships that collapsed the last time? How do we know they will not be worse? There is a great deal of detail which we have not even had a chance to discuss here. There is also the issue of the rent caps. Since the Government's document was published, we have not had a debate on that, which I find a bit odd. The Taoiseach indicated that after the housing forum tomorrow there might be a discussion of the matter next week. I hope that can be confirmed and that we will find out the detail and have a chance to go through this stuff. I am not happy with it nor are many of the housing agencies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry to go on but these points must be made. The last time rent caps were reviewed, they were increased by 9%. Since then, rents have gone up by 17% in Dublin. The caps are very far behind the curve. Nobody could seriously suggest, given the gap between the 9% increase in the cap and a 17% increase in rents since, that this is not contributing directly to the homelessness and housing crisis. It self-evidently is. I do not understand why we have been fobbed off with a review when the evidence is piling up. As far as the crisis was concerned, we were repeatedly promised a review, but we did not get it. We then get the situation I have referred to with community welfare officers. While I appreciate that the Minister of State came over to me yesterday when he heard about the particular case and said "We will see what we can do", I cannot understand why there cannot be a general instruction to community welfare officers pending a review of the wider policy to sanction any payment where there is a legitimate claim that will keep someone in a house and prevent them becoming homeless. It is very easy for welfare officers to check if claims are legitimate. If someone comes in and says the only place he or she can find costs €2,000 per month while www.daft.ie shows that there are places available for €1,200, the community welfare officer can say "Come off it. Go and find somewhere for €1,200". If someone comes in and says the only available place costs €1,200, the community welfare officer only needs a computer to confirm on www.daft.ie whether that is all that is available in the area at that price. If he or she concludes that it is, he or she should just sign the cheque. That would prevent a great many people becoming homeless at Christmas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The points have been made and we do not need to go over them again. Both Deputy Ruth Coppinger and I would like to press the amendments because a marker must be put down on the issue of poverty, child poverty in particular.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The most telling thing in the service plan is the comment of Tony O'Brien, Director General of the HSE, in the executive summary to the effect that it will not be possible to put in place any additional or new service developments. That says it all. Despite fanfare about increased funding, all we have done is allow the €500 million overrun and thereafter is it €80 million or €110 million we have got? I would like to know if the €110 million figure includes the €35 million which has been earmarked for several years for mental health services. Perhaps the Minister of State could clarify that. Either way, the funding will just about deal with demographic pressures. As Tony O'Brien says, it will have no significant impact in terms of the delivery of services. There are so many questions. All of this is against a background of a budget cut from €16 billion to €13 billion over the last number of years, 10,000 staff gone and thousands of beds closed. It is not possible to see how this budget can have an impact on the crisis that has 40,000 people on waiting lists for over a year and 300,000 people on waiting lists altogether. There are also questions around medical card discretion. In the 2014 budget, €1,875,000 was allowed for but in 2015 there is only €1,722,000, which is a cut of €150,000 on what was allowed for last year. The target last year for elective procedures for children was 100%. While the service plan shows we only managed 50%, the target is back to 100% this year. It does not add up. The target for compliance with the working time directive last year was 100% but the actual outturn was only 67%. The target is nevertheless back up to 100% this year. Again, it does not add up.
