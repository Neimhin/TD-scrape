RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the heart-rending and appalling cases that shocked the nation when it featured on the "RTE Investigates" programme last Monday concerned one of my constituency cases. Sarah-Ann Mitchell, who is 11 years old, was diagnosed with scoliosis in July and still does not have an appointment. I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister on 20 December on behalf of her mother, Karen, which was batted off to the HSE on 17 January. There has been no reply. Sarah-Ann's consultant says her spinal curvature has increased by 10% to 60% since July because of the delay. She is suffering greatly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The consultant also said that part of the problem is the lack of nursing staff. Will the Minister agree to meet Karen in order that she can find out what is going on and when Sarah-Ann will receive treatment? The orthodontic clinic at Loughlinstown hospital is no longer making referrals to St. James's Hospital because the list at the latter is so long. What does the Minister propose to do about this? It is bad enough for patients to be on a long list but even worse if one cannot get on the list.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government should just accept their proposals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The points have been well made. I would like to add my voice to the suggestion that the information within the Minister's remit, the information that other Oireachtas Members may have and the contacts they may have had in regard to this matter should be part of the terms of reference of the commission of investigation. I agree that, as Deputies Daly and Wallace suggested, the cases of the other whistleblowers should also be included in the commission of investigation. I agree that the Commissioner should step aside until this investigation is concluded. The Minister's main defence against the last suggestion is that Commissioner O'Sullivan is entitled to her good name and to due process. Of course, until an investigation is concluded, there is no conviction and there is no definitive certainty on the rights and wrongs of these allegations. However, when serious allegations of this sort are made, generally speaking, it is normal practice in employment or anywhere else, pending an investigation and without prejudice, that people would step aside. This is particularly the case here because, if the Commissioner remains in situ, given we do not know the truth of these serious allegations, she potentially has a position where she could influence the evidence chain relating to the investigation itself. That is simply not acceptable if we want a proper investigation. I do not think it in any way prejudices anybody's good name. It is just sensible practice for people to step aside without prejudice to allow the investigation to be conducted. If the Commissioner is vindicated, or if the investigation into any of the other matters in regard to political or media involvement, or collusion in a possible smear campaign against Maurice McCabe, finds that none of that took place, then people will be vindicated and that will, no doubt, be made very clear and made public in the aftermath. For now, however, she should step aside. This saga has gone on and on, with Maurice McCabe and other whistleblowers being treated appallingly and every effort being made to stymie them, or at least the allegations are that this has gone on. However, when we have somebody like Superintendent David Taylor, who was close to Martin Callinan and who was operating at a very senior level subsequently with Nóirín O'Sullivan, making the sort of allegations he is making of a scurrilous smear campaign against Maurice McCabe that used the nastiest, most character-impugning allegations about him, it could not be more serious. If there is even a scintilla of truth in this, heads have to roll right along the line. It calls into question the whole culture at a senior level in the Garda, particularly because he is alleging a continuation from Callinan through to the new Commissioner. He is suggesting we are not just dealing with a couple of rotten apples but potentially with a rotten barrel, an absolutely rotten culture, at the most senior level of the Garda, which is trying to smother, defame and intimidate people who are trying to blow the whistle in the public interest about wrongdoing within the Garda. The Minister needs to take on board what was said today, broaden the terms of reference and insist that Commissioner O'Sullivan steps aside until we get to the truth of these incredibly serious allegations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister was talking about creating jobs in the previous question. This question is about keeping jobs. We discussed this last week, both the future for Ardmore Studies and the jobs, hundreds directly and thousands indirect, that are dependent on the studio. I seek an update as to what the Minister has done and what she knows about the efforts to secure the future of Ardmore Studios as a working film studio and to maintain the jobs and its critical importance in the Irish film industry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister for her response. To take up the last point, will she give us a commitment that not only will she consult the Cabinet but she will also consult the Dáil on any decision about the disposal of Ardmore? While I welcome the fact the Minister is talking about it as a going concern, and I obviously welcome the commitment of the county council to retain the zoning, which would mean it cannot, for example, be sold off for housing, if we do not definitively secure its future as an operating film studio, zoning can change further down the line. That, in itself, does not secure its long-term future. While I take the point that Enterprise Ireland is not in the business of running film studios, the State has to make a clear commitment that it is going to maintain the studio. There needs to be joined-up thinking between Creative Ireland and the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs in terms of understanding that the Government has to guarantee its future. If necessary, if we cannot get a buyer, we should think about the workers buy-out proposal or the State buying over the rest of the shareholding.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not doubt for one second that the Minister and just about everybody else who is concerned with this wants to retain the studio as a going concern, so I am not questioning that. What I am saying is that while the retention of the film-only zoning is very much to be welcomed, in itself it does not guarantee that somebody will come in and buy it, and keep it as an operating studio. I would like to have further confirmation that, if some outside buyer does not come in with a guarantee to retain it as a working studio, the State will commit to do whatever is necessary to retain it as a working studio. I hope somebody comes in, and I know the workers also hope that, because the problem is then solved. However, if that does not happen, we could have a problem. We need to have a plan B, which means looking at options like the possibility of supporting a workers buy-out or, if necessary, the Government buying the rest of the share and having the studio retained and supported under public ownership.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about a workers buy-out?
