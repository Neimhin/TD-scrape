RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we clarify which questions are grouped?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it Questions Nos. 31, 32 and 50?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Question No. 50 is in the grouping.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister please get real? Donald Trump's decision to recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel was not a mistake; it was a calculated declaration of war against the Palestinian people, the Arab world and the Muslim population. If the Minister does not see that, then he is living in cloud cuckoo land. Netanyahu is celebrating. He claims that the European Union will eventually accept this and move EU embassies to Jerusalem. Is the Minister seriously suggesting that the Israeli Government is genuine? I say as much given what it has done since the Oslo Accords to accelerate illegal settlements, carve up Jerusalem and ethnically cleanse thousands of Palestinians from east Jerusalem. It has carved up Hebron, literally sliced Hebron in two, to the point that there are now 600,000 settlers in the West Bank. That is double the number at the time of the Oslo Accords. Does the Minister honestly believe Israel has the slightest interest in peace? Now, the United States has made absolutely clear that it has no interest in peace either. I have never believed in the two-state solution because it legitimises ethnic cleansing. Whether the Minister believes in the two-state solution, it is now dead because Israel has systematically flouted the Oslo Accords and UN international law. Faced with these facts, at what point will the Minister say that sanctions become justified?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister think there should be any sanction for the systematic breaking of international law? The Minister believes sanctions are justified against Syria. Does the Minister believe that at any point sanctions should be imposed against Israel for what it is doing? Does the Minister believe anything other than words of concern should be expressed about the fact that the United States has now legitimised the breaking of international law? Does the Minister believe it was legitimate to dismantle the apartheid state in South Africa using sanctions and boycott? Will the Minister explain the difference? What is the difference between the systematic flouting of international law and the ethnic cleansing being conducted by the Israeli State on the one hand and what apartheid South Africa did on the other? Can they Minister explain the difference? I cannot see the difference, except for the fact that Israel has done it more thoroughly. Does the Minister oppose ethnic cleansing? That is what is being done in east Jerusalem – there is no other word for it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what happened in South Africa. We got at result in South Africa.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Viktor Orbán does not share it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last week during Leaders' Questions and on other occasions in this House, I vociferously protested the Government's cynical decision to sign us up to the PESCO European defence pact and the manner in which the Government did so, namely, by withholding that it planned to do this from the Business Committee for several weeks. It was a calculated effort to prevent public debate on the matter. There are many reasons to oppose our involvement in EU militarisation but I will raise one of them today. In the past week, Amnesty International has condemned the complicity of European governments in what it describes as the horrific abuse of refugees and migrants and how the EU naval operation in the Mediterranean is colluding with the ministry of the interior, the Libyan coastguard, and the Libyan directorate for combatting illegal migration in "torture and abuse of tens of thousands of refugees and migrants detained by [the] Libyan immigration authorities in appalling conditions in Libya." It goes on to say that European governments are "actively supporting a sophisticated system of abuse and exploitation of refugees and migrants by the Libyan Coast Guard, detention authorities and smugglers in order to prevent people from crossing the Mediterranean". It refers to overcrowded detention centres where refugees and migrants are subject to systematic abuse. It contends, and I agree, that European governments have not only been aware of these abuses but in actively supporting the Libyan authorities in stopping sea crossings and containing people in Libya, they are complicit in these abuses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the Government going to do about this? It is a damning indictment of what European governments are doing to thousands of people in Libya.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we get to the next question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we get to the next group?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked my question earlier, but the Taoiseach ran out of time. In light of Amnesty International's damning report which explicitly states that European governments are colluding with slavery, torture, systematic abuse and physical and sexual violence against 20,000 Libyan immigrants, will the Taoiseach look into this matter? Does he think he might visit Libya and see the horrific detention centres and the treatment of the desperate people who are being enslaved and abused on an ongoing and systematic basis? Donald Trump has now explicitly endorsed something that flouts international law. Is there any crime he can commit against international law that will finally provoke the Taoiseach to move beyond stating that our friendship with the United States goes beyond any single US President? Mr. Trump has flouted international law and declared war on the people of Palestine, inflaming conflict across the Middle East. Will the Taoiseach express anything more than concern about Mr. Trump's behaviour?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no concern for the Libyans. I asked twice and there is nothing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no comment on the horrific treatment. It is unbelievable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, see you, Taoiseach. The moral indifference and double standards of European leaders is really stunning to behold. For the last number of weeks we have rightly heard the Government and other parties in this House speak about the need for no Border, North or South, and yet the border that Europe imposes, which has resulted in 35,000 people drowning in the Mediterranean over the last five years, is a matter of complete indifference. I have asked the Taoiseach three times today to comment on what is happening in Libya. He has not uttered a word of response. In the last week, Amnesty International has produced a report making the most damning allegations against all European governments and the European Union. I will repeat for the record: "European governments complicit in horrific abuse of refugees and migrants". It goes on to say:Tens of thousands are being kept indefinitely in overcrowded detention centres where they are subjected to systematic abuse... European Governments have not just been fully aware of these abuses but are actively supporting the Libyan authorities in stopping sea crossings and detaining people in Libya. They are complicit in these abuses. European governments are actively supporting a sophisticated system of abuse and exploitation of refugees and migrants by the Libyan coastguard, detention authorities and smugglers in order to prevent people from crossing the Mediterranean.These people are experiencing slavery, physical and sexual abuse, extortion for money and horrific conditions of detention. There are now 20,000 people living in these conditions. There has not been a word from the Taoiseach on this issue and he did not mention in his speech that this would be brought up at the European Council. He refused to answer questions on the matter twice this morning and then, probably because he knew we would raise the matter again, he walked out before the issue was raised. The moral bankruptcy of our Government and the European Union is absolutely stunning. We also asked if there would be any move from our Government or the European Union beyond expressing concern and hand-wringing over what Donald Trump has done in the last week in declaring war on the people of Palestine and the entire Middle East. He has now legitimised the illegal annexation of East Jerusalem, in defiance of international law, by Israel. It has put two fingers up to the peace process and the two-state solution, which Europe claims it supports. Israel clearly has no interest in that solution. Since 1993 the number of illegal settlers, in defiance of international law, on Palestinian territory has doubled to 600,000. A 440 km wall separates Palestinians from their own land and from Jerusalem. There are 167 different enclaves where the Israelis are slicing up Jerusalem, Hebron and other Palestinian territories in cities in order to occupy the area further in defiance in international law. Nothing has been done. Does anybody believe that the apartheid state of South Africa had a right to continue in existence? We all accept it had to end. The crimes that Israel is committing, which are now endorsed by the United States against the people of Palestine, are every bit as brutal, and in fact have been going on a lot longer than what happened in South Africa. There have been no sanctions and no action. There are expressions of concern. When is the European Union and our Government going to find the moral compass and demand action rather than words and crocodile tears about the abuses of Palestinians or Libyans?
