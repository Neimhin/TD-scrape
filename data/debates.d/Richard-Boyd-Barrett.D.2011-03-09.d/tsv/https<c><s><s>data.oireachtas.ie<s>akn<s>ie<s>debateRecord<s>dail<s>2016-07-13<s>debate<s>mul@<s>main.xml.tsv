RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government's stated position on people in mortgage and housing difficulties is to keep them in their homes. The previous Government phased out mortgage interest supplement for new applicants as of the beginning of 2014. Everybody who receives the supplement will be removed from the scheme as of 1 January 2018, while those in receipt of mortgage interest relief will no longer receive it as of 1 January 2017. The Government has made a commitment to replace these schemes with what it describes as sustainable solutions. When will we see the sustainable solutions the Government has promised aimed at keeping in their homes people who previously received some assistance through these schemes? I am dealing with people who are in trouble. They took the Minister's advice and contacted their lenders and some have done deals, but they continue to find themselves in extreme financial difficulty because mortgage interest supplement or relief is not available to them. When will the promised sustainable solutions to replace these schemes be introduced and what action will be taken in the interim for those who find themselves in difficulties and are no longer able to avail of the schemes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the worrying rise of political forces in Britain who have traded on anti-immigrant sentiment which is dangerous and, frankly, racist, will the Taoiseach join me in wishing Mr. Jeremy Corbyn the best of luck in the Labour Party leadership battle? A victory for him is the best hope some politics might emerge in Britain that will move in a more progressive direction, particularly in view of his unconditional support for the rights of migrants and immigrants in Britain. He is thoroughly anti-racist and in the aftermath of the Chilcot report, anti-war, unlike the discredited Blairite rump that is now trying to stab him in the back. Perhaps the Taoiseach might respond to that brief question. My main question relates to the European Union and the debate and controversy into which it has been thrown, particularly in the light of Brexit. When there have been questions raised and criticisms made of the European Union, it has presented itself as the benign and progressive force in European politics. Does the Taoiseach think there is a supreme irony and hypocrisy in the fact that it is the European Union which claims it supports the free movement of people which might be the obstacle in the way of the free movement of people between Britain and Ireland? It demonstrates that the European Union's commitment to the free movement of people and internationalism stops at the borders of Europe, at frontier Europe, even in so far as it may affect us and our relationship with our nearest neighbour, Britain. Does the Taoiseach agree that he must be steadfast in pointing out to the European Union that if it claims to be committed to the free movement of people, that free movement should extend beyond the borders of fortress Europe, be it between Britain and Ireland or to poor Syrian refugees who are trying to get into the European Union? Did the Taoiseach raise at the European Council the recommendations made by the Committee on Housing and Homelessness? The committee urged the Government to urgently seek flexibility from the European Commission in the application of EU fiscal rules to the financing of social housing. That is what the all-party committee established by the DÃ¡il to deal with the social housing emergency asked the Government to raise with the European Union. Will the Union give us flexibility under these crazy fiscal rules that are preventing us from spending even our own money to provide the social housing we urgently need? Did the Taoiseach raise that issue? Will he insist on us being given such flexibility or will he only insist on what I heard the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, say, that Ireland might leave the European Union if it dares to do anything about corporation tax? That appears to be a red line issue for the Government. Is it a red line issue for the Taoiseach to go to the European Council to demand flexibility under EU fiscal rules to deal with the biggest crisis facing the country in order that we can make the investment required in the provision of urgently needed council housing?
