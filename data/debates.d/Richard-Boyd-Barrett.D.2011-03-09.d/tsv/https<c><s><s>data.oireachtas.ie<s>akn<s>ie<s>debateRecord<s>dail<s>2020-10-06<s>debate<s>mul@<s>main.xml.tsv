RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Tánaiste launched a really cynical, politically motivated attack on the public health team in order to cover over the Government's failure to use the summer period to resource our ICUs to the level we need, our hospitals generally and a tracing regime that would allow us to chase the virus, rather than be chased by it, as is currently happening. Regardless of the cynicism of the Tánaiste's attack, if infection rates continue even at their current level or if, as predicted by the modellers at NPHET, they get worse, the economic, human and social damage will be even worse. If the Government is to deal with that situation and take the measures that will be necessary one way or another to protect public health, it will need to protect the incomes of working people. The taxi drivers in their thousands will be on a socially distanced drive protest this Friday because along with other groups they have seen the Government slash their pandemic unemployment payments, forcing them back to work when there is no work. The same is true for those who work in events, the arts and music, along with bar workers and hotel workers. Effectively, from a financial point of view, the Government has stabbed them in the back at the time when they need support. It has lifted the eviction moratorium and the mortgage repayment moratorium that would have allowed them to survive this period. It has failed to give them supports and has reduced their supports. Tomorrow, we will debate a motion calling for the restoration of those payments. Will the Government do that? Irrespective of our dispute with the Government about restriction levels and so on, if it wants public compliance, it cannot do anything other than restore the income supports for people who have lost their jobs as a result of this pandemic. Will the Government do it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Taoiseach wants an effective campaign of public information in the situation we are in, he should not have a control freak attitude, which is fearful of public debate. In fact, he should use the resources he is making available for online activity or announcements to actually facilitate debate and provide more detailed information than is currently available. There is a tendency for the Government to insult the intelligence of the public and not to believe in their wisdom. In the end, these debates are forced out. Last week, I organised a briefing about zero Covid at which it was argued that we a need a debate about strategy. A week later, we are having a debate about strategy. It has been forced on the Government but there is massive confusion. Advice from NPHET says one thing, the Taoiseach dismisses it and the Tánaiste absolutely rubbishes NPHET but where is the information and the evidence? We need to put in the public domain the information and the data that led the Taoiseach to dismiss NPHET and put out NPHET's data, and let people adjudicate on the actual information and not be afraid to have a debate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A lot of the considerations are not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At five weeks behind.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry, the minutes are five weeks behind.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I echo Deputy Barry's call with regard to the Debenhams workers. It is shameful that 1,000 workers have to continue their protest for this length of time to get basic justice and decent treatment from the liquidator. Debenhams clearly does not care a damn about them. The Taoiseach must exercise the influence he has to ensure those workers get a just settlement. Martin in Blackrock, whom I mentioned earlier, repeats his invitation for the Taoiseach to, in all seriousness, sit down with him, Eilish, Viv, Helen and others to talk to them about why they are there and what they expect of the Government to ensure they get just treatment. I cannot understand why the Government will not restore the pandemic unemployment payment. There is no difference between now and March in terms of the bills, mortgages, financial pressures and so on facing people who have lost their jobs as a result of the pandemic. How does the Taoiseach think people whose work has been stopped and whose income has been drastically reduced as a result of the pandemic are going to pay their bills? The Taoiseach must answer them. It seems to me that there is no other answer other than that the Government has to restore those payments and protections as a minimum measure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Personally, yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We agree with that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what it is worried about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The true history of the attitude of successive Irish Governments to culture, arts, music and events, and to the crews that stand behind them, is a history of lip service without tangible support. That is most obviously reflected in the fact that we spend one sixth of the average spend across Europe on funding arts and culture. The events and music sectors have never received a penny, essentially, and there was even no engagement until they began to get themselves organised in the last few months through groups such as EPIC, the event production industry Covid-19 working group. I sought the first debate in the House on arts and culture after the pandemic, and then requested that groups such as EPIC and the National Campaign for the Arts appear before the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response. Since then, the level of lip service in the House to arts and culture has grown exponentially. There is no doubt about that. After the virtual silence about arts, culture, music and events, there has been a cacophony. The level of lip service and rhetoric that has been expended in saying how much people love the arts and music and how much they contribute to our culture and society is almost a cultural event in itself. Never have we needed them more than in the utterly grim situation we now face. However, lip service has still not been matched by tangible support. In fact, apart from a few paltry million euro that was added to the funded sector, still bringing it nowhere near the European average expenditure on that, nothing has been given. One million euro for music is just an insult, to be honest, compared to the contribution musicians make. In fact, when one looks at the entire issue, the cuts the Government has imposed to the PUP and the wage subsidy mean it has given a little token and taken it all back. The PUP and the wage subsidy are the payments from the Government that reach everybody in those sectors, that is, all the crew people, the musicians, artists, performers and all the people who have lost work. It is the payment they all received. Frankly, it was not enough and it was not tailored in such a way that they could do some work on top of it, if they were lucky enough to get a little work. However, at least they all received it. That is the thing the Government has cut. All the groups representing arts, music and culture, including EPIC, the Events Industry Alliance and the National Campaign for the Arts, have asked the Government to restore and retain the PUP and income subsidy payments and, indeed, to allow people to earn a little above that. That is the key issue. Beyond that, there is the question of whether the Minister will give grants to cover the ongoing costs of insurance, repayments and all the other ongoing costs people are still incurring even though there is no work for them. Is the Minister going to give scaffolding funding for the reduced capacities, or no capacity, in venues? That is the question. So far, it has been lip service rather than tangible commitments. Frankly, the engagements appear to be tokenistic and, according to some of the reports I am hearing, that is precisely what they are. Of course, all those connected to the industry in indirect jobs, the 35,000 jobs and others beyond that such as in the taxi industry, are all asking the same questions as to how they will be able to pay their bills and rent and whether they will be able to survive. One company involved in music wrote to me today. It gives work to 300 musicians and asked twice for the wage subsidy, but was refused twice. I do not know how it does not qualify. It is unbelievable that it does not qualify for these schemes. Let us stop the rhetoric and deliver the support. In contrast, there is one exception to all this - the film producers. There is virtually no ongoing employment in the industry, but in the last number of years they have received €668 million in grants, tax reliefs and so forth. It dwarfs what the rest of arts and culture has received. I believe in the film industry, but that is shocking when there are no jobs. Let us support the artists, performers, crews and musicians.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise to the Minister of State. I did not hear her opening comments because I was at a meeting. I thank Sinn Féin for tabling the motion and making it an all-party effort. It is absolutely imperative that we discuss the UNCRPD and its full implementation, particularly given the huge impact on disability services that Covid-19 has had. As Deputy Pringle just said, we signed up to the UN convention and 11 years later, only after long hard campaigning by disability activists, with protests every couple of months two years ago by various disability, activist and advocate groups, the Government was eventually forced, and it really was forced, to do what it should have done 11 years earlier and ratify the UN convention. Even when the Government was dragged kicking and screaming to ratify it, it left out the critical part, which was the optional protocol. I do not know whether this was discussed earlier and whether the Government has given a commitment that it will adopt the optional protocol. I will not say the UN convention is not worth the paper it is written on without the optional protocol but it is not far off it. That is the thing that really forces accountability on the Government and gives a mechanism to people with disabilities to hold the Government to account as to whether it will ensure real equality at every level for people with disabilities, who are clearly denied this at a whole range of levels, whether transport, employment or education. In just about every sphere of life equality is not a tangible reality. When I think about things that have happened recently in a campaign in which I have been involved with St. Mary's Telford on Merrion Road, it is shocking that the Government is allowing them to happen. The Sisters of Charity have just decided to get rid of a convalescence centre nursing home for people with disabilities and effectively turf out women, some of whom suffered at the hands of the Sisters of Charity and who have lived there for 60 years with visual impairment and disability. They were just told their homes are going. They have waged a massive campaign and the Sisters of Charity are now speaking about leaving them for a little while but essentially they have been told to get out. This is funded by the HSE with taxpayers' money but because it is the Sisters of Charity they can do this for reasons unknown. The Government is just saying it is not its affair. It is just not on that this should be allowed to happen. I should mention St. Monica's Nursing Home in Belvedere Place. I do not know it as well. The workers there have just been dumped and are not getting paid proper redundancy. It is shocking. In recent days, I received a letter about St. John of God. I do not know whether this issue has been raised. Disability services should be publicly delivered and not delivered through religious organisations but as it happens St. John of God delivers pretty much all of the intellectual disability services in my area. It is stating they are all going. Such is the level of underfunding from the HSE that there will be no services. They will just have to walk away. At the bottom of it are the austerity cuts that were imposed back in 2008 and the years afterwards. It has never really recovered from them or the failure of the Government to provide the funding. There is the threat to St. Joseph's dementia care in Shankill, which nearly went under other than big campaigning. That is just not on. We are not putting the resources into making equality a reality. I think about my friends Sean O'Kelly and Bernard Mulvany, who run the Access for All campaign to ensure that lifts on the DART line are fixed. A bit of extra money has been given but there is still a long way to go to ensure access to the DART. We have a lot more to do so let us get a commitment on the optional protocol and let us actually put the resources in to make equality for people with disabilities a reality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Barely a week goes by that President Donald Trump does not do something else that horrifies me and threatens either his own society or the wider world in some way. One of the more disturbing suggestions of recent times is that he would not accept the outcome of an election if he lost it. That is a serious business when one considers the extremely tense situation that exists in the US. Has the Minister any reaction to those sorts of suggestions from President Trump?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The problem is that we are dealing with President Trump. I have definite views and want the President to lose the election. I do not have much faith in Joe Biden but we have to get rid of President Trump. I do not expect the Minister to say that. The President was essentially threatening civil war. That is not an idle threat when one considers what has happened in the United States over the past few months. There has been war on the streets and cities have exploded. The President is leaning on terrifying and, in some cases, openly fascist forces, such as the Ku Klux Klan, which he refuses to condemn. He is essentially threatening a race war and civil war if he does not win the election. Sometimes one has to name the problem. This is not the normal run of politics; this is far more serious. This is a man who does not care about the truth, telling lies or the consequences of his actions and is threatening civil war. That sort of threat to democracy has to be called out in a serious way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Something that people rarely remark upon is that the country that produced the Nazis was the most developed and advanced society in Europe, almost bar none, at the time. It descended into horror beyond belief. That was a political force that never gained more than 33% support in an open election and which engineered its rise to power through a lie about the burning of the Reichstag. Those events start to have terrifying echoes. I am not saying that Donald Trump is Adolf Hitler but he is playing around with political forces that are heading very dangerously in that direction and threatening this kind of behaviour. Sometimes one just has to say that this stuff is too lethal and dangerous. One can see that President Trump is whipping up and encouraging political forces even in this country and across Europe. We cannot treat that in the normal way. It has to be called out as something that must be politically defeated, challenged and driven out of the political arena.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The problem is that despite the statements of sympathy with the plight Palestinians are faced with, the silent transfer and annexation prosecuted by Israel against Palestinians to remove them from places like East Jerusalem and other parts of the West Bank just goes on and on. Nothing is done to stop it. The Minister is stating that he is appalled by it but nothing can be done, which is his essential line.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Since January there has been a 55% rise in the number of structures targeted for demolition or confiscated in the occupied territories and a fourfold increase in the number of displaced people. While all these statements are being made, the situation continues to get worse. In East Jerusalem, 24 structures were demolished last month. It just goes on and no action is taken. There are no consequences. Is it any wonder that Israel believes it can do what it likes? The Minister and Europe keep talking to Israel and expressing concern but there are no consequences. In reality, it believes it has the green light to do what it likes because there will be no consequences. The only reason apartheid South Africa was eventually brought down was because there were consequences for running an abhorrent regime but there are no consequences for Israel.
