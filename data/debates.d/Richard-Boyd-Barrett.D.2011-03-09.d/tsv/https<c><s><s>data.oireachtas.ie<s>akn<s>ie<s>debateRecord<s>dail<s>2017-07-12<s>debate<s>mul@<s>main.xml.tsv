RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was very democratic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The fairly desperate scramble of the political establishment in this country and elsewhere to understand why it is so discredited often focuses on trivia and superficial impressions about what is important and what motivates the electorate. Never more did we see this on show than during the visit of Prime Minister Trudeau, when the focus of much of the commentary was about socks, image and jogging through the park. There was no serious debate about the substantial issues for which the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Trudeau affirmed their support, which are the actual reasons the political establishment is in trouble, namely, the consequence of 25 years of corporate-led globalisation, of which CETA is the latest version. I say seriously to the Taoiseach that he should recognise, even for his own narrow political concerns or, for that matter, those of Deputy Micheál Martin, that the reason the establishment is in trouble is the consequence of corporate-led globalisation on ordinary working people and their incomes, public services, infrastructure and the growing inequality in the distribution of wealth, which CETA will further exacerbate. The Taoiseach keeps saying he favours trade. So do I. I favour trade in a way that will benefit the majority of people. All the lauding of CETA, which the Taoiseach has reaffirmed, fails to acknowledge, first, that he plans to apply it without any democratic mandate in this country, as in many other places, which infuriates people, and, second, that he fails to acknowledge the damage it will do to workers' rights, environmental standards, the distribution of wealth, health and safety standards or, according to a recent academic study, the estimated 300,000 jobs that will be lost in Europe as a result of the agreement. None of these things are mentioned.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach just forges ahead with his support for this deal that will only benefit multinational corporations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is historically declining.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Many small companies will go out of business.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is because there is not too much detail.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The political establishment, which I will define for Deputy Micheál Martin, comprises the people who have dominated this State since its inception-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I was saying, the political establishment, which I will define for Deputy Martin as being the people who have dominated the State for the past 75 years, like a narrative in which they say they are the people in favour of enterprise and jobs whereas the left just wants to give out about things.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The truth is that we just want different priorities in developing jobs and enterprise. One of those, which we have talked about incessantly, and at the time of the previous budget, People Before Profit was the only group of people to include it in their budget submission, is the need to increase the arts budget significantly and to recognise the enormous, cultural, economic and social potential of the arts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There has been some rhetorical acknowledgement of that issue by the Government and Fianna Fáil, largely because of the work of the National Campaign for the Arts and others. In reality, however, the arts budget for 2017 was reduced by 16% on what it was in 2016 and we are at the bottom of the league table when it comes to expenditure on arts as a proportion of gross domestic product, GDP. We do not recognise the value, potential, work or contribution of artists. There is probably nothing that has enhanced Ireland's reputation at every level on the international stage more than arts, poetry and music, yet the level of interest of the political establishment beyond rhetoric is pathetic. That is borne out by the pitifully low level of investment in the arts. Is the Taoiseach's new regime going to recognise this huge gap, begin to back the arts and artists and invest in our cultural talent?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We snuffed out the Blueshirts for a while.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was not talking about Michael D.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Michael D. was never part of the political establishment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He was on the left wing of the Labour Party.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He was an honourable exception.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Despite all the great efforts taken by political parties and Governments to manipulate the narrative around politics in this country in order to convince the public that they are doing this, that or the other and the parliamentary games that have been regularly played on a large scale in recent weeks - such as ramming legislation through at a rate of knots and all those games in which the big parties in particular specialise - when the history of this period is written, what will be recorded will not be all the public relations spin, manipulation and tricks, it will be the fact that the two major parties allowed the banks and those who profiteer from property to destroy the economy and create an unprecedented period of austerity and hardship for the citizens of this country and then allowed the conditions which led to the latter to re-emerge rather than tackling the fundamental reasons for it happening in the first instance. The housing crisis, the mortgage arrears crisis, the rental crisis and the homelessness crisis all revolve around that fact. Even now, in the aftermath of the disaster that was inflicted, this Government does not want to stand up to the banks. That is just putting it simply. If 80,000 people are in mortgage arrears and 33,000 of them are in arrears for two years or more and have the real prospect of losing their homes, the Government is willing to allow that to happen as long as we do not annoy the banks or upset somebody's notion of private property and the rights relating thereto. I always wonder when reference is made to the Constitution and the protections relating to private property. When we argued for rent controls, the Government said it could not be done. Strangely enough, however, the Government - under a lot of pressure - brought in a very limited form of rent control at the end of last year. Suddenly it could be done and no legal issues emerged. I do not believe all that nonsense and much as I hold Fianna Fáil responsible for getting us into this mess, I agree that the Bill should pass Second Stage because it is doing something that we proposed in an extensive series of amendments to the personal insolvency legislation when it was originally introduced, namely, that the Insolvency Service of Ireland should be allowed to enforce solutions for people in mortgage distress in order to ensure they do not lose their homes.I am not sure if Fianna Fáil voted with us when we put that forward. I hope that they did, to show a little bit of consistency. Our proposal was written out in great detail. I wrote the amendments myself at great length. Fine Gael would not do it then, however. It is all because Fine Gael wants to protect the banks. That is the reality, with all the suffering that flows from it. It is not just about the mortgage arrears crisis which this Bill deals with but also the wider housing crisis. Worse than that, the Government is resurrecting the conditions that led to all this by allowing and facilitating the sale of vast amounts of property assets to vulture funds which are evicting people and gaining even greater control over property prices, rents and so on. The Government is facilitating a worsening of the situation. It beggars belief. The least the Government could do is let this Bill, which is trying to address one aspect of it, go through Second Stage in order that we can discuss it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am enjoying the debate anyway.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not at all. I was just saying that I was enjoying the debate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	His amendment is the first in the grouping.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think it is the other way around.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a matter of interest, I thought there was no deadline in putting in Report Stage amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not say we cannot put in amendments on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think the Deputy can submit them now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are not.
