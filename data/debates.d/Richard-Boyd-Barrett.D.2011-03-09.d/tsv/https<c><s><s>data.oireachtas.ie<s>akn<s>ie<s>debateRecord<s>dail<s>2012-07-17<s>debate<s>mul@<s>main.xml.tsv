RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are many obscenities to the austerity agenda one of the worst of which is homelessness and of that, the worst of all is youth homelessness.  There are approximately 1,000 homeless in the Dublin city area.  The number has increased dramatically and the homelessness organisations estimate that 100 young people sleep alone on the streets at night in Dublin.The Fianna Fáil Government, in one of its most disgusting cuts, cut social welfare for young people.  This has contributed directly, not to job creation but to driving many young people out of the country and also into homelessness.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question to the Minister is simple.  Whereas a person in the care of the homeless services retains his or her full social welfare, a person who becomes homeless between the ages of 18 and 24 does not get the full social welfare payment and, consequently, becomes trapped in homelessness because even if the person finds private rented accommodation and gets rent supplement, the person's income is so low that he or she cannot pay the rent.  As a result, it becomes more difficult for the person to access work because he or she must give as an address a homeless hostel.  What we are asking simply is that any young person who, at any point between the ages of 18 and 24, becomes homeless should be given the full social welfare entitlement so that he or she can get out of homelessness and can access other accommodation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I cannot believe I am hearing this from a Labour Party Minister.  This is the Michael McDowell school of economics - if we have inequality and if people are downtrodden, this will somehow act as an incentive for them to get a job.Does the Minister understand the question?  People who are homeless as a result of whatever circumstances led them into homelessness are trying to get out of homelessness and they are being prevented from doing so because, even if they access private rented accommodation and get rent supplement, the low level of social welfare income provided for them under the jobseeker's allowance - because of the cuts imposed by Fianna Fáil - means they cannot take up that accommodation and get onto the next step of the ladder to try to access employment and get back into society.  The question is simple.  For those between the ages of 18 and 24 who are homeless and trying to access homelessness services, will the Minister review the situation and give them the full social welfare entitlement of €188 so they can get out of homelessness, access private rented accommodation and, from there, apply for jobs?  It is very difficult to apply for a job from a homeless hostel.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They have no future on the streets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is to cut their social welfare.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about a roof over their heads?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We all agree with that.  What about the ones who are homeless?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the programme for Government the Taoiseach stated:[O]ur parties are committed to protecting the vulnerable and to burden-sharing on an equitable basis.  Fianna Fáil presided over an unequal and increasingly divided Ireland. We are both committed to forging a new Ireland that is built on fairness and equal citizenship.They are fine words but the facts revealed this week confirm again that the opposite is the truth under the Government.  Social Justice Ireland shows that while the poorest people in society have seen their income drop by 18% in the past year, the wealthiest 10% have seen their income increase by 4% and that the gap between the richest and the poorest has opened dramatically in recent years.When we say that one should tax the wealthy in this country, the Taoiseach claims there is no pot of gold.  I got shocking replies from the Minister for Finance about the earnings of the wealthiest people in society last week and how much tax they paid.  They showed a very low level of effective taxes on the wealthiest in society.  For example, the top 10,000 earners earned just under €6 billion last year, an average of €595,000 each, and paid an effective tax rate of only 29%.  That information came from the Department of Finance.What everyone on the street knows is now official: the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.  Working people and the least well-off are getting it in the neck with austerity while the rich are being protected.  What is the Taoiseach going to do about it?  Is he going to address the inequality and unfairness and is he going to impose taxes on the super-wealthy who can afford it or will he continue to slaughter the poor, the vulnerable and the working people?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The figures are from 2012.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is about poverty and inequality in this country, it is not about Europe and the debt crisis.  The figures I quoted to the Taoiseach on the top income earners are 2012 figures provided by the Department of Finance.  They also show, for example, that the top 10% of earners earned €29.5 billion in total income last year.  They have average earnings of €136,000 per year and they are paying an effective tax rate of only 24%.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The budget cuts to lone parents, rent allowance and other social welfare payments and community employment schemes are further attacking the least well-off while the wealthy are being protected and are not paying their fair share of taxes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we have a radical shift in policy where people who earn between €130,000 and €600,000 a year – the super-wealthy in society-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----are made to shoulder the burden of the cuts and austerity instead of people who are homeless or on social welfare, low and middle income workers and people who are struggling to pay their bills?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Government change its policy and stop protecting the super-wealthy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Two hundred thousand children are living in poverty.  Is the Taoiseach dreaming?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I find the political point scoring between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael extremely amusing------
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	------as they both supported the bank guarantee which, as the Taoiseach rightly said-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----was the single most important financial decision taken by any Government in the State's history and which bankrupted the country with disastrous consequences.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am responding to the amusing political games being played.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach certainly has a point.  Fianna Fáil has a brass neck to raise the issue; it is beyond belief, but how the Taoiseach can poke fun when he supported the measure is beyond me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Taoiseach asked the departmental officials who were present at the time where the records are?  It stinks to high heaven that there is no record of this most important decision and the deliberations on it.  What investigations has the Taoiseach carried out into the record keeping for that crucial meeting if he is so worried about it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It stinks to high heaven that there is no record of this most important meeting or the deliberations that led to this disastrous decision.  I have pointed out that it is amusing that the Taoiseach is poking fun at Fianna Fáil when his party supported the decision.  We all know, as it turned out, that the rationale was shared by Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the European authorities-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----to protect the banks at all costs and sacrifice the rest of us to pay for it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Taoiseach is so concerned about the matter, what investigations has he conducted to ascertain whether records were taken by departmental officials or anybody else, especially if he is making the serious suggestion there may have been shredding or the dispatching of these critical records?  It is suspicious that there are no records, what is he doing to find out what happened to them, or if records were taken?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If there are pieces of paper, the Taoiseach should publish them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Taoiseach asked the departmental officials?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we confirm that notes were taken?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There was widespread disappointment at the Personal Insolvency Bill.  It failed to do what should have been done, which is to provide for the writing down of unsustainable mortgage debt left on the backs of people through no fault of their own.  It happened because of the pumping up of the property bubble by the banks, the developers and their friends, Fianna Fáil, in government at the time.  People have been left with this disastrous situation, which is no fault of their own.  They hoped there would be real relief in writing down the debt and recognising it was a debt artificially created by the greedy and imposed on the back of people who want nothing more than to put a roof over their heads.  Instead, there is an arrangement-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----where the banks have a veto and the last say.  Is this the meeting where the Taoiseach decided to give the banks the last say?  They seem to have the last say on everything.  Is this the meeting at which it was all agreed, whereby the bank said that any debt settlement arrangements and insolvency arrangements would be subject to the banks having the last say and the Taoiseach just accepted it?  It is a pretty poor show given what the banks have done and are doing to this country.  Once again, they come in and tell the Taoiseach what to do and he obeys.Did the Taoiseach invite distressed mortgages holders to the meeting?  Did he invite the credit unions, which are more in touch with ordinary people?  There will be no debt write-downs for them and no bailout but the banks get the bailout and still do not engage in debt write-down.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did the Taoiseach talk to ordinary people affected by this problem or did he listen only to the banks?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will talk about this issue in more detail later in the week.  I got my brief on the Bill from someone who is in mortgage distress.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I went to someone in the situation of unsustainable mortgage arrears-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and I asked the person to read the Bill and provide me with a critique of it.  The person said the Bill was rubbish because it left the power in the hands of the banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Was it at this meeting that the Taoiseach gave the banks the veto?  Why did he not tell them that the Government was going to tell the banks what to do and that it was going to impose fair debt settlement arrangements because the Government is now the boss of the banks and, having recapitalised them, they should serve the people rather than their own interests?  Why did the Taoiseach not do so?  Why did he allow the banks to have a veto?  Did the banks tell the Taoiseach that at the meeting?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I spoke to someone affected by the problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why did the Taoiseach not get such people to write the Bill, not the banks?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	By us, the people.
