RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee.  There are 3,400 repossessions and legal actions of one sort or another in the pipeline.  Can the witnesses assure us that Bank of Ireland is actively trying to give people in those cases every option besides having their homes taken off them?  Will the witnesses tell us a bit about how Bank of Ireland interacts with the group of people in respect of whom it has gone to the drastic extent of issuing legal proceedings or putting them in the position of supposedly voluntarily surrendering their homes?  I suspect it often is not that voluntary and they have little choice.  Will the witnesses assure us that Bank of Ireland is making every effort to keep people in their homes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Bank of Ireland re-engages with the customers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Oddly enough, and perhaps running counter to my instincts and impulses and some of the questioning, I actually believe the banks.  It is not in their interests to repossess people and they are under a great deal of pressure.  Mr. Mason mentioned that Bank of Ireland reaches some arrangement in nine out of ten cases.  What about the one to which it cannot offer a solution, even if that is what the customer is seeking?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What kind of person is that?  These are people who are trying to make an arrangement with Bank of Ireland but for whom it does not believe there is a solution, having examined their situations.  Is that what is happening?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At that point the bank moves to get their houses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why would mortgage-to-rent not be an option?  I presume we are discussing people who are on low incomes or have lost their jobs and are dependent on social welfare.  Would Bank of Ireland offer people in such situations a mortgage-to-rent option?  Why would they refuse it, why might it not be suitable or what might be the problem?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is something we could consider.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is much that is thrown at the banks that we should be the ones considering.  I do not approve of some of the banks' actions, but they have been given the power to do them and are probably behaving rationally from their own point of view.  The criteria for mortgage-to-rent solutions might rule some people out, at which time Bank of Ireland moves towards repossession.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	From what the witnesses have told me, I am angry about what appears to be their approach to residual debt.  Using the previous example of someone who has lost a job or is on a low income, took out a mortgage in good faith, is a victim of the economic collapse, has a family and so on, if that person is forced to give the bank his or her family home, which is an awful thing to have to do for an innocent victim of other people's behaviour, including that of the banks, Bank of Ireland will pursue that person for the residual debt of €100,000 or €150,000.  That is cruel.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking the witnesses in all honesty.  I will not give the banks credit, but I acknowledge that, in my experience, they have not been moving for wholesale repossessions.  This is not particularly because they are nice, but because it would not be in their interests.  Where someone has no option and is forced to give up the family home because there is no sustainable solution available, it has dramatic consequences, yet there is still an outstanding amount and Bank of Ireland will chase that person down for it and take him or her to court, even though it knows the person has no money.  Is the bank serious?  That is an extraordinarily vindictive and vicious thing to do to people who have already been innocent victims of a mess that was created by the banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is extraordinary.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us take a person who has lost a job and as a result does not have the capacity to do a deal with the bank.  The bank then moves to repossess the home.  It knows that the person has no money and will be struggling to put a roof over his or her head, yet it still proposes to initiate legal proceedings to try to get blood out of a stone.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Boucher not believe that is cruel and vindictive?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put it to Mr. Boucher that it is unbelievably cruel that the bank chases people who have lost everything for money that it knows they do not have.  What is its purpose in doing that when it knows it will be unable to get any money from the people concerned?  What is the purpose in taking to court a person whose only income is from social welfare benefits and trying to get from him or her, say, €100,000, which it knows he or she does not have?  Leaving aside the cruelty, distress and anxiety for the family involved, I do not see how this makes sense from the bank's point of view.  How from its point of view does it make sense?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Boucher's responsibility is to the bank's shareholders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Therefore, the bank chooses to torture people from whom it knows it cannot get money?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What the bank is doing could not be described as anything other than punishment.  What it is doing is punishing people because it knows they cannot pay, but it still demands that they do so, including by bringing the legal system down on top of them to force them to pay.  There is no word describe it other than "punishment".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But the bank is still going to chase them for more money.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the buy-to-let sector, I have made the following point to all of the banks.  There are many people who are tenants of landlords who owe money to the banks.  They are innocent victims in all of this in that they are paying rent to their landlords who have gone bust.  The banks have several thousand of these landlords on their books and commenced repossession proceedings in respect of some of the properties concerned.  Does Bank of Ireland propose to respect the rights of tenants who faithfully pay their rent and have every right to expect security of tenure and not to be turfed out by receivers appointed by the bank or does it propose to turf out tenants whose contract is not with the bank but with the landlord, which contract they have continued to honour?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Often a person could be a party to a one year lease agreement which then expires, but because these things often operate on an informal basis, he or she expects to continue paying rent and remain in the property.  The Residential Tenancies Act provides for a four-year cycle in terms of tenancy, which means that a person could expect security of tenure for three or four years.  However, the bank can get around this by appointing a receiver who chooses to sell the property.  I would like to hear from the delegates that Bank of Ireland's attitude is not a mercenary one of moving in as soon as it can to sell a property, particularly if there is a tenant in it who is faithfully paying rent.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appeal to the bank to do so.  I hope we do not have cause to meet the delegates again to discuss the eviction of thousands of tenants by the bank.
