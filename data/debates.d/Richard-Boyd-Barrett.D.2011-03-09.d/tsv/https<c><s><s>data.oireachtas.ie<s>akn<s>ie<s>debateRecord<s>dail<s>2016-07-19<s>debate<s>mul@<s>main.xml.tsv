RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the more than 100,000 families and households rotting on housing lists for 15 years and longer and the thousands of families suffering the cruelty and hardship of homelessness, I regret to give my opinion that this document is an incredible disappointment. At best, it is yet another mirage and false dawn for those who desperately need solutions to the housing crisis. At worst, I believe it to be a cynical exercise in spoof and dishonesty in that it masks a move to retreat from the provision of local authority housing to the privatisation of housing provision under the guise of a promise of an increase in social housing provision. If that contention is not true, the Taoiseach will be able to answer a simple question - an answer that is not contained in the report. How many local authority houses will be built between 2016 and 2020, the years of this plan? I am being very specific; my question is about local authority houses. I am not asking about the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, the housing assistance payment, HAP, leasing arrangements, public private partnerships or approved housing bodies. I am asking about council houses. How many will be built? It is not in the report, it was never in Deputy Alan Kelly's report and the Taoiseach never answers that question. I believe what is clearly spelt out in this document is that this is all about more incentives, grants and supports for private developers and vulture funds, in the hope of creating a mirage that the private, for profit sector will deliver the social housing we need when it will not. What we need are council houses. If I am wrong, the Taoiseach should tell me. Will he give me the specific figures? How many council houses will be built next year and in subsequent years? I suspect the Taoiseach will not be able to give me the answer to the question. In any event, the figure will be well south of the headline figures being blasted all over the media at the moment. Let him prove me wrong and give hope to those who have been waiting for 15 years and longer on a housing list. Let him tell them there is light at the end of the tunnel. However, there is no such light in this document, which is a manifesto to privatise public housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know the Taoiseach cannot.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is pretty elementary.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not know this was questions to People Before Profit. I thought it was questions to the Taoiseach. It could not be more telling that, in answer to the most basic and elementary question, the Taoiseach cannot tell the House how many council houses the Government intends to deliver. That confirms that we are just getting a rehashed, slightly upscaled version of the Kelly plan. There are big headline figures but when one scratches beneath the surface, it is all dependent on "incentives" to the private sector in the shape of infrastructural grants and the transfer of public land. Could we cosset them any more than we have already done? Was it not the cosseting and incentivising of these people that led to the last property crash while delivering no social housing? The Taoiseach pursues this mirage but this will be a disastrous failure. If the Taoiseach cannot answer the question as to how many local authority houses are to be built, which is damning, why did he not accept the recommendations of the Oireachtas Committee on Housing and Homelessness? There is to be no moratorium on repossessions, no request to the EU to break the fiscal rules on investment in social housing and no rent controls. Could it be any more of a mirage than that? The Government did not even listen to its own all-party Oireachtas committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will give the Taoiseach the answer. The number is 53 while 600 joined the housing list.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach cannot give me the numbers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need council houses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Most of the recommendations were rejected.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On behalf of People Before Profit and the Anti-Austerity Alliance I extend our deepest sympathies and condolences to the families, friends and loved ones of the people who were massacred in Nice and those who were injured, some of whom are still in a critical state. The actions that claimed their lives were utterly despicable, unconscionable and unjustifiable in any terms. While we do not really know whether the attacker was a crazed lone individual influenced by the ideas of the so-called Islamic State or actually directed by it, we can be clear that that sort of hate and ideology offers absolutely nothing to humanity, the Muslim community, or any cause in north Africa, the Middle East or anywhere else in terms of trying to bring peace or justice to troubled parts of the world. It must be condemned in the most unequivocal terms. These tragedies continue and they seem to be multiplying. We need to begin to address how people can be driven to these acts of hatred and violence. While this is not the time to debate those things, we must resist any demonisation of the wider Muslim or north African communities in trying to understand or explain what happened.We also have to address the deep sense of alienation and injustice that is felt by many people in north Africa, the Middle East and the north African and Muslim communities in France. That is not in any way to provide justification for this horrific attack, rather it recognises that alienation, frustration and a sense of injustice can be the seedbed for the sort of hatred we saw unleashed in Nice. If we do not want to see a repeat of these sorts of attacks, we all have a responsibility to begin to grapple with these issues.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. It was my pen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is somebody else's turn.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is up to the Minister to group them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the five years of the last Dáil I asked a litany of questions about what I consider to be serious concerns about the corporate governance of Dún Laoghaire Harbour. Payments of expenses to directors turned out to be irregular and where the money was supposed to be refunded, it was not. Extra payments were made to the CEO and the saga of questions goes on. I am not sure if the Minister is aware of it, but the latest accounts of Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company show a €6.5 million loss, an increase from a €1 million loss last year. Will the Minister take into account these serious financial and corporate questions concerning the future of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister needs to look into the issue of whether there are court proceedings. My understanding is that there is none. The Minister is being told a porky. He should simply ask the company if there is a court date and if an actual court hearing is due. He will find out there is not, so they are not telling the truth. That is my understanding and the matter needs to be checked. Earlier this year, the statutory auditors for Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company, Deloitte, resigned. This year, Pamela Kearney, the auditor on the board, resigned. As I have told the Minister, losses for the company, whose accounts came out in May, have increased from €1 million to €6.5 million. Next week, on 27 July, the trustees of the pension scheme have been asked to meet the Pensions Board to address serious concerns raised by the worker pension trustees about the company's behaviour concerning the pension scheme. The questions continue over serious problems and irregularities with the financial and corporate governance of this harbour company. This company, which the Minister himself once called a quango, has to be dissolved. Its operating loss this year was €500,000. The combined salaries and fees of the CEO and directors add up to that loss. This quango has to be dissolved.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I said, the operating loss, not to mind the huge increase in losses, is equivalent to the excessive salaries, fees and expenses that are being paid to an executive that has essentially run this company into the ground. That in itself, on a financial basis, is the reason for its dissolution and the need for it to be put under council control. In that way, we can have some real oversight and accountability concerning what goes on there. I urge the Minister to do that. When I asked him before, he offered an arrangement to meet some of the other stakeholders. Much of what the Minister is hearing is coming from the harbour company itself or from senior council officials.In the next few weeks, if at all possible, I would like to bring some of the other harbour stakeholders to meet with the Minister to discuss the other side of the story in terms of what is going on in Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company because it is not a good story, Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is nothing I would like to believe more than that this plan will deliver. Everybody in this House wants to solve the problem, and how could they not, given the scale of hardship and suffering for homeless people in emergency accommodation or those who have been waiting on housing lists for 15 to 18 years with little or no hope of ever being housed? However, when one looks at the detail of this plan I do not think it will deliver. That is so, not just because it does not take on board what people like ourselves have been saying since 2011, but also because of what was confirmed by the chairperson of the Housing Finance Agency, Dr. Michelle Norris, this morning. She summarised what we have been saying for five years and it stands as the most accurate critique of the failure of this plan to get to the kernel of the problem. Dr. Norris said:We have become too dependent on the private sector to house low-income households. If we are going to deliver houses we need in the short term, in my view, local authorities to be introduced to building at a large scale that will involve them having permission to borrow money. Therefore, local authorities must directly deliver council housing and be given the money to do so themselves. Dr. Norris has recognised the problem and she is right. The question is whether this plan proposes to do that, and it does not. It is littered with references to incentives, private developers, vulture funds, competitiveness-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not mention vulture funds specifically, but it talks about those who will build large-scale rental property. Those are the vulture funds, the people who bought up land and property and own it. The most telling confirmation that my assessment of this is right came when I asked the Taoiseach earlier today if he could tell me how many local authority houses would be built under the plan. He frankly admitted that he could not give me an answer to that question. It is not in the plan. I have heard since from journalists, which I presume came from the Minister, and who I suspect, like everybody else, want to believe that this plan is a new departure. Everybody wants to believe that, while we all wanted to believe that Deputy Alan Kelly's plan was going to change things, but it did not. The Taoiseach could not answer the question of how many council houses will be built, and neither can this report. The nearest it gets to answering the question is on page 45 where it states, "With cooperation and mobilisation by local authorities and AHBs, this Action Plan envisages a significant progressive increase in social housing build activity to over 5,000 ... a year by 2021." Let us read that carefully. It is not 5,000 a year to 2021. That would still only amount to 25,000 and it would not all be council because some of it would be from approved housing bodies. However, the Minister hopes to get up to 5,000 in 2021. Therefore, of the headline figure of 47,000 social housing units, which sounds good, fewer than 25,000 - in fact, I suspect it is considerably less - will be actual local authority houses. In the time of the previous Government the housing list went from 96,000 to 140,000 families and households, and although we do not quite know what it is now, it is up by more than 45,000. If the rate of increase in the housing list continues, we will have a longer council housing list at the end of this plan than we currently have. That is because at the centre of its strategy, this plan does not envisage local authorities taking advice from the Housing Finance Agency and getting back to direct provision of large-scale local authority housing. Why are the figures not in it? Will the Minister tell me how many council houses will be built under this plan? The Taoiseach could not answer and I bet the Minister cannot do so either.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Gino Kenny showed up. It is not in the report. The bulk of the report is about the housing assistance payment, HAP, and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS. I disagree with the principle of HAP, but for the desperate people coming into my constituency office daily I would like to think I could say, "There you go. It's not a council house, but it's something." I can tell the Minister, however, that it is not going to happen. Given the numbers involved, the Minister might get some of it but he will not get anything like the targets he is talking about. There is no evidence that they are signing up in significant numbers and why would they?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know from my own locality that they are not. I read these figures out the other day and will do so again. Even with the Minister's increased rent caps or HAP limits, rent levels in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown for a single one-bedroom dwelling are €1,800 per month, which is double the Minister's limit. Why would a private landlord enter into an arrangement with the Minister for a cap of €1,300 when average rents are €1,800? For a three-bedroom dwelling why would they enter into an arrangement with the Minister when the average rent is €2,200 and all they can get from him is €1,300? They will not do it and that is the problem. Sadly, I do not have time to go into the detail. As is so often the case, there is a reliance on the private sector and an ideological blindness. In addition, there is kowtowing to developers who say they cannot make enough profits which is why they will not build and deliver social and affordable housing. We keep kowtowing to them, however, but they still do not deliver, and we do not get the council housing we need to solve the problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just gave them to the Minister - build council houses.
