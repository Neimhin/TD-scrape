RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the delegates for their explanation which has been very helpful.  To follow on from where Deputy Pearse Doherty finished, the conditionality set out for accessing current recapitalisation suggests the threshold will be very high and that all other possibilities will have to be exhausted before one can access recapitalisation under the ESM and that an arguably even higher threshold will apply for retroactive recapitalisation, judging from the sounds coming from the European Union and the fact that it will be left to the discretion of the board of governors.  A country must exhaust every other possibility before it will be able to apply for direct recapitalisation of its banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not give me much hope because the threshold is so high, even if one is looking for money in the here and now.   Of €500 billion in lending capacity only €60 billion is available for direct recapitalisation of financial institutions.  Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a pretty small amount, which is just over 10% of its lending capacity.  With such a small amount available throughout the whole of Europe for direct recapitalisation and a pretty high threshold being exacted for current recapitalisation in the legislation, our chances of getting retroactive recapitalisation are zero to nil, given the size of the pot available and the thresholds applied to current recapitalisation.  There is nothing to give much hope we will get anything in terms of retroactive recapitalisation.  Is this a reasonable reading of what we have in front of us?  To put it another way and to use colloquial language, it does not state retroactive recapitalisation would be considered sympathetically for countries which have been beggared as a result of their requirement to bail out their banks and have had a really hard time - obviously, it would be phrased differently.  It has very high thresholds for current recapitalisation and very little money available and something about a board of governors considering it on a case-by-case basis.  It does not look very hopeful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not for Mr. Ó Brolcháin to comment, but it looks like a sop to salvage the credibility of the Government's original triumphalism that it would obtain this, that as it now fades into the distance there is still a possibility we will get it.  I will move on from this point as there is not much more to be said about it.    On a more general basis, the €60 billion for direct recapitalisation would be a pretty pathetic figure if there was to be another serious financial crisis in Europe.  We had to get €64 billion and one bank alone, Anglo Irish Bank, required €30 billion.  If there was to be any serious shock to the European financial system, the €60 billion for the whole of Europe would be exhausted very quickly by two banks the size of Anglo Irish Bank.  We would then be back to our bailing them out again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the €60 billion included in this legislation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that figure set out in this legislation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Allowing for more money to go directly into banks because giving it to governments would reduce-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the approach of just over 10% of the fund being available for direct recapitalisation, the thinking is that the states and the taxpayer will need to pick up the bill in the event of a serious crisis.  Mr. Ó Brolcháin mentioned that the 10% figure might be varied, but this is indicative of the thinking involved.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the bail-in and so on, although it is gut-wrenching for us that Europe has now acknowledged the need for a bail-in of bondholders when we did not get one and are highly unlikely to do so.  As a practical example of how all of this is working, will Mr. Ó Brolcháin tell us about the €45 billion that has been given to Spain and Cyprus?  How did that process work, what conditions applied and so on?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What of the interest rates?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What conditionality applied?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would be interested in it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. Ó Brolcháin.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In our case, but they will not give it to us retrospectively.
