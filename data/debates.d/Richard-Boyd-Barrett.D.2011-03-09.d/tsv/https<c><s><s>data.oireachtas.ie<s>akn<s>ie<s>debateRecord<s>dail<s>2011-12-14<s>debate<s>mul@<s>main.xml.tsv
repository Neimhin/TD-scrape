RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Give them houses, not reports.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Unless you are a banker or a bondholder.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This Government will privatise them all.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Taoiseach joking?  He intends to cut them all.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will these waivers last as long as those on the bin charges?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is bad enough that the Taoiseach wants to impose yet another regressive charge on low and middle income families in this country on top of all the other charges, the rising prices and the austerity measures——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——which are absolutely crucifying people.  It is disgraceful that on this Bill, the Social Welfare Bill and almost any Bill that really matters to the daily life of ordinary people, the Taoiseach is imposing a guillotine.  He should at least allow for a proper debate.  I put it to the Taoiseach that, such is the severity of the austerity that is now being meted out to people and being rushed through with guillotines, pretty soon the anger of people will rise up——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——to the point that they will want another type of guillotine to deal with the people who are imposing this austerity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about tomorrow?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is wrong with tomorrow?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing my time with Deputies Shane Ross, Mick Wallace and John Halligan.It is evident that despite all the hoopla, last weekend's summit meeting of EU leaders was a spectacular failure.  The record decline in the euro, the collapsing stock markets, rising bond yields, downgradings and threats of further downgradings of European debt, all testify to the failure of yet another summit.  Summit after summit, failure after failure.  The failure of the strategy being pursued by EU leaders and by the Taoiseach, has long been evident to ordinary workers and citizens and to the vulnerable, both in this country and in Europe, who are suffering mass unemployment, forced emigration, brutal austerity, cut after cut.  Now, the speculators who caused the crisis, before whom the Government kneels and prostrates itself and demands that we kneel and prostrate ourselves, are betting that the Taoiseach's plan will not work.  They are voting with their feet and they are betting that Europe is going down.The Fianna Fáil Government slaughtered this country with austerity to bail out the banks and they handed us over to the troika.  By the way, they did not mention the ECB mandate when they were doing all this.  When those of us who campaigned against the Lisbon treaty did talk about the ECB mandate and its failure to consider anything other than inflation and profit, we were ignored and ridiculed by Fianna Fáil.  Nonetheless, I welcome their conversion on the road to Damascus.The Taoiseach's Government continues with the attacks on school children, on lone parents, on the elderly, on the disabled, resulting in unemployment — the very thing he said he would prioritise — getting worse, not better.  In response to this situation, where the troika simply demands even more austerity, he comes back from this summit proposing that we support a pact based on permanently establishing a policy of bailing out the banks and permanent austerity visited on the people of this country and the people of the rest of Europe.  He tries to cover that with talk of firewalls.  What the hell are we talking about?  Human shields would be a better description for what is happening and the policy being pursued by the European Union which is being implemented here.  Our citizens' livelihoods, services and incomes are being used as shields to protect bankers, bondholders and speculators.  I ask the Taoiseach if there is any destruction he will not visit on our economy and which the EU leaders will not visit on the European economy, its citizens and even now, the European Union itself, which is threatened with break-up in order to protect a currency or to protect the people behind that currency or the speculators and the bondholders.  Which is more important, the people, the citizens, their services, their livelihoods, their right to a job, or a bloody currency and the bondholders who stand behind it?As we said yesterday, with this pact the Taoiseach proposes to set in stone a Stalinist-like centralised command economy of permanent austerity and permanent inequality.  I wonder whether the EU leaders are quietly looking at China where there is economic growth and thinking that dictatorship seems to work in China.  A brutal regime which does not give its citizens any rights results in economic growth.  Perhaps they are looking at Russia where elections are being rigged and are deciding this is the economic model we should follow.  It is a very alarming thought that this is the direction in which Europe is heading.  The historic gains of fighting for democracy and for the right of citizens to control their economic and political affairs, to decide on their political representatives and institutions, are being systematically demolished.It is indicative of that sort of contempt for democracy and for the needs and wishes of our citizens that the Government is trying to do every piece of gymnastics possible to avoid a referendum.  Frankly, I do not know how the Government can argue for one second that a referendum is not necessary.  This deal is not even within the structures of the European Union, it has no bearing, therefore, on measures we have passed in referenda.  It is a new pact of a more anti-democratic Europe which is simply a creature, an agent, for the markets, for Goldman Sachs, for the bankers and the bondholders.I appeal to the Taoiseach and to the Tánaiste to stand up for what is right, to stand up for the citizens of this country and, indeed, for citizens across Europe whose interests should come first.  Democracy, jobs, public services, equality, fairness and decency can be achieved if there is a willingness to bring these markets under control.   Is it not embarrassing for democratically elected leaders across Europe to be dictated to by the markets and financial institutions which wrecked our economy?  Their actions make a mockery of the Taoiseach and our democracy.  He should stop it and stand up for the people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach would be better off worrying about the politburos in Brussels and Frankfurt which are doing all the dictating at the moment.  My party's politburo operates openly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach is begging them and they are just ignoring them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are ignoring us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	And to sell our State assets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Surely the Government knows what is in it now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some other bodies will monitor our budgets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Government representatives were at the summit.  Do they know what they agreed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government has the substance and it signed up to it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Which is going down.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it the Europe of the bondholders or of the people?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A wealth tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Mathews, we are a little tight on time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The list of categories that we are seeking in these amendments to have excluded from the charge are unanswerable for anybody who claims to be even vaguely interested in fairness.  Unless somebody on that side of the House in the Government will tell us soon — I would like to see the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, nod his head and state that I am absolutely right and that the Government will agree — they are, in fact, exposing the truth about this charge.  With all the talk about fairness and how there will be exclusions for the small number of categories that the Minister has decided to exclude, if he does not exclude these categories then the talk of fairness is rubbish.How could the Minister possibly not exclude the 350,000 who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own over the past three years?  Is it not bad enough that they have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, through the behaviour of gamblers and bondholders, developers and politicians?  Is it not bad enough that they must suffer that ignominy of unemployment with little prospect of recovery anywhere close on the horizon, and that their children are leaving the country?  The Minister states that it is okay to load another austerity measure on top of them, as well as hitting various other payments, in the budget the Government has just passed and in the social welfare Bill, that they would receive and that would bolster their income, which is miserable compared to what they would have enjoyed when they were working hard, as they want to be, and contributing to society.  How can the Minister not exclude anybody who has lost his or her job?How can the Minister not exclude those on family income supplement who are at the lowest level of income?  That is why they get State support.  How can the Minister not exclude those with a disability?  How can he not exclude State pensioners?  How can he not exclude those who are in negative equity because of the behaviour of reckless bankers and developers?  How can he not exclude those on medical cards?  The reason they are on medical cards is because they do not have enough money to provide for their health care.  If those groups do not deserve to be excluded from this household charge, then it is an attack on those groups.  There is not other way to describe it.  It is quite obscene.Of course, the reason the Minister of State is not nodding his head and is not giving the commitment is because even the groups that the Minister has excluded have nothing to do with the Government's desire for fairness but have everything to do with trying to pull a con trick on the public as to the real nature of this charge.  Just as they did when they supported bin charges where they brought in the waivers at the beginning to try to soften people up to try to disorganise and undermine the legitimate opposition to the bin charges, after a few years the waivers disappear.  Everybody out there knows that is what will happen here.  It is merely a ruse.  It is merely a tactic.  It has nothing to do with fairness.  It is about playing games with people.  It is about the same cynical politics, which has wrecked this country and which has infected and corrupted the political culture.  The Minister thinks it is okay.  He thinks it is funny.  He thinks it is tactical to play games with people, pretending that there will be some element of fairness when the intention is nothing more than to get the foot in the door for this charge, and then for the water charges, do away with the waivers and ratchet up the charges as the years go by.  That is the intention.  Most members of the public know this.  It is very important that it be said loud and clear; otherwise the Deputies would not vote with us on the amendments.This issue turns on the question of fair taxation, and the Minister of State and Government know this well.  They keep wringing their hands saying they do not like what they are doing and wish they did not have to do it.  They say the troika made them do so.  It is obscene that this measure is in the troika agreement and that the Government is doing its bidding to pay off the bondholders.  Notwithstanding its ridiculous, pathetic decision to capitulate to the troika, there are alternatives, and these have been spelled out.Why will the Government not be honest?  Deputy Joe Higgins referred to the wealth tax and I will not repeat the point.  Why is it never complicated to attack the poor, vulnerable and least well off and why are we always told it is too complicated to tax the wealthy?  It is stated that while the latter approach might be fair, it is just not possible.  I do not understand this.  Perhaps the Minister of State could explain it to me.Could the Minister of State explain why the 10,000 highest earners in the State who, according to the Revenue Commissioners, earn an average of €500,000 per year, or €6 billion between them, paid less than €2 billion in tax?  This represents an effective tax rate of 29%.  Even if it were increased to 39% — I would be in favour of increasing it to at least 49% — it would yield €1 billion.  Is €250,000 or €300,000 per year not enough for these people?  Do they honestly believe it would be unfair to take from them the €160 million the Government is choosing to take from the poor and vulnerable?  Could they not afford it?  Could they not manage on €250,000 or €300,000 per year?  Is it that difficult to live on that money?  Could the Government not go after some of the former taoisigh and Ministers who have left the Oireachtas with annual earnings of €145,000, in spite of their not having reached retirement age?  This is unbelievable.  When David Cameron resigns, he will receive £32,000 as a former Prime Minister.  Two of our former Prime Ministers walk off with €145,000 each per year.  Why does the Government not go after them?  Why is it so difficult?  It is a question of whether the Government is committed to fairness or cynical bogus tactics to pull the wool over the eyes of the least well off and most vulnerable.I agreed with Deputy Mathews's analysis but his one problem is that he does not recognise that the troika and Government will not listen to him because they do not care.  They have made a cold, calculated decision that working people and the poor will pay for the crisis of the bondholders.
