RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State is contradicting everybody.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government on Committee Stage did not really seem to take on board the points Deputy Catherine Murphy and I made on Second Stage. There are two reasons to be concerned and oppose the legislation. We may have a chance to discuss one of these before debate on the Bill finishes today. The Government is rolling in two elements, one of which is an international treaty and the other is the merger of the RPII and the EPA. They should not be in the same Bill and I have a fundamental problem with such a process. I would probably support one of those elements but I do not really support the other. Radiological protection and ensuring we are adequately protected against radiation, whether natural or generated by the nuclear industry, is a very important business. It is not something that most people worry about much of the time, and I hope we never have to worry about it in a serious way. At any time there could be an accident and radon is an ongoing problem. The issue of potential nuclear accidents is serious, and we all might be running around asking who has the plan if anything serious was to happen. One remembers the major embarrassment for the last Government when it was discovered that the big plan consisted of giving out iodine tablets, staying indoors and hiding under a table. It was not very heartening stuff when we are dealing with something as dangerous as radiation, one of the more dangerous phenomena known to man. We must have a dedicated body for dealing with this issue and not one simply subsumed under the EPA, with no guarantee that its specificity on an issue of crucial importance will be maintained or respected in a new body. This amendment is really the minimum we could ask of the Government in order to allay such concerns.If the Minister of State is not willing to grant this, he should at least agree to a separate agency which will be responsible for this area and maintain all the current functions of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, RPII. If the Minister of State wanted to ensure the RPII is merged with, rather than liquidated and subsumed by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, he would accept this amendment and would have acknowledged its legitimacy on Committee Stage. He has failed to do that, which causes me concern, to say the least, about this Bill. I do not think we should be doing this. I do not see its value or the savings. When the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy O’Dowd, introduced the Bill on Second Stage, he was very vague about the savings this would achieve. There are no real savings but considerable costs have been incurred in preparing this merger. I heard a figure of €800,000 and the Minister of State has not identified anything close to that sum in savings to be achieved. This is decorative but potentially dangerous because a body we need to watch something important such as radiation and its potentially damaging effects could be endangered. I am interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say to allay our concerns. If he was taking those concerns seriously, concerns that the RPII has strongly indicated, he would accept this amendment. If he does not, I will be forced to vote against this Bill. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When I hear words like “efficiency” and “cost effectiveness”, I immediately get the jitters because they are often code for cuts. The notion of cost effectiveness is narrowly defined. It is cost-effective to the value of €260,000 in 2016, according to the Minister of State. This is a new figure that has jumped out since we asked about the savings on previous Stages. I would love to hear where this €260,000 will come from because it was not mentioned in the Minister of State’s Second Stage speech. Even if the annual saving is €260,000, what will it cost us if there is a serious accident and we are not prepared for it? What will it cost if in the meantime because of the pressures on the EPA staff and resources and so on, the “flexibility” of its structure means that pressure is put on it not to give the proper resources or focus to replacing the RPII’s independent single-minded focus on this very specific area of radiation threat, through a nuclear accident or radon?One cannot mess with these very serious matters. One cannot hope for the best or play fast and loose in this regard because the consequences of serious accidents are potentially deadly for large numbers of people. That is the thinking behind this amendment. The basis of our concern about this whole Bill is that we are talking about a very important area. We are not talking about any old area of the environment - we are talking about an absolutely lethal substance. That is why we are asking for these minimal guarantees. If the Minister of State cannot give them, and instead merely offers us some words, it will not be very convincing and the Government will be making a mistake.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What happens if it is now time to move the adjournment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are then running into Private Members' time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So we just adjourn the debate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not have adequate time because it is now Private Members' time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would be fine if I had three or four minutes but then I would be running into Private Members' time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have no desire to drag out this, but I would have needed more than 30 seconds.
