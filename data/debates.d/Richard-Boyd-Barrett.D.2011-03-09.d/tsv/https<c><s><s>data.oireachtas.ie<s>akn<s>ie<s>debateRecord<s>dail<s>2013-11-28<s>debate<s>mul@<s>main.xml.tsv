RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister knows, there is a major crisis affecting defined pension schemes across the country. Some 20% are in trouble.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My name is on the Order Paper. It was in the name of Deputy Pringle but it has been changed. There is a crisis affecting defined benefit pension schemes. We know about the current crisis in the ESB and Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company. We are also familiar with the circumstances of Waterford Glass and of approximately 160 other pension schemes. What will the Minister do about it? Will the pensions Bill sort out this crisis? The Minister made reference to the United Kingdom. In the United Kingdom, pensioners are guaranteed at least 90% of what they should get up to a maximum of £30,000. Will the Minister give the full level of protection to workers who have paid into pension schemes all their lives, or will she do the bare minimum? In particular, can restructuring occur on multiple occasions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One question Deputy Pringle wanted to ask was whether it will be possible under the Bill for a company to restructure a pension scheme more than once in circumstances where restructuring is allowed? Owing to a restructuring plan implemented by a company, could one lose 10% to 20% of what one expected and then lose the same again, perhaps on multiple occasions, if the under-funding problem persisted? In the framing of the Bill, will the Minister do the absolute minimum required by the European Union or will she do the maximum by really putting the priorities of workers and pensioners first in dealing with under-funded pension schemes? It seems she is acting for the minimum rather than the maximum.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can a company restructure on multiple occasions with the result that a scheme member would lose out not just once, but several times? The under-funding crisis is another legacy of the banks. One should remember that many of the funds are in trouble because of the banks or investments in banking shares that have now collapsed. Pension scheme members comprise another victim of the banking crisis. Many problems with pension funds could be sorted out if we diverted some of the €2.5 billion that is currently spent on tax breaks for private pensions, mostly for the genuinely premium gold-plated pensions of the super-rich or wealthiest in the country, to help with crises such as those in Waterford Glass, the ESB and other companies whose pension schemes are in trouble. In this way, we could actually resolve the problem whereby ordinary workers are being shafted. They are victims yet again of the banking crisis.

Owing to the tsunami of problems affecting the financial markets, pension funds in Ireland took a terrible hit. The Pensions Regulator has reported on how Irish pension funds were often over-invested in a particular field of investment, which included the Irish banks.
