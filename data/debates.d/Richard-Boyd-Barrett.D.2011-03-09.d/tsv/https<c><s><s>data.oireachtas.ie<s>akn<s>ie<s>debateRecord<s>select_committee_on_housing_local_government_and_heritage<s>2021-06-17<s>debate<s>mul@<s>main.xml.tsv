RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I missed Deputy Cian O'Callaghan's contribution but I suspect our amendment, No. 195, is in a similar vein in that we believe the LDA, rather than being a mechanism to open up the public land bank to private interests, should be moving in the exact opposite direction.It should aggressively seek to bring privately-owned land suitable for housing that is not being used, but is being hoarded and speculated on, into use. It should use aggressive compulsory purchase powers to take that land into use, force existing private owners to bring it into use or simply take it from them. Quite frankly, we need a body that is monitoring, like a hawk, the available zoned building land or, indeed, land that is not zoned but would be suitable for delivering public and affordable housing, and is pouncing on that land to ensure monopolistic control of the building land bank is not in the hands of a relatively small number of private owners, which is currently the situation. The logic behind amendment No. 195 is to insert the use of compulsory powers into the Bill as a key part of what the LDA should be doing. The amendment should probably include buildings as well as land. I might reconsider that for our amendment on Report Stage because I presume the Government will not agree with it. The way in which empty property in the hands of private owners is just sat on for years and years on end is, frankly, obscene. It is staring communities throughout the country in the face that existing property is being sat on, is empty and is derelict or whatever, just to wait to see the value of it appreciate and decide strategically when or if it will be developed. That just should not be allowed. We should have an agency that goes after that property and land aggressively, to bring it into use for public and affordable housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the last point about the role of the local authorities and the disposal of land, to be honest, the Minister is being somewhat disingenuous. If one takes Shanganagh, it was the non-elected executive that proposed the transfer of that site to the LDA. It was Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, the usual suspects, which supported it. We opposed that transfer because we had been campaigning for years for the council to build public and affordable housing on that site. I am not quite sure how the relationship between the Department and county managers and so on works. They are certainly not told what to do by the directly elected representatives. It was the non-elected executive's proposal to transfer the land to the LDA. That was because the policy of this Government and its predecessor wanted private finance and private investment involved in the development of public lands. I will not labour the point but it slowed the process. I remember Brendan Kenny explaining to the housing committee in the previous Dáil how, if the local authority built on its own land, there was one process for finance, planning and so on. With the Minister's proposal, there will be three processes. The evidence speaks for itself in my opinion. On the substantial issue of the amendment itself, does the Minister recognise that the problem of private owners hoarding land suitable for housing is a problem? Everybody else does. If the LDA is not going to be the agency to deal with that problem, who will deal with it? To me, that would have been one of the central purposes of setting up such an agency, as Deputy Cian O'Callaghan said, going right back to the sort of thinking behind the Kenny report. Does the Minister recognise it as a problem? If he does, why on earth would he delay this when we are setting up an agency that could have the power to actually do something to deal with the significant problem of land hoarding and activating privately owned land that could be used for housing to help us to address the housing crisis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 195:In page 40, between lines 26 and 27, to insert the following:“(4) The Agency may compulsorily purchase relevant private land suitable for public and affordable housing.”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to hear the Minister's rationale for giving himself the power to exempt LDA developments from Part V.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what it does. It explicitly does that. If the Minister wants to explain-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It gives the Minister the power-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister can explain it to me if he wants but as I read it, it gives him the power to exempt a development from Part V. Potentially, we could have no social housing on a LDA site.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like clarity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Section 73(2) states "The Government may, by order, at the request of the Minister, exempt relevant public land from the provisions of this Part where the land" and then gives a series of examples. The term "this Part" is the one where Part V is applicable, in the section above it. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is saying that the reference in section 73(1) "where applicable" refers not to Part V but to Part 9, is that what the Minister is saying?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I got it wrong, I am happy to admit it. The Minister is saying that this Bill does not empower him to get rid of the Part V requirement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not finished.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also wanted to make the more general point about social housing. The Minister said we will align the Bill on affordable housing with the LDA Bill and so on, that there will be a series of amendments to that effect. Will he clarify what "social housing" is? I refer to the eligibility criteria and particularly the income thresholds and what the Minister envisages. There is a problem in respect of the cohort of people who are eligible for social housing, for Part V and whatever proportion of LDA developments shall be social housing as against, for example, cost rental or affordable purchase. My fear and suspicion, given that the income thresholds have not risen for a decade, is that there is a concerted policy to make fewer and fewer people eligible for social housing and that consequently, the proportion of LDA developments that will be social housing will become smaller and smaller. Cost rental, which is essentially a higher rent of social housing will slowly but surely substitute for traditional social housing with a differential rent scheme. If we are to fully understand the potential implications of the LDA, we need to know who the Government envisages as being eligible for social housing in the future as against, for example, cost rental. It is a bit difficult for us to understand terms like "affordable" if we do not know the income cohort which the Government envisages will be eligible, compared with social housing. Otherwise we do not know what "social housing" means or who it will be for. I would like that clarified. With amendment No. 200, we are simply trying to prevent any transfer to anyone other than the local authority or approved housing bodies. We believe, as has been well rehearsed in this debate, that this would ensure the transfer and completion of ownership of the planning authority or to persons nominated by the planning authority and nobody else, that is, no disposal to any other interests.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 200:In page 46, to delete lines 4 to 16 and substitute the following:“(a) the building and transfer on completion, to the ownership of the planning authority, or to the ownership of persons nominated by the authority for the provision of public and affordable housing.”
