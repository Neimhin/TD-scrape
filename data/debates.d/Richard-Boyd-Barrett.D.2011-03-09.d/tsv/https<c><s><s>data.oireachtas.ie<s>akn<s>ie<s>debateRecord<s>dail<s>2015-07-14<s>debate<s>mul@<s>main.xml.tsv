RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tomorrow workers in Greece will commence a 24-hour general strike and there will be mass protests all over Greece against the shameful bullying by the troika and EU governments in attempting to shove another austerity package down the throats of the Greek people who will be protesting against the tragic capitulation of Alex Tsipras’ Government to the austerity agenda. How does the Minister respond to the allegation, made by the former Greek Finance Minister, Yanis Varoufakis, in the article in New Statesman published in the last day or two, that Ireland was one of what he described as the major opponents of the Greek Government in seeking a debt writedown and real relief from the austerity package the troika was trying to impose?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The so-called bailout is conditional on the acceptance of further pension cuts, savage spending cuts, VAT increases, €50 billion worth of further privatisations, more repossessions of homes and foreclosures on small businesses. This is in a country in which the level of poverty has increased by 98%, the child mortality rate has increased by 42%, pensions have been slashed by 45% and salaries have been cut by 40%. How can the Minister and his friends in the troika honestly say the Greek people must take more pain when they are being crushed? How does the Minister respond to the allegation from the former Greek finance Minister that Ireland, along with a few other countries, was foremost in insisting that Greece and its people must accept more vicious austerity or get no assistance from Europe? That is a shameful betrayal of people who have been crushed. Mr. Varoufakis says that the reason Ireland took this position was fear of political embarrassment if the Greek people got any relief on debt and austerity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister not actually mean that the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has assisted in what is effectively a coup d'état in Greece? There is a deliberate attempt by Chancellor Angela Merkel and the troika to split the Greek Government in order to ram more unconscionable austerity down the throats of people who are on their knees. Does the fact that there is going to be a general strike tomorrow not prove that Tsipras's Government, in its shameful capitulation, does not enjoy the support of the Greek people? They are on the streets yet again tomorrow because they cannot take it. Why has our Government sided with the euro bullies against the wishes and needs of the Greek people, instead of standing up for a Europe of democracy and solidarity? The European project as a notion of solidarity and co-operation is dead in the water. It has exposed itself now as a bullying, corporate, bank-dominated austerity juggernaut that cares nothing for democracy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am involved in organising a public meeting in Sallynoggin tonight where I expect large numbers of local residents to come and express their absolute fury and disbelief at a decision of two public bodies, Dublin Bus and the National Transport Authority, NTA. These bodies, which are the Government’s responsibility, have made proposals to slash bus services in the greater Dún Laoghaire area, affecting bus routes Nos. 7, 59, 63, 8, 111 and 45A. In particular, Sallynoggin will be devastated with the proposal to take the No. 7 out of the area altogether. Killiney Village and Mackintosh Park off Pottery Road are to lose the No. 59 bus service. The frequency of buses to Loughlinstown Park is to be substantially reduced. Blackrock Village will no longer have the No. 7 going through it. Significant numbers of residents in large community areas, particularly the elderly, the young, students and the disabled, are going to suffer severely as a result of these proposals if they are implemented. I do not want the Government to fob this of, claiming it is the NTA or Dublin Bus’s responsibility. These are bodies owned by the public and of which the Government is in charge. The NTA cannot be an excuse, like the Health Service Executive, for the Government to abdicate its responsibility. It is the Government’s cuts in subsidies to Dublin Bus that are forcing this agenda of privatisation of these services. Will the Government tell Dublin Bus and the NTA to get their hands off our local bus services? We need more, not fewer, buses through these areas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Dublin Bus is making €11 million in profits, carrying 4 million extra passengers and these numbers continue to rise. That means we need more, not fewer, buses. This is about profit, nothing more. For the Government, as the Minister of State has just done, to pass this off, claiming it has to do with the NTA and Dublin Bus, is nonsense. The NTA was set up by Fianna Fáil and continued by this Government. Owen Keegan, a Dublin city manager, and John Fitzgerald, a former city manager, are on the NTA board and are the Government’s appointees. We want them called to heel. It is this and the previous Governments’ decisions to cut subsidies to public transport in Dublin city from €85 million down to €60 million that has generated an artificial crisis in Dublin Bus services. This then has become the excuse for Owen Keegan, John Fitzgerald and other bodies to demand the reconfiguration of bus routes, meaning cuts. We lost the No. 46A through Monkstown Farm as a result of this process.Now we will lose the No. 7 services through Sallynoggin from Loughlinstown. Killiney village will be devastated without the No. 59, Mackintosh Park etc. Of course, several of these routes are also earmarked for privatisation. It is a set-up what is going on here. There will be fury about this, and it will not be only as it was in one isolated area in Monkstown Farm on the last occasion. This is across the whole of Dún Laoghaire. I ask the Minister to not fob this off. The Minister should intervene stating this is not acceptable. Dublin Bus is making profits. We have more passengers. We need more, not fewer, buses through those areas. The Minister should say, "No way", to these cuts.
