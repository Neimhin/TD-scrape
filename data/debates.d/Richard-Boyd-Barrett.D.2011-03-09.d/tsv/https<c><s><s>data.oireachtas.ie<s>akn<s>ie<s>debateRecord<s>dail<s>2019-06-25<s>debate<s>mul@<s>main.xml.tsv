RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also wish to speak about the NESC report on public transport. The Government's climate plan is pathetic when it comes to public transport. We need public transport anyway to deal with dire congestion. On many important bus routes, students and workers just cannot get on buses in the morning. In the context of a climate change emergency, the Government is doing nothing in response to the call by NESC, for example, for high quality and frequency of transport services. I will outline how bad it is. Both Bus Éireann and Dublin Bus have fewer buses in their fleets than they did in 2008, which is shocking. We are going backwards. In the same period bus fares have increased by 80%. The demands on the public transport fleet have significantly increased in the intervening period. We have fewer buses nationally and in Dublin, bus fares have increased and we have the lowest subsidies for public transport almost anywhere in Europe. This contrasts with, for example, Luxembourg which is now introducing free public transport. Dunkirk has already introduced free public transport as has Estonia. Oslo has made a dramatic shift to cheaper better public transport. Interestingly it is now moving against electric vehicles, which is the centrepiece of this Government's transport plan, because it is not working. Instead Oslo is moving towards a dramatic increase in investment in the quality, frequency and affordability of public transport. What does the Taoiseach have to say to that? In the last three budgets, we have proposed moving to free public transport, having subsidies for public transport at the level of the best in Europe and for a significant increase in the national and Dublin Bus fleet to improve the quality of bus services.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not happening.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government has claimed it is supportive of a mix of social and non-social housing. A mix of people with different family sizes and in different income brackets is a reasonable aspiration although the net effect has been effectively to prevent large-scale social and affordable housing developments on public land because they are tied up with convoluted formulas around social housing that never seem to get resolved. I put it to the Taoiseach that his stated aim of a mix of social and non-social housing is, in many cases, turning out to be something more akin to social cleansing or social apartheid. A report emerged today which stated that half of the counties in the country are unaffordable for first-time buyers. In those counties, and mine is one of them, people on low and middle incomes are being driven out. They are being cleansed from the area. These areas then only become places where very rich people can live. That is what is actually happening. There is a small number of developments where we are supposed to get a social mix on private developments with 10% social housing under Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000. That is not happening in a number of those cases, particularly and disgracefully in strategic housing developments which involved fast-track planning and were supposed to deal with the housing crisis. What is actually happening in a development in Dún Laoghaire is that an extra 60 houses will be built and no social housing. The law allowed for that through some convoluted arrangement with the developer.  In areas of high property value, social housing is being provided off-site so there is no social mix. The social housing is somewhere else because we could not have people on low incomes living in certain areas. Even in areas where that 10% is being provided, the social housing element is being segregated in separate blocks, usually with one or two-bedroom units and no family-sized units in many cases, and where the specifications of the social housing element are considerably lower than the houses built in the non-social part of the development. That is social apartheid, not social mix. It is institutionalising and underpinning segregation of people on the basis of their income levels. Does the Taoiseach think that is acceptable? What is he going to do about it? What is he going to do about the fact that strategic housing developments are, in some cases, not delivering any social housing whatsoever? Does the Taoiseach think that is acceptable?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We would have no problem submitting our plans.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The €700 million that according to this statement is available for additional expenditure in the coming budget is just not enough. The issue of the likely cost overruns in health has been pointed out. The Minister has questions to answer. The Christmas bonus was raised by Mr. Colm McCarthy at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight. We must also consider the possibility of a hard Brexit and the costs that could impose, the volatility of the corporation tax receipts and possible downturns. Those are all uncertainties. Whether we have a hard Brexit or any of these difficulties materialise, there are many areas where we need dramatic increases in investment and spending. Affordable housing and council housing are most obvious area. We are not doing enough. The Construction Industry Federation told the committee that the private sector will not meet the output targets the Government hopes it will hit, and the situation in public and affordable housing is just dire. The leakage of wastewater into Dublin Bay is another example of a creaking water infrastructure that needs dramatic increases in investment. If climate change targets are to be met and congestion dealt with, a dramatic increase in investment in public transport is needed to reduce fares, improve the quality of public transport and start new projects. We have a serious problem with childcare. We need to invest to provide affordable childcare on a greatly expanded basis. In the area of education, we need many more apprentices. That means investment in that area. The financial obstacles facing people going into apprenticeships and higher education must be removed. Particularly given our skills and labour shortages, any possible additional labour force participation needs to be activated. That means investment in areas such as education, apprenticeships, childcare and so on. Then there is the need for climate action and a range of areas where we need significantly increased investment and spending. Moreover, wage demands from health workers and others who have suffered pay restraint and pay cuts for the best part of a decade are legitimate and justified. We need to find money for everything.  Unlike other people, we are not hypocritical. We do not call for fiscal rectitude on one hand and lots of extra expenditure on the other, nor do we believe that extra investment and expenditure should be financed through additional borrowing. That is a dangerous game. We should not worsen the poor debt position. As the Minister will be aware, our question to him is why he does not look at other potential sources of revenue. The elephant in the room is now being discussed even in the United States, and by some very unlikely people. Some of the richest people in the US are talking about wealth taxes. Why do we not look at those taxing that revenue as a source of wealth? Employers' pay-related social insurance, PRSI, is at one of the lowest rates anywhere in Europe. We could tax financial transactions. Professor Stephen Kinsella was before our committee earlier. He said that the financial flows in and out of this country are astonishing. They are way out of proportion to an economy this size. The State should have a financial transactions tax, which could generate lots of revenue. The myriad tax loopholes that benefit property speculators and big multinationals should be examined. Why does the Government not look at redirecting some of those resources into key areas where investment is needed such as infrastructure, services and strategic industry? We need a more sustainable and diversified economy. The best buffer against uncertainties is not to have an economy that is so vulnerable to a small number of corporations and a couple of sectors. Why not look at those options? We need investment and money for services, but the Government never ever considers taxing wealth and profits, which have increased exponentially. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That leads on to the point I was making and the question for the Minister to answer. Given the possibility of a disorderly Brexit, uncertainties in other areas, the demands and requirements for public spending on a whole range of areas - I will not list them - is €700 million really enough? If, as I would suggest, it would be far preferable to have much more - I do not think anybody could dispute it would be preferable to do that - does the Minister not think it is time to look at raising extra sources of revenue from areas that Fine Gael has been unwilling to look at previously? I cited the example of Professor Stephen Kinsella. He said that when he first thought about financial transactions tax, for which we have been advocating for a long time, he did not like the idea of it. He has now come around. He has now said, given the staggering scale of financial flows into and out of this country, that this is a form of behaviour we need to tax both to constrain it and as a potential source of revenue. That is just one example. I also mentioned employer's PRSI and closing some of the big corporation tax loopholes, particularly those benefiting the big multinationals. Labour skills shortages are developing as we near full employment. I would argue that there is considerable underemployment in sectors of the economy which could help deal with that problem. However, in order to deal with it we need to do something to remove financial obstacles to getting into education, further education, postgraduate education and so on. We need to do something about the cost of childcare. We need to take measures which will cost money but actually increase labour market participation to address this very serious problem for the economy. Does the Minister accept that we need investment in those areas?
