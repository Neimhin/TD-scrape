RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Unlike the witnesses, I am an opponent of SARP. It is difficult for many people to swallow the fact that these extremely highly-paid executives get this tax relief. Given that there are so many other tax reliefs available, and that such large profits are being made by the corporations coming in here, what evidence do the witnesses have that there would be any less investment by these companies if we removed SARP? It seems like icing on a very big cake for people who are already making a lot of money and being very well paid. I would be interested in the witnesses' comments on that. I refer to the research and development tax credit. We all want to see research and development, but as Ms Gunnell indicated, the small and medium enterprises are not really benefiting from it. They do not have the necessary resources or research and development departments, and they are fearful, from what Ms Gunnell said, of getting it. Who is getting it? I think we all know the answer to that. It is now worth €700 million, which is not an insubstantial figure, and is going to the usual suspects - the big multinational corporations, such as Google, Facebook, or pharmaceutical companies - which are also benefiting from a whole range of other tax reliefs, credits and allowances. If we want to have indigenous research and development and to encourage the SME sector, particularly in the context of something like climate change, would €700 million or even a fraction of that not be better targeted at encouraging indigenous research and development by SMEs or public universities? Universities were mentioned, but they are currently dependent on whether a big multinational wants to outsource something to them.Surely, there is a case for redirecting some or all of that money into public universities to increase their research and development capacities, which are more likely to be focused on what might be good for the country or help to advance renewable energy, instead of assisting someone to come up with the iPhone 11 or a new app that is only slightly different from a previous app. Would it be better to redirect that money to target things that are a priority for us?  Ms Gunnell kept her comments on the film relief quite brief and did not pass any judgment on it. I do not know how familiar she is with it. How can one test its effectiveness? The conditions attached to it are that it will provide quality employment and training and contribute to Irish cultural expression and endeavour. Is it achieving those goals? We were told by members of the film industry who were lobbying for it that we were getting 17,000 good jobs for it and so on. However, when the Department of Finance looked into the relief, it found that it led to far fewer jobs, a total of approximately 2,000. Some people maintain that the 2,000 jobs are completely precarious and that those employed in them have almost no rights. It is not quality employment and there is no proper training structure. At a minimum, we need a comparison of the cultural output since that type of relief was brought in and, for example, that under previous methods of financing the film industry. I am not convinced that the output in terms of the criteria set out in the relief has been better over the past ten years than was previously the case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will return to the issue of research and development and direct expenditure by universities, grants or whatever else, as opposed to research and development tax relief. Would our guests accept that it is going to a relatively small number of private corporations? Do they know what the comparison is between how much is going in direct expenditure as against the approximately €700 million in tax credits, an amount which has risen dramatically in the past while? That is the thing at which we have to look. Which is getting better results for us? How much is going in tax relief to a relatively small group as against how much is going in direct expenditure and what is it giving us? Which would be better and how would the money be better spent? It is a choice between whether we should give more in tax relief and direct expenditure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I had not read the figures helpfully provided by our secretariat on the beneficiaries, their numbers and the salary range.It would shock many people to learn that a small but significant number of incredibly well-paid individuals are paying less tax than they are. The salary ranges about which we are talking are morally shocking. It is worth noting that 359 people who have incomes of between €75,000 and €150,000 are getting tax breaks and 160 people who earn between €150,000 and €225,000 are paying less income tax than normal workers. Some 79 people who earn between €225,000 and €300,000, 56 who earn between €300,000 and €375,000, 95 who earn between €375,000 and €675,000, 26 who earn between €675,000 and €1 million a year, 14 who earn between €1 million and €3 million a year and four who earn between €3 million and €10 million a year are also getting tax breaks which allow them to pay proportionately less tax than average workers. That is unbelievable. Does Ms Gunnell believe there is a moral problem with that? I did not even know that anybody could earn between €3 million and €10 million in salary a year. It is staggering and beyond belief; it is morally quite obscene. Does Ms Gunnell believe there is any moral problem with it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the amount of tax relief. That is the tax break.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A person can be given three times the average industrial wage in tax relief.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will make one additional brief comment. That is morally repugnant. Aside from the morality, Ms Gunnell is making a pragmatic argument that these people would not come here otherwise. She has mentioned other jurisdictions with which we are competing and which have similar tax break schemes for these incredibly well-paid people. Has the Irish Tax Institute carried out a comparison with countries that do not have such tax breaks for incredibly well-paid people which shows definitively that they do less well in getting skilled people into the various sectors where they are needed? The only way we could judge the matter at that level and in the terms by which Ms Gunnell is defending itand I find those figures unacceptable at almost any levelis to determine whether countries which do not provide these tax breaks have problems in getting access to necessary skills. The only way to sustain that argument is to show that a given jurisdiction which does not have a special assignee relief programme providing these tax breaks has real problems in getting these people in.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Ms Gunnell believe it is a relevant question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Ms Gunnell.
