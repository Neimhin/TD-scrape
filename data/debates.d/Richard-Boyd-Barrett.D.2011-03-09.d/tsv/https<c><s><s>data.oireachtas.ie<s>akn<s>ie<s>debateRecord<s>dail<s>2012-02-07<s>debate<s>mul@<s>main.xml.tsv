RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps we could also deal at this point with Question No. 9.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to return to the financial transactions tax.  This is one of the instances in which people from the United Left Alliance have a very different view from the political establishment on both sides of the House.  I am amazed that in a situation where Europe faces its gravest economic crisis since the 1930s and this country faces its gravest economic crisis in its history - we all know the crisis was caused by the anarchic casino-like behaviour of the financial markets - the strategy of the Government, with Mr. David Cameron's Government, is to block a tiny measure to regulate and rein in these same financial markets that have wrecked the European economy.  The excuse that we cannot do it unless everybody else in the world does it also is pathetic because it is a recipe for never doing it, as the Taoiseach and Mr. Cameron well know.I find it amazing that the Taoiseach, like the previous Government, has rammed poisonous destructive austerity down the throats of the people, ordinary citizens who bear no responsibility for the economic crisis, and says he is being made do it by the European Union and the troika.  However, when one half decent proposal comes from the European Union, that we should put a tiny tax on the crazed financial markets that caused the crisis, we cannot do it because it is too difficult and would wreck the economy.  We can wreck the lives of working people, force hundreds of thousands into mass unemployment, send tens of thousands abroad by way of forced emigration, but we cannot put a tiny tax on the financial institutions which wrecked the economy, as well as the entire European economy.How will we ever have a financial transactions tax if this is the attitude?  The previous Government which bankrupted the country made similar arguments about the property sector; it called on us to look at the employment created in property development and the stamp duty received and stated it could not possibly do anything to dampen the sector because of the economy's dependency on it.  It seems the Taoiseach wants to do the same with the financial services sector.  This is very shortsighted.  Any short-term advantage the Taoiseach or Mr. Cameron may think they will get from-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All other speakers were allowed to continue and I am nearly finished.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put it to the Taoiseach and ask him to respond-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Leaders' Questions ran over time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the case that any perceived short-term advantage - the Government has not given any statistics or figures to back up the assertion that jobs will be lost in the Irish financial services sector - by essentially blocking the imposition of a financial transactions tax on the financial markets in Europe will amount ot a pyrrhic victory because it will make the position more volatile?  It is inevitable there will be further shocks on the international financial markets and we will be hardest hit, along with Britain, because we will have failed to put a tax on the institutions and diversify and sustain the economy, which is what we desperately need to do, by getting some money back and investing it in economic, industrial and manufacturing activity that could provide jobs and a sustainable economic future instead of riding on the backs of the anarchic financial markets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach responded to Deputy Martin-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and mine was a supplementary on his response to Deputy Martin.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No one answered that question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is because he agrees with the Taoiseach.  That is why it is a valid question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach intend joining the rest of Europe in doing it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So there will never be a financial transaction tax here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Wait until it goes back.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the present Government and its predecessor have sought to justify Ireland's participation in these battle groups, they try to present the case as though Ireland is doing something that complies with the military neutrality for which this State stands and that we are merely involving ourselves in what essentially are benign humanitarian undertakings and that there is nothing to worry about.  However, as already has been mentioned, the game is given away by the term "battle groups".  The Government can try to put whatever spin it wishes on that but it speaks for itself.  Battle groups are battle groups and they are being prepared, trained and equipped for battle.  Moreover, over the years, those who have promoted the increasing militarisation of the European Union and the development of what is an embryonic European army have been clear in some of their statements as to what is the real agenda.  I believe it was Romano Prodi who spoke of the need to be able to fight the resource wars of the 21st century.  It does not get more explicit than that.  Even the Minister's former party leader referred to the new tasks these battle groups would be allowed to undertake and pointed to the fact that peacemaking and crisis management by combat forces constitutes war by another name.  If one makes peace using military force, one is making war.  All sides in a war claim their intent is peace but pursuing peace through military means is peace on one's own terms and is another name for war.  This is what these battle groups are about and this is what the major promoters of the battle groups envisage as the ultimate intention.If one considers the European Defence Agency's vision documents and various position papers over the years, which are all part of the growing military-industrial complex that is being promoted and pushed within the European Union, they also are highly explicit about what it considers to be a role for the European military forces and-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister obviously has not read the documents to which I refer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Minister read the European Defence Agency's vision documents?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Minister read them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, the Minister is-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is totally wrong there.  I am 100% on the side of the people fighting for democracy against the brutal Assad dictatorship and have joined with-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister just cannot resist it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Funnily enough, only the other week we had a meeting at Liberty Hall, with Syrians involved, talking about how we supported the Syrian uprising against the Assad dictatorship.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The difference is that we are consistent in our support of the democratic and revolutionary forces across the Middle East whereas the Minister is selective.  While he claims he supports them in Syria, he is not so quick to support them in Palestine or in Bahrain, and for that matter he is not so quick to say anything about how the generals are crushing the democratic movement in Egypt right now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is selective because the real agenda behind his interventions in such situations, as well as the interventions of the European Union and United States, is to pursue their interests and their agenda and not the interest of the people of the aforementioned countries.  This is what is of concern to me.In addition, the financial cost of this measure is extraordinary.  The Minister is closing down the barracks of soldiers and their families in the face of significant opposition from those soldiers and their families.  He states it is necessary to do this for financial reasons because of the troika and all the rest, but yet we can afford to spend more.  When Ireland participated in the Nordic battle group, I understand it cost €850 million and involved 100 soldiers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise; the cost was €850,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not believe we should participate in battle groups.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I believe Ireland should participate in genuine humanitarian missions but battle groups are not designed or equipped for this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister inform the House with regard to the equipment the battle group will be using?  Will there be tanks involved?  If so, will they be used for humanitarian purposes?  How much is our involvement with the battle group going to cost?  From where will the extra money come?  Barracks in this country are being closed and it is now intended to deploy an additional 75 soldiers-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----to serve with the new European army, which the Minister obviously supports.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is an amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What?  Since when?  Will somebody explain this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just want clarification on what the Leas-Cheann Comhairle said.  It is a regular occurrence in the Chamber that the Government deletes the entirety of a Private Members' motion and replaces it with something that completely negates the motion as tabled by the Opposition and this is allowed consistently.  However, in this case we are being told one is not allowed do this.  I ask for clarification on where the consistency is in the application of this rule.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, I also wish to point out the thrust of the Bill purports to be some level of democratic reform of the institution of the IMF.  My amendment proposes to achieve exactly the same end, namely, democratic reform of the IMF, through different means.  It replaces the various measures proposed in the draft Bill with another measure designed precisely to achieve democratic reform of the IMF.  Why, therefore, is it out of order?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just want an explanation as why it is out of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government, in my opinion, has been extremely dishonest in how it has presented the Bill.  On Second and Committee Stages and whenever it has commented on the Bill, it has suggested it is purely a technical Bill.  It is not a technical Bill.  Its measures arise out of an intensely political response by the IMF to a crisis of legitimacy it has suffered since its disastrous policies in the Asian crisis at the end of the 1990s produced a huge reaction against the IMF by many of the Asian countries.  As it had done in many Third World countries previously, the IMF slavishly enforced neoliberal dogma as a response to the Asian crisis, propelling Asia into a very serious recession by imposing its economic shock therapy on Asian countries, specifically lifting capital controls leading to a massive flight of money out of Asia which turned a crisis into a deep recession.  The result was that many of those Asian countries boycotted the IMF, and the IMF was on the brink of falling apart.  That produced a political rather than a technical debate within the IMF on the need to rebuild its legitimacy and credibility on the international stage or face extinction.  There was a long period of debate, and gatherings took place in which the way they intended to address the deeply undemocratic nature of the IMF and its failing legitimacy was discussed.  The thrust of the criticisms of the IMF at that time was that it was dominated entirely by the United States, the big European powers and the big industrial powers in the world such that the United States, for example, with 17% of the votes within the IMF, could block any proposal even if it was supported by all the remaining states because 85% of votes is needed to get a proposal through in the IMF.  That has not changed.This Bill, and these so-called reforms, purport to be recalibrating the IMF in a reformist or more democratic direction but it leaves the US veto intact and a situation where the 27 industrialised nations still have more than 60% of the votes in the IMF and completely dominate it.  That contrasts with the poorest countries that far out-number the industrialised countries and have far bigger populations.  In many cases their resources fuel the economy of the industrialised nations but are plundered in many cases by those industrial nations with the assistance of the IMF enforcing its structural adjustment programmes and its dogma about gearing up economies for export in the global markets that have devastated those countries.  Their dominance, which is due to the undemocratic governance structures of the IMF, has meant they have been able to ram that stuff down the throats of African, Latin American and Asian countries.  There was a huge reaction against that because of the Asian crisis.  That was most dramatically seen through the 1990s and the early 2000s in the big demonstrations in Seattle and the anti-globalisation movement, which caused a major crisis of legitimacy for the IMF, and this is what they come up with - nothing.Our Government is rubber stamping what is a con job, and it is not just left wingers or activists who are saying that.  The Brookings Institution, a right wing think tank in the United States, described these so-called reforms as follows:a decades-old building that is in need of major repairs and renovation.  The plumbing is ancient and needs updating.  The roof is leaking in places.  Termites have been found in the joists in the basement.  Yet the building owners recommend, as a first step in renovation, merely a fresh coat of paint in the entrance hallway and the fixing of some broken glass panes in the windows facing the street.In other words, it is a purely cosmetic exercise with no attempt to address the substantial and deep democratic deficit within the IMF that allows it to be dominated by the United States and the major powers.It is also worth putting on record again what Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize winning economist, said about the IMF.  He stated:When the IMF arrives in a country, they are interested in only one thing.  How do we make sure the banks and financial institutions are paid? … It is the IMF that keeps the [financial] speculators in business.  They're not interested in development, or what helps a country to get out of poverty.That is what Stiglitz said and that is the reality.  Our Government is giving succour to this institution and is trying to give it the stamp of renewed legitimacy precisely at a time when its entire structures and modus operandi should be challenged in the most fundamental way.In terms of the IMF's policies and the undemocratic nature of that institution, which remains unchanged, it is now trying to apply its witchcraft in this country and in Greece, with devastating consequences.  This is a time when we should have a serious debate about the nature of the IMF.  Of course we need a global financial institution that is genuinely acting in the interests of all states and the global economy but that is not what the IMF is; it is a creature of the United States and the big industrial powers which are trying to gain advantage from the misery of others.  That is the reason it is vitally important to oppose this Bill and call for real democratic reform of the IMF and the other global financial institutions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, will the names of those Members who opposed the Bill be recorded?
