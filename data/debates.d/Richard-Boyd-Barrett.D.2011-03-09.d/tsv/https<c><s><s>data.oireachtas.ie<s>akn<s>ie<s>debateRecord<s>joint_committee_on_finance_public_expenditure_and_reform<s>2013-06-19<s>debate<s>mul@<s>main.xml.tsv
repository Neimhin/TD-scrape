RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Government's decision to abandon the plan to sell off the Coillte harvesting rights. This is a stunning victory for people power and the campaign of public protest against the plan to sell off our public forests. It is a pity that members of the Minister's own party, who are chuckling, seem to have such contempt for the public's view on this issue-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a tremendous victory for people power and the protest campaign against the plan to sell off the forests. It is also a victory for common sense. It indicates that the Government is listening to people, which is a positive development. The Minister has stated that it is not now an appropriate time to sell off the harvesting rights of Coillte. Will he assure the committee and the public - who have expressed their opposition to any plan to sell in any part our public forests - that there will be no future efforts to sell off any part of our public forests? Will he agree there is no appropriate time to sell off what is an absolutely precious cultural, national and economic asset?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My time is short and I have heard the Minister's point before. Is the Minister saying that he is still holding out the possibility of selling off the harvesting rights at some point in the future?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A "Yes" or "No" answer would be helpful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the contrary, the Minister is confusing the issues. I asked about the harvesting rights and the Minister spoke about selling trees. We all know Coillte sells trees and plants replacements. Any benefit or profit that is derived from that sale comes back to the State and to a State-owned company. The issue is that the Minister had proposed to sell off the harvesting rights to private enterprise. What I want to know is whether the Minister can give us a firm assurance that it is completely off the agenda to sell off at any point, now or in the future, Coillte's harvesting rights in Ireland's public forests, and whether he will commit to retaining the harvesting rights to Ireland's public forests in public ownership in perpetuity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is slightly dancing around the question. If I am not getting an answer, so be it. I do not believe, and neither does the public, that the harvesting rights or any aspect of our public forestry should be sold now or at any point in the future, not just because it is a valuable economic asset but because it is part of our national and cultural heritage. It is simply not for sale. Does the Minister subscribe to that view - which I think is the majority view in this country - that our forests or the harvesting rights to them are not for sale, now or at any time in the future?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a straightforward question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The land will be retained in public ownership and any profits generated will come back to the State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Excuse me, Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I started off by welcoming the fact that the Minister has abandoned the Government's plan to sell off Coillte's harvesting rights. I take it as a victory for people power.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, it is a victory for people power. The Minister despises people power but I consider it quite important.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is utterly dismissive of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister utterly dismisses the impact of people power in this instance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He shook his head and said it had no impact.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister seems entirely dismissive of the impact of public opposition to his previous commitment to sell off the harvesting rights. People in this county do not believe that any form of privatisation of any aspect of Ireland's public forestry is acceptable, because it will lead to pressure on that amenity, which is a precious national asset, as a whole. I was hoping for an assurance from the Minister that the Government has fully abandoned any plan to privatise or sell off any part of the public forestry. That is what I am seeking and what the public would like to hear.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They were not elected on a platform of selling off our forests.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not annoyed-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The situation is that the Minister is still holding open the possibility for privatisation but his plans in that regard have been stopped for now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is absolutely clear from what he said. However, we shall leave it at that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Chairman, the Minister is cutting across me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In regard to the potential sale of other State assets, I would make the same argument. Does the Minister agree that selling off the profitable parts of Bord Gáis, for example, to an entity such as Blackstone, the United States investment fund which I understand has expressed an interest in purchasing them, for the rumoured price tag of €1 billion, will inevitably put pressure on the remainder of that company's operations? Why would we sell off the profitable parts of a company which is currently in public ownership, leaving us with the parts that are costly to maintain? Surely that is a recipe for privatisation further down the road?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree that the deficit of jobs is the greatest problem for our economy, but I do not see how selling off profitable parts of State enterprises will create jobs. In fact, doing so will merely put pressure on what is left of the company in public ownership to be privatised. That was one of the reasons for my opposition to the sale of Coillte's harvesting rights, and the same danger arises in respect of Bord Gáis and ESB. After selling off the profitable bits, what is left will invariably come under greater pressure further down the road. I have a final question. The cost of energy is a major burden for consumers and the State as a whole. Bord Gáis Energy produces wind energy, has a considerable development portfolio and has wind energy assets currently under construction. How can it be a good idea for the State to sell off the ability to produce energy? Surely having the ability to produce our own energy is the way to exercise some degree of control over prices? If we sufficiently develop our wind energy capacity, we will have access to cheaper electricity for citizens. It is a question of control of the production of energy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said "profitable", not "strategic".
