RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the Public Gallery we have three groups of tenants comprising more than 100 families and individuals facing eviction at the hands of vulture funds. One group is from the constituency of the Minister. They reside in Grove Park, South Richmond Street and Rosedale Terrace. Val Issuer DAC, a vulture fund, is trying to evict them. Another group is from my area. They reside in St. Helen's Court in Dún Laoghaire and are facing the fourth attempt the vulture fund has made over the past two years to exploit loopholes regarding sale or substantial refurbishment to evict them. The other group comprises approximately 50 families residing at Emmet Lodge, Emmet Manor and Emmet Court in Inchicore who face eviction by Mill Street Projects Limited, which is, interestingly, the same group trying to evict the people in Dún Laoghaire.What will the Minister do to stop these vulture funds evicting these people into homelessness?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All three of these cases demonstrate that the Minister's legislation is riddled with loopholes for unscrupulous vulture funds, which lack any compassion or humanity. The Minister's laws make assumptions about landlords - and I am sure there are many individual landlords out there who care about their tenants and have a scintilla of compassion or humanity - but these three cases demonstrate that there are vulture funds that do not want to be landlords, do not give a damn about tenants and do not care about making people homeless. They just see the property as an asset they can sweat and the best way to sweat it is to evict people, exploiting loopholes, particularly the loophole around substantial refurbishment, the loopholes around sale or, in the case of Dún Laoghaire where there are 11 tenants, they will move to evict eight and will try to evict the other three a little bit further down the line because of the Tyrrelstown amendment. We need a ban on evictions on the grounds of sale. We need a tightening up of the issue of refurbishment so that it cannot be used to justify evictions and we need the passing of the anti-evictions Bill 2018, which was passed by the majority of this Dáil but which the Minister is blocking, which would prevent many of these evictions. Does the Minister recognise there is a problem? Will he address it in order to help these people avoid homelessness?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The tax breaks the Government has given these people and the meetings that were held in 2013 with Deputy Noonan who invited them in have created the conditions in which these vultures are operating. I repeat that the measures mentioned by the Minister do not address the problems that are faced by these people. It is no good for the Minister to say he is independent of the RTB. The Government proposed the legislation which is failing to protect these tenants. We have proposed alternatives, such as the anti-evictions Bill 2018, as have other Opposition parties, to close down these loopholes. The Government resists these efforts for reasons I do not understand when it is as clear as day that these vultures do not care about tenants. They are not even interested in being landlords. They are buying property to evict people and then to flip it on because the asset will have an increased value. That is what they are doing. Society and the tenants are paying the price because they will end up in homeless services because the Minister failed to address the problem. Will the Minister address the problem or will this continue to happen? What does the Minister have to say to the people in the Visitors Gallery who are faced with this situation? What are they supposed to do?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They have found a way around it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Change the law.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This morning I brought three different groups of tenants into the Public Gallery before addressing a question to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Murphy. All three groups face evictions by ruthless vulture funds that have absolutely no concern for their welfare but seek to evict them in order to drive up the value of the property assets they have purchased. More than 100 individuals and families, some in Inchicore, some in Dublin 6, the Minister's own constituency, and some in my constituency, Dún Laoghaire, face evictions at the hands of these vulture funds. All the funds are using loopholes in the residential tenancies legislation in order to justify or execute these attempted evictions, loopholes which we in the Opposition have repeatedly pointed out would be and are being used by vulture funds to evict people. The loopholes relate to substantial refurbishment of property and sale of property. The latest case concerns the Dún Laoghaire residents, who face the fourth separate effort by two different vulture funds to have them evicted in the past two years. This time they think it will succeed because they have found another loophole to get around the so-called Tyrrelstown amendment, which restricts mass evictions in cases of ten or more tenants. What do these vulture funds do? They evict eight of the 11 tenants and then, in nine months' time, they can evict the other three. There used to be 21 tenants in the properties affected, but slowly the vulture funds have whittled their numbers down through insecurity, fear and anxiety. The numbers go down as the vulture funds try to get them all out. Now 50 families on Richmond Street and Grove Park, in Dublin 6, face the same, as do residents of three blocks of apartments, Emmet Manor, Emmet Court and Emmet Lodge, in Inchicore. I asked the Minister for Housing what he would do to stop these ruthless, inhuman vulture funds - that is what they are. Let us be clear about what is at stake. They are trying to do one thing and one thing only: make people homeless to drive up the value of the assets and make profit. They do not want to be landlords and they do not care about the tenants or the kids. They just want to drive up the value of the assets. What will the Government do about this? We have put before the Government Bills to amend the Constitution to enshrine the right to housing and we have seen the House pass the Solidarity-People Before Profit anti-evictions Bill, which the Government blocks, to prevent evictions in these kinds of cases, but still the Government does nothing. It is protecting these vultures and giving them tax breaks. Michael Noonan invited them in in 2013 with a whole series of meetings and they are ruthlessly exploiting the housing crisis and inflicting misery on hundreds of families. What will the Taoiseach do?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said "attempted evictions".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Rent increases of 4% per year on top of already unaffordable rents are not doing much to control rents. They are completely out of control and beyond the vast majority of workers' ability to pay. The failure of all the measures the Taoiseach cited to address the threat of vulture funds trying to evict people is very evident in the case of St. Helen's Court, Dún Laoghaire, as I mentioned. Two different vulture funds - one flipped the property to the other - have attempted four times to try to evict the people living there. When they keep doing this it has an attrition effect and it is absolutely clear that the people behind these funds have no interest in having tenants. They have succeeded. In that block there are now ten empty units sitting there. The Government should instruct Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to use compulsory purchase powers to take over those units. Otherwise, the vulture funds will eventually drive the tenants out, as they have already driven out ten. More to the point, the Government should close the loopholes in the law that allow these vulture funds to do this continually, but the Government is not doing so. The vulture funds find new loopholes because the Government still allows sale or refurbishment as grounds for attempted eviction. Another way around this is that they refurbish the property but change its fundamental character such that they cannot offer it back to the tenant because it is a different type of property. That is what they are doing. I ask in the first instance that the Taoiseach gets the Minister to intervene to ensure that the local authorities-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----secure those properties to prevent the eviction, change the loopholes in order that one cannot evict on the grounds of sale, close down the other loopholes and introduce a constitutional right to housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is how we will address these vulture funds treating tenants in this way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ten of them are gone.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sell the properties with the tenant.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will start by paying tribute to the independent beef farmers and the Beef Plan Movement for their magnificent campaign over recent weeks and over the course of the summer. They have highlighted the absolutely intolerable and unacceptable levels of income which they are expected to endure despite producing a beef product of extremely high quality. I am shocked by these income levels. Until I met representatives of the Beef Plan Movement before the summer, I did not know that anybody working to produce such a product could be expected to survive on such a level of income. It is absolutely shocking. Average incomes are €12,000 and many are on €10,000 or €8,000 a year. It is a scandal. From what I can see having heard from them, their scepticism and mistrust regarding the good faith of the beef barons, processors and retailers and some of the governmental agencies and bodies that are supposed to be trying to address this issue are perfectly understandable. I am not saying that any of the Fianna Fáil Deputies present is saying it, but there is a narrative floating around to the effect that all this would be sorted if farmers just pulled back from the gate. From what I understand, they do not want to be there. They have been forced to the gate, and they are staying there because they do not trust the processors, retailers and various agencies of Government to ensure their interests. The key is the base price, which has decreased. One of the farmers I spoke to just before entering the Chamber told me of losses of between €200 to €250 per animal over the past couple of years. Contrary to what has been suggested in some of the discourse, retail beef prices have actually increased in some parts of Europe during the period in question. Farmers are asking a simple question - if what they are getting is going down while retail beef prices are increasing, where is the money going? They conclude that it is going into the hands of the beef processors, who control the price and the market, and the retailers, all of whom are making large profits. One does not have to be a rocket scientist to see that. Goodman's various companies have seen €175 million in profits. Frankly, I am amazed. One of the first issues that I ever got involved in was protesting around the issues that led to the beef tribunal - export credit insurance, rotten beef to Iraq and so on. It is amazing that some of those involved are still around, controlling the beef sector, making massive profits and, as we recently discovered, routing quite an amount of those profits through Luxembourg, a tax haven. In effect, they are a cartel controlling the industry and the prices while beef farmers are on an abysmal income. Look at the large retailers in this country. We do not even know how much profit Tesco makes, as it does not declare its Irish profits, but it is making lots of money. Aldi, McDonald's and so on are making a great deal of money. The answer to the question about where the money is going is that it is going to them. One of the questions I was requested to ask concerned the exceptional aid scheme. Will the Minister of State assure us that it is not benefitting these companies? Is it going to the farmers who are struggling? They want to know because they are suspicious. Just like CAP, it is shocking that these companies, which are making that level of profit and funnelling profits through tax havens and so on, are getting CAP payments when the small producer is struggling to survive. There is a suspicion among beef farmers that this entire situation has been engineered and the companies want to shut down many of the small beef producers and move things elsewhere. Hence the kerfuffle about the talk of Bord Bia giving quality assurance to plants in the North and, apparently, the rest of the UK for slaughtering Irish cattle, since doing so might work better for the beef processors if there is a no-deal Brexit because tariffs on live cattle exports are much less than on the manufactured product. If cattle are sent over the Border to be slaughtered in the North, lower tariffs will be applied and Irish products will be sold into Britain, where 50% of our market lies. Is this all being engineered by our friends in the cartel to drive the small producer out of business completely? Historically, the trajectory of farming, rural economies and so on has been one of centralisation, the creation of monopolies and the destruction of the small producer. We used to call this "enclosures". That is what happens. Will serious action be taken to protect the small producer? Will supports, subsidies, exceptional aid schemes and so on be directed so as to ensure incomes, fairness and transparency around prices, where the money is going, who is making the profit and so on? The meat industry cartel people do not want to own up to that, but the facts seem to speak for themselves. As others have alluded to, beef farmers just want to be told by the producer organisations or the processors that there will be a minimum price of €3.80 per kilo. There would be nothing illegal if the processors said it. They set the price anyway - let us be honest. If the processors said that they would give farmers a minimum of €3.80 per kilo, this situation could be resolved. Look at the profits that Larry Goodman is making. He can afford it. In terms of the narrative around this situation, that is where the Government's pressure should be directed. These farmers do not want to be out on the picket line, but they do not trust the big players, the people who control the market or the agencies. I understand that there was a kerfuffle at the ploughing championships because people felt that Bord Bia giving quality assurance to plants in the North and so on was part of a stitch-up of producers in response to the protests of recent weeks. I stand with the farmers. The onus is on the large processors and retailers that are making lots of money and on the Government to ensure that farmers get a fair price and fair incomes for the work they do and the incredible and important role they play in holding rural Ireland together and maintaining the Irish rural economy. Let us show them some respect.
