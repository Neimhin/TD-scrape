RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As was mentioned and as the whole country knows, teachers and gardaí have felt forced to embark on a significant campaign of industrial action over the next few weeks in pursuit of fairness in respect of pay. There will also be mass meetings of nurses over the coming couple of weeks to discuss pay issues. One of the several things at the heart of this looming industrial action is the anger and frustration felt by teachers, gardaí and, increasingly, by nurses over the issue of equality of pay. The call was clearly articulated last Thursday by the ASTI, in a demonstration in which I participated outside the gates of this House, when young and older teachers stood together demanding equal pay for equal work. It is a basic and simple principle.I was struck by the sight of newly qualified and new entrant teachers explaining how angry and frustrated they were after coming out of college, getting their qualifications, in some cases at very high levels, and getting paid €6,000, €7,000 or €8,000 less than a teacher with the same qualifications working in the same school just because they had entered service after 2011. Will the Taoiseach accept that such inequality in pay is unacceptable and that it breaches the most fundamental principle of treating people equally? In the 1970s, we got equal pay for women, which did not exist previously, and nobody would dare to suggest we should have anything less than equal pay for men and women. We have equality legislation which outlaws discrimination against people on pretty much any basis. Is it not in line with the fundamental principle of equality that teachers, nurses and gardaí should get the same pay for doing the same work? Will the Taoiseach commit to re-establishing that equality and ending the pay apartheid which is one of the burning issues angering teachers, nurses and gardaí and which is forcing many young people who might go into those professions to leave this country because the Taoiseach continues to allow that discrimination against them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The only groups of workers who have balloted on this issue are the ASTI and the Garda representative unions.The Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland, ASTI, and the gardaí have democratically made a decision and, I suspect, if it was put to the rank and file of the Teachers Union of Ireland, TUI, the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, and to the nurses, we might have a different response. The young teachers at that rally were not political or radical people. There were just young teachers and they have thought about this deeply. They do not want to be on strike but they are raging about the question of inequality. The Taoiseach referenced figures of increases, with which I am well familiar, but they are not equality. That is the point. It was clear from those young teachers that they want equality. I asked the Taoiseach if he accepted that this pay inequality, pay apartheid and discrimination against young people coming into this profession simply because they happen to come into it after 2011 is unacceptable and if he accepted that it must be done away with. That is what they believe. It is pay apartheid. The scale of it is such that even with the increases the Taoiseach's is proposing, teachers who came into the profession after 2011 will earn about €160,000 less over their lifetimes. That is a very significant chunk of what it would cost to put a roof over their heads over the course of their lifetimes, even with the Taoiseach's proposed changes. Will he commit to equality? That is the question. Will he acknowledge that the teachers, the gardaí and any other group who choose to fight for equality and, if necessary, take industrial action to achieve it are right to pursue the principle of equality?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They were not balloted.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking about equality. Just answer the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They were not balloted.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could it coincide with our demonstration?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, it is on Syria.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We pushed for the debate as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I presume the Deputy will be out at our protest tomorrow.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is one-sided humanitarianism.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a similar theme, it is quite extraordinary that the committee dealing with the arts should only have met after the budget. That says it all in terms of the commitment of the Government to the arts, in that there was no discussion whatsoever prior to the budget about properly resourcing and funding the arts. This was after we had a major discussion in this House in which Members on all sides pledged their verbal and rhetorical commitment to the arts. When it came to allocating money that would make a difference, however, and turning words into reality, the committee did not even meet until after the event. Is it any wonder that we had the pretty shocking decision of the Government to cut the arts, culture and film budget by 16% and to cut the Irish language budget by 9%? We had a €30 million cut in the case of arts, film and culture and €5 million in the case of the Irish language. I have heard the Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs since saying that there was an extra €50 million provided for the Centenary which was a once-off allocation, thus justifying the 16% cut. Surely the Taoiseach knew and if the Cabinet committee had met it would have acknowledged the fact the National Campaign for the Arts had very specifically asked in its pre-budget submission that the entire €50 million that had been allocated to the arts for the Centenary would be retained. That was a very modest ask because, as the Taoiseach knows - I do not know why he finds this particularly amusing - the debate in this House and the argument put forward by the National Campaign for the Arts was that we should move from the miserable 0.1% of GDP that is spent on the arts in this country in the direction, at least, of 0.6% which is the average spend on the arts in Europe. There was no move at all, despite all the rhetorical commitments. There was no actual move. Members of the Government are happy to jump in front of the cameras when there is a photo opportunity for the Centenary or some other arts event but when it comes to listening to the artists and giving resources, there is no meeting and an actual cut in the budget. I do not see how the Taoiseach can possibly justify this. The National Campaign for the Arts is asking the Government to reconsider and I ask the same. Will the Taoiseach reconsider? Will this committee meet and take seriously arts, culture and heritage which is one of the greatest assets of this country but which has been treated as a very poor second cousin when it comes to the allocation of resources?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question is not a supplementary question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not a supplementary question. It is a question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am keen for some clarity on the health budget and the allocations. Can the Taoiseach repeat the date the sub-committee last met? Did he say it was 23 September?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What was the date for the meeting of the sub-committee?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Excellent, that is clarity, at least, although I doubt if I will get clarity in response to the rest of my question. Today the Taoiseach repeated something the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform said on the day of the budget. It was the assertion that this budget includes the biggest health allocation in the history of the State. That was challenged within minutes of the claim being made during the budget by Susan Mitchell, a journalist with the Sunday Business Post. She also stripped out - I heard the Taoiseach make reference to this - the reduction in the budget that would have resulted from taking out the allocation for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. She pointed out that the total and absolute budget was bigger in 2008 than it was this year. It is important that we have clarity on who is correct and to have clear figures, comparisons and explanations that stand up in respect of what was taken out of the Department of Health. There was considerable messing around with figures last year on the health budget. I put it to the Taoiseach that we need clarity on this. We deserve that and the public deserves clarity on the health budget. We should also have the honest admission - again this has been asserted by many - that the allocation, if it is an increase, is almost certainly not an increase in real terms when we strip out Lansdowne Road arrangements, the inclusion of the €500 million cost over-run from last year as well as the demographic pressures that would have required extra budget resources in any event. The question is about what service delivery is going to be like. In other words, do we now have additional resources that will lead to additional and improved quality of services? The doctors came out today and criticised the €15 million to deal with the crisis in accident and emergency departments. One group called the allocation pathetic and said it would not deal with the crisis at all. I would like clarity on mental health. I have just heard a reference to €35 million which the Taoiseach said has been allocated. However, in the Budget Statement reference to additional funding for health, there is no reference to mental health whatsoever. Instead, there is reference to the level of mental health services being delivered within the available funding. Is it the same? That is what I want to know. Have we given additional funding to mental health? The commitment of the Government and of the House is to the full implementation of A Vision for Change to deal with the fact that our mental health teams are at 48% of the staffing levels they should have and that we need 24/7 emergency mental health services. My next question is on home care packages. I have asked this question several times, including during the budget debate and in respect of specific people. There was crowing about the fact that there will be 950 extra home care packages, but this is still 6,000 home care packages south or less than it was before the cuts started in 2008. I want a simple answer from the Minister for Health, who is sitting near the Taoiseach. It relates to the cases that I have on my desk - I suspect others have them as well - involving people whose need for home care packages is acknowledged. Are they going to continue to be told that the budget is not there? That is what I want to know.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Unfortunately, I do not have speaking time during Priority Questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was €15 billion in 2008.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have checked it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about my question on mental health?
