RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On foot of comments made by Deputy Donnelly yesterday, I want to clarify a point about the 1,482 women. As well as the additional 1,500 women who had cancer diagnoses - and the pretty frightening implications given that 208 women's false negative results missed their cancer - of the original 1,482 only some 400 of those women were included in the audit. Is this correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the witness be as brief as possible because I have a very short time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What flags?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To put it another way, what about the other 1,082?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the time, if Mr. Gleeson allows me to hone my question, is there no possibility that those 1,082 cases not included in the review had false negatives and were victims of the same errors as the 400?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will have to study the witness's answer afterwards because it contained a lot of detail. I now return to the testing and warnings. When Dr. David Gibbons, Dr. Sam Coulter-Smith and others made their warnings and indicated their fears on the consequences of outsourcing, it was not mere speculation. They had evidence, namely, that the positive rate coming from US laboratories, because of a different methodology or system, was 1.2 rather than 1.8 in Ireland. Were they correct at that time? Was that true then? Is that evidence correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. O'Brien is saying that the detection rate improved with the new contract. Can he say that definitively?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One factor suggested for the inferior detection rate and the quality of the screening was that readers in the United States were reading 80 to 90 tests daily, whereas the NHS had a maximum of 50 that readers were allowed to examine. Here in Ireland the figure was more like 30 to 35 slides. I would have thought that if a reader is looking at 90 slides each day, the possibility of making mistakes is considerably higher than if he or she is doing 30 to 35 or a maximum of 50. That was one of their concerns. Will the witnesses tell us if that continued to be the case after the contract for the screening programme was established? Is the 1.66 rate that the witnesses mentioned, which is still lower than 1.8, across the results from both the Irish and American tests? We were told that 50% are still being done in Ireland and 50% are being done in the US. When the witnesses give the figure of 1.66, is that the aggregate of both the Irish and American tests? If it is, that does not tell us specifically what detection rate is coming from the American laboratories.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the readers and the number of readings being done?
