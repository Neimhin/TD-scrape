RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to ask the Taoiseach again about the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill 2016, whether it was discussed at the health committee meeting and the decision of the Government and its representatives on the Joint Committee on Health to support stopping the Bill even though it had passed Second Stage. As a doctor, how can the Taoiseach stand over a report that is essentially determined by a report from the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, which does not comprise doctors or experts in the field of medicinal cannabis, is 77% funded through fees from the pharmaceutical industry and led the committee to make a statement to the effect that "there is still a shortage of peer-reviewed evidence for the efficacy and safety of cannabinoid treatment for many conditions" while, at the same time, refusing even to take testimony from, for example, Professor Mike Barnes, honorary professor of neurological rehabilitation at Newcastle University, who wrote the authoritative report on medicinal cannabis for the British Parliament and said the exact opposite to what our committee said? According to Professor Barnes, while it is certainly true that more peer-reviewed work is always needed, it is untrue to imply that current evidence is inadequate, particularly given that there is considerable evidence of efficacy in the context of chronic pain and spasticity - both indications having licences in different jurisdictions - as well as nausea, vomiting, anxiety and childhood epilepsy.That is just one example - I could quote more but I do not have time - of where the actual medical experts have given evidence, although ignored by the health committee, directly counter to the recommendations essentially inspired by the HPRA. I mentioned the IMO to the Taoiseach last week and he dismissed it as a trade union. It is a trade union of doctors compared with members of the HPRA, who are not doctors or experts. Will the Taoiseach continue to allow Fine Gael or, for that matter, Deputy Micheál Martin and Fianna Fáil, to block legislation which is backed up by medical and scientific evidence on medicinal cannabis?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Irish Water.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to formally move our amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the important parts of the motion, which is included in our amendment as well, is to call this a national emergency and to declare a national emergency. I put that in all seriousness to the Minister. The type of dramatic, radical action that is necessary is simply not forthcoming. We talk about tweaking Rebuilding Ireland.While some of the measures the Minister has announced may make a difference, they will not address the fundamental crisis we face. The key to resolving this issue is to embark on an emergency programme of direct council housing construction on a much more significant scale than that proposed by the Minister. The delivery of 3,000 council houses and 5,000 so-called social housing units next year will not cut it because it will be a drop in the ocean, especially in light of the number of new people who will be added to the housing list in the interim and over the coming five-year period. I asked the Minister's officials for figures on the number of new applicants for housing in recent days. I have still not received them and I would like to get them. The figure of 91,000 people on the housing list was, I believe, provided just after the list had been the subject of a major cull. I also believe that the number of families on the housing list is significantly higher than the official figure suggests. The increased number of applications that will be received must be factored into the Government's calculations. Against this background, Rebuilding Ireland proposes that 21,000 new homes will be constructed directly by councils or approved housing bodies, with the remainder consisting of refurbishments and so forth. Under Rebuilding Ireland, the vast majority of new homes will be provided under the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, the housing assistance payment, HAP, and leasing arrangements. The final target, based on the Government's reliance on the private sector, exceeds 90,000. As I have stated to the Minister and his predecessors for years, this target will not be realised and even if it were, it would not deliver secure social housing. One of the many cases I am dealing with involves a couple with eight children - they have another child on the way - who are housed in a hotel in Shankill. Before the Minister decides to move the family to a hub in town, he must not do so because they do not want to move into town. The children go to school in Shankill and the family should not be moved out of the hotel unless a council house is available. They have been told by the council to find their third RAS or HAP tenancy, which is a joke given that there are eight children. They are at breaking point, yet they are being told they have no chance of securing a council house any time soon. The housing assistance payment will not cut it for this family. Even if the Government achieves its target, the HAP scheme will cost between €800 million and €1 billion per annum in payments to private landlords. Further, it will provide housing that is not secure or permanent and will not deliver the type of social housing that would resolve the problem. Against this background, the Minister continues to speak of public private partnerships. Under PPPs, up to two thirds of public land and housing stock, all of which could be public, will be flogged off. The Minister refuses to take emergency measures to acquire housing units that are lying vacant. The Central Statistics Office has provided a figure of 180,000 vacant housing units. Even if the figure is only 10% of that, it would still mean 18,000 units were vacant. Where is the emergency legislation to get these units into the system and provide housing for people on the housing list? It is not forthcoming.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They would never do that, would they?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should commence our contribution by taking a drink of water because the people who wanted to bring in water charges - Fianna Fáil first and then Fine Gael - wanted to put a price tag on this glass of water. In fact, there has been a running joke with the ushers here. Every time we have asked for a glass of water over the past four years, they have said, "Have a glass now before they put a price tag on it or we will charge you."
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Exactly, although there probably would have been subsidised prices for water in the Dáil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They might have been subsidised prices here but they would have been charging us for the water. That is what people recognised. Setting aside all the disingenuous propaganda from the Government about the environmental reasons for bringing in water charges, people knew, and they were right, that the real agenda was to put a price tag on this in order that, at some point, someone could profit out of it. That was the agenda. The Government tried to cover over this fact with constant talk of the need to, and its concern to, invest in the decrepit water infrastructure and to ensure water conservation. It tried to create an equation that as there is 47% of water leaking out of the pipes, which is true, therefore what we need to do is put meters on people's households to reduce their water usage. It was claimed that the reason we have 47% of the water leaking out of our water system is because of excessive usage - people drinking too much water, having too many baths, flushing the toilet too often or, my favourite one, swimming pools, because there were apparently tens of thousands of people with swimming pools. It was all nonsense. Belatedly, after all the expenditure on water meters, all the political confrontation, debate and so on, the expert group finally confirmed something we had been saying right from the beginning, which was that ordinary householders were not excessive users of water and that, in fact, we used less water per household and per person than people did in the UK, where they have water charges and privatisation, and that we are low users of household water compared with most of our European counterparts. All the justification was nonsense. The real reason we had decrepit water infrastructure was decades of underinvestment by Fianna Fáil-led and Fine Gael-led Governments, because they are the only Governments we have had in this State. It was Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael chronically underinvesting in the water infrastructure and failing to address the massive leaks in the mains, not excessive use in individual households or even leaks. Even Irish Water finally confirmed belatedly that only 7% of the leakage out of the system was to do with households. The vast majority of the leakage was in the mains and the reason this was not addressed was because Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, quite often propped up by the Labour Party, had failed to invest sufficiently in the water infrastructure. That situation worsened after the economic collapse in 2008 when one of the first things to be hit was spending on infrastructure, including water infrastructure. The big drop in investment came post 2008 courtesy of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party and was then followed on by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, when average investment in water infrastructure dropped by about €100 million. It is thanks to those guys. It is not thanks to excessive users or these mythical people with swimming pools, but thanks to the Government decision to axe investment in that area. The people did not believe them because it was not true. It was not pragmatic politics that finally resolved this. It is almost three years to the day since the political establishment of this country were shocked on 11 October 2014 by a demonstration of 100,000 people taking to the streets, a demonstration, by the way, not characterised by political thuggery, but by grandparents, children, mothers with prams and every sector of society mobilising the length and breadth of the country to come to Dublin in an unprecedented demonstration and saying, "Water is a human right and we reject your agenda to turn it into a commodity out of which someone can make profit." That shocked the political establishment and forced the beginning of a retreat which has finally culminated in the Bill before us today, which is going to repeal the water charges and pay back these people who were bullied by the establishment into paying the charges that were forced out of them. While I often criticise this place as being at bit of a talking shop that does not achieve much, the first meeting of the Right2Water campaign happened in LH2000. I organised the meeting and it was attended by Sinn Féin, the Socialist Party, Deputy Seamus Healy, the Independents 4 Change, the Mandate trade union, the Unite trade union and the Communications Workers Union. We came up with the name Right2Water and said that water is a human right and that we were going to resist this, and we named the date for the 11 October demonstration. We did not know at that time how big it was going to be or how historic that movement was going to be. The battle was won by the people on the streets in mass peaceful demonstrations, forcing retreat after retreat on the political establishment. Then we come to this Bill. Finally, the establishment is forced to capitulate but is trying to leave the door open, still using the same disingenuous arguments about water conservation and excessive use. What I find incredible is that, in all the time the Government has talked about water conservation, it never put in place an actual water conservation grant to encourage or assist people to conserve water. It is still not here in this Bill. It gave €100, which was a bribe and which was not attached in any way at all to having to undertake any water conservation measures, and even now in this Bill there is no water conservation. We bothered to put in our pre-budget submissions for the past three years extra money to help householders who have leaks but cannot afford to fix them, and we put in other water conservation measures. It is proof positive that the Government never cared about water conservation and that it was never the issue for it. It was always about getting the charging regime going, getting a revenue stream going, getting all the private consultants in, getting our friend, Denis O'Brien, to have the contracts to put in the water meters, and all these people at the big honey pot and the big cash cow. They could make a fortune out of it and the people would pay. Even still, the Government will not put in a water conservation grant. It wants to leave the door open to the future reintroduction of water charges with this excessive charge and by having some billing structure which it can expand later, in a few years, after 2019, when it thinks the political environment might have changed for the better. All the way along, dishonesty and disingenuousness has characterised the Government's approach but the people found it out and they defeated it. We will resist the attempt in this Bill to leave the door open. Indeed, if the Government makes the mistake of trying to reintroduce water charges in the future, it will feel the wrath of people power and the people's movement that defeated it over the past four years. If the Government cares about water conservation, I look forward to its support for our amendments to this Bill.
