RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we discussing section 74?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend Deputy Pearse Doherty on bringing this up. He has made all the relevant points. I have raised this point a number of times. Could the Minister tell us the tax expenditure for intra-group transactions in the latest available figures? It has increased dramatically in recent years. Revenue provides a table on expenditures, credits and reliefs for corporate tax. I do not have the figures in front of me but between 2016 and 2017, if I remember correctly, the tax expenditure under the heading intra-group transactions jumped from something like €2 billion to €9 billion. This is obviously a major loophole which is being exploited by companies like those in the Goodman Group and many others. Such companies are lending themselves money via subsidiaries and claiming that the repayments on that are a cost and writing down their tax liability. It is a complete scam and those loopholes need to be closed. It is blatant tax avoidance. Has the Minister up-to-date figures on what I called the loophole, or tax expenditure, or whatever the Minister wants to call it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister have that figure?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That cannot be true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 121:In page 120, between lines 25 and 26, to insert the following:
“Report on second home tax and landlord’s tax
74. Within 6 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall produce a report on abolishing the local property tax for family homes and establishing, instead a second home tax and a landlord’s tax that would be imposed on the owners of multiple properties.”.The local property tax, LPT, was sold to us at the time it was introduced on two grounds, if my memory serves me right. The first was it would dampen the property market and help prevent the stratospheric rises in property prices that had preceded the crash of 2008. That was one of the claims made for the property tax or the family home tax, as we like to call it. It self-evidently has not achieved that when we look at where property prices have gone in recent years. Despite the imposition of the local property tax it has done less than zero to dampen the property market in any shape or form. That justification for the local property tax has not withstood the test of reality. The other claim made for it was that it would mean more money for local services. We would have more money for local government and badly-needed local services. That absolutely has not happened. In fact, the opposite happened in many cases. Euro for euro, whatever revenue has been and is raised through the property tax has been reduced, in terms of central Government funding, for local government. There was no increase in the amount of money available for local services. I thought it said it all when I read a report in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council which stated that since the imposition of the local property tax it has had less revenue in the transport department. That was just one department, but I thought it was interesting to see "less money for local government" written in black and white. As we speak, the budget is being debated in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. As we speak, it is cutting the retrofit and recycling programmes and increasing rates. One wonders where all this extra money that we were supposed to get from the local property tax is. That is what is happening. Neither of the two aims we were told the local property tax would achieve have been achieved. In both cases, things still continue to move in the opposite direction. What happened was that people had imposed on them a very unfair and regressive, by any definition, tax on the family home. People worked very hard, earned the money and bought the house to put a roof over their heads. It was not to buy a commercial, money-making or wealth producing asset but just to put a roof over their heads and they get taxed again on it, in many cases having paid stamp duty. It is very unfair. There are areas where the property prices are not in any sense in the control of the people who live in those properties, my area being an example, but this is true in many parts of the country. I do not want to single out south Dublin but if one happens to live in a former council house that one bought, which now in my area might sell for €400,000, one could be on a State pension yet is hit with a tax that is related to a market valuation of that property, which could shoot up significantly at some point and, I suspect, almost certainly will after the next general election. It is just not fair. I do not understand how anybody could describe it as fair. It is self-evidently not fair because one's income might be the same as somebody who lives in a house exactly the same size but in an area where house prices are lower. That is just not fair. I am suggesting that the Government acknowledges that at least we have an argument in saying that and looks at an alternative that would be genuinely progressive. I refer to having a genuine wealth tax, which would be a progressive tax on second and more properties because if one has a second home, one is starting to talk about wealth. If one has three, four or five properties, one is talking about real wealth. One is not talking about a roof to put over the heads of one's family. One is talking about wealth-producing assets.  In recent years, in our alternative budget submissions, we proposed to do precisely that and that it would be genuinely progressive and based on it being real wealth-producing assets. Does the Minister think that would be fairer and would it not be something he might consider looking into?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister could simply engineer a provision to raise the same money. I will withdraw my amendment but reintroduce it on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My amendment No. 120 was ruled out of order but I am sure it was an entirely legitimate decision by the Chairman.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will try to resubmit my amendment but I want to put the issue on the record for the committee so that it can be raised on Report Stage. I call on the Minister to look again at the section 481 film tax relief. We have discussed the relief at length and I acknowledge that he has been very positive in his engagement and response to some of the points that I raised. Indeed, new guidelines were published on 31 October, which is positive and welcome. I commend the Minister and his team on doing so but there is more to be done. The basic objective of section 481 is to contribute to filmmaking in the country, and the culture of the country and, critically, to provide quality employment and training. That key phrase is a condition of the relief. It is still not the case that we are getting "quality employment and training". The reason is the structure of the relief is that producer companies apply for it. These are standing major production companies, which are famously known as the 12 apostles, with probably seven or eight of them being significant players. They get significant tax relief pretty much every year, which is worth about €80 million a year. Over the past decade, these companies have received many millions of euro to make films. They claim the relief on the basis that they will provide "quality employment and training" but then a designated activity company, DAC, is set up for the particular film production. However, when the people who work on the film seek to vindicate their rights, for example, under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Workers) Act 2003, which ensures that people who work on a fixed-term basis from project to project accumulate rights from one project to another. Workers are unable to do that because when they seek to assert their rights, the film producer who applies for the relief from the Department of Finance says that he or she is not the employer and the DAC is the employer. The film producer company applies for the relief and it should only get the relief if it provides employment and training but they do not, and it says it is the DAC that is the employer. For example, if a worker, as has happened on a number of occasions, goes to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and says, "You are my employer" but the film producer who has applied to the Minister for the tax relief says, "I am not and the DAC is the employer". Of course, by the time the work gets to the WRC, the DAC does not exist because the film production, typically, is a few months or weeks so there is no employer. I do not see how we can give out €80 million in tax relief when there are no employers or give it to people who say they are going to create employment but when asked by their employees, "Are you my employer?", they reply that they are not nor do they take responsibility for training. There is, therefore, something wrong with the structure. As a result, the people who have worked for decades in the industry accumulate no rights as employees, which I am sure that the Minister will accept is wrong. Clearly, that flies in the face of the fixed-term workers' directive and the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Workers) Act, which specifically states that fixed-term employees should not enjoy conditions any less favourable than somebody on a permanent contract. That is what the legislation is supposed to achieve but these workers do not get those rights because it is a DAC, which appears like a mushroom but then disappears. The same producer company will set up a series of DACs. I ask the Minister to clarify in the section 481 relief that the employer is the producer company that applies for the relief. These companies get the relief on the basis of providing employment and, therefore, they must be the employer. That aspect should be clearly established. Such companies cannot say to the Minister, "Give me the money because I am going to create employment" yet say to the employee, "I am not your employer". That is having your cake and eating it or speaking out of both sides of your mouth. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Chairman knows, I am speaking to the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure that the Minister will agree that the arts are very important.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will make another point on why I think this matter is in the interest of the Minister, and not just from the point of view of the employees. This issue is important for workers. They have the right to accumulate rights as workers. They have the right, after spending a decade or two in an industry, not to be completely insecure as to their prospects of future employment. They are vulnerable in that situation and should not be so. I wish to make an equally serious point and ask the Minister to give it serious consideration. The EU has clearly set out state aid rules for arts funding. The Union fully accepts, as I do and I fully support, that one needs to give state aid to the arts because, due to their nature, they cannot always be expected to make a profit. The EU goes on to say that the state aid should be conditional on creating a permanent pool of talent and creating companies of scale. That is a condition under which the EU allows money to flow to the arts, and specifically film. That is not happening in Ireland. We do not have a permanent pool of talent because none of those workers from project to project has any right to be in the industry. They can work for a few years and then a producer will tell them that he or she is not taking them on for the next project. A producer will say, "I have employed you on the last five projects via these DACs but I am not taking you for this one because I have just decided I am not taking you." These workers have absolutely no rights in that situation and, therefore, no permanent pool of talent is created. People in the industry say that, as a result, trainees never even get to the point where they are accredited as trainees and the majority of people who are categorised as trainees never stay in the industry because there is no pathway to reach a point where they are an accredited member of the film industry. We, therefore, do not get a permanent pool of employees, which we should. None of the companies that I mentioned have a company of scale. I mentioned the 12 apostles or the seven or eight big ones. The largest one has a staff of ten or 15 people, which is not a company of scale. I refer to encouraging foreign investment.I am sure that is something Fine Gael wishes to see. It is unattractive if there is no experienced pool of people in the industry or companies of scale and, instead, everything is cobbled together for each production. That is not an industry. However, we are putting in probably €100 million per year if one takes account of the Irish Film Board and have nothing to show for it. We need to address that and further refine the relief to ensure that we have a permanent pool of employees, it is made clear who are the employers and we get an industry of scale.
