RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister's strong words of condemnation of the appalling treatment by Israel of the people of Gaza.  Frankly, it is difficult to understand how this State or other states in Europe continue to treat Israel as if it is a normal state when it does this type of thing, yet they impose sanctions on Iran and roundly condemn it.  Did the Minister raise the matter of Khader Adnan on his visit and, if not, will he raise it?  Khader Adnan has been on hunger strike for 66 days.  He is now critically ill and will possibly die in the next few days.  He is held in so-called administrative detention, which means imprisonment without trial.  He is one of 300 Palestinians, including 180 children under the age of 18 years, who are imprisoned without trial.  This is a routine part of the Israeli flouting of human rights when it comes to Palestinians.  Will the Minister make a public statement calling on the Israelis to release this man and to end the absolutely despicable practice of administrative detention?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about people who lost their jobs through no fault of their own?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise to Deputy Joe Higgins.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, it will be okay as long as we both get a chance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My questions are related to whether there was any discussion at the Council meeting in January on the impact of the austerity programme on the potential for growth in the economy, on what it had done to the Greek economy and on what, according to all the mounting evidence, it was doing to the entire European economy.  The Taoiseach may have seen an article by the economist Paul Krugman in today's edition of The Irish Times in which he has yet again pleaded with political leaders across Europe to break with what he describes as the “destructive folly” of austerity and calls “delusional beliefs about the virtues of austerity”.  He is right, of course, because each week the evidence mounts and new figures confirm that austerity is crippling the European economy.  Austerity, not the behaviour of the Greek people, has destroyed the Greek economy and all the evidence is mounting that it will destroy the Irish economy.  I specifically ask the Taoiseach whether he took the time at the Council meeting in January or more recently to talk to the Greek Prime Minister.  The Taoiseach has made a virtue of stating how different Ireland is from Greece.  I happened to attend an event organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions this morning on community employment and the devastating consequences of cuts, at which it was pointed out that the level of poverty in Ireland had risen fast and child poverty faster again but that the level of both had risen faster than in Greece.  The increase in the incidence of suicide in Ireland is on a par with that in Greece.  What has happened in Greece in the past year is absolutely shocking, in that its suicide rate has doubled and all the health professionals there and everyone who has examined this issue has stated this is as a direct result of the austerity to pay off bankers and bondholders.  Moreover, Ireland has seen a similar dramatic increase in the level of suicide and no one in his or her right mind is unaware of the connection between this increase and austerity.I also ask the Taoiseach about job creation.  At the presentation I attended this morning organised by the Irish Congress of Trade Unions its report confirmed that, according to the Government's own figures, the level of employment in the community and voluntary sector would drop from 48,000 when the Administration came into power to 36,000 in this vital sector that provides a range of services, including child care, health care and sports services.  The level of employment will fall as a direct result of the cuts the Government is imposing.  How can it talk about this or how can leaders in Europe at summit meetings talk about their concern about the level of youth unemployment which, as the Taoiseach has pointed out, is running at 29% and then implement austerity measures that will lead to a reduction of 12,000 in the number who work in the voluntary and community sectors over the term of the Government?  Moreover, this only pertains to a single sector.It is clear at every level that this does not make sense.  I ask the Taoiseach whether there is any cognisance or awareness, either within the Government or at summit meetings of European Union leaders, of what all economists are saying and what each set of statistics confirms, that austerity is not just causing immense suffering but, in terms of all its stated objectives, is also failing?  It is contracting growth, increasing the level of unemployment and making matters worse.  At what point will this issue be discussed or will it just be left to the pages of the Financial Times and Nobel Prize winning economists to point this out?  Will the policy leaders in Europe discuss it at any point?  Moreover, what are they going to do about it when everything they do and each decision they make is making matters worse?  Furthermore, agreeing to a treaty that will institutionalise austerity which has failed for three years for at least another seven or eight simply defies belief.  The Taoiseach should indicate whether there was any serious discussion of this issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On suicide rates, it not a rant; they are factual.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was an amazing dodge of the questions I posed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach accept what health professionals in Greece and Ireland are stating, namely, that austerity has led to a dramatic increase in suicide rates?  Is the Taoiseach stating that there is no connection and that it is just a coincidence?  Is he saying that a reduction of 12,000 in numbers in the community and voluntary sector, as a result of the cuts introduced by the Government, represents job creation?  Will this be of assistance in resolving the problem of youth unemployment or will it instead do immense damage?  I am not surprised that a Fine Gael Taoiseach would dismiss the points I am making.  However, I am actually shocked that the Minister, Deputy Burton, is nodding in agreement, particularly when the ICTU has referred to a massacre in respect of community and voluntary services and has highlighted the damage being done to our most disadvantaged communities.Is the Taoiseach seriously disputing the fact that there has been a dramatic and accelerating contraction in growth across the European economy as a result of the imposition of austerity measures?  Surely he is not denying the existence of such a contraction.  If he is, then I put it to him that what Paul Krugman referred to as delusional beliefs about the virtues of austerity are truly rife in this House.  Is the Taoiseach in a position to indicate whether there is a connection between suicide and the austerity that is being imposed in Greece and Ireland?  Does it concern him that the rates of poverty and child poverty in this country are increasing faster than is the case in Greece?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a fact.  The Minister should read the evidence in this regard in the ICTU's report.  If she had attended the launch, she would already have seen the evidence to which I refer.  What does the Taoiseach have to say with regard to the rate of child poverty here being ahead of that which obtains in Greece?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have plenty of friends who-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was asking about the connection between austerity and suicide which is highlighted in the report to which I refer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is rich.  It is the Government which is imposing the austerity.  The Taoiseach must be kidding.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What has that to do with the European Council?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a result of the budget cuts in rent allowance, it is becoming apparent that sick, mentally ill and vulnerable persons who have been told to negotiate lower rents with their landlords are being refused such reductions or being threatened with homelessness, while fraudulent form filling is also an issue.  This is widespread.  A housing Bill proposed by the Government is supposed to deal with the mess that is the provision of social housing and supports for those in receipt of rent allowance, but it is unclear when it will be introduced.  This is a major issue.  Will the legislation be brought forward soon in order that we can discuss the vitally important issue of housing?  Does the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government have any proposals to prevent the increase in the level of fraud and the number of vulnerable persons being pushed out of rented accommodation because of cuts in rent allowance?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government should introduce rent controls.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is happening.
