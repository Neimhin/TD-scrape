RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach suggested the Government's Housing for All policy is working. I would like him to try to explain that to three people in the Gallery. They are Tony, Radoslaw and Seán, who are three of the five remaining tenants in the St. Helen's Court complex in Dún Laoghaire. This Friday they will be at the Four Courts, where a vulture fund will seek an enforcement order to evict them from their homes. They have never done anything wrong and have always paid their rent. Once upon a time they were part of a community of 20 tenants who all lived there. It was a fabulous community, which has been destroyed by the greed of two successive vulture funds. It is fair to say their lives have been ruined for four years by the greed and ruthlessness of vulture funds and the failure of this and previous Governments to address the causes of the persecution they have suffered at the hands of vulture funds. Their story is not just a story of their persecution but, to be honest, it tells the story of tens of thousands of people who are victims of the housing crisis and the failure of this and successive Governments to deal with the matter. Why do I say this? This vulture fund has no reason to evict these people but it is allowed to evict them. Legally, the vulture fund is allowed to just throw these people out on the street. They have paid their rent and never done anything wrong but they can be thrown out on the street. These tenants receive the housing assistance payment, HAP. Seán and Radoslaw are both working and Tony, who is now retired, was a healthcare worker. He has had a stroke as a result of the stress he suffered over the past four years at the hands of these vulture funds. They are HAP recipients, so in other words they are meant to be socially housed, although they are not. They are being thrown out on the street and the council has no obligation to rehouse such people. They may well end up in homeless accommodation. This would not be such a problem if there was social housing but there are 5,000 families on the housing list waiting ten to 20 years to get a house. These people are included in that list. The tenants get €960, the homeless HAP rate, to find alternative accommodation but the problem is that rents are more than €2,000 per month in our area. What is really shocking is that not only will they end up on the street unless the Government intervenes but there are now only five tenants where there used to be 20. For two years, 15 fully refurbished apartments that could have housed people on the housing list have been sitting empty because a greedy vulture fund can make more profit by sitting on empty properties and evicting other tenants than renting them to people who need them. What is the Taoiseach going to do about that for them and others facing similar persecution by vulture funds and the failure of Governments to deal with the housing crisis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is all very interesting. Will the Taoiseach guarantee that Tony, Radoslaw, Seán and the other two households remaining in St. Helen's Court will not be thrown into emergency accommodation after Friday's court proceedings? That is what they want to hear. That is the commitment they need. Beyond that, why are the vulture funds allowed to do this for nothing other than greed? Why are they allowed to evict people who have done nothing wrong and sit for two years on 15 empty properties when there are people crying out for accommodation? It is even worse now. There are 5,000 people on the housing list and Ukrainian people are fleeing a desperate situation of war but this vulture fund is allowed to sit on empty properties and evict tenants who have done nothing wrong. The State should step in, buy that block and force its purchase. The Government must also change the law because they got around the Tyrrelstown amendment. They tried to evict more than ten households. The Tyrrelstown amendment protected those people, so they evicted seven households. Give these people that guarantee and do something to prevent vulture funds treating people like this.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the rest of them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government spent I do not know how long telling us it did not have the flexibility to reduce VAT because it would impact on the derogation. Then we discovered it could do so, as we had said. Europe was happy to move heaven and earth in some respects in response to the war in Ukraine but not in other respects, particularly in respect of trying to protect working people from the economic and financial impacts of the war in Ukraine. By the way, as a little aside, not only did the EU state it would give a little bit of flexibility but not much with a small VAT reduction, which the Minister of State had said we could not get, but it does not want to give any further flexibility. Even for the people of Ukraine it does not want to lessen the economic impact for them. We tabled a question asking whether the Government would consider unilateral cancellation of Ukrainian debt. We got an answer from the Minister that we could not possibly do this because it would impact on the international financial system. This is how much we care about the Ukrainians faced with war. We cannot cancel their debt. We cannot protect ordinary people here against the impact of this inflationary spiral. Of course the war in Ukraine is having some impact on this. It would be foolish to suggest otherwise. This is not the primary reason for the inflationary spiral and the cost-of-living increases we are seeing. The main reason is a thing called profiteering. Now we can add to this war profiteering. There was profiteering going on before the Ukrainian crisis and now we have war profiteering going on by the energy companies, including oil and gas companies, that have seen their profits go through the roof. This is the elephant in the room. The Government is profiteering through VAT. It is being very slightly reduced but it is not really a full give-back of the huge VAT bonanza the Government has enjoyed as a result of rising energy prices. There is a small reduction in the level of profiteering by the Government via VAT but it will not touch the profits of the energy companies, which have gone through the roof. This is the elephant in the room. There should be a windfall tax on the super profits being enjoyed by these companies as a result of the inflation crisis affecting so many and which is literally killing people. Let us be straight about this. We had more than 2,000 winter excess deaths. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul states that last year 42% of those with illness and disability reduced their heating and electricity use because of the inflationary spiral. This stuff kills the vulnerable unless we do something serious about it. This is not going anywhere near enough to compensate for the increase of at least €700 or €800 in energy prices alone as well as all of the other costs of living that are rising. The inflation rate is now running at 6.7% and is possibly set to go higher. It means an average worker has lost more than €2,000 as a result of the inflationary crisis. This is what is happening to people. The Government's measures are not going anywhere near it because it does not want to control the profiteering or impose windfall taxes on energy companies. It does not want to control rents that are spiralling through the roof yet again this month, leading directly to people being driven into homelessness. It does not want to touch the profits of people making money from the inflationary spiral. Let us also remind ourselves about the deregulation and privatisation of the energy market and the decision to take the ESB out of a not-for-profit basis. I was reading the commentary at the time in 2011 when the ESB was starting to engage in price competition. The prediction was that it would be a win-win situation for suppliers and consumers and that it should drive down prices. That did not happen, did it? The exact opposite happened. We had some of the lowest energy prices in Europe prior to deregulation and privatisation; we now have some of the highest. That is profiteering.It is in the Government's control to act but it is not willing to do anything about it. We could control or tax those windfall profits.
