RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why can the Taoiseach not do it for the Debenhams workers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is designed to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed. I very rarely, if ever, miss a Business Committee meeting but I feel like saying that while the cat is away, the mice will play. Questions on Promised Legislation has disappeared from the normal schedule where we might, for example, ask the Taoiseach when the legislation to implement the Duffy Cahill report will be brought forward. The Government, having knocked the smaller parties down the pecking order in an effort to gag them at the end of the summer recess, has now given itself extra time above and beyond the move to gag the smaller parties. It wants to have its cake and eat it and to dominate the debate in here completely. It is absolutely unbelievable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The neck is extraordinary. Also, there was an agreement at the Business Committee two meetings ago to have a debate on the economic situation this week, particularly given the Government's plans to axe the pandemic unemployment payments, PUP, the week after that. On multiple grounds, therefore, I object to the Order of Business.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government did not respond to the point on additional time, above and beyond that associated with the manipulation of the speaking order executed at the end of summer term.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the proposed business. There is additional time for the Government, above and beyond that associated with the cynical manipulation already rammed through.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just wondering if they are from the same party-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I am not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am saying we should keep to the order that has been there since the 1920s.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We always had that time. Always.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Wait and see the turnout from the Government parties at committees-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Protecting public health is a priority but we have to face the fact there is a shocking contradiction. I raised this at the Covid committee so I am not grandstanding. We are spending approximately 50 times more on ensuring adherence to public health guidelines per Deputy than we are spending per pupil in school. That is shocking. The money given to schools to ensure physical distancing is approximately 50 times less per pupil than the amount of money we are spending on ensuring adherence to the public health guidelines in the Dáil. That will not fly with people. We have to address it without compromising public health. We have to focus on finding a solution to this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	From a foreign policy point of view, I would like the Taoiseach's assurance that this Government, and all parties in this House, will do absolutely nothing between now and November to facilitate, encourage or promote assistance to Donald Trump's campaign to return to the White House. I think this is a priority. Under normal circumstances, one might say we have to maintain friendly relationships with the US but I am of the view, as I have said many times in this House, that Donald Trump is inciting the most dangerous political forces. He is encouraging a politics of hate and legitimising it across the world, along with people like Jair Bolsonaro and Viktor Orbán. These people are actively encouraging and legitimising hate, division, conflict and racism in a dangerous way that echoes the politics of the fascists of the 1930s. I think Biden is useless and I am not particularly promoting him either. However, it is in all of our interests that we do not do anything that could be used by Trump to assist his return to power. Palestine, which Deputy MacDonald has just raised, is a case in point. Trump has given license to Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, to annex Palestinian territory, to manipulate in a dangerous way the situation in the Middle East, to renew assaults on Gaza and so on. It is another instance of the danger of Trump.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know the Taoiseach will not be as explicit as I might be about Trump but I am asking the Department of the Taoiseach to be careful not to inadvertently offer any public relations opportunities to Donald Trump between now and November. That is what I am urging because he is a danger to the whole world. Whatever I may think about Biden, this guy is a threat to democracy. On Palestine, I agree with the call to support the occupied territories Bill and for the recognition of the Palestinian state. I want to point out to the Government, to Sinn Féin and to others that there is a contradiction between saying that we do not interfere with the politics of other states and pinning our colours to the mast of the two-state solution. Palestinians are divided about a two-state and one-state solution. In this country, we completely reject two-state solutions. It is called partition, we reject it and we recognise that partition was a disaster. Why would we support, as a matter of principle, the continued partition of Palestine when there is a very valid argument from many Palestinians that the solution to the conflict in Palestine is to have a single state where one's religion or ethnic background makes no difference and where one is treated equally? That was the historic position of the Palestinians. They conceded that under pressure from the Israelis and since they have done so, the situation has been a disaster. The two-state solution has not worked and is not now even viable but it copper-fastens partition on ethnic and religious grounds. The Taoiseach may agree or disagree with me but we should not fix our mast to the position of two states because it is dangerous. We should look at Lebanon, where there were similar arrangements and it turned out to be a disaster for the whole history of that state. The people of Lebanon are now saying they cannot have these institutionalised sectarian partitions. I put it to the Taoiseach that the same point applies to Palestine.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The protocol and general division deals with relations with the religious bodies. I appeal to the Taoiseach, through this division, to engage urgently with the Sisters of Charity and the Catholic Church generally on a scandal in the St. Mary's centre, a nursing home that also provides assisted living housing for people with blindness, visual impairment and disability. In a Debenhams-style, cynical, tactical liquidation the Sisters of Charity's wholly-owned subsidiary, set up by the order, has already liquidated the Caritas convalescent centre and representatives of the subsidiary are in the High Court as I speak trying to liquidate the nursing home, which provided for 50 residents. Social housing was also specifically provided for those with blindness and disability. By the way, that was originally financed by Dublin City Council but then outsourced to the Sisters of Charity - that makes me laugh - which is now dumping these vulnerable people and all the workers on the scrapheap, while hiding behind company law. The workers are in the High Court trying to resist this move, but they are up against high-powered barristers. We have to stop and remember that the Sisters of Charity, which is doing this, is supposed to be a religious organisation. These organisations and the services provided are funded by taxpayers. This cannot be allowed to happen. I ask the Taoiseach, through his Department, to crack the whip on these religious organisations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I raised the problem I have with Questions on Promised Legislation being taken off the Dáil schedule on the Order of Business. While the Government might not have a legislative programme, there is a programme for Government, which contains commitments regarding various legislation, some of which has been rightly described by Deputy McDonald as "off the wall". We need answers to be given in the House about when those proposals will come forward. Taxi drivers have been hammered during Covid-19, are unable to make a viable living and now face cuts to their pandemic unemployment payments. I have repeatedly asked questions on their behalf.They are doing a drive-by protest, which I hope will be big, to the Dáil next Tuesday. They are looking for the assistance of the Government and to add insult to injury, the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, has said they have to get out of the bus lanes, as if they are not part of the public transport network. Does that require legislation? Is legislation planned in order that taxi drivers are no longer considered part of the public transport system?  It is kicking taxi drivers when they are down. Is that legislation coming forward? I hope the Taoiseach will tell the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that is not acceptable. Rather than kicking the taxi drivers when they are down, I hope he will listen to some of the demands they have made and try to help them through this extremely difficult period.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sure.
