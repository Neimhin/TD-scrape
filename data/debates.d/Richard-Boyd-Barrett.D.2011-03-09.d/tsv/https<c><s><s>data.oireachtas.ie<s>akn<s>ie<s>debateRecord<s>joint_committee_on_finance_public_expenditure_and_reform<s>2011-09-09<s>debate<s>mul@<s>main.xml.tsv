RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a matter of procedure, it is not fair that the members who ask questions at the beginning of a meeting are given a huge amount of time and that others' questions are squeezed into a few minutes at the end.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the delegation for attending.  I wonder if at this stage their heads are as fried as mine, given the detail and questions we are trying to get through.My first question to Mr. Corrigan is on an issue already referred to by Deputy Mathews.  This is an appropriate question to ask of Mr. Corrigan as someone who is managing the debt.  The question of what exactly is the national debt and when will it peak has been asked.  I would like Mr. Corrigan to give us an estimate of the proportion of the national debt, current and projected, which has resulted from the banking crisis and as a result of the hole in the banks?  I would also like to know about the accompanying costs of recapitalisation of the banks, the paying-off of the bonds of insolvent banks, and the cost of setting up NAMA.  Also, what is the amount to be paid in interest on loans?  Perhaps Mr. Corrigan might give us a ballpark figure which the ordinary person on the street and people like me who are not financial experts could understand.  I am not in any way embarrassed in admitting I am not a financial expert, given the mess some financial experts have made.  It is long past time we received simple answers which ordinary people could understand and on which they could make informed decisions.  In giving us the figures Mr. Corrigan might separate the interest payable on loans in order that we would know the total cost in doing what the European Union and the IMF have asked us to do.If I understood him correctly, Mr. Corrigan stated that he advised the Minister on the issue of debt management, the State's finances and so on.  However, he said his opinion was just part of the soup, to use his own expression, of the various influences on the Minister.  I put it to him that his advice is probably one of the most significant influences on the Minister - it certainly appears to me to be the case - in so far as the policy appears to be driven primarily by what he has expressed as a central concern - getting back into the private bond markets.  Some of us would question the wisdom of that priority over other possible priorities, but Mr. Corrigan has said it must be our priority and that - he can correct me if I am wrong - in order to do this it is his opinion and advice that we must meet the EU-IMF fiscal targets which, translated into layman's language, mean brutal austerity being imposed on vulnerable and working people in this country, most of whom bear no responsibility for the current mess.  He believes we must meet and, possibly, exceed these targets to convince the bond markets to start lending money to us again.  Will he clarify that this is his opinion and role?Mr. Corrigan gives priority to developing our relations with investors in order that if we have good relations with them and do what they think is good for them, they will start to lend us money again.  However, is it not also the case that there is a certain schizophrenia in the markets?  Of course, the investors with whom we might discuss lending us money want to be sure they would get their money back and they believe the way they would get it back is through us imposing austerity and so forth.  However, the markets as a whole look at this and say the effect of imposing austerity is crippling the economy, massively contracting demand and seriously undermining the possibility of achieving the economic growth necessary if we are to pay off debts in the future.  Is that not the glaring contradiction in all of this?In that regard, can Mr. Corrigan confirm that if all of this does not result in economic growth, the entire project will be derailed?  I believe he used the expression "derailed" and spoke about indigenous and exogenous factors, to use the jargon, that could derail everything.  Certainly, one of these is depression in the economy.  If there is stagnation and further contraction in demand and so forth and if there is no growth, we will simply be unable to pay off these debts.  It will become unsustainable.  Can Mr. Corrigan offer his opinion on the exogenous factors?  He said much of this could be derailed if the rate of growth in Europe and the global economy begins to slow down, as appears to be happening.  Is it not obvious that it will slow down because it is not just this country that is imposing austerity which is contracting demand in the economy; other countries are doing the same?  It cannot have any other effect on them than the effect it is having on us.The single bright spark to which we point is the export sector which we believe will get us out of this situation.  In fact, it is seriously questionable whether even the best performing export sector - it is still a relatively small proportion of the economy - in the best case scenario could pull us out of this situation when the domestic economy is in such a mess.  Given even that little faint hope that is being expressed, and which is stalling, is it not obvious that we must give the obvious advice, as experts or as lay people looking at the facts, that if they are all imposing this austerity it will have the same effect on their economies as it is having on our economy and that the market for exports is going to contract if this continues?  That is obvious.  Is not that the type of advice we should give?  That raises questions about the whole strategy.  Should not our focus be to try to stimulate demand and growth to ensure a real possibility of us being able to work our way out of this crisis?In regard to the issue of pay, bonuses and so on, this is not focused on the individuals.  People find it hard to stomach, as I do, that anybody in the current climate, where the NTMA has said it is advising the Government to meet or possibly exceed the IMF targets, which means imposing austerity - cuts in income, social welfare and so on - on people who bear no responsibility for the current crisis; where the NTMA has rightly said it is not responsible for the current crisis but the banking system, the developers, and definitely the politicians are responsible-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The political system.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a fair point.  However, the policy the Government was advised to implement is to impose austerity on people who were as equally innocent as the Deputy but had a much lower level of income.  If the NTMA can advise that level of austerity people will lose their homes and those on the lowest income levels will be cut to meet those targets.  In that context it is utterly unacceptable that hundreds of people are earning seven and eight times the average industrial wage.  In the case of some of the best paid individuals in NTMA and NAMA, who are earning ten, 12 and 14 times the average industrial wage, how can that be justified?  How can that set an example for people in the current climate?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to ask a few questions about NAMA.  Mr. Frank Daly said the expectations of NAMA were unrealistic.  I was surprised at the expectations he articulated of people about NAMA but, perhaps, they were in the commentariat, the banking system and among politicians.  I put to him what I think was the expectation of most people and ask him to tell us why these expectations are not being borne out.  Most people believed that NAMA would be a bailout for the banks and the speculators of the €70 billion speculative toxic loans on their books.  NAMA took the most speculative, the biggest and in many cases the most toxic loans off the banks' books in order to put the banks back on their feet - that was the theory - so that they would begin to lend and invest back into the economy and recover as much as possible of the speculative loans.  In the first case, although it is not the fault of NAMA - that is a result of the policy - clearly it has failed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to make that point because it is not €30 billion that it cost us: the NAMA exercise puts the public at risk for €70 billion.  Given that in its previous business plans NAMA put forward projections about how much it might get back and how much profit could be made, how much of that €70 billion does it expect to get back?  He had previous suggestions about certain levels of profitability and so on, but that was with regard to the €30 billion.  He said it was not NAMA's intention to sell things at fire sale prices and so on.  He could have that intention, but it is difficult to understand how selling in the current climate could be construed as not selling at fire sale prices, given the massive collapse of the market.  He mentioned that NAMA had disposed of €4.6 billion in property assets.  How much were the loans for those?  If it has recovered €4.6 billion, what proportion of the loans on those assets is that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we selling the properties that are actually more valuable, such as those in the south east of England, when one might argue those are the ones we should hang on to?  We should retain the properties that are more valuable and think of imaginative ways to deal with the ones that are more difficult to sell or get value from.On the issue of residential property in the hands of NAMA, he talked about engaging with the various Departments about social housing, primary care units and so on.  What I want to know is the terms of that engagement and the terms of possible arrangements.  He mentioned a figure of 10,000 residential properties, and I was surprised at how low that figure was.  Does he expect more to be in the hands of NAMA, or is that it?  I do not understand why we are not putting the 50,000 families who are on the social housing list into those properties and getting rental revenue back for the State, which would solve a problem of social housing and save a significant amount of money that is currently going into the pockets of private landlords in the form of rent allowance.Finally-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Everybody else got a lot longer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is the last sentence.As I understand it, some of the empty properties that have been taken on by local authorities are being leased from the developers - probably including some bankrupt developers - so that they will own the properties at the end.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Should we not own the properties at the end of this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Very briefly-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But so the question is clear, after which Mr. Corrigan may come back-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also asked about the cost of NAMA and all the other attendant costs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will we telephone Mr. Daly about this?
