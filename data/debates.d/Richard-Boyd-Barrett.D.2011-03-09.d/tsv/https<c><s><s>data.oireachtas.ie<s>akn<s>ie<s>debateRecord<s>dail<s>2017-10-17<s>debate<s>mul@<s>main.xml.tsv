RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach did not answer the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is absolutely not true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not agreed. At the Business Committee I raised the issue of not debating the double taxation agreements with Kazakhstan and Macao.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Leas-Cheann Comhairle does not know because I have not explained it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I need to explain why. Kazakhstan is, in effect, a dictatorship. The European Parliament has passed four resolutions outlining major problems with human rights abuses, arrests, imprisonments and the seizure of the property of civil society opponents and political opposition figures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The European Parliament-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have one minute. That is the rule.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have one minute in which to explain why we are opposing something.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should not ignore human rights abuses and the denial of democracy in Kazakhstan. They are systematic and ongoing and have been reported by human rights bodies across the globe. In doing this deal we are ignoring these issues.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no response. Can we not even ask for one?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In regard to the discrimination against pensioners discussed earlier, I and several others raised this issue when the Taoiseach was the Minister for Social Protection, and he acknowledged then that there was problem with the averaging and a problem with people who did not benefit from the homemaker's credit being discriminated against because it was not retrospective. He acknowledged that a long time ago, at least a year to a year to a half ago, in engagements that took place in this House involving Members from both sides of this House. How come it has taken him this long to act on this and when will he do something about it? By the way, in our budget submission, we allocated several hundred million euro for expanding the homemaker's scheme, so we did include it in our budget submission. The Taoiseach said he read them all, so he should know it was in our budget submission at least. He has given no clear commitment as to when he will deal with this discrimination against more than 30,000 pensioners, many of whom are women, although not all, as he said. It is a discrimination and unfairness, nonetheless, which he has acknowledged. He said then that he was going to do something about it but he has still done nothing about it. When is he going to do something about it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach said that previously but when will that be done?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All expert opinion suggests the formation of hurricane Ophelia was due to rising ocean temperatures which are related to global warming. Does that not prompt the Taoiseach to think we need a far more seriously focused approach to dealing with climate change, rather than what we are doing, which is engaged in special pleading as to why we should be allowed to continue with increased CO2 emissions and not meet targets and run the risk of fines? The Citizens' Assembly stated we should be global leaders. That is what it recommended to the Government and we are the opposite. The fact that the Taoiseach does not have a dedicated Cabinet sub-committee suggests he is not taking the issue seriously. Should he reconsider after the weekend? The next issue I want to raise which is of critical importance and requires the emergency response we saw at the weekend from the Government is housing and the need for a special committee to deal with what continues to be a crisis that is out of control. We need an emergency focused, dedicated, all-Government response to the housing and homelessness crisis. It justifies having a special Cabinet sub-committee which the Taoiseach would chair.
