RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Until May 2017, the Government operated a complete ban on the right of asylum seekers to look for employment and contribute to our society. That ban was found to be unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2017. The limited right to work the Government introduced as a result of the Supreme Court case has left the vast majority of asylum seekers either without the right to employment or facing so many obstacles to securing employment that it is effectively of no use to them. Does the Minister recognise that fact? Does he agree that we would solve many problems and much hardship if he gave a right to work to all asylum seekers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This does not make sense. We have labour shortages in a large number of areas, from the health service to special needs education, childcare and construction. I could go through a list. Despite this, thousands of people who are forced to live in fairly inhumane conditions in direct provision centres, many of them in isolated areas, want to work but cannot do so. This does not make sense for them or for society. Why should applicants be forced to wait nine months and why does this apply only in the case of a first application? It should be remembered that many of the people who get the right to asylum in this country have previously been refused in the first application. The particular case which led the Supreme Court to strike down the Department's ban on employment for asylum seekers involved a man who had been in direct provision for eight years. He was a member of what we know to be a persecuted group, the Rohingya, who subsequently got the right to stay but was forced to exist in direct provision for eight years. Rather than forcing people into the isolation, stigma and hardship of direct provision centres, why does the Department not give them the right to work and make it easy for them to contribute to and benefit society? I am glad that a review is upcoming. I hope the Minister of State will take serious steps to address the many obstacles asylum seekers face, including their inability to get driving licences and their isolation from transport services caused by the location of the direct provision centres. He should examine these issues and recognise that these are people who could and want to make a contribution to our society.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is inhumane to have children living in hostels or hotels, where their mothers or fathers cannot cook dinner for them, for years on end. It is inhumane for asylum seekers and people in family emergency homeless hubs. "Inhumane" is not an unreasonable word to use in this regard. A more important term again is "totally unnecessary". I hope the Minister of State will recognise, as he has failed to do so far, that those who have been given the right to work face many obstacles, including public transport difficulties and problems getting driving licences. All of these barriers mean that even those who want to get to work, and who have the right to do so, find it difficult. Many people who have been in the system for longer and whose cases are under appeal are completely denied the right to work. Why would the Government deny them the right to work rather than allowing them to make a dignified contribution to society?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I informed the Business Committee a few days ago, grassroots housing activists are planning a housing demonstration on 5 December and have requested that Deputies, rather than attending the demonstration, have a debate in the House on solutions to the housing crisis. I hope that debate will be arranged. There are many reasons that people wish to protest, including the welfare of children, economic evictions and the lack of public housing. In light of the O'Devaney Gardens controversy and the determination of the Government and some of the Opposition parties to dispose of public land to private developers for the purposes of providing social and affordable housing, will the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government tell us how much the social housing element of those developments will cost us when we buy them back from the private developers to whom the land was given?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Department's guidelines for the acquisition of dwellings suggest shocking upper limit figures of €400,000, €500,000 and €700,000 for social housing units.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are those the prices the public will pay for housing from private developers on land that was given to those developers by the State?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am opposed to both of those developments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How much will people pay for social housing units?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How much will people pay?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sometimes we are so focused on individual measures we do not take the time to step back and look at the big picture in terms of the economy, the amount of wealth that exists in the economy, who gets the benefit of that wealth, how it is distributed, and whether it is distributed fairly. The only opportunity to do that is during the Finance Bill, which is why I have tabled a series of amendments asking that the Government produce reports to get the information we need to examine these issues. Even with the sources available to me as the finance spokesperson for a small party with limited resources, I find the situation shocking. When we discussed this yesterday, I noted that most people would be shocked to know that the net worth of Irish households currently stands at €740 billion. That is the net figure, after liabilities. If that was shared out equally, everyone would have €150,000 each. Of course, the truth is the vast majority of people have no savings at all and often owe more than they own.That enormous wealth, which has been generated and increased dramatically over the past seven or eight years, is concentrated in the hands of a tiny group of people. It is not me saying this; the information is from the Central Bank's quarterly statistics, which show that 53% of the €740 billion of wealth I described is concentrated in the hands of 10% of the population. The top 5%, comprising 85,000 households, have roughly €3.26 million each, on average, which is incredible. Vast amounts of wealth are concentrated in the hands of an absolutely tiny group of people while the vast majority either owe more than they own or have no savings and struggle just to pay bills relating to childcare, mortgages or rent. They survive on meagre earnings. Other figures that I do not have to hand - I do not believe the Minister of State disputes these because I spoke to him earlier as he has examined them - show the share of national income that goes to profits versus that which goes to wages. That has dramatically shifted in favour of profits over the past 20 or 30 years, more so in Ireland than in any other country in the western world. Far from there being a trickle-down of wealth as Ireland records some of the highest levels of economic growth anywhere in the western world, it is gushing upwards into the hands of a tiny group of people. By means of these amendments, I am arguing that we need to address this and see it as a problem. Of course, it is a social problem. In the early 1970s, people in average jobs, if they had jobs, could hope to be able to afford a mortgage. Now, well-qualified people with jobs cannot do that. It is a real and tangible expression of this growing inequality in the distribution of wealth. People work really hard in jobs and qualify for skilled work but their earnings are not enough to be able to put an affordable roof over their heads. This arises because much of the real wealth in the economy is invested in property assets and these are rented back to the people who cannot afford them at an extortionate price. People are sitting on money and it is making more money for them; they are getting richer while, in real terms, ordinary workers are getting poorer. It is in this context that we argue that there should be wealth taxes. This would help redistribute the fruits of large economic growth, and specifically the growth in household wealth, in a fairer way to the benefit of the majority and not just a super-wealthy minority.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The vast majority of the increase in household wealth is in the value of property assets, as the Minister of State has acknowledged. Financial assets are significant at €374 billion but there is €534 billion in housing assets. The Minister of State argues that if we impose a wealth tax, these people might move out of the country and take their assets with them. They could not take housing with them and one cannot carry land and property assets from the country. It might not be bad if these people moved their money from property because it could lead to the extortionate price of property assets falling. That would not be bad at all. I do not really see the downside. We could put just a 2% annual tax on the top 5%, comprising 85,000 people, who have an average of €3.26 million each in assets.If we were to allow them €1 million each, excluded from that, for their own families, we would raise €3.85 billion. They would not feel the loss of a 2% tax on that level of income. In fact, they would probably be richer the next year than they were the previous year given the current level of inflation on property assets. However, the revenue that would accrue from such a tax would amount to a great deal of money that could be spent on health, education and dealing with poverty and all the infrastructural crises - the desperate needs of our society expressed in here day after day. Does the Minister of State not consider that would be fair and reasonable?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will press it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 16:In page 92, between lines 14 and 15, to insert the following:
"Report on minimum effective corporate tax rate
34. Within 6 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall produce a report on establishing a minimum effective corporate tax rate of 12.5 per cent.".When people go to the Revenue website to look at corporate tax reliefs they get a table in a small font. I have been straining my eyes. A few years ago, I would have been able to see these figures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I seriously challenge anybody to read the figures in this table. This is with regard to access to important information. This is public money that is every bit as real as money that is announced in every budget to great fanfare, much public attention and scrutinised heavily with regard to the amount spent directly on health or education and allocated to various Departments. Depending on how it is calculated, and there is an interesting debate on what is in the base and not the base, the budget scrutiny committee estimates there is approximately €15 billion worth of tax expenditure every year and most of this rolls over from year to year. This is a lot of money. I emphasise that the Minister has had meaningful engagement with me on this matter. I also acknowledge that in the area of film relief he has genuinely listened and that he has also made some positive moves on IREFs and so on in the budget. However, as I have said to him many times, there is a whole lot more that needs to be looked at. Frankly, I still believe this is a massive scandal. To emphasise the point, in 2012, at the bottom of the crash, €74 billion of pre-tax profits were recorded. The figure for 2017 was €159 billion, which means profits have doubled more or less. The problem is that even the very modest 12.5% corporate tax rate is not paid on these enormous profits, which have doubled. When all of the loopholes in the interesting table that people cannot read are applied, the taxable income, as opposed to the pre-tax profit, drops from €159 billion to €79 billion. We have €80 billion worth of loopholes, expenditures and reliefs that write down the taxable profit so that the effective rate of pre-tax profits is not 12.5% but 5%. If the Minister imposed a minimum effective rate on pre-tax profits, he would generate approximately €9 billion extra in revenue a year and these companies would still be very profitable. There are lot of areas to look at but the one I really want to stress this year in the short time I have is intra-group transactions. I had to really look closely at the table to see this one. Intra-group transactions are mostly transactions between subsidiaries of the same company lending each other money. One company sets up a lot of subsidiaries and lends itself money and charges itself interest.The interest it has to pay back to itself is tax deductible, thereby writing down its profits and allowing it to pay less tax. We discovered this with, for example, Larry Goodman's companies in Luxembourg and so on, but they are all at it. It is amazing that the figure on this fascinating list for tax forgone due to intra-group transactions, which amounted to €9 billion in 2016, saw a massive jump from the previous year. I do not have the exact figure, but it was approximately €2 billion or €3 billion then. Guess what it was in 2017. It was €16 billion. It went from €9 billion to €16 billion between 2016 and 2017. God knows what it will be in 2018 and 2019. This is the major mechanism through which some of the most profitable companies owned by some of the richest people avoid paying their proper share of tax. They are lending themselves money and charging themselves interest, paying which reduces their profits. An interesting provision is that of losses forward whereby the banks that brought this country to its knees can use previous losses to write down their tax liabilities, meaning that Bank of Ireland, AIB and so on pay virtually no tax on the enormous profits they are now generating. Another interesting provision is the category called "Certain company reconstructions and amalgamations". It was in place last year but I am not sure as to whether it was in place the year before. This tax expenditure increased from €189 million in 2016 to €425 million in 2017. This is tax avoidance on a massive scale and is robbing the taxpayer of significant amounts of money that could go into health, education, public transport or a just transition in terms of climate change. One could go through the list of possibilities. I appeal to the Minister. A report on this is important. The Committee on Budgetary Oversight has started some of that work, but the next issue we need to examine closely is intra-group transactions. That the figure mushroomed from €9 billion to €16 billion in one year shows that it has become the major loophole through which many of these companies are writing down their tax liabilities. We need to examine what is going on, who is benefitting from the loophole and how to shut it down.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will comment briefly. It is around the area of whether the effective rate of corporation tax in this country is as the Minister stated or whether it is not that the debate centres. I dispute it because the Minister is referring to taxable income after all the reliefs, exemptions and deductions in the list I referred to have been applied. To me, the essence of the problem is the total declared profits, which have mushroomed, are not what are taxed. About half of that is taxed. How €159 billion in profits suddenly turns into €79 billion in profits - with €80 billion in the difference - and how the 12.5% tax rate is only applied to that second lower figure is the problem. At the centre of that, as the Minister rightly says, are intra-group transactions. As I tried to stress, intra-group transactions and transfer pricing involve subsidiaries of the same company moving money around in order to avoid paying tax. That is wrong and we have to address it. I accept the Minister is looking at it and I accept there are some measures here, as part of the OECD process, that are moving to address some of these problems but we are not going anywhere near far enough. Equally, it is shameful the banks are not paying tax because of losses forward. I did not mention the research and development tax credit. Again, it is mostly going to this same group of companies when it could be better directed, in my opinion, into public universities for research and development that would benefit the domestic economy. We disagree but I have put the point and hopefully it has some impact on Government thinking.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a global move for such corporations to start paying their taxes, and we should not be the laggards on the matter, but we are. Even though we know the curtain is starting to come down on the corporations, we think we should try to get as much as we can out of it before it does. That is a mistake, however, because we could get more by getting ahead of the curve than by being the laggards. I do not believe the idea that if we introduce a minimum effective tax rate to apply to companies that make the scale of profits that such companies make in Ireland, which will ensure they do not benefit as much from the clear loopholes they exploit and that we will get a bit more as a minimum - a minimum of billions of euro - they will all run out of the country. There is nowhere left for them to run, particularly in the English-speaking world within the EU, which is where they want to be, even more so after Brexit. The minimum effective rate would still be well below what the rest of Europe pays because, as the Minister rightly said, the nominal rates in Europe are considerably higher and probably average at more than 20%. Even with the reliefs they give, however, which might reduce the effective rate to 10%, 9% or whatever it is, the rates are still higher than what we pay on pre-tax profits. We could pitch it higher, get in a fair bit of money, and we would not risk them all running for cover because there is nowhere left for them to go. We should do it because it would give us a great deal of money for the infrastructure, housing and public transport on which they, as much as anyone else, rely, although they do not pay the fair share as a proportion of their profits that they should towards them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 18:In page 97, after line 32, to insert the following:
“Report on carbon tax
40. Within 6 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall produce a report on the carbon tax, fuel poverty and income inequality.”.Our opposition to the carbon tax is well known. It is not necessary when opposing an unjust, regressive and counterproductive tax to suggest that climate change is not a serious and urgent problem.It is an urgent problem. It is an emergency. We have a short timeframe to address that emergency before we do irreversible damage to climate, to biodiversity and to the conditions which sustain human existence on this planet. There is no question but that we need to address it. The problem is the carbon tax will not address it. First, we have a carbon tax and it has done nothing - less than nothing - to reduce CO2 emissions. CO2 emissions continue to rise. Ireland is failing spectacularly in meeting its targets, is facing hundreds of millions of euro of fines as a result and is trying to buy its way out of its emission reduction targets through the carbon trading system. The carbon trading system itself is another example of how trying to put a price on pollution is not the way to address it. The big idea ten years ago was that with carbon trading one can buy one's way out of the problem. Of course, that became an area for speculation and for the big polluters to buy the right to pollute more from poorer countries which emitted less. It is completely counterproductive. It is also counterproductive from the point of view of trying to win over the majority of ordinary people to support the fight for radical climate action and I ask the Government to consider this. If we are to make this change we need to have everybody on board. They must feel they have a stake in taking radical climate action and that they will not be punished for the crimes of polluting corporations and Government failure to address CO2 emissions. We know 70% of global emissions come from a few hundred companies. In fact, governments resist efforts to tax those corporations and use some of the enormous profits they generate from polluting industries, such as the fossil fuel industries, to redirect revenues into making the necessary transition. Instead of doing that, we punish the people who are not responsible and potentially alienate them from the battle to address the climate emergency. This amendment I have put forward particularly asks the Government to look at the issue of fuel poverty. It is estimated that 400,000 households or 28% of the population in this country are living in fuel poverty. The majority of those people are living in G-rated homes, in other words, poorly insulated homes, and are already suffering from poor insulation. They do not want to have to spend large sums heating their homes. They must do so because their homes are badly insulated. A very significant portion of them can do nothing about it because they live in private rented accommodation. They cannot do it. The landlord has to do it. Alternatively, they live in public rented accommodation - local authority homes - and they cannot do it. In fact, I spend quite a lot of my time making representations to the local authority asking on behalf of local authority tenants if it will insulate their homes and the local authority says it has not got the money to do it. By the way, and here is an interesting twist, in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, in the budget recently passed by the new coalition of Fianna Fáil, the Green Party, the Social Democrats, the Labour Party and Independents, they have cut the retrofit budget. They totally slashed it in their first budget. What already was a snail's pace of retrofitting of local authority homes will be slashed entirely. It is shocking. It is disgraceful that they would do it. It is unbelievable that the Green Party would do it. It is also shocking that the Government would allow them to do it given that we need to ramp up dramatically the retrofit of homes. We need to dramatically ramp up the grants to address the fact that 760,000 of the people in this country - one in six - live in poverty. How the hell are they supposed to retrofit their homes to insulate them, which would be of benefit to them? They would not be against the idea. They would be very much in favour of it because it would reduce their energy bills and would make their homes warmer. However, they are not being given the resources to do it. Now we will punish them for that fact with a carbon tax. We will punish them for that fact by taking public service obligation bus routes out of their areas in many cases with the BusConnects plans, by the reduction in subsidies, for example, the public service obligation subsidies, to Dublin Bus from €87 million a decade ago to €50 million, and by us having fewer buses in the Dublin Bus fleet than we had ten years ago. Already, people who depend on public transport who do not use private cars will now be doubly punished. They have already got a poorer public transport service and now they will be punished again with a carbon tax and possibly with higher fares. Public transport fares in this country are some of the highest in Europe and they have gone up by 80% in the past ten years. We continue to allow bus fares to go up when we should be reducing or abolishing fares and increasing the subsidies. There are many more areas I could go into. For rural Ireland, what is necessary is to give a sustainable living and payments to our farmers to enable them to move to forms of agriculture that are sustainable and do not emit so much CO2. Our rural colleagues are correct to be concerned about these matters because they have to be guaranteed investment and schemes that will make it possible, and not be punished for making a necessary transition.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I assure the Minister that I am very sincere about addressing climate change. Our policy is very detailed. We have just produced an extensive document on it and our budget submission, which we produce every year, also shows precisely how we will pay for it in a whole range of areas. I will not deal with them all now, but it includes aviation fuel charges, for example. That would raise a lot of money from the people who actually make profit from polluting. That is the difference. What about the big agrifood barons who are making profit out of one of the big polluting areas, not the small beef farmer who is struggling to survive? Do not punish him or her, punish the guys who are declaring their profits in Luxembourg and who are making a fortune out of this sector and then use the money raised to ensure a just transition for the small farmer. I must question the Government's bona fides
on this. In the first instance, it is not addressing the main problem, namely, that putting a price on pollution has failed. We have been doing it for several decades with carbon trading and with carbon taxes and it has not worked. I defy anyone to show me any evidence that would allow us to meet the targets in the eleven years available to us. We need much more radical actions. That means focusing on the main areas. In the context of energy, the Government should stop issuing fossil fuel licences now. Do not lock us into liquid natural gas infrastructure that will lock us into fossil fuel use for decades. Housing is another big sector. We need to retrofit approximately 120,000 homes a year every year for 20 years, which means the State is going to have to do it. No one else can afford the cost, it must be done by the State. Transport must be made cheaper and the subsidies have to increase. People will not get out of cars unless the Government provides better public transport. During my time in this House, more than anyone else I have raised the issue of afforestation. Since the first year I arrived here, I have spoken of the need to increase the pathetic levels of forest cover in this country. Our targets are pathetic but our delivery is about 50% of those targets. That has been consistent since I entered the Dáil. Furthermore, the forestry we do plant is often worse for the environment than no forestry at all. We need to dramatically change the forestry model, increase the level of planting and invest in renewable energy and in research and development around producing renewable energy sources. That means funding our universities which we are not doing either.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not see how the Minister can say that they will be protected when they clearly are not protected as it stands and I cannot see any measures here to protect the 400,000 households living in fuel poverty. Many or most of them cannot afford to do the retrofit they would like to do, which would improve their quality of life. They just cannot afford it and in some cases they would not be allowed to do it by their landlord, private or public. How can the Minister say it is fair to impose additional costs on people already suffering fuel poverty? I cannot see how he can possibly justify it, nor do I see how the Minister can justify allowing bus and train fares to go up and the subsidies to public transport to go down. I do not see how he can justify that and say that the Government is serious about climate change. On gas as a transitional fuel, in the past week the European Investment Bank has made a decision that, as of 2021, it will not lend any more money for fossil fuel projects. That includes gas. The gas industry is going ballistic about that because it was looking for special exceptions for gas on the basis that it is a transitional fuel but the European Investment Bank said "no" to that. As a result, fossil fuel lending will come to an end as of 2021. We, on the other hand, have put into the European Union as a priority project of common interest a liquid natural gas infrastructure to import fracked gas from the United States that will lock us into importing one of the most toxic CO2 emitting forms of fossil fuel for decades, long after we are supposed to have reached carbon neutrality and long after the environment needs us to reach carbon neutrality. The Government needs to take a long hard look at whether its policies are serious in addressing this emergency.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will wait for the Minister. I want to hear what he has to say.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was late to the debate as I was speaking to the protestors outside Leinster House who work in this sector and are very concerned about these proposals. My Irish Solidarity-People Before Profit colleague Deputy Gino Kenny has worked on this issue in more depth than I have. I am interested in hearing the Minister's response to the points we have raised, particularly in respect of those cases where doctors have said certain supplements may be of benefit on an ongoing basis to maintain people's health against certain conditions from which they suffer or are recovering. To impose this additional cost on the persons concerns does not seem to be a good idea. Surely we want to encourage people to look after their health and well-being? It is difficult to see how we can demarcate the line between food supplements and foods without ending up on the wrong side of it in many cases and unfairly taxing products that should be treated as foods. On a lighter note, I am big fan of Bob Marley whose biography details how he visited Ireland many years ago in great anticipation of enjoying huge helpings of his favourite food - a type of seaweed called Irish moss - only to discover that it was not for sale in shops here. I am almost certain that one can get it these days in precisely the types of shop we are discussing. This is something that for Bob Marley and many others in Jamaica was a food, indeed a very healthy food. However, one is likely to find it for sale here only as a food supplement which will be treated differently from food for VAT purposes. The same taxation regime will apply to many other products, such as fish oil which may be described as supplements. That is a mistake. It will be detrimental to people's health in some cases if they can no longer afford the products, as well as being damaging to the small businesses that produce and sell them. I am very sympathetic to the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He had to eat fish and chips because he could not buy any Irish moss and felt pretty ill because of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 29:In page 130, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:
“Report on local property tax
74. Within 6 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall produce a report on the local property tax and its implications for funding for local authorities.”. The property tax is still a live issue and nobody should fool themselves politically about that fact. The feeling is that once the general election is out of the way, the property tax will only go in one direction and that is up, and that the Government has been holding off on the revaluation and increases that will follow because it knows how politically damaging it would be to increase it, as would have had to be the case if the original plan for the tax had been followed through. The Government has backed away from that because it knows how regressive people feel it is. It may dispute this, but it is a fact. The property tax replaced a progressive model of funding for local government with a regressive form of funding. When it was introduced, it was suggested that was not what was happening, and that the introduction of a property tax would lead to better local services and more funding for local government. Those of us who opposed it always felt that was a nonsense, but what we said has turned out to the case. There has not been an extra cent for local government. Far from there being more money for some local authority budgets, in Dublin, notably Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council and Dublin City Council, budgets are being cut.  The Fianna Fáil, Green Party, Labour Party and Social Democrats alliance now controlling Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council cut the budget for retrofitting, which we should be doing more of, as well as the environmental awareness and community grants budgets, while increasing rates for small businesses and parking charges. One would have thought the council had more money given the property tax, but it has less because for every cent it collected in property tax was offset against central government funding. The Government replaced a progressive tax, which was centrally funded through income-related tax, with a tax on the family home that has nothing to do with a person's income and ability to pay. We get nothing for that additional burden. I do not always agree with Owen Keegan by any stretch of the imagination, but he made that point in respect of Dublin City Council's budget. The rationale put forward was bogus and the evidence now is that is the case. This will get worse on the other side of a general election at whatever point some sort of revaluation or reconfiguration of the property tax takes place. That would be unfair and totally unjustifiable.  I am sure that in many parts of the country, as in my area, the value of people's houses has absolutely nothing to do with their wealth or income. It may be that the two correlate and some people have houses that are worth a lot while also earning a lot of money, but there is no automatic or necessary connection between the two. Many council houses in my area that people bought are now, through no fault of theirs, worth a fortune because no other council houses have been built since. Any kind of house is now worth a fortune, but that bears no relationship to the income of those in them and their ability to pay. People living in such houses are often on very low incomes. The system is not fair and has not done anything to improve funding for local government and the services that flow from it.  The evidence from some of the council budgets I have mentioned is that the situation is getting worse in terms of local government funding. That is my case for saying that we need a more progressive form of funding for local government, which is not based on the value of a property over which people have absolutely no control and bears no relation to their ability to pay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We fundamentally disagree. I do not think people's family homes can be considered wealth in the same way as people who have two, three or four houses - besides their family home - and rent those out to make money. For me, those rented houses are wealth-generating assets. People putting a roof over their head is surely just doing a basic thing needed to exist in society. I do not see that as wealth, but as something that society should be able to provide for people. Our society does not provide that, but people do manage to get to the point of at least having a roof over their heads through immense struggle, hardship and hard work. They are then, however, going to be charged for having that home even when it is not a wealth-producing asset. In any event, the value of a home is not dictated by the owner. There is a relationship between the bricks and mortar required to build a house in Roscommon and the similar materials required in Ballybrack, but the value of the resulting houses will be completely different. That has nothing to do with the intrinsic quality of the buildings, but with the fact that the market, which is completely out of the control of the homeowner, has driven up the price to a certain level in one area compared with another. Those two properties, however, will be taxed on that differential. That is fundamentally unjust. We excluded the family home in our proposed wealth tax, even for the 85,000 richest people in the country who are worth €3.5 million. We think a wealth tax should be imposed on those people, but we removed the family home from consideration because we think it is different from a wealth-producing asset. That is a sustainable and reasonable position.  Turning to local authorities, would the Minister give them the power to tax the profits of property developers and land speculators and allow them to generate extra revenue that way? That might give the local authorities a few options.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not drawing a distinction between these two things is the problem. There clearly is a difference between a home in which people live and worked hard to pay for because they needed it to live in. There are only a few ways for people to get an affordable roof over their heads in our society. There is a major difference, however, when we then consider people who own second, third, fourth, fifth, tenth or even 100th properties, and which they can rent out to generate revenue. Those are two very different things, but the Minister does not treat them differently in the property tax. That is the problem. To me that is an injustice and that is the reason we will continue to oppose a family home tax. Perhaps that is a better way to put it and that is the way we termed the tax when we campaigned on this issue. We are opposed to a family home tax and that is what his tax is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, I am.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 30:In page 130, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:
“Report on relief for investment in film
74. Within 6 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall produce a report on section 481 of the Principal Act and its relation to developing quality employment in the film industry.”.My brain is addled at this stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputies will be glad to hear that this is my last amendment and this is one where we have a bit more common ground. I genuinely thank the Minister for engaging with me on the issue of the section 481 tax relief for the film industry. I refer to the extent to which it needs, should and is required to contribute to quality employment and training in the film industry and the development of that industry. I thank the Minister's officials for engaging with us as well. They have responded to some of the points I made, largely on behalf of those who have worked in the industry for decades. They believe that investment in creating employment and training in a film industry in this country is a good thing and that we should do more of that. They do not believe, however, that the current incentive has had the desired effect. The employment and training provided has not been of sufficient quality, even though that is the intent of the tax relief. I refer to particular parts of the industry. As the Minister and his officials know, I have distinguished between the film industry and areas such as the animation sector, where the relief has had a major impact. In that sector, there are companies of scale, people have secure jobs and income and, as a result, Irish animation is boxing at the very highest level on the international scene. That area is really going from strength to strength. That has not, sadly, been the outcome to the same extent in the film industry. There have been many successful productions, but the provision of quality employment and training has not been the same in that sector. As a result, there is a quite a debate or controversy, to put it mildly, going on in the industry.  I will not recapitulate the whole debate. As I said to the Minister when we met earlier to discuss this issue - I hope it is okay to mention that - the problem is that film production companies which apply for the relief are then subsequently denying that they are the employers. The way they do that is, for each film production, the Irish production company sets up a special purpose vehicle, SPV, or designated activity company, DAC. It is not really a company. It is merely a financial instrument. It is an accounting tool for that particular production. However, when workers attempt to assert their rights as employees, the Irish producer company which applied for the relief which is conditional on the provision of employment and training, says to the employee that it is not his or her employer and that the SPV is his or her employer. The SPV only exists for the film and then it is gone. Then the same producer company makes another film, sets up another SPV but it is a different employer, even though it is the same employer. Then it makes another film, sets up another SPV but it is a different employer, but actually it is the same employer. This is the problem. It means that people who have worked on film after film for the same producer and the same recipient of section 481 relief are not accumulating the rights that they have under law, particularly under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 which was precisely designed by the European Union and enshrined in Irish law to ensure that this kind of thing does not happen. To concretise it, it means that those workers are completely vulnerable. There is nothing to stop the film producer saying to a worker that he or she has worked for the film producer on three or four films previously and has received awards and credits, as many of these workers have, but the film producer will not take him or her on the next film because the worker asked for the application of the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997, in terms of hours of work, breaks or whatever. The producer company thinks the worker is asking for too much and is a troublemaker and it will not employ him or her on the next production. As we speak, that is what is happening. On RTÉ News tonight, one will see, if one looks at the entertainment section, reference to the sequel for "Vikings" being produced in Ashford, County Wicklow. I refer to people who worked for that producer company, Metropolitan and World 2000, which produced "Vikings" before it, "Into the Badlands" before that, "Penny Dreadful" - I can go through the list. If one went to those previous productions, looked at the credits at the end and looked at who were the stage hands, the construction-grade staff, the drivers etc. to see how many of them are on this new one when those credits role, at present the answer is "very few". They have already contacted this film company and said that they worked on its last few productions and they are hoping they will be working on these ones and they are being told that they will not. Co-incidentally, some of those people or their associates are people who went to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht discussing this issue nearly two years ago where they made allegations about the failure of the producer companies to vindicate the rights of workers and fully apply the law on bogus self-employment, the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 and other employment requirements. It is many of those people or people associated with them who now will not be allowed onto that production that is in the news tonight. That is not acceptable. I have had a sympathetic ear from the Minister in this regard and from his officials. I hope that we will design the public support which we need in this industry in such a way that what I refer to cannot happen and that workers who ask for their legal rights will not be displaced.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister and his team for their genuine interest and engagement and for some of the very significant improvements they have made on foot of the debates and discussions that have gone on on this front. No doubt it is a project to project issue. Having said that, well in excess of €1 billion has gone into the film industry through this relief over the past ten or 15 years. By any definition, that is a lot of money. It is an indisputable fact that people who have worked in that industry for ten, 15, 20 or 25 years do not know when the next film production financed with that relief happens whether they have any chance of a job. In fact, there is nothing to prevent the recipient of that relief or one of its agents saying they are sorry, the worker worked there for the past 20 years, but he or she is not coming in on the current one. They do not have to give any reason because they are not the employer: the employer is a different entity. That is a real problem and it is current. People will not have an income coming into this Christmas as a result. That is what we are talking about. I refer to people who have credits and awards to their name and who were part of award-winning films. That cannot persist. In the short time available, I repeat my welcome for the engagement of the Government. I hope we can move this forward so that we create an industry of scale and with a more secure pool of employees with skills, trainees etc. that will help all of this industry and help arts and culture in this country develop and expand.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will withdraw the amendment. The Minister said he will look into it.
