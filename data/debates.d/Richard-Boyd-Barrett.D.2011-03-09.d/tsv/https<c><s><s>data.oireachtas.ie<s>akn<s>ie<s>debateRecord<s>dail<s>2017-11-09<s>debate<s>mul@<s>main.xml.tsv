RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Paradise Papers, so-called, or what I think should more accurately be described as the parasite papers, reveal a nexus of elite, super-wealthy individuals, banks and corporations, such as Apple, stashing away countless billions of euro in offshore bank accounts, in places like Jersey in the Channel Islands, in order to hide those billions from the taxman here in this country, and robbing the people of this country of valuable revenues that we need to deal with the housing emergency, the shambles in our public health service, the gross inequalities in income, the poverty and the massive deficits in our infrastructure - all the many urgent and desperate needs. Billions upon billions being stashed away has been revealed in these papers. I want to ask why it is that the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, when he was Minister for Social Protection, using public money, ran a nasty, unfounded campaign about welfare cheats. Where is the campaign about the super-wealthy corporate tax dodgers who are genuinely robbing us all of the hundreds of millions and billions we need for housing, health and other urgent social problems? Where is the campaign? Where is the outrage? Where is the opprobrium? Does the Tánaiste not agree that the Government and Deputy Michael Noonan have very serious questions to answer about tax changes that were made in 2014 and revealed in the Paradise Papers, that coincided with Apple restructuring its tax arrangements when the double Irish tax scam that cost us €13 billion in tax revenue was rumbled because of international and public outrage? Coincidentally, Deputy Michael Noonan changes the tax regime to benefit Apple and other corporations at the same time that they relocate some of their subsidiary companies to the Channel Islands and, as a result, we lose up to €800 million in tax revenue from Apple alone, never mind the other companies that almost certainly took advantage of this change.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is absolutely true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it a coincidence that Deputy Enda Kenny met the CEO of Apple in January of 2014 at the same time that outrage was being expressed and pressure was coming on the issue of the double Irish? Then, lo and behold, in the budget of October a new loophole was opened up in the tax code to benefit Apple and other corporations like it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is too much of coincidence. Where is the investigation? Where is the outrage? Where is the campaign against these super-wealthy tax dodgers who are robbing the people of this country and the world of these tax revenues?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not a word from the Taoiseach when he met Mr. Tim Cook recently in the United States about the aggressive tax avoidance of Apple.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are probably going to be investigated by the EU for a second time. This will be on top of the investigation into the €13 billion tax dodged by Apple in the double Irish scam. Commissioner Vestager is discussing investigating-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----what happened, what Deputy Noonan did in 2014 to change the tax code and the restructuring of Apple's tax arrangements as regards the Isle of Man. The Government will not even take the €13 billion from Apple and put it into an escrow account as it has been ordered to do by the EU. The EU is taking infringement proceedings over our failure to ratify the anti-money laundering directive, which we were supposed to have ratified in June and which relates to tax evasion and-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----the beneficial ownership of deposits. The figures are stunning. After this tax break was introduced by Deputy Noonan, benefitting Apple and other corporations, tax breaks on intangible assets increased from €2.6 billion to €28 billion in one year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is hundreds of millions, if not billions, of euro in tax revenue lost as a direct result of what Deputy Noonan did in 2014.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where is the outrage? Where is the investigation? Where is the campaign on buses-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----paid for with public money asking people whether they want to deal with these tax dodgers who are cheating us all?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As long as Apple agrees.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I make a suggestion on that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The arrangements would only allow for seven slots.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government and the committee have 50 minutes between them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They have 30 minutes between them to begin and then a further ten minutes each at the end. That leaves only 70 minutes for the rest of us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is precisely my point. I suggest we change that and make them five-minute slots.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Leas-Cheann Comhairle need not worry, we will fill the time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What are we doing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Five minutes. And will everybody be allowed speak?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Two.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appeal to the Government to drop its opposition to the Bill proceeding to Committee Stage. It is not too late to change its position. I welcome the engagement with Fianna Fáil and Sinn Féin over the past week or two. Notwithstanding their concerns and those of the Joint Committee on Health about aspects of the Bill, which must be taken seriously, they are willing to engage. This is what is necessary because tens of thousands of people in this country are suffering from chronic pain, multiple sclerosis, the effects of nausea from chemotherapy and a host of other conditions for which there is, to quote the experts, strong evidence of the efficacy of medicinal cannabis. That is the view of Professor Mike Barnes, a consultant neurologist who did the authoritative report on this issue for the British Parliament. Professor Barnes has refuted the argument made by the Minister and the joint committee and he, unlike the Minister and members of the committee, is an expert.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Health Products Regulatory Authority is not an expert body either.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When members of the joint committee asked representatives of the HPRA what specific expertise they had in the area of medicinal cannabis, the answer they gave was "None".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	David Finn, a professor of pharmacology at NUI Galway who has studied medicinal cannabis for 16 years, stated the decision to leave chronic pain out of the Minister's compassionate access programme made no sense. Professor Finn, Dr. Cathal Ó Súilleabháin and representatives of the Irish Medical Organisation stated the strongest evidence-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not know why the Minister is shaking his head. He should read the Barnes report and stop interrupting me. He spoke earlier and will have more time to respond. Witnesses at the committee stated the strongest evidence in respect of medicinal cannabis was on pain. The joint committee's report states that pain is complex, which is correct. However, we do not mind allowing opiates to be prescribed when there is widespread opiate addiction caused by opiate based painkillers and benzodiazepines. We can regulate these products with the complexities of pain but cannot do so with medicinal cannabis, even though all the evidence shows that opiates are much more dangerous than medicinal cannabis. There is no evidence to back up the statement that there would be leakage to recreational use. Professor Barnes and Dr. Ó Súilleabháin stated that no evidence of increased recreational use of cannabis or increased problems relating to cannabis has emerged. Specifically, there is no evidence of diversion of medicinal products to the illicit market. As in Ireland, illicit cannabis is so widely available in the countries in question as to make diversion insignificant. We have diversion with prescription painkillers, yet the Minister has not banned them. We have diversion of opiate based drugs, even though their use is not based on the prescriptions given. The Minister has not banned those drugs or argued that they cannot be regulated, as he has argued in the case of cannabis, despite the absence of any supporting evidence. Why can Germany, the Netherlands and a number of US states do what is proposed in the Bill? The problem with the HPRA regulating this issue - this concern was raised by Sinn Féin and Fianna Fáil - was that its compassionate access programme did not provide access. Other countries abandoned their access programmes and introduced laws similar to what we have proposed. They dealt with the issue by having their version medicinal products regulatory authorities establish a new subdivision to deal specifically with cannabis. We are open to an amendment providing for such a change. This could be easily achieved on Committee Stage if there was a will to do so. If this Bill is not the vehicle for doing so, it will be two years before we have another Bill on this issue, on which we have spent a year already. Vera Twomey collapsed with stress outside the House and her daughter is in Holland. It is disgraceful that thousands of people will be left out in the cold. The alternative is to work together as parliamentarians and progress the Bill. Professor Mike Barnes and representatives of the IMO will come to the House next week. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister meet them and allow the Bill to pass?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I went five seconds over my time.
