RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the long list of threats that President Trump's agenda represents to the world, near or at the top is his climate sabotage, that is, his determination to derail global efforts to deal with the climate emergency. I am disappointed, to put it mildly, that the Taoiseach made only a cursory reference to that. In recent days, the Government has made great play of its concern and determination to act on the climate emergency but for the world's greatest climate saboteur, we not only invite him and roll out the red carpet but do not challenge his climate-wrecking agenda. Is that because the Government is ultimately not so concerned about the matter? Most notably, the Government continues to set its face against People Before Profit's climate emergency measures Bill, which seeks to give expression in law to the central demand of the global climate movement, namely, to keep fossil fuels in the ground. Like President Trump, the Government does not wish to upset the global fossil fuel industry and, therefore, it uses the trickery of money messages to underpin its determination to frustrate efforts to keep fossil fuels in the ground. It does this despite knowing, as does everybody else, including scientists, that the precondition for addressing the climate emergency is to keep 80% of known fossil fuels in the ground, rather than providing opportunities to explore for and extract even more fossil fuels, as the Government seems determined to do.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The power of mass movements and people power to face down repressive, brutal and authoritarian governments has been demonstrated in spectacular fashion in the past couple of weeks in Hong Kong. I mention also in passing the similar heroic protests against brutal repression in Sudan. However, I have to say that although the question is about Singapore, there is a deafening silence from the Government and European-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry, it is Hong Kong. There is deafening silence about this repression and I wonder why that is the case. Are we so silent when this fantastic movement of people power faces brutal repression because we feel compromised by our significant trade relations with China?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The persistence of millions of protesters, mostly young people, on the streets of Hong Kong forced the Chief Executive, Ms Carrie Lam, very reluctantly to back off, after first trying brutal repression involving rubber bullets that injured about 80 people. Ms Lam did so because the protesters did not give up, although she will still not resign after what she has done. Let us be clear. Carrie Lam is dancing to the tune of a brutal, authoritarian and undemocratic regime in China. It is interesting that this is occurring close to the 30th anniversary of the massacre in Tiananmen Square when the Chinese authorities butchered students and rolled over them with tanks. Since then, they have ruled with an iron fist, attacking civil rights activists and lawyers who defend people and their human rights. They have also been responsible for the persecution of about 13 million Turkic Muslims, the Uighurs, the people of Tibet and Kazakhs. They use vicious repression. The extradition Bill in Hong Kong was an attempt to go after and extradite many people who have fled to Hong Kong from China. What are we saying about China's ruthless authoritarianism?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I find that approach amazing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do actually because in certain circumstances, we would be very happy to condemn and denounce violence, repression and the destruction of human rights but then we want to pedal softly with China because we have many trade relationships with it. The same goes for Saudi Arabia and I suspect the reason for the silence around Sudan is not dissimilar. The problem with that approach is that if the Hong Kong regime, operating on behalf of the Chinese regime, had succeeded in using violence to repress the mass protest movement, we would have done nothing about it. Thankfully, the people power movement overcame that - for now - but let us remember Tiananmen Square and think about the millions who are being oppressed by the Chinese regime. Should we not be a little more robust in calling out this stuff? Do we take a soft pedalling approach because we think we must develop our trade relations with China and that, therefore, we should just be silent about this stuff? Very little was said at the height of this by the Government or European leaders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I am saying it was a weak statement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People Before Profit will also oppose this proposal to send 14 more Irish troops, in this case rangers, to a deadly conflict and war that is raging in Mali for many reasons. Before explaining why we are opposing this planned deployment, I should note that our opposition to the Government's plan is not in any sense a criticism of our troops who may be sent to Mali if this House makes the decision to do so and in that regard, if Fianna FÃ¡il backs the proposal, it seems they will be sent. I have absolutely no doubt about the bravery, courage, professionalism and heroism of members of the Defence Forces, the personnel who are already in Mali on the EU training mission and, for that matter, those who will be sent and rotated if this mission goes ahead. Our opposition is because the political decision being made is a big mistake. From the point of view of Ireland's neutrality, the safety of Irish soldiers and the impact on the war and conflict in Mali, we think there are dangers involved or, worse, that sending our troops would be counterproductive. Members of the public need to know what is going on in Mali because they do not know a hell of a lot about it. The Minister of State's speech has not illuminated our understanding of the conflict, the historical situation in Mali that led to that conflict, the role of the different powers involved in military intervention as part of the UN mission and, as has been mentioned, the crucial role of France. The public is not being informed. I do not know the degree to which the rangers or members of the Defence Forces generally are being informed about what is going on. If they were informed, we would be in a better position to have a serious debate about this before the Government rushes off and sends troops into a deadly conflict in which terrible massacres of hundreds of people have been perpetuated by all sides in the past three months and 177 UN peacekeepers have been killed over the past three years. We are sending our troops into a deadly situation. There has been no real explanation as to why this is happening, the context or what might come out of this endeavour. To put it in simple terms, this mission breaches our neutrality. Most people understand that our neutrality has something to do with our historic opposition to empire and colonialism. In so far as people have a view of the commendable and noble tradition of the Defence Forces being involved in UN missions abroad, it concerns peacekeeping. On both of those counts, this mission does not qualify. We are now involving ourselves with a colonial intervention. The French are backing the Malian armed forces and we are going to be involved on this mission, backing Mali and its armed forces. The French Army is a colonial force with a long history of trying to control this area and ruthlessly crushing opposition movements. As has already been mentioned, the Tuareg is the most notable of those movements. The colonial carve-up of the region was the ultimate cause of this conflict. The other cause is the desperate poverty in Mali. It is worth mentioning that as well. Half of the population lives below the poverty line, life expectancy is 55 as a result of malnutrition, access to clean water is lacking and adult literacy stands at 38%. That is despite Mali having considerable mineral resources. All of that desperate poverty is a direct result of colonialism and French colonialism in particular. We are effectively going into Mali and underwriting a colonial intervention to allow France to maintain its influence and control in the area. That to which I refer is a very dangerous thing to do in the context of the welfare and safety of our soldiers. It is also dangerous to our reputation internationally as people who are not associated with imperial and colonial interventions, as well as to our neutrality. In any meaningful definition of neutrality, backing the armed forces of the Malian state in a civil war has nothing to do with that concept. It is a clear breach of neutrality. This is a serious matter because the lives of Irish soldiers are on the line. As has already been mentioned, we do not pay these soldiers properly and their allowances have been slashed. The result is that they are already at the bottom of the ladder in terms of public sector pay. The Government refused to restore those allowances and many members of the Defence Forces are living on family income supplement. We are, however, willing to send them into this deadly situation. It is a great tribute to the heroism, bravery and professionalism of our Defence Forces' personnel that many of them want to go on this mission. They want to hone their skills and try to do some good. The political context in which they are being sent, however, is dangerous for those troops and also flies in the face of our military neutrality. There is a very simple question we should ask ourselves. Why have the Canadians pulled out of this mission having previously participated? If the Minister of State is concerned about understanding the nature of the conflict and protecting the welfare of our troops on this mission, has he had a conversation with the Canadian Government? If he has, could he please relay details of that conversation and the rationale regarding why Canada pulled out of the mission to the House? That would be very illuminating. The other context relating to this issue is Ireland's desire to get a seat on the United Nations Security Council. It is interesting to note that we are competing with Canada for that position to some extent. Is coincidental that just as the Canadians pulled out of the mission, Ireland has rapidly stepped into the breach? We have done that without a proper public debate. Are Irish troops being put in danger by engaging in peace enforcement instead of our traditional role of peacekeeping because of a desire to get a seat on the Security Council? The UN was not terribly happy that Canada made a decision to pull out of its involvement in Mali. I suspect there is a connection and that is another important reason for us to not get involved in this mission. I do not think the timing is coincidental. Nobody could suggest that what we are doing is not a serious departure from the traditional practice and understanding of peacekeeping. There is no peace to keep in Mali because a war is going on. It is a very bloody war with many massacres. The UN and the EU are now involving themselves with forces from a country, France, that has a definite colonial agenda. People in Mali know that. Those involved in the conflict have bitter experience of French involvement in Mali. Ireland being connected to that, even indirectly - though in reality it will be direct and will be perceived as such - is going to implicate us in the French role and agenda. There will be immediate damaging consequences for the safety of our personnel. Our reputation as a neutral state will also be damaged. I do not state that we oppose this deployment lightly. If the troops are sent, then we have to exert pressure to ensure that their security will be protected as much as possible and that they are as well equipped as possible. Given all that I have stated, however, I do not think these troops should be sent at all. The Government is sending them into danger and doing so in a way that damages Ireland's international reputation as a neutral power.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Jack Chambers will still back the Government.
