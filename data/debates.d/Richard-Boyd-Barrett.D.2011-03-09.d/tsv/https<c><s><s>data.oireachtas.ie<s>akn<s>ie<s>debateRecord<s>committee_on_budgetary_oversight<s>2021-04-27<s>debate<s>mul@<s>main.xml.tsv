RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister for his contribution. There was relief last week when he talked about no cliff-edge for Covid-related income supports but in recent days that relief quite quickly gave way, certainly on my part and I suspect on the part of many people out there, to deep concern at suggestions that the PUP payment might be cut in the near future for sectors where there are still large numbers of people unemployed through no fault of their own because of the impact of Covid measures. I want to get an assurance from him that people who have lost employment and income, as a result of the pandemic, are not going to be further punished because they happen to be in the sectors that are worst hit. I think it is important to put it that way. Some sectors have been hit much worse than others and they are going to be the longest impacted, or scarred, by Covid. The idea that there would be a withdrawal of PUP payments from, for example, taxi drivers, whose industry is on its knees, musicians, arts people, cultural workers, areas linked to aviation, certain parts of retail, and hospitality, and that they would be punished by cuts in the PUP in the short term, when we are still a long way from the recovery of those sectors, would be unacceptable. I want to get an assurance from the Minister that that is not the case. I would like the Minister to comment on the reports that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Michael McGrath, is talking about troika-style monitoring of public service budgets, which is a very alarming echo of the austerity policies that failed us so badly in the aftermath of 2008. Surely one of the things we have learned from Covid is that in areas like health, ICU capacity, hospital capacity and public health infrastructure, we do not need retrenchment; we need more investment, more spending and more capacity building. The same can be said about education, higher education and, obviously, public housing and affordable housing. We do not need retrenchment in these areas. We need significant increased investment because big deficits in these areas have been further revealed because of Covid. Again, I want an assurance that that is not the case. Indeed, I could add climate-resilience infrastructure to that list as it needs significant increases in spending and investment. Any talk of troika-style retrenchment would be extremely worrying when we need to move in the exact opposite direction. Perhaps the Minister could respond to those points.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will slightly press the Minister on that issue. The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, will bring a memorandum to Cabinet today. I am not sure what is in the memorandum, but it certainly raised alarm bells. It would be very helpful for the Minister for Finance to give reassurances to people, particularly those in sectors where there is likely to be quite a long-term impact from Covid. I previously referred to taxi drivers. They will be protesting on Thursday. Their sector will not recover until the music, entertainment, aviation and tourism sectors recover. It would be completely wrong to cut their PUP, as it would be to cut the PUP of workers in sectors such as music or entertainment where it is clear they have lost income and employment opportunities as a result of Covid and are likely to be the longest impacted by those factors. Assurances in that regard would be helpful. It is not just about the fact that there are emergency Covid payments and public services. My point was that Covid has revealed significant deficiencies in spending and investment in several areas. It is important that we do not go backwards, to where we were previously, but, rather, recognise the lessons of Covid. We need to increase capacity in ICUs, hospital bed numbers and public health teams around the country to name just a few examples. Similarly, we need investment in schools such as in better ventilation, better quality buildings and smaller class sizes. Surely these are the lessons of Covid. Learning those lessons means increased investment and capacity building. I have given just two examples. Housing is another I could add. Any talk of just returning to the situation pre Covid would not be learning the lessons of the pandemic in terms of going to the new and better normal that has been much spoken about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Doherty and I have asked questions about the PUP. I am still getting slightly conflicting signals from the Minister and would like to get a bit of clarity on the PUP. Some sectors will, of course, recover, As public health restrictions are lifted, people will be able to go back to work and they will not be on the PUP, so the Minister will not need to maintain it for them. In respect of continued public health restrictions or the scarring effect on particular areas, a few of which I have mentioned, such as aviation, music, entertainment, certain areas of hospitality and tourism, since people's loss of employment and income results from Government public health policy, can the Minister give an assurance that he will maintain supports for those groups because otherwise he is, in effect, punishing those worst hit by the pandemic? This would be pretty ironic considering, as the Minister pointed out, some people have not been impacted economically at all and some sectors of our economy and some of the wealthiest people and most profitable businesses have done extremely well during the pandemic. It would be grossly unfair to pull supports from the worst affected while others have done extremely well in the pandemic. The Minister should give assurances that he will not do that at any point when the loss of income and employment is not the fault of these people but is a consequence of the pandemic and measures the Government took to address it. If the Minister does not give this assurance, people will be very angry. Another question I put to the Minister last week to which I have not received an answer is in the same ball park. Why has the Government consistently refused to extend schemes like the CRSS and the CBAS, the grant support schemes for people who have ongoing fixed costs that they cannot cover because of loss of revenue, to people who do not have rateable premises? Those groups have been as badly hit - in some cases, even worse - as those with premises but the Minister has refused to extend the grant support schemes to them. Again, I refer to musicians, taxi drivers, people in events and so on. Why is the Government not giving them support when they are some of the worst hit when it comes to covering their fixed costs and when the debts they are accumulating are going to make it very hard for them to recover?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I assume the Chairman is not going to allow me to respond but if the Chairman gives me time to answer the Minister's question, I am happy to do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not think the Minister quite explained why some people are excluded. On the point about zero Covid, we would not be in such a precarious situation having to decide between high circulation levels of the virus and reopening after a long period of lockdown if the Government had introduced a zero Covid approach at the appropriate time and not made the mistakes it made in December and January, which have left us in a much more protracted period. The truth is that there is tremendous fatigue and there will be no stomach for trying to reimpose even harsher restrictions. However, the Minister should do everything to avoid a fourth wave so there should not be premature accelerated reopening, which could produce a damaging further wave and greater lockdown. There should be mandatory quarantine to keep the variants from coming in and completely destroying the vaccination programme and the progress that people's hardship has achieved.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was my answer.
