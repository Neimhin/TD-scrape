RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Masks like the one I am wearing are sometimes associated with stick-up robberies. It is kind of appropriate that it is politicians who are now wearing the masks that are associated with such robberies. It might be even more appropriate for the chief executive officers of some of the largest and wealthiest corporations to be wearing them, given the scale of their theft of tax revenues that should accrue to society in general from the absolutely staggering profits those corporations make. Those profits, which they make from the people working for them and on which they pay negligible levels of tax, are obscene. If the Minister does not start from that point, he is just being plain dishonest. The court did not dispute in its ruling that Apple paid 0.005% tax on vast amounts of profits.That is obscene. There are no two ways about it. It succeeded in paying that derisory level of tax on vast profits by working through companies incorporated in this jurisdiction. The fact that the General Court of the European Union concluded that the Commission could not prove that the Revenue authorities conferred selective advantage on Apple does not take from the fact that Apple achieved that aim of paying a derisory level of tax in Ireland. Does anybody seriously believe that Revenue and the Government did not know that was happening? Does anybody believe that for one second? Unless we accept that Revenue and the Governments of the day were complete idiots, and I do not think anybody believes they were, then they knew what was going on and the derisory levels of tax that were being paid. However, the Commission could not prove that it was an arrangement designed specifically for Apple, although that is what it believes. I have always believed that it was not just Apple that benefitted from such arrangements, but also a select group of ICT companies and possibly some pharmaceutical companies. They are certainly not arrangements from which the vast majority of domestic small or medium enterprise in this country benefitted. In that sense, a very select advantage is conferred on these enormously wealthy companies. Of course, the trick in all this is centred around intellectual property. This is not a historic issue. I love the concept of intellectual property. Firms were and are allowed to allocate profits to a company that is tax resident nowhere but is the holder of the intellectual property or the idea. They can allocate any amount of profit they wish to the company that owns the intellectual property. That is what they do. Every year, a company can declare profits of €1 billion, but give €990 million in royalties to the company which is the owner of the intellectual property and which is tax resident nowhere, thereby writing down taxable profit to negligible levels. They effectively write their own tax bill and the State allows them to do it. These practices are an insult to the workers of the companies. The Government often declares that it must defend the jobs of the workers in Cork. That should absolutely be done. However, the idea that all of the wealth is generated by a company that is tax resident nowhere but holds "the idea" is insulting to the workers who produce iPhones and, indeed, those who sell them in Europe and the rest of the world. Apparently, their labour activity is worth nothing and the profits all result from "the idea". The ideas and the CEOs are not what kept us going and kept everything moving during the pandemic. Rather, it was the workers who do the physical work, the essential workers and the front-line workers. The ideological notion that one can attribute all the value to "the idea" or the intellectual property is a very capitalist and neo-liberal one which we should reject. That is an aside. The crucial point is that none of this is historical. After the events which gave rise to the case, corporate profits went from €83 billion in 2013 to €190 billion in 2018. That is a 228% increase in gross trading corporate profits. In 2018, there were €190 billion in profits. That is a massive increase. How much tax was paid on those profits? A total of €10.4 billion. That is not 12.5%. No matter how many times the Minister asserts that these companies are paying 11.6%, as he just did in his address, they are not doing so. If they were paying 12.5% or even 11.6%, they would be paying approximately €23 billion in tax. How are they getting away with it? They are writing down their taxable profit on the basis of royalties paid to the company that possesses the idea or the intellectual property. In that way, they siphon off the profits such that the taxable profits are derisory and the effective tax rate is reduced to a negligible level. These practices are still going on. After pressure domestically and internationally forced the Government to do away with the double Irish, which was the mechanism through which Apple avoided taxes in the period covered by the ruling, the Government opened new doors for these companies. It is still going on. It is shameful and it is robbing people not just in this country but across the world of revenues that are needed for health, education, housing and infrastructure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Congratulations again, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, on your victory. I welcome the establishment of a Ministry responsible for higher education and research. It is a very positive move. If the importance of investing in research in medicine and other areas needs to be underlined, one need look no further than the lessons of the pandemic itself. There is clearly a deficit in these areas, but we have a lot of skilled and talented young people, graduates, postgraduates and so on. We need to invest in them and in research that will really benefit our society. I hope that lesson is more obvious than ever after Covid-19. The purpose of this Ministry should be to ensure that access to higher education is as wide and unfettered as possible. One key aspect of that should be the elimination of all fees for students entering third level education or undertaking postgraduate degrees. They should not have to suffer some of the highest fees in the European Union; a €3,000 registration fee for undergraduates and a €6,000 fee for people doing masters degrees. That is completely unacceptable. It was unacceptable before Covid-19 and it is entirely unacceptable now. Many of the opportunities for undergraduates to take summer jobs to earn money for their fees are gone. Their parents may have suffered reductions in income or loss of employment. If we really see the importance of education and want to open it up, we should remove all the financial obstacles and eliminate all fees to provide the widest possible access. Of course, people will say the socialists believe there is a free money tree and we do not have the money for that. Let me point out that as a proportion of GDP, our spending on education, health and just about every other key public service is among the lowest in Europe. Investing more in public services and in key areas like education is not a radical idea. It is standard across Europe. The problem is that we redirect resources away from higher education and third level education towards tax breaks for research and development available to wealthy multinational corporations that pay a pittance in tax. Rather than invest money in research in our public universities, we give nearly €1 billion a year in research and development tax breaks to some of the wealthiest corporations in the world. It seems to me that they have enough money. We should close those tax loopholes. We should redirect the €700 million or €800 million a year that goes to a handful of multinational corporations into our universities to remove fees and invest in more research and greater access to higher education. I might have left my points at that and welcomed this Bill, but there is a big difficulty. This Bill and the setting up of this new Ministry are linked to something absolutely scandalous, namely, the plans to increase by €16,000 the already high salaries of Ministers of State, as if €124,000 is not enough. Last night, when I asked the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, how he could possibly justify this, he said it was fair to expect pay equality around the Cabinet table. I thought about this for a minute and realised the Government believes in pay equality in the public service. That is why people earning €124,000 could not possibly work beside other Ministers who are on higher salaries though they do the same job. They must be given a €16,000 increase. It is only fair. We must have equality. Then one remembers that apparently the same principle of equality in the public service does not apply to teachers, who are on a fraction of that salary. It is okay for teachers entering education after 2011 to earn a substantially lower starting salary than the teachers doing exactly the same job beside them do. Inequality is okay there, but it is not okay between Ministers around the Cabinet table. It is also okay for lecturers in higher education to earn a starting salary of €38,000, though those who started before 2011 earned €42,000. That pay inequality is okay, but we cannot possibly have pay inequality for Ministers on €124,000. We have to give them an additional €16,000. That is a scandalous double standard. Those double standards will be felt by our nurses and front-line health workers more than anyone. They were the ones who protected us and continue to protect us at great personal cost during the pandemic. What did those health workers get as their reward from the State for losing their lives and suffering the highest Covid-19 infection rates of health workers anywhere in the world? They got a round of applause. They did not get a pay increase or pay equality. I suggest we save the cost of this pay increase by just giving the Ministers a round of applause, the same thing they gave the nurses who protected us. That is hollow thanks for the workers on the front line who protected us. Ministers must have pay equality and they must get €16,000. The double standard is frankly nauseating and it will not be lost on people. I have just come from a meeting of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response which heard from taxi drivers who are financially on their knees. How will students who cannot get summer jobs pay the fees they are now being charged for attending lectures one day a week? They are still being charged some of the highest fees imaginable. Workers in the arts, music and entertainment industries have seen their incomes decimated but the Ministers of State must have a €16,000 pay increase on top of a €124,000 salary. It is absolutely shocking. We would like to support a Bill to create a new Ministry for an important area like higher education and research, but how on earth can we possibly support a pay increase for junior Ministers with already massive salaries? If they need pay equality around the Cabinet table, why not reduce the pay of the senior Ministers? That would be a better way to achieve pay equality. It would be a bit fairer. It would send a better signal to the people who are suffering because of the economic fallout of Covid-19. That is my suggestion. Let us give the Ministers of State a round of applause instead of a €16,000 pay increase.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is nothing short of nauseating that the Government would consider it okay to increase the already staggeringly high salaries of super junior Ministers of €124,000 per annum by €16,000. How can it possibly justify that when nurses who were infected with Covid-19 on the front line did not get sick pay? That is the reality. Nurses recruited to the call for Ireland on agency contracts and on a fraction of the salary of these super junior Ministers did not get sick pay when they were infected with Covid-19 yet three super junior Ministers think they need an additional €16,000 per annum on top of their existing salaries of €124,000. It is unbelievable.  When I challenged the Minister of State, Deputy O'Donovan, about this yesterday and asked him to provide an explanation or justification for this pay increase for super junior Ministers who are already on high salaries he said that we need pay equality around the Cabinet table. People need to dwell on that fact. Our nurses have been fighting for pay equality for years now and it has been refused and resisted. There are nurses who, because they were recruited after 2011, have to work alongside other nurses who do the same job and are paid more. Pay and equality exists for super junior Ministers but the Government appears to think that it does not apply to workers on the front line, fighting to protect our health and our society. For a person on a salary of €124,000 per annum in the role of super junior Minister pay inequality is unacceptable. The double standards and hypocrisy of that are shocking beyond belief and an insult to our nurses, healthcare workers and front-line workers and others in the higher education area for which one of these super junior Ministers has responsibility.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is. A lecturer recruited post-2011 starts on a lower wage than a person recruited pre-2011. That is a fact. That pay inequality exists for lecturers in third level education. It is unacceptable, apparently, for super junior Ministers to have to put up with pay inequality. The double standards are nauseating. It is a pity Government has tarnished a good Bill, which has the good objective of setting up a new Department of higher education and research, with this backdoor attempt to boost the salaries of three people who are already extortionately well paid.
