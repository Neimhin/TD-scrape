RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the publication of this report, which was commissioned to respond to the belief that there is widespread concern about the current taxation and licensing arrangements for gas and oil.  I certainly believe that when gas and oil are discovered and go into production, the people of this country get next to nothing from it, in effect.  In that context, the production of this report by an Oireachtas committee is a welcome development.  Although I would go a little beyond what is recommended in the report in a number of areas, frankly, the implementation of the recommendations made by the all-party committee would be a major step in the right direction.  The Minister should take them seriously.  One of the reasonable points made in the report is that oil prices are likely to stay on their current upward trajectory, which means that oil companies' interest in exploration will increase over time.  Ireland is a relatively politically stable place compared to many of the other locations where exploration might be considered and is therefore attractive from that point of view.  Crucially, technological innovation in the area of locating and extracting gas and oil reserves has improved dramatically and consequently some of the obstacles that might previously have discouraged gas and oil companies are not problems to the same extent they used to be.  In that context, Deputies from all parties have recommended we should increase the tax take significantly.  I do not see why the Minister would resist this.  It is probably not so many years since he would have been one of those shouting loudest for there being a significant benefit to the public from our gas and oil reserves.  For that reason, he should implement these recommendations, as a minimum step towards ensuring the people of this country gain some benefit from our oil and gas reserves rather than giving them away to private companies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	According to the figures I have from the Numis Securities research department report, France had a take of just under 50%, not 35%.  I do not know how to explain the divergence between my figures and those of the Minister.  There is a very interesting graph of the tax takes of various countries that shows us at the absolute bottom, with by far the lowest amount of tax take for our citizens of any country in Europe.  The table shows Ireland with its tiny 25% take; a percentage it does not even receive because private companies get capital write-offs.  At the top are countries such as Iran and Venezuela which take about 90%, with most countries taking somewhere between 50% and 70%.One might reasonably argue there has to be some incentivisation but, to use the Minister's phrase, we have gone to the funny farm end of the spectrum in that we are getting virtually nothing.  The arrangements are such that we stand to get virtually nothing for the citizens of this country from the current regime.  I do not see the point of that and clearly the all-party Oireachtas joint committee also recognises this.  What is the point in having drilling and production if we get nothing from it?  This report is an attempt to redress the balance in favour of ensuring the people of this country gain some benefit if there are significant oil finds.  I welcome the Minister saying we must discuss this in more detail and it is urgent that we discuss it early.  To take the experience of Corrib, we made a bags of it on every level, public consultation, environmental and in the terms given to the private oil companies.  We made a bags of it and must ensure we get it right this time.  That means shifting the balance towards the public interest and away from the interests of the big oil companies.
