RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This Bill and budget 2016 are thread bare attempts at making it appear that the Government is giving something back when it has given back next to nothing against a background of having slashed social protection payments to the degree that the levels of poverty and deprivation among the most vulnerable sectors of society have spiralled through the roof. The small give-backs, including the €3 increase in pensions and the €5 per month increase in child benefit, are pathetic, given that rates have been frozen for the past four years and that the groups hit most have been the victims of other cuts in so-called non-core social welfare protections and payments. There are many people who, against a background of spiralling levels of poverty and deprivation, received nothing in the so-called "give-back" budget, including widowers, those in receipt of invalidity pension, carers, people with disabilities, jobseekers and carers under 66 years of age.There is nothing in it for people with a disability, for the one-parent family payment, for the deserted wives' allowance or for the supplementary welfare allowance. There is no increase in the living alone allowance. All the people in those groups who have had their incomes slashed and battered with cuts and austerity and who have had their core payments frozen or cut over the past four or five years get absolutely nothing back. It is that which puts us in a situation where we have doubled the number of people living in consistent poverty to 376,000, where 1.4 million of our population, which is an increase of 128%, are suffering deprivation and where 211,000 children are living at risk of poverty or in poverty. All those situations have deteriorated or, in many cases, are still deteriorating because of the biggest failure of all of this Government, which is its failure to deal with the housing and homelessness crisis. That crisis has resulted from the Government parties' decision to reduce social housing provision from the trickle that it was under Fianna Fáil, which had already generated a crisis, to stop it altogether in the first year they were in government. They ceased the building of social housing and compounded that by slashing rent allowance in 2012 and that has led directly to the homelessness and housing catastrophe we have now, which is getting worse on a daily basis. Let us consider the rates of rent allowance, on which the Minister, Deputy Burton, refuses to budge. The rent allowance for a single person, under the rent allowance scheme, is €520 per month, for a couple it is €750 per month, for a couple with one child it is €950 per month, for a couple with two children it is €975 per month and for a couple with three children it is €1,000 per month. Where on this planet, not to mind in Dublin where rents have gone up by about 16% in the past two years, would one find accommodation for those amounts? It simply does not exist. We begged the Minister to increase those rent allowance thresholds or even to give real flexibility, but it is not happening.  The Minister may have heard on the news about a man, with whom I was dealing, who was living in a tent on the beach. He has now moved out of the tent but he may be back living in it after only moving out of it two weeks ago because the Department is still refusing to sanction rent allowance for him. The Minister will be getting an e-mail from me begging for this money to be sanctioned, otherwise that man will end up back living in a tent along with seven other people who are living in tents on Killiney beach, and that is only the tip of the iceberg. When is the Minister going to stop giving tax breaks to the multinationals in this country and start giving some real protection to the people who are homeless, who are without houses and who are suffering poverty and deprivation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will speak first.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to focus on a few points. First, I would not underestimate how outraged people are about the decision of Bank of Ireland to essentially exclude most of its customers from doing business in its branches. This sums up everything that we have done wrong and it will be a constant theme in all the points I want to make about this Bill. What people find infuriating is that this is a case of here we go again. The banks we bailed out - which brought the country to its knees and which cost us six or seven years of cruel suffering - have decided to just turn around and spit at us in the face. It is as simple as that. This bank is spitting at us in the face. People are outraged about it and I do not blame them. This is on top of the banks' refusal to give proper debt relief to those who are in mortgage arrears. People find the latter nauseating. Somebody texted me before I came to the House and suggested that Bank of Ireland customers should be outside its branches tomorrow picketing, protesting and taking their money out of their accounts. I could not agree more. What is happening is disgusting. However, those in government allowed it to happen because of their determination to nurse the banks back to health, sell them off to the private sector and allow them to be a law unto themselves in order that they can do it all over again to us. It is the small things that sometimes cause explosions and the Government may find that this will become a focus for some of the accumulated anger about the way it has let the banks off the hook. In my initial response to the budget, I made many of the points about the generally unfair and regressive impact it will have and the laughably so-called tax give-away or "give-back". The points I made on budget day have been underlined by previous speakers. However, I will put it very simply: why does somebody earning in excess of €70,000 need €1,000 more when there are people who cannot afford to pay their rent, who are ending up sleeping in cars, tents, hostels or on the street and to whom €1,000 would make a considerable difference? Why did the Government need to give €1,000 back to people who have more than enough to pay the bills? That amount is ten times more than the Government gives to somebody on social welfare. It is cruelly unfair and it shows the callousness of the Government and its complete lack of understanding of what is happening to many thousands of families. Some 130,000 families are on housing waiting lists, thousands of people are in emergency accommodation and tens of thousands of others are in mortgage arrears and fear the loss of the roof over their heads because they cannot pay the bills. These people literally cannot keep the roof over their heads. They should have been the sole focus of the Government's budget changes in terms of giving anything back but instead it is giving multiples to the people earning in excess of €70,000 a year. That is obscene. As I said on budget day, in some ways all of that is small beer compared to the really big-ticket item contained in this Bill. As I noted previously, it is like the magician's trick - one hand is keeping people occupied with the smaller detail while the other is doing the real business. That is how magicians work and that is how this Government works. The really big-ticket item, the real give-away, is contained in this Finance Bill in something that, relatively speaking, has received little attention, which is focused on only in the business pages, and that is the knowledge box. This is where we reveal the true colours of the Government in its determination to continue the wholesale transfer of wealth from the poor and the less well off to the super rich, to accelerate this process and to frustrate the efforts of a growing chorus of international voices demanding that something be done about this concentration of wealth in the hands of the multinational corporations. The concentration to which I refer has reached obscene levels. Just as the noose is beginning to tighten on these people, the Irish Government gives them another way out by means of a new double Irish mechanism. Let us not forget that the double Irish mechanism, which has allowed them to avoid tens upon tens of billions of euro in taxes in recent years, will be phased out up to 2020. As of the beginning of next year, they will have two ways to avoid tax, they will have the knowledge box and they will have the double Irish mechanism, just so they can work out exactly how they are going to operate this tax system to ensure they do not have to pay any extra at all. That is part of the explanation for the mystery of the sudden appearance of €2 billion in tax revenue, the unexplained €2 billion. From where did it come? It has come from the corporations which, courtesy of the Government, have been using the double Irish to avoid tax for the past number of years. Then, because the whistle was blown by some of us who became Members of the Dáil and by a growing number of people around the world who said "This stuff has to stop", money mysteriously appeared which now can potentially be taxable income. This money will not, of course, be taxed because even though it will be included on the books, it will benefit from the knowledge box provision. Previously, this money was siphoned off. It could not be clearer what is going on. It all centres around precisely the abuse, exploitation and manipulation of things such as intellectual property and patents, which are at the centre of the knowledge box, and that is precisely what was at the centre of the double Irish, whereby increasing billions of euro were siphoned out of the system through the so-called trade charges - or royalties - on intellectual property and patents. The Minister's Department even produced a paper on this matter for the sub-committee that was examining it. Again, that was prompted by some of us who demanded that it be investigated, although the Minister refused to allow some of the main players involved to come before the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure. So terrified is he of these multinationals, he would not even allow a discussion about the suggestion that they should come before the committee to happen in public - the cameras had to be switched off. The figures have again been buried in these papers that nobody reads. They show that the amount of income that was siphoned off under the category of trade charges increased from €5 billion in 2006 to €21 billion in 2011. Some €16 billion extra each year was siphoned off through royalties and patents under the double Irish. Now the same will be done with the knowledge box. Billions and billions of euro will be siphoned off.Why are the people not grateful for the so-called budget giveback? Why has it not given us a bounce in the polls? Why is Labour still going to be obliterated in the coming election? The Government could have saved itself from that if it was just willing to make some of these guys in question pay some extra tax and, in so far as it got a little bounce from them this year, given it back to the people who actually needed it. Our alternative is for an extra fiscal space of €2.2 billion. This includes adding in the €700 million that under the EU fiscal rules one is not allowed to. That €2.2 billion would cover the cost of abolishing property tax, water charges and reversing almost all of the social protection cuts imposed since this Government came into office. If, in addition to that, one made the multinationals pay the actual 12.5% on corporation tax, imposed the financial transaction tax and imposed a third level of PRSI on employers and employees who earn in excess of €100,000 a year, then the Government would get an extra €4.3 billion which would cover the cost of giving €1.5 billion extra to education, €1 billion extra to health, and abolishing the universal social charge, USC, for everyone earning less than €70,000 a year. People would be grateful for that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Two minutes is not enough time to do justice to this subject. The utterly unspeakable tragedy that occurred in Carrickmines must be the catalyst, if all of the tears are not to be crocodile tears, for radical, urgent and immediate change in how we treat Travellers. In considering my contribution to this debate and in putting forward amendments, I thought that the first people I should consult should be the Travellers themselves. Incidentally, that should be the guide to our policy, our response to this tragedy and to what is needed. My amendments simply convey to the Minister what representatives of the Travellers said is required. They said, first, that we must establish a public inquiry into what happened in Carrickmines. It is worth mentioning that the Romanian Prime Minister has just resigned amid mass protests in Romania following the death of dozens of Romanians in a fire in a nightclub in the last few days. That should give us pause for thought about our response and our responsibility for what happened in Carrickmines. They have asked also for the immediate reversal of the 87% cuts that have been imposed on the Traveller accommodation programme, which has led to the appalling situation with Traveller accommodation throughout the country. Those cuts must be reversed. They ask that we enact a series of measures to address State racism affecting Travellers, including the immediate recognition - no messing around, no reviews and no talks - of Traveller ethnicity and a policy of zero tolerance when it comes to politicians or public officials who play around with anti-Traveller racism, which they do all of the time.
