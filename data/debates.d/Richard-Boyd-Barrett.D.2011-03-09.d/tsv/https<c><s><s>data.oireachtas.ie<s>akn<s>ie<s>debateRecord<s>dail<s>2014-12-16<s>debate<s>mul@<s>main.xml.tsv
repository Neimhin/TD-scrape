RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A question that arises time and again for me and, I suspect, quite a few Members of this House - in the context of the recent protests and, in a general sense, based on people's experience of austerity and their financial difficulties - concerns the running sore of ministerial pensions. People keep talking about this and are outraged and furious that some of the key Ministers and taoisigh involved in bankrupting this country have walked away with enormous severance payments and salaries. I would like the Minister to give some detail on this. While I know there have been some changes, I contend that even sitting Ministers and taoisigh will be entitled, after just two years of serving in this Government, to a pension. The Taoiseach will get €20,000, while a Minister or the Tánaiste will get €18,000 just after two years. The average civil servant, however, would have to work 40 years to get an equivalent amount. Ministers, on top of being entitled to pensions, get a Deputy's salary and so on. How does the Minister respond to the anger and outrage over that sort of injustice?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I raise this issue because it angers many people. While I acknowledge that it is a complicated area and a number of changes have been made, it makes people's blood boil when they hear a report that 111 former Ministers were paid pensions worth €9,653,000 in 2012. Notwithstanding the Minister's response, I understand the Taoiseach can walk away with a pension of €20,000 after only two years in the role, and I presume the Taoiseach's pension increases in subsequent years. After two years, the pensions available to the Tánaiste and Ministers are approximately €18,000 and €15,000, respectively. The average public sector worker would have to work for 40 years to accumulate a pension of €20,000, whereas the Taoiseach receives that level of pension after only two years and, on reaching retirement age, he will also receive the pension provided to a Deputy and so forth. Having been hit with all the financial emergency measures, the universal social charge and pension levies, people ask the reason the Taoiseach and other Ministers can walk away from office after only two years with a pension of nearly 20 grand.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have studied the answer in detail. On the issue of constitutionality, there are two categories. There is a category of people, which includes former taoisigh and Ministers, who are associated with the bankruptcy of the country and who have walked away with large amounts of money. It infuriates people that they can be penalised for what they see as the crimes of others, while those who were at the helm walk away, effectively, scot-free. They would like the Government to re-examine what can be done and whether measures can be taken. They are outraged by this when they cannot make ends meet and have been hit with emergency measures, the imposition of water charges and all the rest. I sat through a committee meeting with the Minister at which we discussed fast accruals, firemen and gardaí. However, when we discuss Ministers, we find that the level of fast accrual is a multiple of what a fireman or garda receives. I understand that for a Deputy there is a fast accrual level of 20 years, but for a Minister it is two years, which is extraordinary and not comparable with the level for a fireman, a garda or a soldier. How can this be justified? They will also receive fairly generous pension entitlements as Deputies, having been remunerated very well as Ministers and so on. After two years they walk away with €18,000 or €20,000. Others say, "We will never get that; we might not get it as our entire pension entitlement at the end of our lives."
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My main question relates to corporation tax in Europe but I will first address other issues dealt with by the Taoiseach. I agree with the Taoiseach in his condemnation of the Taliban attack in Afghanistan, which he rightly described as wanton murder. That attack must be roundly and comprehensively condemned as an outrage but I hope our moral compass will be consistent when it comes to other outrages perpetrated against innocent children and families in Afghanistan. It seems to me that consistency is lacking as I have never heard the Taoiseach or anyone else speak of wanton murder when referring to the use of drones, controlled remotely in the United States of America, to kill innocent people in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taoiseach and others have, rightly, expressed outrage at this latest atrocity but I hope they do precisely the same and use the same type of language when it comes to the use of drone weaponry by the United States in Afghanistan. If anything has fuelled support for the Taliban it is the US occupation of Afghanistan and its consistent use of drone weapons to bomb wedding parties, villages and so on. Sadly, this is driving some people in Afghanistan into the hands of the Taliban. Much outrage has been expressed regarding the dire situation in Syria and the appalling record of the Assad government. The Taoiseach made reference to the latter and I could not agree more with the sentiments he expressed. The growth of ISIS in the mess that is Syria presents a serious danger and millions of Syrian people are suffering in the humanitarian crisis as they have been forced to flee their homes or killed. The Taoiseach articulated all of this but, as I have said previously, the key to unlocking this situation is to at least not obstruct the ordinary Syrian people from waging their struggle against Assad and ISIS, both rightly condemned by the Taoiseach. The Turkish Government continues to obstruct the capacity of Kurds in Syria to take on ISIS and Assad. Incredibly, the international community continues to designate the representative of the Kurdish people, the Kurdistan Workers' Party, PKK, as a terrorist organisation when, clearly, it is the legitimate representative of the Kurdish people and has been the most effective force in protecting ordinary Syrians against Assad and ISIS, most notably in Kobanê. Why does the international community continue to designate the PKK as a terrorist organisation when, clearly, it is not? The PKK has waged an effective fight on behalf of ordinary, innocent citizens who are victims of Assad and ISIS. I ask the Taoiseach to raise his voice on behalf of ordinary Syrian people and their political representatives who are fighting to save their lives and protect them from despots and sectarians. There is a big international campaign seeking the de-listing of the PKK as a terrorist organisation and Ireland should add its voice to this. On corporate taxation, the new Economics Commissioner, Mr. Pierre Moscovici, rightly said that the winds of change are blowing when referring to multinational companies that engage in aggressive tax avoidance across Europe. He noted that Ireland and Luxembourg are constantly implicated in such aggressive corporate tax issues. I found it interesting that the Taoiseach was effusive in his praise for Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker. He is now at the centre of this storm as, during his premiership of Luxembourg, tax rulings were passed in favour of multinational companies, including Irish multinational companies, that engaged in very aggressive tax avoidance on a massive scale. There has been a serious move against aggressive tax avoidance by the multinational sector in Europe.The problem is that we seem to be on the wrong side of the dividing line of attitudes in Europe to this phenomenon, with Mr. Juncker and the Taoiseach on one side while others say we have to do something about these multinational companies getting away with blue murder when it comes to not paying a fair contribution in corporation tax. Is that not the case?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is led by the PKK.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yet again, as we move through this Bill section by section, it stumbles from the shambolic to the borderline comic to the Chaplinesque and then back to the outright dreadful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I actually said I was thinking more of Charlie Chaplin. To be honest, there is a good bit of Groucho and the Three Stooges in there too. It would be funny if it were not so serious. Last week we spoke about the hidden costs of Irish Water. Here is another cost. Judging from the anecdotal evidence we have already heard from Deputies, we will have a hell of a lot of disputes with Irish Water. Where is the Commission for Energy Regulation going to get the staff and resources to deal with these complaints? It will be putting in for more money too. This will be another cost to add to the €130 million - or is it €160 million or €210 million? - for the conservation grant, as well as the hidden costs of administering these grants. It all piles up, leading one to believe the whole idea is becoming ridiculous. Due to all these consequences of setting up this quango, it will not make a cent but will rob people of more money. Following on from what Deputy Coppinger said, it is obvious that this will produce more problems and complaints because there are far more demarcation lines. There is the demarcation of what the customer’s responsibility is and what it is not. If it is not a customer’s responsibility, is it Irish Water’s, the local authority’s or the contractor’s? We have all these stools and everyone batting everything back to everyone else. A subject we have not brought up yet is that of rats. I am not talking about the Government or a certain builder who is in dispute with bricklayers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am discussing actual rats in pipes. A man who came to my office this week had rats coming into his house because of cracks in his water pipes. This is a serious problem and happens quite a lot when rats get into cracked sewer pipes. Many of these sewer pipes go across some of the demarcation lines I spoke about. In this man’s case, the sewer pipe is coming from a council property into a private property. Whose responsibility is it? It is quite possible that the rats are coming from the council’s area, but the problem is manifesting in somebody’s private property. The man in question claims it is the council’s problem, while the council is claiming it is Irish Water’s problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point is that we are going to have more disputes like this because we have Irish Water.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is obvious. To add to Deputy Coppinger’s examples, we have had two major leaks in Dún Laoghaire, one of which, on the West Pier, went on for weeks, with tens of millions of gallons of water pouring out of the pipe while the council and Irish Water argued over which of them was responsible. It went backward and forward and backward and forward, and the water just kept pumping out. Another leak in Monkstown went on for two weeks, with tens of millions of gallons of water pouring out on a main road. Who is responsible? Nobody is responsible - or we will fight for weeks over who is responsible. Somewhere down the line, in this interesting bureaucracy, the customer will have to navigate from the council back to Irish Water and then on to this gang. Will this gang be running a call centre? I do not know. The customer will go backward and forward, around and around on the merry-go-round, whereas once upon a time they just went down to the council and said, "Can you sort this out?". While they might have had to fight with the council, at least they could ask their local representatives to argue the case for them. There was some line of accountability and a physical office with real human beings, not disembodied voices in a call centre, with whom one could engage, as well as a democratic forum in which to raise matters. Now we have lots of demarcation lines, so nobody will be responsible and everybody will be responsible, and we have some disembodied entity a far distance away that is going to resolve the dispute. There will be far more disputes than we have now. Will the Minister enlighten us as to the costs for all of this? Are extra costs anticipated for the extra resources and staffing the Commission for Energy Regulation will need to deal with this new job? Believe me, it will have a big and confusing job.
