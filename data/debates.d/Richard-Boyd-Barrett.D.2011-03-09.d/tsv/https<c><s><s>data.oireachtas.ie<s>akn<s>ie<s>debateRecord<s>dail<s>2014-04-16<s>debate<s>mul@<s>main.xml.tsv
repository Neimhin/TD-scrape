RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When is the Government going to do that? When is it going to build council houses?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The first step in solving this problem is for the Minister to recognise that an emergency exists-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and that emergency measures are required to deal with it. I have been informed by officials from DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council that, for the first time ever, they have nothing to offer families seeking accommodation. They cannot even provide homeless accommodation. The officials in question are just telling people to go away. What is the Minister going to do about this? We all know there is a need for social housing. The Government is planning to build approximately 500 council houses at a time when 95,000 are needed. The 500 houses to which I refer will not even match the number of people who will go onto the waiting list this year as a result of their own homes being repossessed because they cannot repay their mortgages. Private landlords are pulling out of the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and leasing arrangements because they can obtain higher rents elsewhere. In such circumstances, the Government's plan is absolutely done for. What does the Government propose to do? That is what we want to know. We do not want the Minister to utter nonsense about supply. The Government should commence building social housing units now and, in the interim, raise the rent cap in order that people might source private rented accommodation. We know that the latter is not a long-term solution. What solution does the Government have for families who are currently homeless and on the streets with their children?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do so every day.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So it has nothing to do with landlords.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government should give money to the local authorities to allow them to do that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Please.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fine Gael and Labour control those local authorities.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	NAMA is the cartel.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Answer the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a major crisis in the national ambulance service - a crisis that leads to deaths. The estimate is that one person per month dies unnecessarily as a result of the under-resourcing and the cuts that have been imposed on the ambulance service. It does not get any more serious than that. People are dying unnecessarily. The cuts the Government is imposing - not just the recruitment embargo that impacts on these services but the more general cuts across the health services - are exacerbating this situation. When the Minister downgraded the accident and emergency services at St. Columcille's Hospital in Loughlinstown, we predicted that it would cause a crisis in St. Vincent's Hospital and this has now been confirmed by the consultants in St. Vincent's. This leads directly to further problems in terms of emergency vehicle response times because as the firefighters and ambulance drivers are reporting, ambulances are then queuing up for hours outside emergency departments because those departments are overwhelmed and under-resourced and there are not enough beds in the hospitals. All of these things are combining to cause a life-threatening crisis which the Minister intends to make worse by attacking one part of the emergency services that is working, namely, Dublin Fire Brigade which provides ambulance services in Dublin. Dublin Fire Brigade provides 40% of the emergency responses and must survive on only 9% of the budget. The Minister wants essentially to pillage that service in order to compensate for the crisis in the national ambulance service. It is outrageous. It is very simple. The resourcing levels in our fire and ambulance services must be brought up to international standards, there must be no more cuts and the Minister must lift the recruitment embargo so that we have the vehicles and resources to provide the services that save lives.
