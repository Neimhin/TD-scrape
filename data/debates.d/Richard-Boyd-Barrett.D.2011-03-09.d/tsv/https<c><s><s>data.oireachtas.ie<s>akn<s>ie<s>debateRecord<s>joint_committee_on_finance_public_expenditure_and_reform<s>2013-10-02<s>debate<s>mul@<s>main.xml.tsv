RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ms McVeigh's analysis and the Government position are all heading in the same direction - that is, that we should not do it. In my view, this is a mistaken view. It is disappointing that in putting forward this analysis, it is clear that the Department has not considered empirical evidence. No empirical study has been done and the Department has not listened to anyone who thinks it might be a good idea. I put it to Ms McVeigh that the Department's views and the Government's views are totally ill-informed as they are based entirely on a short-term notion of national self-interest which is not even based on any kind of empirical analysis. Given the financial crash suffered by this country as a result of global speculation I ask if the Department has a duty to look at what the costs of speculation were for this economy as a whole and to look at least at the possible merits of a financial transaction tax in order to prevent the catastrophic sort of collapse we have seen in our economy as a result of the activities of the speculators. In Ms McVeigh's view, should the Government and the Department not prejudge this but rather give serious consideration to the arguments on the other side? I suggest they listen to the people putting forward the argument and look at costs. Ms McVeigh talked about costs or potential costs to the State. I will suggest a very obvious cost which she has not even mentioned - that is, the cost to our economy, which is now suffering. This is the significant cost of massive unemployment, a huge debt, an economy crippled. There is a very good argument for saying that this derives precisely from letting these financial vultures, as I call them, off the leash over the past 25 years, with devastating consequences for the global economy. This should be quantified, in my view. There should be an empirical analysis. It might be the case that there could be a short-term cost, but there is a question of long-term cost if this is not done. What about the funds that could be raised? For example, Oxfam supports the financial transaction tax because in its view the moneys from the financial transaction tax are vital to financing serious action on climate change. The financial transaction tax is supposed to provide a back-up fund in case of further financial failure. The proponents of the financial transaction tax are saying the moneys raised could be key for financing major public investment to create jobs and stimulate economic growth. I suggest there should be a cost-benefit analysis of one argument as against the other. None of this has been done. We are getting a policy based on nothing. We are getting an opinion based on absolutely nothing. I do not expect Ms McVeigh to agree with me, but if we are going to have a serious debate we need to look at the reason the tax is being proposed, at the pro and con arguments. We need to have empirical analysis of what the effects might be at every level, positive and negative, so that we can have a serious debate. I ask if this is not a reasonable request from a member of the finance committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree it must be looked at. However, Ms McVeigh has pretty much admitted that there is no empirical evidence whatsoever for some of the assertions about the possible dangers. I will put one scenario to Ms McVeigh. We have a low corporate tax rate. When a corporation decides whether it will invest here, it does not just look at the financial transaction tax or the corporation tax in isolation; it considers the package and decides whether it would be better off in Ireland than somewhere else. Given that there is a pretty significant gap between effective corporate tax rates in Britain and effective corporate tax rates here, the idea that an extra tax of one tenth of 1% on financial transactions in the IFSC is going to lead to a flood of companies moving out of the IFSC and into London is bordering on the preposterous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ms McVeigh has made a statement about a cascade effect. This sort of thing needs to be analysed. Even if the figure were to be 50 times the original rate, that only amounts to 5%.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fifty times seems pretty high, in my view. I would like to see some hard evidence for this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be absolutely honest.When I hear that the organisations which have given the Department their opinions on this issue include the American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, National Treasury Management Agency, Central Bank, IFSC and the funds industry, it strikes me that I could have told Ms McVeigh exactly what they would say. I would like to hear the views of other types of organisations, so we have a chance of a balanced debate. On the question of how much a financial transaction tax might raise, Ms McVeigh indicated there would be costs and so on. The Central Bank's quarterly bulletin for this year shows there has been a massive increase in investment funds, up to a net worth of €1.1 trillion. Does this not suggest that the potential take from an FTT might well be considerably larger than the ESRI estimate of somewhere between €400 million and €700 million? Ms McVeigh has put forward a sort of qualification even on the ESRI estimate, pointing out that we would have to give some €300 million of those moneys back to the EU budget. Is it not the case, however, that the €300 million would be subtracted from our total contributions to the EU budget and there would, in effect, be a net benefit to the State?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that. However, taking the €180 million we are getting in stamp duty from, say, €700 million - as I said, that figure might even be larger given the high level of investment funds - we could still be looking at a potential net gain of something in the region of €500 million.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ms McVeigh's explanation calls to mind the American politician who spoke about known knowns, known unknowns and unknown unknowns. We could go on this way forever.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has there been a serious effort to quantify these issues? I accept the point that revised drafts are being drawn up and so on, but I have never heard any hard evidence to back up the assertion that there will, for example, be a large migration of financial transactions over to London.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will conclude by observing that the Department of Finance has a duty to be balanced in the way it examines this issue and analyses and presents the pros and cons. Unfortunately, I am not convinced that is happening.
