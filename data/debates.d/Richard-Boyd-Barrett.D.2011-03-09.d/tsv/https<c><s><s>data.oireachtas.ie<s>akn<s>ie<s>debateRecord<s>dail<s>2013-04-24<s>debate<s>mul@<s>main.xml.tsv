RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a disgraceful attempt to short circuit and pre-empt any possible negotiation with public sector workers over their pay and conditions and over the Croke Park deal. It is an act of bullying of workers by the Government. It is particularly outrageous that a Labour Party Minister would seek to bully trade union members, large numbers of whom put him and his colleagues into the House and Government, and show such contempt for what ordinary public sector workers have said with their vote. He is well aware that the representatives of workers have proposals that differ markedly from his way of dealing with the deficit problem and he should be open to listen to those proposals and alternative views rather than try to shove this down their throat and pre-empt any discussions with them. Shame on a Labour Party Minister for doing this. He should not try to ram this through in advance of those negotiations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When JobBridge was introduced some of us were sceptical about the claims the Government made for it and believed that, against a wider background of austerity and cuts that were crippling employment prospects, this scheme could be abused by employers to displace existing jobs. The instance I have cited for the Minister is a serious example of those fears being realised. I refer to a private company that is employed by one of our councils, Dún Laoghaire Rathdown County Council, with a major contract for waste collection in the county. One week it has people working for it whom it has to pay; the next week, those people are gone and replaced with so-called interns that the State is paying for, subsidising a private company.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the employees, Brian, stated:I was working in Ballyogan for one year and 11 months and I was told on Wednesday, 27 March that I would no longer be needed on 1 April. Now there is an intern doing my job. This intern is being paid from the Department of Social Protection and I had to sign on too, costing the State an extra €238 every week while Oxigen are laughing all the way to the bank.That is a very serious example of abuse of the scheme, and there is widespread anecdotal evidence of that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What does the Minister intend to do about that, and what measures will she put in place to ensure it cannot happen again?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The person I quoted complained to the Department of Social Protection on 21 March. It is now 24 April. The Minister says she is considering the complaint made. How long does it take to consider this matter and adjudicate on it? It appears to me to be a cut and dried case of abuse by, I repeat, a company that has a major contract with a local authority and is profiting from the contract that has been given to it by a public authority. There have been many other instances that I know have been cited to the Minister, including the use of interns for checkout jobs in Donegal and jobs in SuperValu. I understand Deputy Halligan mentioned to the Minister furniture firms in Waterford that close down one week, make people redundant, tell them to depend on the insolvency service to get their redundancy payment and reopen the next week doing the same job with interns in the jobs of the employees they had let go.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	More needs to be done to monitor this scheme. Will there be prosecutions of firms that have abused the scheme?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They all came from employees.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has nothing to do with Trotsky. It is about four people who lost their jobs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister should have some respect for them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Talk to the employees.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have finally heard some good news.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope it really is good news. I am glad the rent limits are being reviewed. It could not have come a moment too soon. I ask the Minister to consider a random sample from daft.ie of rents in the south Dublin area. In the case of bedsits, there is not a single rental property in south Dublin that is available today under or on the cap the Minister is proposing.This is causing havoc for people. I hope the Minister will take a lead from the local authorities in this regard. There seems to be an acknowledgement that, for example, while the rent cap for a couple with two children is €925, local authorities that are doing deals with landlords under RAS are actually agreeing to pay between €1,050 and €1,300 because they understand that the caps are utterly unrealistic. Will the Minister in her review take into account the fact that deals are being done under the rent caps? This means she should not conclude that there are many properties available at rents lower than the caps. Just this week I heard about the case of a couple, Emma and Keith, whose two children live with their father, but the father is deemed not to exist in terms of accessing rent allowance so they are paying €1,200 in rent despite receiving rent allowance which is capped at just €950. They have to cobble together the rest out of their social welfare payments. In her review, the Minister needs to consider the fact that, in reality, a large number of people are being forced to cobble together money to pay rent which is far higher than the caps. That is not acceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree it is an improvement to move rent supplementation to local government, for all of the reasons outlined by the Minister, particularly in terms of people seeking employment. I agree also that the long-term solution to this, or even the medium-term solution, is a major social housing programme, which would be better value for everybody and would far better secure the wants and aspirations of people for a secure roof over their heads. I hope the Minister will announce that we are to move away from the disastrous Fianna Fáil policy and towards building social housing. In the interim, however, rent caps in areas where rents are rising must be dealt with as a matter of urgency because, while I accept rents are falling in other areas, we must have realistic caps. I also ask that action be taken to make it illegal for landlords to say that rent allowance tenants will not be accepted, which is, frankly, the modern Irish equivalent of "No dogs, no blacks, no Irish", the phrase on the horrific signs that were used in Britain not 20 or 30 years ago. It is used to prevent people who need to rent property from getting it by landlords who seem to discriminate against people simply because they are unfortunate enough to need rent support or are unemployed. It is obnoxious and is also a major obstacle to people in finding the little bit of affordable rental accommodation that is available.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the past week or so a local newspaper in County Wicklow reported on what can only be described as a secret meeting involving the Tánaiste and senior administrators and medical personnel from St. Vincent's and Loughlinstown hospitals. It was also attended by Deputies from County Wicklow and the Labour Party Senator Aideen Hayden.The purpose of the meeting was to discuss the Government's intention to downgrade the 24-hour accident and emergency service at Loughlinstown hospital to that of a minor injury unit and to transfer the accident and emergency service to St. Vincent's hospital. I find it strange that the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, rather than the Minister or either Minister of State at the Department of Health is taking this matter. I find strange also that no Deputy from Dún Laoghaire was invited to a meeting to discuss an issue which has been very controversial for quite a few years. Despite that I have raised this matter during the Topical Issue debate on several occasions and have tabled numerous questions about it the Department, or whoever organised the meeting, did not have the courtesy to invite representatives from the Dún Laoghaire area, where the hospital is located. It is extraordinary that this should have happened. This smacks of political manipulation of the worst kind and shows disrespect not only to the elected representatives from the Dún Laoghaire area, but, more important, to the people of Dún Laoghaire, Loughlinstown, Shankill, Ballybrack and other areas surrounding the hospital.  I understand that at the meeting people were informed of the Minister's intention to bring a proposal to Cabinet to reconfigure accident and emergency services in south Dublin by downgrading the 24-hour accident and emergency service at Loughlinstown hospital. I would like to know why Deputies from Dún Laoghaire were not invited to the meeting. Had this anything to do with the fact that I and others have campaigned against the downgrading of these services? Also, where are the details of this reconfiguration? I understand that people were also told at the meeting that this reconfiguration would result in a better, safer and more efficient service. Given the large numbers of people regularly left lying for hours and often days on trolleys at the accident and emergency unit at St. Vincent's hospital it is hard to understand how it will cope with the overflow of the approximately 21,000 people per year who attend the accident and emergency unit at Loughlinstown hospital.  Can the Minister of State confirm that the hospitals' budget for the reconfigured services will remain the same? I understand they are to decrease by 3%. As such, not only will the accident and emergency service be downgraded but the budget to deal with the same volume of cases will be smaller. How does all of this tally with the long stated commitment of the Tánaiste, who is from Dún Laoghaire and, mysteriously, was invited to the meeting when other representatives of the area were not, to upgrade Loughlinstown hospital to a regional hospital and with the Government's commitment to care in the community and so on? This reconfiguration will result in a displacement of services so that they will be at an ever greater distance from people in the Wicklow and Dún Laoghaire areas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State's response is not satisfactory. Virtually every month for the past year and a half I have asked what is happening in regard to the reconfiguration of services in this area and about the possible downgrading of accident and emergency services at Loughlinstown hospital. I have been told time and again by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, that the report is imminent but it has not yet materialised. Lo and behold a secret meeting takes place at which everybody but those who have expressed opposition to the plan are told what is proposed. Even now, I do not know what is planned. The response provided by the Minister does not give details in regard to what will happen. I understand that people at the meeting were told that the 24-hour accident and emergency service at Loughlinstown hospital will be downgraded to a minor injuries surgery which will operate from 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., which is a substantial downgrading. How can the Minister claim, as suggested in the response, that this reconfiguration will, as a result of their being more experience people in particular areas, improve services when budgets are falling and St. Vincent's hospital accident and emergency service is already, judging by the number of people regularly on trolleys for hours and days there, unable to cope? How is St. Vincent's to cope with the overflow from Loughlinstown hospital once downgraded, which overflow is also likely to result in a deterioration of the service available to people living in the areas surrounding St. Vincent's hospital? Reference was made to proximity to the home in terms of the provision of services.The hospital was situated in Loughlinstown precisely to provide services for people in areas as far as south Wicklow, as well as in Cherrywood, Shankill and so on. The people living in these areas will now have to travel much further to access these services. This decision flies in the face of the commitment to provide services for people closer to home.
