RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Obviously it is positive to be discussing any measure that will improve workplace relations and streamline the Labour Court and the Employment Appeals Tribunal, and the whole area of workers' rights and conciliation in cases of dispute. However, I am not sure that what the Minister is proposing here will achieve that aim. I am not against - I would be broadly for - streamlining the system, making it more accessible, speeding it up because of course there have been major delays, and allowing people to understand clearly how to access the industrial relations and the employment rights machinery of the State. From that point of view, the aims are reasonably laudable but there is probably a big gap between the aims and the means by which the Minister is proposing to deliver on those aims. I wish to take up from where Deputy Joan Collins left off. It is not just about the machinery we have to vindicate the rights of people; it is also about identifying the rights of people. The context of this is that workers' rights in terms of the legal protection workers have are completely inadequate. The pitch is tipped very much in favour of employers as we discovered in some of the recent disputes and disputes going back over a number of years in which workers have been shafted by rogue employers with very little recourse or great difficulty getting recourse. One dispute, which I have to encounter literally day because the venue of the dispute is right next door to my constituency office and which I have raised with the Minister on a number of occasions, is the Connolly Shoes dispute. Those workers are still picketing four years later. It is extraordinary. When they were eventually able to access the Employment Appeals Tribunal, Labour Court and the whole lot, their case was completely vindicated and the employer was shown to be in the wrong. He had not paid them moneys owed and had unfairly dismissed them. All of this was established and he has just completely refused to engage and refuses to pay them. When the representatives of the workers have pursued the money through the courts and so on, he has hidden the money behind shelf companies he owns. Suddenly workers who thought they were working for Connolly Shoes discovered they were not working for Connolly Shoes but working for some other outfit, which happens to be owned by exactly the same guy, but apparently has no assets. So he has a range of different companies, some of which have the money insulated from any recourse for the workers to get hold of the money that the industrial relations machinery has determined they are owed. Everybody is throwing their hands up, claiming there is nothing they can do. It has taken four years and it looks as if they may have just about got there now. It is extraordinary to have workers picketing and in dispute for four years after essentially being turfed out by a rogue employer who refuses to pay them their entitlements. These are real problems. We had something similar with the Vita Cortex dispute and the occupation that took place in Cork. We have a number of these instances where our laws allow rogue employers to hide from their responsibilities and obligations to their workers by essentially playing fast and loose with company law which allows them to do that. We need to do something about that. The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has to address this. I do not claim it is an easy matter, but if a series of companies have the same directors and owners, and one of those companies has been found to be abusing the rights of those workers and has an obligation to pay them, there must be some way to prevent that person from hiding their assets with other companies. That just has to stop, as must hiding money offshore, as Deputy Joan Collins mentioned. There seems to be no political will on the part of the Government to make it stop. I want the Government to outline what it will do on that front. What happened in the Greyhound dispute - we are now seeing it with JJ Rhatigan - is just not acceptable. Something needs to be done where employers decide they want something and if they do not get it they can just lock workers out. There was much hoo-ha and criticism by certain quarters about workers who were blockading the Greyhound depot. However, not mentioned enough in those discussions was that those workers arrived at work at 7 o'clock one morning and without any warning, discussion, consultation or negotiation there was a guy outside with a new contract with a 30% pay cut. He said, "Sign this or get lost." The workers said they would not accept that and were told, "Sorry, you're out. We have a bus-load of scabs we're going to bring in to do your job." Those workers were then forced to go through eight or nine weeks of a dispute in order to force him even into negotiation. Laws need to be changed to make it impossible for employers to treat workers in that way.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the proposed new employment rights and industrial relations machinery to work, as I stated before the break, we need improved and strengthened legislation in the area of workers' rights. This includes dealing with rogue employers who refuse to pay wages and refuse to comply with awards and decisions made by the industrial relations machinery; dealing with employers hiding behind shelf companies; and dealing with the completely unacceptable situation highlighted in Greyhound, where an employer can just change somebody's contract and tell him or her to sign it or go, which led those workers to being locked out. We need improved legislation strengthening workers' rights in these situations. Another important area, which has been raised with the Minister a few times, is highlighted in the Rhatigan dispute, which has led workers to be locked out for six weeks, two of whom who have been occupying a crane for the past few days.They are alleging - frankly, I believe them - rampant abuse of the subcontracting system, the so-called RCT1 system. The Minister may not be fully acquainted with this. I talked to one of the workers involved. He says that, along with a number of other bricklayers, he was employed by JJ Rhatigan. Believing they were employees of JJ Rhatigan, five weeks later they had not been paid anything. When they protested about this, some money appeared in the bank account of one of these people which amounted to all of the workers getting â‚¬100 per week for the five weeks they had worked. When he questioned what the hell was going on, he was told he was a subcontractor. He said, "What? I'm not a subcontractor. I'm not employing these guys. We're just individual bricklayers who've been working for you for five weeks and believed we were employed by you. You're now telling us we're subcontractors." This bricklayer told me that he was not a subcontractor, had never been a subcontractor and did not want to be a subcontractor. This is a flagrant abuse of the RCT system. I have heard umpteen allegations of this kind of activity by big contractors. They then wash their hands and say they are not their employees even though they know quite well that these people have been brought in and essentially falsely described and categorised as subcontractors. That sort of thing is not on. Those workers should not be sitting outside that building site, which is a public-contract building site for a school with public money going into it with this sort of carry on going on. What will be done to investigate this activity which is rampant and has led to industrial disputes and will lead to more? As the construction sector picks up, will the Government take action and introduce necessary legislation to deal with this rampant abuse of the subcontracting system? Streamlining the industrial relations machinery will mean nothing if we do not strengthen the rights in legislation of workers to prevent these sorts of abuses and create a level playing field, which, at the moment, is heavily tilted in favour of employers, quite a few of whom then engage in rogue behaviour. There are serious problems with what is in the legislation. First, the potential for the adjudicator to dismiss frivolous claims is unacceptable and may even breach the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. As the professor of law in NUI Maynooth pointed out, people have the right to have their grievances heard and the idea that they can be dismissed as frivolous by a civil servant is not acceptable. Second, the initial hearings with the adjudicators should be public and not private because public hearings act as a deterrent to rogue or delinquent employers and put pressure on them to treat workers properly. If these things go on behind closed doors, there is a problem. Third, a single adjudicator at the proposed Workplace Relations Commission is not good enough. As I understand it, almost all sides of the industrial relations divide - lawyers, workers' representatives and employers' representatives - believe the tripartite system, where there is somebody representing workers, somebody representing employers and somebody who is a legal expert making an adjudication, is far more favourable than having one person, probably not qualified, making these adjudications. As Michael Doherty, professor of law in NUI Maynooth, has said, a single adjudicator seems to be motivated more by cost-saving requirements rather than by trying to come up with a fair, equitable and efficient system. The legislation still gives the Minister the right to impose fees. There should be absolutely no question of fees. The provision for fixed penalty notices of â‚¬150 is a joke. This will be the soft option for employers and allow them to avoid properly dealing with grievances, complaints and problems brought up by employees.
