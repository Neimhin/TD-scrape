RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have just come from a meeting of the Joint Sub-Committee on Global Taxation, to which Professor Jim Stewart was giving evidence. He was asked by Deputies from various parties to back up his assertion that the real corporate tax rate in this country - the so-called effective rate - is only 2.2%. He was categorical about it. Whereas the Government claims the corporate tax rate is 11.9%, virtually every international commentator and a minority of us in this House say that is nonsense and that, in reality, these big multinationals are paying a fraction of that amount. Professor Stewart was absolutely clear in stating the figure was much closer to 2.2%. He pointed out that in Irish tax law - not American tax law or any other country's law - the norm is that if a company is incorporated in this country, it is deemed to be tax resident here and that foreign-owned companies are the only exception to that norm. It appears that a different set of rules is applied to foreign-owned companies. There is one law for Irish companies and another law for the multinationals. That double standard in how we judge companies' liabilities for tax purposes allows them to shift massive amounts of profits abroad and to claim the profits are made in the Virgin Islands, the Cayman Islands or Bermuda when, as Professor Stewart pointed out, these companies have employees here in respect of whom they pay PRSI, they pay VAT and they occupy offices in this country. Somehow, they claim they are owned and controlled in Bermuda or the British Virgin Islands, where they have no offices or employees, and do not even have telephone numbers. The Revenue Commissioners simply conclude they are owned and controlled in the Cayman Islands or the Virgin Islands. He rightly pointed out this is not a reasonable assessment of where they are owned and controlled. In so far as one can reasonably allocate their profits, any reasonable person would say those profits should be allocated here. Irish tax law states that a company incorporated here is normally regarded as tax resident. Is it not obvious that we are facilitating incredible tax evasion from these multinational companies? That option is not available to Irish companies and small and medium enterprises. It is solely available to enormously profitable multinationals. I would like to hear the Taoiseach's response to that. Professor Stewart was very convincing and he knew the Irish tax code very well. Perhaps the Taoiseach could explain further. Professor Stewart also suggested that while we may not be the only country that could be described as having features of a tax haven, we are in the same category as Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland, all of which are also being investigated for being tax havens or countries with the features of tax havens. The way in which we interpret and apply our tax laws is facilitating this. The Taoiseach stated that we do not have brass-plate companies. I discussed this subject with Professor Stewart in a telephone conversation, and he confirmed in his submission to the sub-committee and in a radio interview that one could wallpaper one's house with all the brass-plate companies in the IFSC. He put flesh on the bones of that when he pointed out that there are €2.1 trillion in assets in the IFSC. He asked why these assets do not show up on the national accounts. If even 1% of these assets appeared on the national accounts, they would amount to €20 billion. As the assets do not appear in the national accounts, clearly the companies are not paying taxes on them in any substantial way. Is that not the definition of a brass-plate company? I ask the Taoiseach to explain that to us. It strongly suggests that, contrary to his assertion, the IFSC is thronged with brass-plate companies which have no real linkages with the Irish economy. We cannot claim they are making a great contribution at any level to the economy.As Professor Stewart pointed out, they are here purely because it is easy to minimise tax liability in this State. In that sense we are again displaying features, as he put it, of a tax haven. The allegations being made against us have serious substance, although it is important to note they are not just being made against us, and they are also levelled at Holland, Luxembourg and Switzerland. We are at the top of the league table but in a race to the bottom on corporate tax issues and allowing multinationals to facilitate these practices.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sure. I only got six or seven minutes but everybody else got 15 minutes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How does the Taoiseach respond to these serious allegations, given the state of the public finances in this country?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We use the Irish tax code.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What if it is in the Cayman Islands, which have nothing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even before the introduction of the housing assistance payment scheme, there was often a significant problem where tenants sought transfers or were made offers where those offers were felt to be completely unworkable from the point of view of the tenant but were deemed to be acceptable by the local authority, particularly where matters to do with proximity to school for children or proximity to supports, such as family or local community, were an issue but were not considered by the local authority as reasonable grounds to refuse an offer when they should have been. In my experience, it is quite common that tenants would be offered accommodation which, from their point of view, is in far-flung areas away out of the area in which they are normally used to living, where their children go to school or where they have support networks. That problem, if it existed previously, will be massively compounded by what the Minister of State is talking about with the housing assistance programme. It is already starting to happen. Where landlords who are in arrangements with the local authority through the HAP scheme decide, as they undoubtedly will on a regular basis, to pull out of those arrangements for whatever reason, the local authority will be overwhelmed with tenants to whom it has an obligation but who it simply has no means to house. The local authorities do not have the local authority housing stock and they do not have other private landlords with whom they will be able to house tenants. This will increase the pressure on the local authorities to push tenants into accepting accommodation which they should not have to accept and then if the tenants do not accept it, they will be penalised. What Deputy Ellis proposes is the minimum safeguard that tenants could expect in order that they have some flexibility and room to manoeuvre to refuse certain offers if they have reasonable grounds for doing so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Those are big areas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State says that people have to be housed in their area of choice, but the problem is that local authority areas are often very big. The Dún Laoghaire-Dalkey list covers a very large area. One end of it could be far away from where children go to school at the other end. While the local authority might say it is in a person's area of choice, in reality it is not practical as it involves significant upheaval for a family with children. If children are attending school far away or if elderly relatives are unwell, those are additional problems. It is reasonable to request three offers to give people room for manoeuvre. The Minister of State says she is open to considering some of the points being made here, so the issue of proximity to school should be explicitly included in any criteria.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There has to be a reasonable proximity to a school where children are involved. In addition, there should be access to family support networks for elderly, disabled or ill people. Those criteria should be written into the legislation so that a local authority would have to consider them in deciding what is a reasonable offer. Housing departments will sometimes take such matters into consideration but they are under massive pressure to offer something, however inappropriate. If those criteria were written into the Bill, it would provide some protection to tenants.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some of us believe that this Bill will turn a housing disaster into a complete catastrophe for social housing and homelessness. The Minister of State obviously disputes that and believes it is workable. I do not see how it can be workable, when all the evidence points in the opposite direction, to move towards reliance on private landlords who are jacking up rents and running away from arrangements with local authorities and who have made it clear they have no interest in housing people on low incomes. It will compound a disastrous situation in ways that will become manifest very quickly. I hope the real review will come from people on the housing lists clamouring at politicians’ clinics, outside local authority offices and outside this building, demanding an immediate reversal of this policy. Time will tell quite quickly. The very least the Government could do is accept this amendment from those of us who are deeply alarmed by what it is doing, and agree to review this scheme every few months, monitor it closely and let us have all the details about what is happening in the different categories of housing need in order that we can assess what is going on. It will be very telling and damning. The Minister of State would obviously argue otherwise, but if she genuinely believes in it, she should make the commitment to regular reviews and to giving us all the detail necessary to make a proper assessment of whether this thing is workable. I hope the Government will at least accept that proposal because this is so serious. It is beyond draining to have to deal with the day-to-day crises families face and the utter failure of the State to deal with their housing needs. We think this scheme will make that problem worse. At the very least will the Minister of State commit to regular detailed reviews and to providing all the information we will need to assess it? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are not getting the straight reality of what this legislation means. I acknowledge it is positive that people will go on to a differential rent scheme. It is preferable to the sham fiasco and waste of money that is rent allowance. However, the Minister of State is arguing that being in a HAPS arrangement, where one is a tenant of a private landlord, albeit in a deferential rent scheme, is the same as being in a council house.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This Bill states that one will be deemed to be appropriately housed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Section 37 states that the provision of housing assistance under this Part shall be deemed to be an appropriate form of social housing support for a household.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State's departmental officials confirmed to the committee today that people in that situation will be off the housing list. She tried to cover over that by saying they can apply for a transfer but one can only apply to a local authority for a transfer if one is deemed to be in overcrowded accommodation or to have a medical priority. One cannot apply for a transfer because one wants to move from private rented accommodation to a council house. It is not even possible to apply for a transfer from one council house to another. That was done away with ten or 15 years ago. In reality, once a tenant is in a HAP scheme - he or she will not have any choice about it in the unlikely event that the council can come to an arrangement - his or her ten year wait on the list will be extinguished. The only basis on which he or she will be able to get a transfer is medical priority or overcrowded accommodation. That is enormous and the consequences need to be monitored. I appeal to the Minister of State, even at this late stage, not to proceed with this provision. In the absence of rent control it is going to be an unmitigated disaster. The disaster has already been unfolding but it will accelerate over the coming weeks. It is not too late to stop this process but if she is not going to halt it at least she can commit to this review to allow us to monitor and assess the damage that will be done by this retrograde legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How does one apply to transfer-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Every person will apply to be on the transfer list.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On what basis can these people apply?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the reversal by the Government of its proposal to impose a guillotine on this debate.Will the Minister of State and the Government seriously consider the fact that quite a number of Deputies have raised very serious questions and concerns about this Bill which should give the Government pause for thought? If the Minister of State, as she indicated, wants to reach a solution over which we can all stand and which deals with this crisis, the Government would be well advised to put back the reconvening of Report Stage for a quite a while and convene some sort of forum, which is not time limited or strictly controlled, where we can sit down and try to come up with something that would work, including discussions about how we could finance long-term social housing provision but also the short-term issues, because we might actually get somewhere. There have been some useful exchanges in this debate and some understandings and illuminations to which all of us have contributed. If we could take that forward instead of being dragooned into accepting this legislation in a few days' time or whatever, we might actually get somewhere. That is just an appeal to the Minister of State.  I would like to make three points on the issue of direct deductions. It is effectively punishing people who are victims of the recession and the economic crisis which have impacted on families in manifold ways - in a whole diverse range of ways into which I cannot even begin to go now where people may fall into arrears. Of course, there are cases of people who are just negligent, who are abusing the system or whatever, but they are a minority. There is, however, a very significant problem of rent arrears which has escalated in recent years and one can absolutely see the correlation between that escalation of the rent arrears crisis and the impact of recession, austerity and cuts in other areas on families and their capacity to pay rents. Therefore, the fact people get into arrears is often because of circumstances completely outside their control. I will give a few examples. One very common example is that many council tenants actually pay their rent ahead. They pay more than their rent as a safeguard against anything ever going wrong. This is very common among council tenants. They pay their rent plus a bit just in case anything ever goes wrong, where they have exceptional needs, a death in the family, an illness or some difficulty which will mean they may not be able to meet their normal rent commitments. Those sort of emergencies and crises hit almost every family at some point in their lives, if not a couple of times. Suddenly, they can find themselves, for a period of six, eight or ten months, not able to meet their normal rent commitments which they have done religiously for all of the period of time they have been council tenants. However, they will be punished under this measure because of circumstances outside their control. That happens often. I will give another common example before I get to specific examples, where somebody faithfully pays his or her rent and declares all income, earnings and all relevant circumstances to the housing department, in terms of the assessment of his or her rent, but the council makes a mistake. This happens all the time. The council assesses the person's rent as being at such a level but a year or even two years down the line, it says, "Sorry, we made a mistake" and although the tenant answered all the questions faithfully, when it looked at their assessment, it saw it should have been charging a higher rent. Over night, through no fault of the tenant, he or she is suddenly told that although they thought they were in the black, they are actually in the red to the tune of €4,000 or €5,000. This happens all the time. I deal with rent sections which say they are sorry they made a mistake but the person has to pay for the mistake and that they will take it directly out of the person's money even though it is through no fault of the person's. I will give another example of a family where somebody in the house has a problem - say one of the principal earners has a problem with drink or something like that but his wife and children believe he is paying the rent and are giving him money to pay it but he is not doing so and they do not know about it. He is culpable and the council has a legitimate case against him. In one particular instance, a couple subsequently separated but the whole family was evicted for rent arrears. Some €12,000 of rent arrears had built up through no fault whatsoever of the children or the wife but they were all evicted. In this case, the money would have been directly deducted from their income even though it had nothing to do with them. That is not fair and this is the problem with what the Minister of State proposes. There will be innocent victims of all sorts of situations which are not the fault of those tenants. Of course, we should help and assist people who may have difficulty paying their rent but the best way to do that is to make sure people are not pushed into poverty. I will give another example, of which I should have thought and which is coming up all the time now. The different quality of council housing means that many tenants, in particular those in older council houses, have to pay much more on heating than tenants in new council houses because there is chronic damp and the houses were built a long time ago and are substandard. A tenant, through no fault of his or her own, has to buy an electric heater because the place is damp. It is really the council's responsibility, and often the council will say it is its responsibility but it does not have the money to dry line the house or to put in insulation, so people have to fork out a much higher proportion of their meagre income on heating the place than somebody who happens to be in a new council house. As a result of the need to keep warm during the winter, people find themselves in arrears and unable to meet all of their rent commitments. They will be hit on the double because the council will say it is now going to grab the money from them, making a bad situation worse. That is not uncommon. There is a lot of housing stock in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, and I am sure elsewhere, where there are chronic problems of damp, lack of insulation, cold and so on and where people are forced to spend massive amounts of their meagre incomes on just keeping the place warm, in particular during winter, and let us not forget the fuel allowance has been cut, making that situation worse.  Under this measure, these people will be punished and told that the council will grab a portion of their social welfare payment, pension or whatever. It is absolutely not fair. We must have measures to deal with people who are abusing this but if people are having difficulties, we need compassion, flexibility and housing departments which have the flexibility to actually recognise where some people have got into difficulty through no fault of their own and should not be punished as a result. On those grounds, I ask the Minister of State to seriously reconsider this measure.
