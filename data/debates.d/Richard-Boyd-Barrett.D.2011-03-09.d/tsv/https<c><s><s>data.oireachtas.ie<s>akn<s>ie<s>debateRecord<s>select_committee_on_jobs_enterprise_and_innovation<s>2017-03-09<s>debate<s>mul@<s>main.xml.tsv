RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Have we dealt with any of the amendments yet?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not agree to the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am substituting for Deputy Br√≠d Smith.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not agree to the section. May I comment on it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will make just one comment for now and it will cover all the sections. The reason I am opposing these sections and would have opposed the first three, had I been fast enough, is that I oppose the Bill in total.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Section 6 allows for a certificate to be given to a group of inventions. Can the Minister explain this? My concern is that minor upgrades or improvements in a particular innovation could be made just for the purposes of getting the tax break and the certificate. They would not necessarily have to be new innovations. There might be one new thing to which minor changes are made, which then qualify for a tax break but this is not really innovation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to flag my concerns about this. I am opposing the entire Bill because we have had clear evidence that corporations are using every means available to avoid tax and push the boundaries of the available tax breaks to minimise their tax bill. The criteria under which one can get the 12.5% tax rate reduced to 6.5% appear to be wide open to abuse and I do not see the safeguards against this. There are, for example, constant upgrades to mobile phones or the iPhone and these could be, as the legislation states, a group of inventions that are part of a general inventive concept. In these cases the companies in question could pay 6.5% for ever and a day.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am making a more general point, although I also have a specific point on this amendment. We will move through this and some of the other amendments that cover some of the same ground. There is no doubt that we need to encourage innovation. We should support innovators. I am not convinced that giving tax breaks to companies is the best way to support innovation, which is why I opposed the Bill in the first instance. Every cent lost in tax revenue is money that could potentially be going to the universities. We have a choice. Do we go the private route in supporting and encouraging innovation or do we take the public route? We could even provide grants to small producers, which might be more helpful to them. The biggest problem for small operations or individuals trying to develop something new is not tax but having a bit of money to do the research and development and develop an idea rather than a tax break on the revenue they generate once they have it up and running. My fear is that this is not the best way to achieve the Bill's stated objective. The unintended - possibly intended - consequence is providing another mechanism for profitable corporations to pay less tax. Obviously, there is a context for that because big questions arise regarding the extent of the tax being paid by corporations. Even people who might disagree with my perspective on these would accept that there are questions to be answered following the Apple case. Just looking at the revenue figures of corporation tax take as against pre-tax profits, dividing one by the other does not give 12.5%, but about 6%. That is the effective rate of tax being paid at the moment. As we know, for some companies it is considerably less because most domestic small and medium-sized enterprises are paying 12.5%. If the average is 6%, it means that a small number of very profitable companies are paying very little.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not had time to read all the cross-references to all the legislation, although I remember debating intensely the knowledge development box at the time it was proposed in the Finance Bill. I ask the Minister of State to remind me what we are dealing with here. What does the existing legislation from the Finance Act do in terms of excluding small and medium-sized enterprise such that it is necessary to have a certificate that is directed at small and medium-sized enterprise? Does the Finance Act distinguish between different companies? Are companies over the threshold set out in this Bill currently benefiting? Is there certification for them and are they benefiting from the tax break? Does the legislation distinguish between small, medium and large enterprises?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I made a slightly different point. This is genuinely a question rather than an argument. Why do we need a certificate specifically for small and medium-sized enterprises? Obviously, the Government wants to help small and medium-sized enterprises. I am not asking that question either. Is there a distinction in the existing legislation? Section 7 refers to relevant companies. Does the legislation distinguish between different-sized companies such that we need a specific certificate for small and medium-sized companies? Why does the provision not just apply to all companies? I am not saying it should. I simply want to know why the existing legislation requires a certificate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there a different certification process for big companies that exceed the threshold?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do they get a certificate from the Department?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where in the existing legislation were small and medium enterprises excluded? I do not understand why they were excluded in the first place.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not labour the point. Perhaps we can have a more detailed discussion with the officials or whoever in order to understand this measure between now and Report Stage. I listened to the Minister of State's response but I do not quite understand why we need this measure. If there are provisions governing the knowledge development box in the Finance Act, and other bigger companies above the thresholds are benefitting from it, I do not understand why small and medium-sized enterprises have been excluded. Are they excluded from availing of the tax break for their intellectual property assets? If they are not excluded then why do we need this legislation? I do not understand.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with Deputy Lawless that a note would be helpful. I have nothing more to say on the matter. I wish to mention an issue that I raised on Second Stage. It is appropriate to raise it now as we are discussing the section that outlines who can apply, etc. How does this legislation protect us against bigger companies setting up companies as a front, or a series of them, that are under the threshold and, consequently, exploit?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the fact that I have flagged issues mean that I must formally say I might table amendments?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I might do so also.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I reserve the right to table an amendment to this section on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also reserve the right to table amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 14, between lines 23 and 24, to insert the following:"(3) The Minister may seek the introduction of appropriate categories or sectoral headings in respect of applications and request information from the Controller as to the proportion of applications under each heading.".This and most of the amendments that follow flow from our general concern about the potential loss of revenue and the potential abuse of the legislation to avoid tax and the conferring of advantage on particular companies or industries which will benefit from significant reductions in tax. Notwithstanding our general opposition to the Bill, the amendments seek safeguards and to have the most extensive information available on who is benefiting from these certificates and the tax break that goes with them in order that we can assess as we go along potential abuses or particular companies or sectors which are gaining major advantages as against others. Even those who agree with the general thrust of the legislation might acknowledge the merit of having such information available to us on which sectors or regions are benefiting from it in order that we can assess the effectiveness of the legislation and assess abuses, revenue losses, etc.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not labour the point I have made. I thank Deputy Rock for endorsing the spirit of the amendments. While I have no doubt about how conscientious the Minister of State, Deputy Halligan, might be in these matters, future Ministers may not be so conscientious. It is helpful for the Minister to have information that breaks down who it is that benefits from a particular measure or from the tax benefit for these companies. It would be helpful if Ministers, others who are not Ministers and for the public to have access to that information so they can assess whether they think this is a good measure and whether the tax benefits conferred are value for money for the public, as against the value of other measures. The area of corporate tax is, to put it mildly, opaque. There are a lot of tax breaks out there. I know that pertains to Revenue but when one gets this certificate then one is going to get the tax break and the two things are connected. I do not have the figures to hand but it is worth saying, and I said it on Second Stage, gross pre-tax profits in Ireland for corporations are in the region of ‚Ç¨95 billion. By the time we take out all the allowable allowances, deductions and tax breaks, the ‚Ç¨95 billion goes down to around ‚Ç¨65 billion in taxable income. That is in the region of ‚Ç¨30 billion to ‚Ç¨40 billion worth of loopholes, tax breaks, incentives, deductions, allowances or whatever one wants to call them. I believe the public and the public representatives need to have more information about these in order to understand them. They need to be transparent and readily available. I am a member of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and in the run-up to Finance Bills and budgets, all members and parties must think about whether these are good measures to benefit the public interest. The more information we have the better.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I should know this as I have been through it so many times. Can I put this amendment in again?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No 2:In page 15, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:‚Äú(h) figures in respect of the geographical or regional distribution of applications,‚Äù.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No 3:In page 15, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:‚Äú(h) such general information as to the operation of the scheme as may be appropriate or relevant,‚Äù.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No 4:In page 15, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:‚ÄúReview and scrutiny19. (1) The Minister shall, as part of the annual Budget process, produce a report on the operation of the KDB including a consideration of the intersection of the KDB with other tax expenditure measures and its impact on the delivery of an effective tax rate for corporations.(2) The Minister shall ensure appropriate annual information exchange between the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in order to facilitate the publication of information on the cost of this initiative, including the cost to date for the Exchequer in revenues forgone, as part of the annual budgetary process.‚Äù.Members can see that the amendments in this group are all covering the same ground and it is an extension of the logic of the earlier group of amendments. These amendments are to ensure that at the intersection of this certificate with Revenue matters and with other State supports that may benefit the companies that are also benefitting from the knowledge development box tax break, there will be the maximum oversight at the level of the D√°il and the relevant Oireachtas committees. This is to have the maximum information, reports and scrutiny at D√°il and committee level on all of these things for the reasons I have already set out.I refer here to the anxiety that these tax breaks are not actually, or may not be, beneficial, that they do not represent good value for money, or that they may be abused or exploited by or be beneficial to particular small groups of companies, rather than being of general benefit to most companies or the public at large. For all of those reasons, these are sensible proposals to ensure that, at the very least, we have the level of oversight, scrutiny and information necessary to make an ongoing assessment of the benefit and value of this measure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Obviously, we disagree on these things. I will not labour the point, but will make my final intervention on the group of amendments. In direct response to the last point, I note that the Bill is supposed to deal specifically with small and medium enterprises. It is not supposed to give rise to a debate about foreign direct investment. As such, that particular argument does not hold.Ironically, it might be relevant if some of my other questions are not addressed adequately. Could this measure be abused by companies that are not supposed to benefit? Under its own terms, the Bill is not supposed to be about foreign direct investment but about extending tax breaks to encourage domestic SMEs. On the issue of information already available from the Comptroller and Auditor General, the amendments are trying to achieve an intersection of various Departments or State aids for companies that link together. The Bill is from the Minister of State's Department, but its subject matter also involves Revenue and possibly other Departments that are supporting companies. We will not fully understand how much of a benefit may be conferred on particular companies, how much public money will be expended and whether we will receive any benefit in return unless we have the whole rather than a fragmented picture. The amendments in this series try to ensure we would have the full picture. In terms of revenue forgone, come on. Surely I only have to say the words "Apple" and "section 110". Regardless of what the Minister of State thinks about this or which side he takes - we take different sides on these matters - all sides agree that section 110 was abused. The information was not available or scrutinised. It was not transparent enough to allow people to know that the vulture funds which had many property assets were paying no tax at all. We only found out after the fact. We still do not know how much tax was forgone because of section 110, but the estimates run into billions of euro. This is serious stuff. To my mind, it is a minimum requirement that we know how much tax will be forgone under a measure such as this in order that we can monitor the position. I am unsure as to whether the Minister cited an estimate on Second Stage. Does the Minister of State have a projected estimate of how much tax will be forgone in the first year or over time? If he does, we will need to test it against the actuality as time passes. If we find that the figure balloons beyond the estimated amount, it might be evidence of major abuse. It is critical that we have this level of oversight, reporting and monitoring of such tax breaks. I have argued strongly that the Committee on Budget Scrutiny should examine every subhead under the corporate tax heading through which tax liability is reduced.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a brief point to make. I will not elaborate on my argument, but I want to flag it in case I have to raise it on Report Stage because it is worth making. The issue of intellectual property is new territory to some extent. It has been at the centre of widespread and aggressive tax avoidance, not just in this country but internationally. This certificate relates specifically to intellectual property. At this point, no one can say how we can measure its value or legislate for it. That is another reason we need to have a tight oversight regime. I will revert to this matter on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 5:In page 15, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:
‚ÄúReview and scrutiny
19. The Minister shall, as part of the annual Budget process, produce a report on the operation of the KDB including a consideration of the intersection of the KDB with other tax expenditure measures and its impact on the delivery of an effective tax rate for corporations.‚Äù.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 6:In page 15, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:
‚ÄúReview and scrutiny
19. The Minister shall ensure appropriate annual information exchange between the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in order to facilitate the publication of information on the cost of this initiative, including the cost to date for the Exchequer in revenues forgone, as part of the annual budgetary process.‚Äù.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 7:In page 15, between lines 3 and 4, to insert the following:
‚ÄúCommittee scrutiny
19. An annual report on the operation of the KDB including a consideration of the intersection of the KDB with other tax expenditure measures and its impact on the delivery of an effective tax rate for corporations should be presented and discussed by the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.‚Äù.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I reserve the right to table an amendment to this section on Report Stage, specifically regarding the adequacy of a maximum fine of ‚Ç¨50,000 or prison sentences of no more than six months or not exceeding three years. At the very least, whether they are adequate is debatable. Sometimes white collar crime is not treated with the seriousness it should be. It is arguable whether the penalties are sufficiently severe to act as a disincentive to such crime.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 8:In page 16, after line 36, to insert the following:
"Intersection with wider enterprise and innovation strategy 
25 .
