RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will speak about a promised report in legislation. When the Social Welfare Bill was passed last year, Deputy Bríd Smith had sought an amendment seeking a report on the inequalities faced by pensioners, which we have discussed this week. That affects 35,000 pensioners who are being robbed of a full pension entitlement. At the time, the current Taoiseach and then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, included an amendment indicating a report on those anomalies would be done within six months. Deputy Smith had sought three months as the timeframe. We are well past the period stipulated in last year's Bill but we still have procrastination from the Government. There are many excuses about how complicated it is but where is the report? When will we get it? This has gone on and on while tens of thousands of pensioners are being robbed of their full pension entitlement because of a failure by the Government to honour the promise.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:To delete all words after “equality of treatment between men and women in relation to pension contributions; and” and substitute the following:“— restoration of the State pension age to 65, and where a worker wishes to work after retirement age such a decision should not be driven by economic necessity.”
