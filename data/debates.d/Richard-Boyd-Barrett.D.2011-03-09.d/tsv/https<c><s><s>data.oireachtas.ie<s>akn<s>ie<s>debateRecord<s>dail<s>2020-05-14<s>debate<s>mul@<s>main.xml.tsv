RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are sharing time. I urge the Government and this House to start working immediately on a new deal for workers facing the prospect of protracted or long-term unemployment. I hear that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, briefed the Green Party and Fianna Fáil about potential economic devastation and a return to a 1980s-style depression with long-term unemployment. I do not think we should sit back like astrologers and wonder which way the stars are moving or which way the wind is blowing. We need to proactively act to ensure we do not return to a period of mass, protracted unemployment. We need a new deal for workers, we need to be ambitious and we need to think outside the box to ensure that people get back to work, have decent incomes and are not thrown on the scrapheap. I refer to arts workers. In the foreseeable future, live entertainment is in deep trouble. That is the reason I asked for the debate tonight. We need answers for workers in the arts. We need answers for taxi drivers, 20,000 of whom have had their industry decimated, and where for the foreseeable future that is likely to be the case. Two thousand Debenhams workers thrown on the scrapheap by a cynical company could be the first of many who will face that situation. How are driving instructors to do driving tests or driving lessons in the foreseeable future? There are many others. I believe that this House has to act urgently to work on a new deal for these workers. Indeed, this relates to the issue of the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response. We cannot wait weeks for these discussions to happen. We need committees set up immediately to discuss and bring in people from these affected sectors to hear from them. We got it wrong on childcare because we did not listen to the childcare providers. We need the Debenhams workers in here next week to hear from them. We need to hear from the arts workers. We need to hear from the taxi drivers. We need to hear from the driving instructors. We need these people in here to help guide us as to how we will prevent a return to mass unemployment and develop a new deal that ensures that does not happen. I would like to hear the Taoiseach's response to that. We must respond and not let ourselves return to a period of mass sustained unemployment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy. I wish to press the Minister on the issue of public and private healthcare. Given that Covid-19 will be with us for the foreseeable future, any consideration of a return to the two-tier system is untenable. The Government needs to make up its mind. Fianna Fáil seems to be somewhat sitting on the fence and even hinting that we should go back to the two-tier system sooner rather than later. I want to push in the exact opposite direction and it should not be for a few months. We need Covid-19 care, Covid-19 surge capacity and to deal with the waiting list crisis and non-Covid-19 care. The only way that can be done is to integrate all healthcare capacity, public and private, into a single system. We need to grasp that nettle now and take the private hospitals fully into public ownership, not on the basis of paying huge sums in rent to billionaires who own them but taking them over fully. Will the Minister respond?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think we need to go further now. There was never a justification for a two-tier system. There has been a general acknowledgement with Sláintecare that that is the case. Now that we have the private healthcare capacity in our hands, why on earth would we go back? It does not make any sense. There is a problem with this contract because it is essentially rent to people who are making profit from health, whatever way one puts it. Why not take it directly under public control? That is the only way we can establish how much additional capacity we need but we certainly need significant additional ICU capacity generally and staffing levels across the healthcare system. Unless we have a single integrated system I do not see how we can even do that. The Minister also needs to respond to the INMO's demands in terms of pay parity for nurses with other healthcare workers, a big recruitment campaign and paying them the awards they were granted as a result of the industrial action. I would like to hear the Minister's response on that. I have a final brief question although the Minister might not have time to answer. For a long time I have been asking about blood plasma therapy. There are trials going on and 500 people have signed up to donate plasma but the plasmapheresis machines in St. James's Hospital are currently sitting idle. I know that from somebody who went there and was told that by the staff. The results from blood plasma therapy are very good. If there are people who are willing to donate, why are we not collecting the plasma?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy. As the person who asked for it, I thank the Ceann Comhairle and the Business Committee for agreeing to have this debate on the arts. I ask the Minister to imagine at the best of times what it would be like if we had no music, comedy, film, theatre or art.Imagine going through the past two months if we had none of those things. It is too awful even to contemplate. The United Nations is talking about a mental health crisis. Imagine how bad that crisis would be without our artists, musicians, poets and writers, as well as the crew - I really want to emphasise this - which includes the technicians, drivers and all the other people who make it happen. Life would not be worth living and we all know it. We only have to think for one minute what the past few months would have been like in that scenario. It would not be worth living in those circumstances and that is how important the arts are. However, the sort of support we give to our arts workers, performers and artists is insulting. It was insulting before the Covid-19 crisis that in a country whose reputation is built on the arts, we spend less than almost anybody else in Europe in supporting arts, the artists and the crew. Then the crisis comes and €1 million is given to support artists. I have in my hand a rejection letter that was sent to an applicant to one of the schemes the Minister is claiming as a success. I will not say the name of the artist who received this rejection letter but the person is a household name. Two thirds of those who applied for this pretty miserable grant were refused and given a grade on the artistic merit of their application. It is utterly insulting. As I said, this particular rejected applicant is a household name who has given service to the State, as have all of these people. They are treated with no respect, except when people want to jump into a camera shot with them to get a bit of credibility or kudos out of the artists' work and creativity. This insulting approach to our artists has to end and we should realise, now more than ever, how important they are. I have a few specific issues to raise. The Minister should commit to the demand of the National Campaign for the Arts for an additional €20 million in funding for this year and next year - frankly, it should be more - to fund arts and arts organisations. She should offer a commitment that the Covid-19 payment will be given to everybody, not just those who happened to be working on 13 March. Many people in the arts would have been working the following week or the week after, but they are being denied payment. The payment should be guaranteed until we at least get back to a situation where live performances and the arts are back up and running. In fact, if we genuinely want to support them, such a payment should be given out on a permanent basis to our artists, as I have suggested before, by way of some sort of public works programme. As Deputy Gannon said, theatres and people in the music business need clarity about the guidelines for a partial reopening. When or if that partial reopening happens, services are going to be chronically underfunded because the revenue streams just will not be there if social distancing is implemented. The last point I want to make is on my oft-repeated theme of the film industry. Why are we giving out supports to film producers who have just sacked all their crew? The staff at Ardmore Studios and elsewhere were not put on the wage subsidy by the producers who get €70 million or €80 million a year but do not actually have any employees, apparently, because they do not recognise those employees as such and sacked them as soon as the crisis hit. Do those people have to go on the Covid-19 payment or are they supposed to apply for jobseeker's alliance? It is absolutely outrageous. These producers continue to look for and get supports but when their workers say, "I am your employee", the producers reply, "We do not have any employees". Let us start supporting the workers, the crew and the artists. We should be putting the money into supporting the people who actually make the art and the work happen.
