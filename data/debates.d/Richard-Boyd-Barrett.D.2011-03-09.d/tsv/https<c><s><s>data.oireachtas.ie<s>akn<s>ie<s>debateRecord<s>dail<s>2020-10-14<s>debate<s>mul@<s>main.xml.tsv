RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If ever there was a demonstration that there is one law in this country for the rich, the powerful and big business and another for working people, we saw that demonstrated in the Four Courts yesterday, where KPMG, the liquidators of Debenhams, sought and got an injunction against Debenhams workers. This means workers who have been treated in the most despicable fashion by their employer and are engaged in an official dispute to fight for justice and fair redundancy now face – these workers include constituents of the Taoiseach - the real prospect of finding themselves imprisoned if they continue in their entirely peaceful and legitimate fight for justice. It is outrageous that should be the case. Workers face the prospect of jail and the wrath of the law; meanwhile, Debenhams, which has treated these workers disgracefully and has manipulated if not broken company law in their efforts to hide assets from these workers, and KPMG, which makes a fortune in contracts from this State and will no doubt be handsomely paid for their role in this process, face no interrogation for their role in this situation. It is appalling. This company tactically unloaded €200 million of debt onto Debenhams Ireland, which had nothing to do with that firm.This is the company that stood up in the courts and gave evidence in April to a court of law that the online business worth €30 million was part of Debenhams Ireland, which every worker knows because the sales of that went through each individual store of Debenhams Ireland, and a few days later then said it was not part of Debenhams Ireland even though there is court testimony to that effect. What is Revenue doing about that? What is KPMG doing about that disgraceful treatment?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What I am talking about is the failure of the Government to address the situation whereby Debenhams can abuse workers like this. KPMG has very serious questions to answer about the way it is handling the liquidation process, given that there is court evidence from Debenhams that the online business was part of Debenhams Ireland's operation. Every worker knows it to be the case, but nobody is doing anything about it. Kieran Wallace told workers at meetings that the State could step aside as a creditor and allocate supplementary cash. It made a €1 million offer. If there is nothing the Government or KPMG can do, how come it offered €1 million? If it can offer €1 million it can offer €10 million. I and the workers do not accept that there is nothing the Government can do.  Will the Taoiseach say publicly that no worker, truck driver or anybody else in this country should break the picket of the Debenhams workers? Will he convene a meeting of KPMG and the shop stewards, with a presence from the Government, to discuss how we can get a fair deal for these workers? Will he instruct KPMG to allocate extra cash? If it can offer €1 million, even though it withdrew the offer, why can it not offer more?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is long past time for action on this. We now face the prospect that ordinary working people - most of whom are women - who are not criminals and should not be criminalised, and have worked long, hard and loyally for Debenhams and have been treated despicably, could end up in jail. The Taoiseach needs to act urgently to prevent that. He should be under no illusion. They will hold this Government and previous Governments responsible for their plight because the failure to address all of these issues after Clerys is the reason they are in this mess now. The Government better take that responsibility.  Can the Government instruct the liquidators? Kieran Wallace said that unless the State voluntarily instructs the liquidators to allocate supplementary cash to the workers nothing can be done. The State can do it. The proof of that is that it offered them €1 million, a pathetic figure. Where did it come from? How could it offer the workers €1 million? If it can offer them €1 million it can offer them the €10 million necessary to give them the two plus two, and then the Government and Revenue can chase the company for the assets they are clearly hiding using accounting tricks. The Government can do it.  I ask the Taoiseach to join me publicly in saying that no truck driver or worker should cross the pickets of Debenhams. Then they will not have to defy an injunction. If workers do not cross the pickets, there is no injunction defiance. Will the Taoiseach convene a meeting with the shop stewards, unions, KPMG and the Government to discuss a resolution?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The devil is always in the detail with budgets. Despite the headline-grabbing figures for this budget, digging into the detail reveals some very severe problems. I was absolutely gobsmacked to get an email yesterday from a young woman who is a science graduate pursuing a postgraduate qualification in public health. She applied for a job as a contact tracer and received a contract from CPL, an agency. It was a zero-hours contract with no sick pay that could be terminated at any point. The hours offered were not guaranteed even on a weekly basis.People need to understand how shocking that is. Whatever view one has about the current situation and the strategies relating to Covid-19 that are to be pursued, we simply cannot get back to anything like normality without having a professional, well-resourced and well-staffed contact tracing regime. That is key to moving beyond lockdowns. In spite of that, this is how science graduates and those studying public health are being treated. They are being offered hire them and fire them zero-hour contracts with no sick pay and at pathetic salary levels. It is a shocking disgrace. Needless to say, the graduate to whom I referred, and many of her fellow graduates, are unlikely to take those jobs. Who would work under those conditions? Instead, the graduates are looking at other employment possibilities. This is not just absolutely shameful treatment of people whom we desperately need in order to combat Covid-19, it is also subverting the public health effort. It is risking lives and public health to try to fight Covid-19 on the back of cheap labour with rotten conditions for the workers who are operating on the front line. It is shameful and beggars belief. Of course, it is not the first time we have seen such a situation. Several months ago, I revealed on foot of a nurse contacting me that CPL, the company that is offering these zero-hour contracts to contact tracers, was offering rotten contracts to nurses and other healthcare workers who offered in the Be on Call for Ireland initiative. Those workers bravely volunteered to fight Covid-19 only to discover they were being offered hire them and fire them contracts. The nurse who contacted me contracted Covid-19 after being employed via CPL. She was not given sick pay. That is how the contact tracers whom we desperately need will be treated. God knows how the testing people are being treated. More generally, the penny-pinching approach to recruitment to all areas of the Covid-19 response threatens to completely derail and undermine the response we need to deal with the pandemic. It is an absolute shocker. The contract states that there is no obligation on the company to provide the worker with work and there is no obligation on the worker to accept the work offered. It states that the company gives no guarantee that hours will be offered to the worker on a weekly basis. Who on earth would take a job like that? Is that how we wish for people to be treated? It is unbelievable that people being recruited for possibly the most important job in terms of dealing with Covid-19 are being offered hire them and fire them contracts. I thank Ferghal Blaney and The Mirror. The newspaper contacted the HSE to confirm these facts and is putting the story out as I speak. It was shocked that this could be true, but the HSE confirmed all the facts. This situation is absolutely disgraceful. Is it any wonder that the State has failed consistently to ramp up the health service or the number of nurses, doctors and public health teams we desperately need to recruit when it is treating healthcare workers in that manner? The pay apartheid system whereby those recruited after 2012 are seen as being worth less than those recruited previously is undermining the State's ability to recruit healthcare workers we desperately need to man ICU and acute beds and to staff the contact tracing regime. On other aspects of the health response, I was shocked to read the small print of the health budget. One would think additional money would be put into health research in the health budget when we desperately need scientific research in the area of developing vaccines and therapies, but not a single extra cent was put into health-related research. That is shocking. The overall budget for Covid-19 response in 2021 is €8 billion less than that in 2020. In other words, the Government is gambling, without evidence or basis, that it will be able to get away with spending less in 2021 to combat Covid-19 in spite of the fact that the rate of infection is going through the roof. It is clear the Government has no strategy to deal with Covid-19. If it were to have such a strategy, that would critically depend on contact tracing and testing, but this is how the Government is going about that aspect. The Ministers who were present earlier have left the Chamber. I refer to the lack of supports for taxi drivers and arts workers. Why on earth would the Government put a cap of €120 on the income people can earn over and above the PUP? That will affect people who have run up costs over the past year and have had no income. Now the Government is putting a cap on the amount they can earn over and above the income support, which means there is a disincentive to work. A taxi driver asked me what he is meant to do when he gets to €120. He wondered whether he should tell the customer to get out of the car. It is madness. We need real supports and grants to cover the ongoing costs of those groups, but that has not been delivered in the budget, which is typical of a budget that short-changed the Covid-19 response and the workers whose livelihoods have been hit hardest by the pandemic.
