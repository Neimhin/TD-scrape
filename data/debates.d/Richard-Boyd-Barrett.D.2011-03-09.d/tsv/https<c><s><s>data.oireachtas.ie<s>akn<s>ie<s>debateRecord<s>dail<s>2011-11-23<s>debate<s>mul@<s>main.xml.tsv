RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also ask that we be given an opportunity to debate the options and issues confronting the people before the budget.  The Taoiseach has indicated that he will make a state of the nation address.  Perhaps these two items could be put together and an address could be made about how the Taoiseach sees the issues facing the Government before the budget and the questions that will influence how the Government will approach the budget.  Opposition parties should have the opportunity to outline their views about options and alternatives facing into the budget.  Particularly given the number of kites being flown and the fear and anxiety being caused to ordinary people, it is only fair, reasonable and democratic to have a debate in the Dáil in which people can set out their perspectives on how we can deal with the economic crisis and the severe issues facing the country in advance of the final budget announcements.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the state of the nation address?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need to understand the severity of this problem.  In a series of locations in my area, namely, Blackrock, Sallynoggin and Stradbrook, and I suspect this is also the case elsewhere in the city and across the country, people have been repeat victims of flooding.  It keeps happening in the same places and the consequences of it have been devastating.  Flood waters mixed with sewage have washed through people's homes.  The insides of their homes have been utterly ruined and walls have been knocked down in some cases.  Back garden walls have been washed away and have smashed into houses behind them.  People were forced out of their homes and are still out of them because of the damage done and they have to pay for alternative accommodation.The key point is that this was not a natural disaster.  The fact that it has happened repeatedly in the same places points to the fact that it was a man-made disaster arising from the chronic failure to invest in water and drainage infrastructure in those places where it has been known for many years, in some cases decades, that there was a serious problem.There has also been a failure on the part of planners to insist on proper water and drainage infrastructure when development was taking place, which means more water has been displaced and flooding got worse.  All the places that have been flooded indicate that the flooding has got worse.  Therefore, there should be no restrictions on the compensation provided for flood victims because it was not their fault.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Minister to remove the application of means-testing to funds under this scheme, to provide an insurance scheme for repeat flood victims who cannot get insurance because of the effect of flooding on their homes——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——and to ensure the scheme also extends to paying for accommodation costs for people who have been displaced.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It should be pointed out to the other Departments that are linked into addressing this issue that there needs to be a co-ordinated strategy to deal with all aspects of it in terms of insurance and dealing with the drainage and water infrastructure.  With regard to the Minister's brief, I have received many reports of there being great inconsistency in what community welfare officers are willing to give people who call to them.  In one place a person will get nothing while in other places the response in terms of humanitarian assistance is quite generous.  Therefore, we need these guidelines.  A number of community welfare officers contacted by my office stated they had no guidelines.  Either they did not know what the guidelines were or there was uncertainty about them.  There is a need for clarity and generosity when it comes to dealing with people who are innocent victims of the failure of various authorities to deal with this problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who is chairing it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am coming at things from a slightly different angle on the same point.  If the intention in focusing on fraud is really about reducing the social welfare bill, would it not also be quite important to focus on ridiculous anomalies such as, for example, the case of a young man named Fergus O'Farrell, who is mentioned in a question further down the list?  He wants to go on the back to education allowance but is deemed ineligible because he is too young and so is being forced to drop out of college and go back on the dole.  Consequently, he will spend nine months longer on the dole, whereas he wants to go to college but cannot get the allowance to do so.  Should we not examine such anomalies involving people who want to get back into education so they can be trained and upskilled rather than being dependent on social welfare?  The current system is forcing them back onto dependency on social welfare.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did the Labour Party give commitments prior to the election about not touching child benefit because it knew it would be wrong to attack the benefit?  Does the Minister agree that the only consequence of cutting child benefit would be to increase child poverty and hit the most vulnerable sectors of society?  Is it a red herring to speak about a few wealthy people benefitting from the payment when the majority of recipients are working, poor and vulnerable people who need it?  If the Minister is to deal with wealth inequalities in our society, she could do so by imposing higher income taxes on the wealthy rather than cutting child benefit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I call on the Government, in particular the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, to condemn immediately, clearly, unequivocally and publicly the Egyptian military regime for the massacre of 33 protestors in Tahrir Square during the weekend and as many as 50 protestors in the past week or two.  I also ask the Government to call publicly and unequivocally for the military clique surrounding Field Marshal Tantawi, a thug of President Mubarak, to step down, relinquish power to the civil authorities and give an immediate undertaking that democratic elections will be allowed to take place and that those elected will have full power without military intrusion.  Will the Tánaiste call in the Egyptian ambassador who is located on Clyde Road in Ballsbridge to tell him that, unless there is a clear undertaking from the Egyptian authorities that they will end the repression of the democratic revolution in Egypt immediately, he will be expelled from Ireland and that we will sever diplomatic and other ties with the regime?Will the Government speak out about the involvement of the United States through its continuing arming and support of the military clique responsible for the massacre during the weekend?  Will the Government make public statements and call in the Saudi ambassador to question him on his country's financing of Salafi gangs which are whipping up sectarian conflict between Christians and Muslims and focusing vicious attacks on Coptic Christians in Egypt in an attempt to disorganise and divide the country's democratic forces?These are important steps that the Government could take to support the democratic revolution in Egypt, which is of historical importance.  If the revolution is defeated, it will set back the cause of democracy in the Middle East for many years to come.  The Government must side publicly with the protestors who are laying down their lives in the fight for democracy, justice and equality in Egypt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Giving dates for elections does not impress me or the Egyptian people because elections were held under President Mubarak.  The problem was that the Mubarak clique continued to rule with an iron fist.  All political opposition was suppressed violently.  Giving dates for elections means nothing, therefore; it is a charade while the military clique retains power which it uses to crush political opposition.  It is necessary for the Government to publicly condemn the military's repression of the democracy movement, call in the ambassador to demand that the military regime state it will relinquish power to the civil authorities and identify a date this year.  This includes releasing political prisoners and bringing the suppression of the protests to an end.The Government should also call in the Saudi ambassador.  The Minister of State referred to groups of thugs attacking Coptic Christians; they are being financed by elements of the Saudi regime.  There is a conspiracy involving certain forces in the region, backed up by the United States, which do not wish to see a genuine democracy in Egypt.  I appeal to the Government to show publicly that it is on the side of the people by making concrete demands to bring about the realisation of the aims of the democratic revolution in Egypt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State should call in the ambassador and ask him to stop the killing of people on the streets of Cairo.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a "No".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will pass over the irony of the fact that this motion was tabled by Fianna Fáil, given it did nothing about the rates system during its 14 years in power.  Tens of thousands of small businesses are clinging on for survival by their finger nails because of the economic disaster Fianna Fáil inflicted on us and the austerity which it and the new Government continues to inflict.  This is depressing demand in the economy significantly and if that problem is not addressed, there is no hope for small and medium-sized businesses, regardless of how much hand wringing is done or how many words of support for small business we hear from any quarter in the House.The rates system makes no sense in that it does not take into account ability to pay or the profitability of a business.  A differential rates scheme should be put in place similar to that in Scotland.  Another form of this scheme is in place in France where small businesses pay a different rate from big businesses.  It is crazy that a bank branch could be housed in a building with a butcher next door and they both pay the same rate.  The bank branch is highly profitable and linked into a much larger entity.  A differential rates scheme is needed, which relates rates to profitability and ability to pay.  For example, when such a scheme was introduced in Scotland a number of years ago, small businesses and shops were given a discount of between 25% and 100% on rates with a maximum rebate set at stg£4,100.  As a result of the scheme, 60% of small businesses experienced a significant benefit.  That is what I propose to the Government.  One does not have to be a socialist or a revolutionary.  This simple measure exists in Scotland and many other parts of Europe to boost small business.
