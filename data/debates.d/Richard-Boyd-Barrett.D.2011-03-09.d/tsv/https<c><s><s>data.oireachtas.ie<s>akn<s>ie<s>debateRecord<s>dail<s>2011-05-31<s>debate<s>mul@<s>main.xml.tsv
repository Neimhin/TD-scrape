RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the issue of accountability following on from Deputy Martin's earlier question.  I am increasingly frustrated at the determination of the Taoiseach's Department to transfer or disallow questions on matters that relate to economic affairs in particular, which I understand the Department is supposed to deal with and the Taoiseach has just answered such a question.  However, these questions are disallowed.  For example——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach explain why a question I submitted——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why then consistently have numerous questions that have been submitted to the Taoiseach——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——about economic affairs——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——either been disallowed or transferred?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Martin asked the same question and you did not interrupt him.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was not told anything by your department.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is precisely what you are——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept the Minister is in a difficult position.  If I understand correctly, the Minister is saying that the money was spent from the wrong subhead, but it was spent in areas where it was needed and now we have the problem of trying to identify the money elsewhere, but that it may well be needed in the area from which it will be taken.  This is the bind we are in.  Some of the Minister's earlier comments suggest he agrees with me that even initially the fair deal scheme was not ideal, based as it was on property prices and putting liens on people's houses.  Does he agree that is what makes the terrible bind in which we find ourselves?  This is all happening against the background of the IMF-EU deal and the austerity programme.I know it is not entirely up to the Minister, but should we not say that if we seek other funding, it cannot come from robbing other vital health services?  It must come from elsewhere and that requires a Government willing to impose taxes on the wealthy and get money from those who can afford it in order to fund the vital health services without which ordinary people will suffer and face a continuing crisis in the health service.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Believe me, a Cheann Comhairle, I am trying my best.With regard to promised legislation——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The fiscal responsibility Bill is in the Taoiseach's legislative programme.  When will the Bill be introduced?  Will it deal with matters which were further——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking about what it will deal with.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Taoiseach——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will this legislation deal with the obscenity, highlighted at the weekend——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——of former Ministers who helped bankrupt this country walking off with pension pots worth millions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the fiscal responsibility Bill deal with that matter?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have had my hand up for the past ten minutes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is on a promised debate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a few occasions, the Taoiseach was asked whether he was open to having a debate on the McCarthy report and he indicated he was.  However, there is still no sign of that debate.  Given the proximity of the next EU-IMF quarterly review, will we have a chance to discuss the McCarthy report in the House before the Taoiseach tells them what he will sell off?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He has not been so far.
