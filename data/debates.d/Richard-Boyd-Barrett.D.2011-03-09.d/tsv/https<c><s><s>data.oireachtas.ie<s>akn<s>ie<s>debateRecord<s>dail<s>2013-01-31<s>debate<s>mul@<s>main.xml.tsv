RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question relates directly to the Minister's Department and policies. Last year, there was an outcry from families of children with special needs about the dramatic increase in the refusal of the domiciliary care allowance, a consequent alarming increase in the number of appeals and the waiting times for those appeals, which often went up to a year. In a parliamentary question I put to the Minister last week to which I received an answer, the same shocking pattern revealed itself when it came to applications for invalidity pensions. In 2009, 39% of applications were refused. In 2011 when the Government took office, the figure jumped to 69% while the figure in 2012 was 64%. As a result, there has been a dramatic increase in the number of appeals so that in 2012, there was a 700% increase in the number of appeals through which people had to go as opposed to 2009. That has led to the appeals office being completely overrun and unable to cope. Only one quarter of the 4,356 appeals lodged in 2012 were decided. This means that thousands of people with chronic illnesses and injuries have to wait up to and over a year to have their appeals heard for invalidity pension. There is widespread anecdotal evidence of similar patterns when it comes to applications for carer's allowance and disability allowance. Why are the Minister's Department and medical assessors second-guessing consultants and GPs who are testifying to the fact that people are physically or mentally unable to work? Is she deliberately denying some of the most vulnerable people - ill people with chronic illnesses - their just entitlements? Where does this leave her constant protestations that she will defend the vulnerable, including people with special needs, when there is clear evidence of a systematic pattern on the part of her Government of denying vulnerable people their rightful entitlements and forcing them into situations of anxiety, desperation and suffering as a result of cuts she is imposing but which she dresses up as reform? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister did not really answer my question. In so far as there has been an improvement to the domiciliary care allowance, I give credit to the staff.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I give most credit to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister had her chance. I give most credit to the families who came out on the streets last year and embarrassed the Government into acknowledging the disgraceful mistreatment of families with special needs. They forced the Minister to address the problem, but it is now being moved to another area. She has completely failed to address the fact that since the Government took office the number of refusals of invalidity pension has dramatically increased by 64%, from 39% in 2011 to 69% in 2012. Two thirds of applicants may be receiving an answer within a few weeks, but they are being refused. I will give an example of the people who are being refused. In most cases, they had an entitlement to illness benefit. In other words, the Department accepted that they were not fit for work and paid them illness benefit. When people applied for invalidity pension after two years, they were denied it in two thirds of cases. I know of one individual who had worked for 40 years as a bin man before developing rheumatoid arthritis and problems with his heart, knee and back. He was denied, despite being completely unable to work. I can provide a litany of similar examples of individuals who are made to suffer for months as they beg and appeal for their entitlements. Is there not a systematic policy of first stop refusal if the Department can find any excuse whatsoever, even when medical assistance has been provided by GPs and consultants? When people appeal, they often have to pay €200 for a consultant's letter stating the Department should not have refused them in the first place. That is another cost for those who are ill and vulnerable. It is disgraceful. Stop treating people in this bureaucratic way and give them their entitlements.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have no problem with them. My problem is with the policy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can provide the statistics showing that two thirds are being refused.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The plan to sell off the harvesting rights of 1.2 million acres of State forestry, the people's forests, to pay off the debts of bankers is an act of national sabotage and betrayal. Public ownership of the forests and the trees that stand on them is the birthright of Irish citizens. I do not know if the word "treason" has its roots in the word "trees" but to sell off the State forestry is an act of treason. What the Minister is planning to do has been done by no other country in Europe. Only one country, Sweden, sold off some of its state forestry but a few years later quickly took it back into 100% public ownership. When it was proposed they would sell off the state forests in Cameron's Britain there was a public outcry and following widespread public consultation the plans were abandoned.  There has been no public consultation here. That is not surprising because if there was a public consultation with the stakeholders and the people who care about our forests they would tell the Minister that privatisation puts at risk thousands of jobs, both direct and indirect, in the forestry sector, that all the valuations done so far for the State forestry lands are gross undervaluations, which suggest we will be selling off the harvesting rights for approximately €500 or less per acre when agricultural land here sells for approximately €2,000 or €3,000 per acre, and that even under Coillte forest assets are being sold to prop up the hole in the pension fund. How much more of our national forests assets will we see stripped if private for profit and commercial interests take over the State forestry? Consultation would also tell the Minister that because forests take 30 to 40 years to rotate inter-generational stable stewardship is needed of the sort that we cannot have when we are talking about speculators and profiteers running the forests. They will tell him that in New Zealand, where privatisation has taken place, there have been major problems with public access, job losses and outflow of profits from the country.  There is simply no justification to sell our forests, and the Minister should abandon this plan immediately. At the very least he should have a public consultation where the facts of Irish forestry and what the impact of its sale would mean for this country could be discussed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First, the idea we might be required to dispose of State assets because the troika tells us to do so makes the whole matter obscene and outrageous. That we might sell off our State forestry - our national heritage - to pay off the debts of gamblers is nothing short of obscene. The Government is not specifically required to sell off Coillte. It could find this money elsewhere by taxing the wealthy or those earning over €100,000. There are many other options but selling off the State forestry is an outrage. Instead, this is an area in which we should be investing, expanding and developing to create employment. The Minister knows, as well as anyone who knows about forestry, jobs can be created just by planting more trees. Doing so would also create a sink for carbon which helps tackle climate change. It would also have a knock-on effect for other industries, services and rural areas. It is absolute madness to divest ourselves of State forestry to speculators such as Helvetica Wealth. They see our public forestry as nothing more than an opportunity to turn a quick buck, not giving a damn about public access, future investment, employment or the State's best interests. The Minister must abandon these plans and we must have a serious discussion with all stakeholders about how we can develop our forestry to the benefit of all citizens and create much badly needed jobs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We could give them Anglo Irish Bank and all its debts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we have public hearings on the matter?
