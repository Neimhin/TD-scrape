RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chair might let somebody else go first.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As Mr. Coffey is aware, one of my favourite subjects is the effective corporate tax rate. It was also addressed by Deputy Doherty. If I heard Mr. Coffey correctly, he stated that the level of deductions and allowances is relatively minimal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Reliefs and credits. In the document, however, they look pretty huge. The document provides the most recent figures, for 2020, with €193 billion in gross trading profits. After allowances and losses forward, the taxable figure goes down to €114 billion. The amount to be taxed drops by 70% or 80%. Mr. Coffey is probably better at maths than I am. It drops by an enormous amount. It is almost halved. It is slightly less than halved but it is a significant fall. Am I right in saying that a lot of that is the royalties and so on that are being paid by companies to their own subsidiaries? Is that still what a lot of it is?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is further down the table.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. The amount accounted for by capital allowances and trading losses forward is huge but Mr. Coffey is saying there is even more further down the table. Where is that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Charges and deductions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Before. The Revenue table is another of my favourite documents. It refers to intragroup transactions, which have jumped astoundingly in the last few years. The latest figure I saw for 2021 was something incredible like €35 billion, and it is describing that as revenue foregone in its list of deductions, reliefs and allowances. That had jumped from €19 billion and before that it was €11 billion. These are staggering figures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is referred to in the Revenue table as intragroup transactions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have a bit of that here as well, of course, in certain areas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that definitely happening in all cases or do we know? Are there still offshore, no tax and low tax locations being utilised for tax avoidance purposes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would Mr. Coffey say that intellectual property, which is very different from purchasing a machine or a factory, is very vulnerable to games being played by corporations, which have a history, let us be honest, of trying to minimise how much tax they pay?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Have I more time?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On research and development, we have shortages of skills all over the place, for example, in the health service, construction and teaching, and we can go through a long list of places where we do not have people where we need qualified specialist people. Should we be rethinking our way of looking at this? If research and development tax reliefs are currently largely benefiting a small number of multinationals and have, therefore, led to our economy being very dependent on a few sectors, which we now realise are quite vulnerable when we look at what has happened with layoffs, there is a sort of opportunity cost. Even if it is given to SMEs, it is not actually meeting our strategic need to have people doing research and becoming highly qualified in areas where we have major deficits. In other words, we are just thinking jobs, jobs, jobs, and we think it is great that we have loads of jobs in one area, but the problem is that we have loads of areas where we desperately need people and we do not have them. To give one example that springs to my mind, one of the problems in our health service is the lack of integration of computer systems and, indeed, we were hacked by the Russians and all the rest of it. We have a completely rubbish sort of computer system in our health service but then we have loads of people working on stuff for Google, Facebook and God knows what. Is there a case for looking at where public expenditure should be going in order to get people qualified in IT who would help our public services, rather than just saying that any job which may be produced by a research and development tax benefit is a good job? Does Mr. Coffey get my point? It may be a slightly convoluted argument. On a question to all of the witnesses, do they have any comment on the Oxfam stuff? They may not agree with the wealth tax but do they have any comment on the Oxfam figures, which essentially show that the rich are getting richer every year, and that there is a greater year-on-year concentration of wealth at the top, whereas 50% of the population have only 1.1% of the wealth. That gap is growing all of the time. Are any of the measures that are being proposed in the Commission on Taxation really going to shift that trajectory? It seems to me that some of them are laudable, and there are some I am not so sure of, but is there any real belief that they are going to address that problem? To me, that is a problem and I believe we need quite radical measures if we are going to shift that trajectory. I ask the witnesses to consider that. I have one very last question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point that I absolutely agree with, the commission says we should avoid cliff edges when it comes to welfare. One of the cliff edges that is at the centre of one of the biggest problems in the country at the moment is the fact that if a person is above a social housing income threshold, they get nothing in terms of support to put a roof over their head. If the threshold is now, say, €45,000 - it depends on the area - and the person is on €44,999, they can get HAP at least - they should get a council house but at least they get HAP to reduce their rent. However, if the person is on €51,000, they get zero, zilch, and they are in serious trouble.That is not to say that people who get HAP are in a great position but they are in a slightly better one that someone who gets nothing at all, given the cost of accommodation. I would be interested in hearing the witnesses' comments on these points.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chair came up with a good phrase for it. Fair play to her.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Was the vote called just now?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has just been called. If we have time, could someone comment on the question of wealth and the richer getting richer?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In one sense.
