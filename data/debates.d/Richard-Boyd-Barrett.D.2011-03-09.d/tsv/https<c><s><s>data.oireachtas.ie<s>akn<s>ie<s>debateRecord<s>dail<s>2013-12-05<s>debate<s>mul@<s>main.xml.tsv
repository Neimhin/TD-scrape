RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 32:In page 75, to delete lines 12 to 38.This measure relates to the increase in tax on tobacco products, including cigarettes. Some of us are in a minority in opposing it but, as we indicated in previous discussions, while we accept fully that cigarettes are bad and that we need to do something about them – I say that as a smoker – I do not believe that is what this measure is about. I do not think it is a health measure; it is a budget measure to grab money and it is one that largely hits the least well-off, as do so many tax increases on commodities people buy, whether they are good or bad for one’s health, such as cigarettes and alcohol. Such taxes increase the cost of living for ordinary people in a way that is regressive because it disproportionately affects people on lower incomes. In so far as we need to deal with smoking, it should be dealt with through education and other health promotion measures which should be funded properly, but of course we are not funding such approaches properly. This is just a grab for money and I do not accept the logic behind it. I wish to record my opposition to the increase.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Oddly enough, the point made by Deputy Doherty that the State makes a lot of money from the measure is the only good thing about it. My problem with the measure is that it is regressive. I make the same argument about it that I made about tobacco in that it is another disproportionate hit for the less well-off - those on lower incomes who are being hammered from every quarter. This is symptomatic of the problem with the Government’s approach to taxation generally - not just this Government but successive Governments. Rather than opt for truly progressive redistributive taxation, they keep hitting the same group of people and effectively reducing their disposable income by loading taxes on goods they buy. That is why I am against the measure. In so far as there is a public health issue with alcohol abuse, this does not make a damn bit of difference, so I urge the Minister of State to please not waste our time with that spin. This is about money. That is fair enough, as the Government needs money, but there are more progressive alternative ways to raise money, as we have outlined on many occasions. I will not labour the point now but I pose the question of why we do not start taxing corporations, those on very high earnings and speculators, instead of giving them tax breaks. Let us go to that well instead of constantly going back to the same well of ordinary working people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support Deputy Broughan's amendment. The Government may try to attach the pension levy to other measures they think the public might want or support, but in reality it is just an austerity grab and an attack on pensioners. Now the promise that this austerity grab, which fuelled such anger among pensioners, would end at a certain point has been broken. That is fairly typical of what goes on. When unjust measures such as this levy are introduced, the Government becomes addicted to the money raised and the likelihood that the measures will ever be gotten rid of sinks further into the distance. This is all the more obnoxious because it is just another outworking of the bailout of bondholders and banks. I had a debate on this issue with the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, on the radio. One must examine the different approaches within this Bill. It gives new tax breaks for trading in securities and shares, for example, and further tax breaks to property speculators in the form of elaborate real estate investment trusts.The more I look into them, the more alarmed I become because this is the new mechanism to encourage speculation in a property boom. These guys are being looked after, encouraged and incentivised to do things that will destabilise the economy, while we continue the raid on smaller pensions. Pension provision is a serious issue that needs to be addressed. Just like the argument I made yesterday about health insurance, private pension schemes are unstable, subject to the whims of the market. One should note the connection. We let the speculators off the leash and they become the people who actually control the value of pensions. As the market goes up and down, so too do the values of pensions in a dangerous way. As has been suggested by several people, we should treble the State pension, making it an attractive and viable option for ordinary people, while, at the same time, doing away with all of the subsidies we give to the private pension business. Meanwhile, the Government is hitting those who have made understandable provision for their old age and has raided them in a nasty way. I oppose the continuation of the levy and the breach of promise it involves.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise in advance because I must leave the Chamber as soon as I have spoken to attend a meeting of the finance committee. The pensions situation is an absolute shambles and the lack of a policy for dealing with it is a disgrace for both the current and previous Governments. Pensioners in general, whether public or private, have been the innocent victims of an economic and financial crisis not of their making. Whether it is the extension of the retirement age, pension levies, the reduction of pension benefits in the public sector or the crisis of defined benefit pension funds, pensioners have got it in the neck. This is a disgrace. The pensions situation is complicated, but much of the complexity, in terms of different pension arrangements, whether public or private, arises from the fact the system is a shambles. It is an ad hoc process. This legislation is being brought forward under pressure because of the crisis and because of the European directive, but it is yet another ad hoc response that attempts to deal with a more general crisis. If we are to deal with the general crisis, we must start from first principles. We must ask ourselves what we are trying to do and what are to be our priorities. Our priorities should be based on the fact that a decent society provides education, housing, health services and a secure and dignified existence for people who retire. This provision for retired people should not be subject to the vagaries of markets, financial crashes and so on and should be enjoyed by all pensioners, whether in the public or private sector. Although we must start from the complicated situation we are in currently, the broad answer to the pensions crisis is to deal with the anomaly where €2.9 billion goes in tax relief to private pension schemes, the greatest beneficiaries of which are high income earners with big pensions. Most of the pension relief goes to these people. We cannot deal with this overnight or immediately, but we must do something to resolve this crazy situation. What this €2.9 billion in tax relief to private pensions means is that the State and ordinary citizens are underpinning a private pension casino for these pensioners, with disastrous consequences. We are making a casino of pensions, here and internationally, and whether people will have a dignified existence after making contributions all their lives is subject to the crazy vagaries of the market - of certain people making a lot of money in private pension schemes and of companies running away from their responsibilities.This must end. It would be far better to transfer the €2.9 billion to a universal pension scheme. One estimate is if we put the €2.9 billion into a universal State pension scheme we could double the State pension for everybody and it would be guaranteed. The advantage of this would be we would have public control of the pension funds and we could use them to invest in what we desperately need to restart the economy. This would not involve gambling them; of course there are never absolute guarantees, but if they were publicly controlled and we invested them in what would be useful in the domestic economy we could be far more certain of the outcome of the investments and therefore have a defined benefit for pensioners which they deserve. The idea we are moving increasingly from defined benefits to defined contributions, which are like a casino as to what one will get at the end, is wrong and regressive. It is part of a very worrying narrative that old people are now a problem and a burden for society. This is a disgrace and is indicative of a society which is going backwards. For many years after the Second World War we moved in the opposite direction and stated we would guarantee better things for pensioners. When I studied geography at school in the late 1980s I learned that because of the enormous wealth being generated by society the biggest problem we would have 20 or 30 years later would be the fact we would be retiring earlier and what would people do with their leisure time. Instead it has gone in the exact opposite direction; we have longer working lives, more precarious situations for pensioners and fewer benefits. This must be changed. The legislation is dealing with defined pension schemes and we must deal with this in the immediate term. Unless we deal with the more general problem we will keep running into crises. We must resolve it. In England 90% is guaranteed to a much higher level. We could do this. We could guarantee 90% or 100% up to €60,000 and cut the guarantee for those entitled to more than €60,000 to approximately 50%. Why do we need such a high guarantee for people on massive pensions which in many cases are double the average industrial wage? We should cut it.
