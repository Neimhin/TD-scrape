RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not. We have had a break for a week and the issue of the Paradise Papers has arisen. They had already been referred to and might more accurately be called the "Parasite Papers". They reveal a really shocking nexus of bankers, wealthy individuals and corporations dodging taxes. According to some reports-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would be unconscionable for the House not to debate these shocking revelations this week. I did not raise this issue for discussion today because I knew I would have been doing so at short notice-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but I am signalling to the Taoiseach that I hope the Government will facilitate a serious discussion on the matter, in respect of which billions of euro in tax revenue are at stake, and the shocking revelations about-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----the collusion of banks, possibly of legislation brought in by this Government, and wealthy individuals in tax evasion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have made my point, indeed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, it is on a different point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am indeed. Thank you, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle. In relation to the speaking arrangements for the Cannabis for Medicinal Use Regulation Bill, it is completely unacceptable that a report on Deputy Gino Kenny's Bill will commence with 15 minutes from the committee Chair, who is recommending that the Bill, which passed Second Stage, goes no further, and then 15 minutes from the Government, which is also recommending that the Bill goes no further, and that there is no allocated, formalised slot for the proposers of the Bill to defend the Bill and explain why they believe it should continue to Committee Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not about proportional representation. It is about balance in argument concerning a Bill we put forward-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----on a very important issue that affects tens of thousands of people with serious medical conditions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be helpful, the group is called Solidarity-People Before Profit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am happy to say the words. My question relates to the so-called Paradise Papers. The Government was supposed to transpose in June this year the EU anti-money-laundering directive which requires that we have information on the ultimate beneficial ownership of companies and corporate entities. This relates very much to the tax dodging of the Irish rich and Irish corporations revealed in the parasite papers. When will the directive be transposed? Infringement proceedings have been taken by the European Commission against Ireland for its failure to transpose it. This is further evidence of the total unwillingness of the Government to tackle corporate tax dodging by the rich and multinationals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to ask about the sub-committee on public services and whether it is considering the Government's responsibility for the current rail dispute. Subsidies for transport services, specifically rail services, have decreased dramatically since 2008, from €181 million to €117 million. If the Government was simply to restore the level of subvention to Irish Rail in 2008, Irish Rail would have more than enough money to fund the pay claims of rail workers who have not received a pay increase for ten years. If the Government raised its subvention to average EU levels, an extra €120 million would be put straight into Irish Rail's transport services, which would be more than enough to finance the modest pay claim of rail workers who do not want to be out on strike but who believe they have no other choice. Have the Taoiseach and the sub-committee accepted that it is the Government's failure to subvent public transport that is the cause of the dispute? There is a rigged game. It means that, even if Irish Rail does well and makes a profit of more than €3.5 million, that profit is taken away from it; therefore, it cannot possibly finance a pay increase. Unless we provide the subvention that we used to give or is common across Europe, this type of dispute will continue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is for all transport and not just Irish Rail.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They should all be subsidised.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So do I.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Before that, I want to say something on the amendments being ruled out of order. I do not understand and I say so genuinely. Amendments Nos. 16 and 18 tabled by Deputies Coppinger, Barry and Paul Murphy have been allowed and we will be allowed to debate them, and rightly so. They regard the preparation of reports on swimming pools and large water features in private residences. They related to water conservation and the need, following the passing of this Bill, for the Government to prepare reports on water conservation issues, which is right and proper, yet oddly, a whole series of other amendments also dealing with matters of water conservation, which similarly call for reports to be produced on water conservation measures, water infrastructure improvement measures, and indeed, swimming pools, has been ruled out of order. I cannot understand that. How can one series of amendments dealing with those topics be allowed and a whole raft of others dealing with precisely the same topics not be?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I genuinely do not want to carry on this for no purpose.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I will move it in a second but genuinely, at the first opportunity I had to get up and speak, I objected to the amendments prior to amendment No. 15, which include amendments which I tabled, being ruled out of order. I asked a very specific question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On amendment No. 7. I asked why it had been ruled out of order when other amendments of exactly the same character and content-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 7. Why was it ruled out of order when other amendments such as Nos. 16 and 18, which deal with precisely the same subjects, are allowed? I just do not understand it. It is inexplicable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is precisely my question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not answer the second part of my question, which is, if that amendment is out of order, why is it that other amendments which deal with exactly the same issues have, rightly, not been deemed out of order?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is an inconsistency. I do not see how a Standing Order which rules out some amendments on a given basis, does not apply to others on the same basis. It just does not add up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not an explanation however.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not an explanation and it shows an inconsistency and incoherence to the-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----way in which amendments are being dealt with.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 15:In page 8, to delete lines 22 to 30. This is really the only opportunity we will have to shoehorn in all the other issues. It should not be like that. It does, in my opinion, curtail a debate on the issues that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Interestingly, the Government, through this Bill, seeks to allow, in the section which my amendment deals with, monitoring of water usage in dwellings. That is allowed and is deemed relevant to the Bill and yet a whole series of amendments which seek to deal with water conservation and water usage more generally, and particularly wasteful water usage, have been ruled out of order and deemed not relevant to the Bill. To my mind that is a very political decision. One type of monitoring of usage is legitimate - monitoring which opens the door to charges being levied against individuals and households. That kind of monitoring is allowed and we can have it in the Bill. Monitoring which seeks to address excessive usage by super wealthy people with swimming pools is apparently not relevant. Monitoring which looks at water conservation in the mains, where the real leakage happens, is not relevant to the Bill. A referendum which seeks to keep water services in public ownership so that private vultures do not pillage our water system for profit, which in places such as Britain has led to a disastrous collapse in investment in water infrastructure and leak prevention, is not deemed relevant and is ruled out of order. It is okay however to monitor the individual. Do not monitor the corporations or the Government's failure to deal with the massive leaks in the system, but monitor the individual - the one area in which the expert commission said there was no wastage. Why does the Minister need this reference, which I do not fully understand, to a distinction between households of four as opposed to individuals? Why does he need the averaging of 2.75 people per household? If the charges are levied on that basis, what happens if a third or fourth person is in the house? The Minister shakes his head at that but that is how the legislation seems to read.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why then does the Minister include these interesting distinctions? He can try to explain them but, to my mind, it indicates that he is trying to leave that back door open through this sort of mechanism. Then he will be able to vary what he considers excessive usage and levy charges, as soon as he thinks it is politically expedient or possible to do so. I take some comfort in the fact that it will not be politically possible for him to do it any time soon because he would suffer an absolutely extraordinary political backlash. It is the people's resistance which has forced the Minister to back-pedal as far as he has. This kind of measure is about leaving the back door open and trying to establish the principle of a threshold, above which people will pay. The Minister will then begin to move that threshold based on the monitoring of individuals' usage and new definitions of what excessive usage is, which he can introduce over time. That has been always the Minister's agenda. It was never ever about water conservation for him or for Fine Gael. It was always about getting a bridgehead in respect of charging individuals which would allow bills to be sent and a revenue stream to be generated from water services which, at some time, will allow for the privatisation of water services.That, of course, is also why the Government does not want to hold a referendum. It does not state it directly, but it cites the legal difficulties and constitutional complexities of defining public ownership. However, all of that is mar dhea because it actually wants to leave the door open for the reintroduction of water charges at some point. A point we do not emphasise enough in this debate is that there have been three successive attempts by the political establishment to introduce water charges. It is not new. An attempt was made in the 1980s and another in the 1990s. There is also an attempt now. Therefore, it was not the troika that was responsible. The Government was not pushed into doing this. The decision predates environmental concerns. It was the Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil agenda from the word go, but they were not able to implement it because of popular anger and resistance. The logic of the amendment is to delete the problematic provisions in the Bill which are, at best, ambiguous and essentially leave the door open for the monitoring of usage by individuals, paving the way for the reintroduction of charges for usage below what the Government has defined as excessive.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The thing that I do not understand is the failure to acknowledge the glaring hypocrisy and contradiction in the Government position.This contradiction which was evident from the beginning continues and persists even now that the mass movement against water charges has forced it to retreat on the levying of domestic water charges on most people. I refer to the Government's consistent and dishonest attempts to justify its support for water charges by referring to the need for water conservation to deal with the water infrastructure problem and incentivise and encourage people to engage in water conservation measures. We never believed the Government; we always knew that the agenda was privatisation and getting a revenue stream because it had made several attempts before. If it is not going to stand up and admit it was lying to people, will the Minister please explain why he will not accept amendments which attempt to deal with water conservation and the big areas of water wastage? Most leaks are from water mains, with only 7% of water leaks in the system coming from individual households and the remainder coming from water mains. It was Fine Gael, and Fianna Fáil before it, which during the austerity period slashed the investment programme to deal with water mains. It was their fault that the water infrastructure got worse. It had nothing to do with opposition to water charges and everything to do with their decision to cut capital investment in water infrastructure. Ironically, People Before Profit and Solidarity are the only parties to put forward in their budgets a real water conservation grant linked with implementing domestic water conservation measures. Why does the Government not support our proposal? Given that the Minister did not address this issue in his first reply, it seems that the Government has never been interested in water conservation, and that it is only interested in a back door to domestic water charges.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said the Government was lying about its concern for-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In that case, can I say the Government was lying?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I withdraw any personal reference to the Minister, but the Government was lying.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will now hear from the Minister who always tells the truth.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is very relevant.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Acting Chairman saying that he feels our pain?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a big admission.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a bit of a giveaway, a bit of a reveal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I strongly support this amendment. One of the shocking examples of the waste of money in this whole debacle of Irish Water was the installation of household meters. Anybody looking objectively and impartially at value for money for the public would have said this was madness. The amount of money that was spent on putting in these household meters was to capture what Irish Water itself said was only 7% of the leaks in the system, that is, only 7% of the water leaking out of the system leaked from households to the mains whereas 93% of it was leaking beyond that, and the meters which have cost us close to €1 billion will not capture that. If that €1 billion had instead gone into ramping up the capital investment programme to deal with upgrading the mains infrastructure and dealing with the leaks, we would be in a much better place now. On a point that is not highlighted enough, it was those who claimed that water charges were about water conservation - Fine Gael and, before it, Fianna Fáil - who slashed the capital investment programme in the austerity years by hundreds of millions of euro. When they got up time and again to justify household water charges, they would ask us to look at all the water that is leaking from the system, and look at how decrepit the water system is, while failing to mention that it was decisions made first by Fianna Fáil and then by Fine Gael to slash hundreds of millions from the capital investment programme in the austerity years that had worsened an already bad situation in that regard. That was then compounded by saying that, with the money available, we were going to pay Denis O'Brien to put in household meters which will not deal with any of that problem and will not compensate for the years of under-investment that they had worsened. I think the Comptroller and Auditor General would look at that and say it is not good value for money, and it might also raise questions about how Denis O'Brien got the contract, because that is also the kind of thing the Comptroller and Auditor General looks into. When we think about the enormous expenditures beyond that to consultants, shocking money was spent on billing and administration and, of course, on obscene salaries, hourly rates and what-not for these consultants, who were brought in by Irish Water to set up the systems, there was enormous wastage. The public were horrified in so far as they were made aware of this. Indeed, what helped sink the already sinking ship of the water charges were the revelations about the extent of expenditures for the metering programme and on consultants. I think the Comptroller and Auditor General might have called a stop, or at least would have put question marks over all that expenditure and whether it represented good value for money. It is imperative, given the absolutely rotten record of Irish Water to date and its enormous wastage of money, that there be proper oversight and accountability for its expenditures of money. Obviously, the far better solution would be just to abolish it, full stop, but seeing the Government is not willing to do that, at the very least it could accept Deputy Murphy's amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Many points have been made but it is worth underlining that if one talks to people in the local authorities, and this is true with regard to both housing and water, they always know what needs to be done. The problem has been that they were not resourced to do it. There are not enough people employed in the local authorities because we have run down the staffing numbers, particularly of outdoor workers directly employed to do work such as identifying leaks and fixing them. The capital investment programme was chronically deficient and, as I mentioned earlier, it was slashed by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael successively in the aftermath of 2008. The slashing of the capital investment programme to upgrade the water infrastructure, which is Victorian and decrepit, and running down the number of directly employed outdoor workers in water departments in local authorities are the problems. That is why we have a problem. If the Government was serious about dealing with the water infrastructure, which it never was, it would be employing lots of people to fix the water mains. They would be directly employed by the local authorities, where the expertise is. The SLAs between Irish Water and the local authorities proved all of this. It was a complete joke. We set up this quango, paid millions of euro to Denis O'Brien to install meters and paid tens of millions of euro to consultants for billing and their big salaries. It was all a waste. What we needed to do, as Irish Water ultimately did, was go to the local authorities and ask them to do the work. However, it is now more inefficient because there is another layer, a quango called Irish Water, leaching money out of the system but handing the work back to the local authorities anyway. It is just laughable. It is another proof, as it were, that Irish Water was never about dealing with those problems, because they could and should be dealt with directly via the local authorities being resourced and staffed, but was always about something else, which was setting up a company that could get revenue from water charging and ultimately move towards privatisation. A proper audit of what must be done to deal with the massive amount of unaccounted for water and putting the resources into the local authorities to do that work is the way to deal with the problem. On the conservation grant, I wish to underline that Solidarity-People Before Profit is the only party that has included an allocation of €100 million for a water conservation grant in its pre-budget submissions for the last three years. No other party has done so. The Government introduced a water conservation grant which was not linked to water conservation measures. It was nothing but a bribe. It gave the money to try to soften the bitter pill of domestic water charges. We have proposed a water conservation grant which would be given to households that carry out water conservation measures such as retrofitting their houses and so forth to put in systems that would reduce their usage of treated water. If the Government is to be believed, and whatever I might think about Deputy Eoghan Murphy's bona fides, I do not credit the Government's bona fides on this matter at all. To use less colourful language than I used earlier, where is the conservation grant if it cares about this? It is not there; it is not even in the Government's head. If it was serious about this stuff it would support the introduction of a genuine conservation grant linked to and supporting householders who are trying to install water conservation measures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In so far as the Minister claims that this Bill is geared towards water conservation, it is not directed at the majority of people but at a very small group which is identified as excessive users. We do not accept that is the main motive and we have expressed the view that it is a means of keeping a foot in on domestic charging so that over time the thresholds will be lowered bringing more people into the charging net. If the Minister was serious and this was actually a water conservation Bill and the matter is as urgent as he says it is - which it is - he would do something about this now. Rather than wait for some stage in the future when resources allow, he would support people, through grants, who are trying to reduce treated water usage. These can be for things such as flushing toilets which can be very substantially reduced with a little investment but is something that many people cannot afford. People want to do the right thing by the environment and conserve our water resources. They never accepted that the Government's water charges were designed to do that, seeing them as designed to punish them on top of all the other financial punishments they suffered. We are proposing a positive incentive to people, so that where people install water-harvesting measures or measures that will reduce their treated water usage, the State will support them by providing them with a grant. If it is important it should happen now, not at some distant point in the future.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will not get it finished tonight.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who knows.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It will be through in the morning. This is quite an important amendment. It speaks to how seriously we take the question of conservation and who we think can help inform a policy or a conscientious approach towards the management, conservation and protection of our water resources. I made the point already that the first answer to that question lies with those who work in water services in the local authorities. These are the people who know and they need to be very strongly represented. It is worth pointing out that year in, year out, the workers in local authority water departments told elected councillors in local authorities that they needed more investment in water infrastructure. It was political decisions by councils, dominated by Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, not to put investment into water infrastructure. It was a political failure by the very same political parties who wanted to introduce water charges. It was not the fault of the workers. If we had listened to the workers and the directors of services and so on, in the local authorities, the investment would have happened. It was not regarded as politically useful or expedient or a priority for Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil and when the time came to cut things in 2008, that is where they started and we are suffering a bitter price as a result. Having workers and trade union representatives in substantial numbers to represent those workers on the water forum is a good idea.  The other part is to have local community representatives. If one wants real buy-in from the community on how we manage, protect and conserve our water resources, then one will facilitate significant representation from communities in a water forum which will overlook things such as seeing if we are implementing EU water directives, as this Bill says this forum is supposed to do. Are the customers being looked after? I hate the phraseology of "customers". The corporate-speak gives away what Irish Water is really about, rather than referring to citizens who have rights. However, that is the wording in the legislation. We should have real community involvement in the management, oversight and protection of our water resources. These are very reasonable, sensible amendments.  On the advisory body, it is critical that we have representatives of the trade unions because they will be dealing with issues relating to industrial relations such as pay and conditions of those working in water services. It is particularly important since another impact of the setting up of Irish Water in the longer term will be an attempt to undermine the conditions of those working in water services as we move to a more privatised, commercially focused model in Irish Water. It is the other side of the coin; the running down of staff numbers in proper pensionable jobs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Sinn Féin for tabling the motion and the "RTÉ Investigates" team for highlighting the issue. The landlords who exploited and profited from the conditions that we saw on "RTÉ Investigates" are just animals. They are flipping animals and they should be in prison. Nothing like that should be tolerated. They are the lowest of the low. What is scandalous is not just those extreme cases but the scale of non-compliance with regulations in the private rented sector. It is shocking. In a number of counties including Kilkenny, Louth, Offaly and Limerick, the non-compliance rate was 100%. In other counties the rate was in the high 90%, including in south Dublin, and in the high 80% in places like Galway, Meath and Clare. This is a shocking level of non-compliance with standards. While not all may be as bad as the horrific conditions that we saw on television, this is not a question of a few bad apples. This is chronic and endemic. Someone said that it is a pity that it had to take an "RTÉ Investigates" programme to wake us up and that is certainly true. I remember coming into this House in 2012. I was a year in the Dáil at the time and was doing Leaders' Questions with the then Tánaiste, Eamon Gilmore. I said that we were on our way to a return to tenement conditions. The current Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, was giving out on television yesterday about the left and Sinn Féin heckling people but I certainly got heckled that day. There were hoots of derision from across the Fine Gael benches. Deputies said that I must be joking, that I was over-dramatising things. I referred to Seán O'Casey and tenement conditions and said that we were on the way back and there was laughter from across the Fine Gael benches. The Ceann Comhairle at the time had to stop proceedings in order to try to shut the Fine Gael Deputies up, such was the level of heckling. I was warning back in 2012 that we were heading towards tenement conditions.It has taken until now for an acknowledgement but it was predictable - it was all so predictable. On the famous supply and demand equation, if the Government does not provide council housing, if it does not have enough staff in the local authorities and is, in fact, slashing staff who are supposed to conduct inspections, all of this was eminently predictable. Now, will we get the sort of radical action we need? I agree completely with the NCT-style proposal but we have to have the staff, which means hundreds of people being put into the local authorities to do the inspections. Critically, however, there will always be underground slum landlords if there is a situation where there is not enough quality social housing that is affordable and provided by the State itself. Indeed, and it is for another debate, the State's own housing stock has big problems. We just had a finding against us from Europe under the European Social Chapter in regard to the conditions in local authority housing complexes where there is chronic damp. I know from my own local authority, where, when we tell staff there is chronic damp, and because they do not have the resources, they say people need to open the windows because ventilation is the problem. Ventilation is not the problem; it is the deplorable and unacceptable conditions. If that is happening in the public sector, God knows the shocking situation in the private sector.
