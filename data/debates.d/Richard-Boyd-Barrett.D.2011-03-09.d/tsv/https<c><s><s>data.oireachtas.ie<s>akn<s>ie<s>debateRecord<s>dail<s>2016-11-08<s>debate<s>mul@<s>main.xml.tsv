RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed. Since the Business Committee last met the week before last, an issue we have discussed this morning and which is of the gravest importance to the entire country has come into view. We have major disruption of our secondary schools. Students or teachers are locked out, depending on how one wants to view it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a proposal. There has been claim and counterclaim today on the reasons for the teachers' dispute and the method by which it can be resolved and that requires that we have a debate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is simply unacceptable that this could continue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My proposal is that we have a debate. I accept that we cannot have it today given the schedule before us, but it is reasonable to propose that there is a proper debate tomorrow to give everybody an opportunity to clarify his or her views and to put forward proposals to resolve it so that this lock-out does not continue and tens and thousands of young people are not further discommoded.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was two weeks ago. The lock-out has happened since then.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking for a bit of urgency to respond to something that is happening now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to repeat my point on the proposal in regard to Thursday. If the lock-out goes ahead on Wednesday, I simply cannot believe we will finish out the week without a serious discussion in this House. It is a dereliction of duty for the House not to debate the issue in detail and try to find a solution.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Business Committee did not meet last week.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This has come up since then. If the Minister of State, Deputy Doherty, does not understand that an urgent crisis has arisen since last week, then she is living on a different planet to the teachers and tens of thousands of pupils who have been discommoded.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I urge the Government to allow for such a debate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put that to the Government. I refer to the all-party motion on Calais, to be taken without debate. The problem is that we have not seen the motion. When will we see it? I am not signing a blank cheque for a motion that relates to the fate of 200 extremely vulnerable children. I will not agree to an all-party motion, which we have not seen, without debate. Can we see the motion?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the motion is not what has been sought by the Not On Our Watch group, we want it amended and we want a debate. If it is what has been sought and what has been discussed in this House, happy days. If there is any row-back in the motion that is to be tabled by the Government in terms of the 200 unaccompanied children, we want a debate on it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I object to that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not agreeing to that. We cannot sign a blank cheque.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for the prohibition of Hydraulic Fracturing and all other practices to extract Hydrocarbon from coal seams, shale rock and tight sands in Ireland.I am aware that the week before last we debated Deputy Tony McLoughlin's Bill which I supported to ban fracking. In parallel with whatever work he was doing on that Bill, I was working to update a similar Bill that I had submitted last December, namely, the Prohibition of Hydraulic Fracturing Bill 2015. I withdrew it from the lottery because it had become clear in the aftermath of events in Antrim that the definition of hydraulic fracturing did not necessarily cover other forms of unconventional extraction of hydrocarbons that essentially were fracking or paved the way for it. Like Deputy Tony McLoughlin, I was working with Friends of the Earth, An Taisce and other groups to refine the Bill to make it more specific and allow it to catch up with technological developments. I am happy with Deputy Tony McLoughlin's Bill, as I signalled to him two weeks ago. I commend him, including for giving a voice to campaigners in his area and environmental campaigners generally who are fighting to ensure we will rule out any possibility of engaging in hydraulic fracturing. However, there is a small difference between his Bill and mine. Actually, it is a significant difference and I suspect that he will probably agree with me. If we have moved towards an agreement or a consensus that we should rule out hydraulic fracturing onshore, as I hope we have, that prohibition should apply offshore also. That is the additional feature of my Bill. I do not intend to add my Bill to the lottery at this point. We will see how the debate goes on Deputy Tony McLoughlin's Bill on Committee Stage when I hope he and the Government will be open to an amendment to include the offshore in the prohibition of hydraulic fracturing and unconventional extraction. The reason is simple. Human health, the impact on the environment and the need to address climate change were the three key issues on which the House seemed to agree were at stake in trying to ban hydraulic fracturing. The evidence suggests human health, the environment and water will be adversely affected by hydraulic fracturing and that there is no justification, particularly in the light of our Paris Declaration commitments to address climate change urgently, for extracting more hydrocarbons or finding new ways to do so. If that is true onshore, self-evidently, it is true offshore also. A further important concern people have raised is seismic impacts, for example, the potential for earthquakes to occur and so on. There is considerable evidence that this technology can contribute to earthquakes and that it has done so. The precautionary principle that was cited in the debate about hydraulic fracturing onshore needs to apply to hydraulic fracturing offshore also. Our offshore territorial waters are a precious resource, just as our land resources are. All of the reasons that have been recounted - tourism, biodiversity, human habitats, animal habitats and so on - apply just as much offshore. Any prohibition on fracking must, therefore, apply offshore. It is in that context that I am submitting the Bill. I hope including it in the lottery will not be necessary further down the road if the Government is open to accepting my amendment to Deputy Tony McLoughlin's Bill on Committee Stage. If it is not, I will try to press ahead with my Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move: "That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time."
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move:That leave be granted to withdraw the Prohibition of Hydraulic Fracturing Bill 2015.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Unfortunately, I could not attend the dialogue last week because I had a commitment-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with Deputy Brendan Howlin. There will not always be agreement but there will be agreement in some areas and we should try to achieve agreement in these areas and work together regardless of whether it is taking up issues with the European Union or the British Government around things like grant funding in Northern Ireland, making sure we do not have a hard Border and other issues relating to particular sectors. In so far as the dialogue has started, is there recognition that one of the lessons of all of this is that our economy is not diversified enough and that it is too dependent on a couple of key sectors, notably beef? I submitted a question that was not taken. I was contacted by the Iranian ambassador before the summer break who told me that Iran was willing to sign a contract for beef with this country worth €2 billion if we were willing to re-establish the embassy in Tehran. That is something the Taoiseach should know. The Iranians even offered a building in Tehran if the Taoiseach did decide to re-establish the embassy. I saw a shocking graph at a meeting at the weekend which showed that when one stripped out of our growth figures-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----intellectual property-related trade-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Nobody else was interrupted.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question follows from Deputy Ryan's, in a way. There is no doubt that we need to move in the direction of assisting people with the punitive cost of child care. We also need to underpin parental choice. We need to ensure that it will actually achieve what the Minister hopes it will. Given the amount of money involved, I worry whether it can achieve that. Is €32 million the full year cost? Given that the money will come in September, what will the full year cost be? In some cases, which I will go into, will it not achieve its end.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The scheme does not start until September 2017. How long does the funding of 32 million run into next year? What is the full year cost of the universal and targeted elements? I am in favour of targeted and universal elements. I recognise that people working in child care have to be paid properly and so on, and that we need to develop capacity. Given all of those requirements and the fact that we need funding for a full year, can the funding really deliver on all of those fronts?To what extent is the money that had been available to schemes that are now being wound up being rolled into this money? In other words, how much of the money is new money? I met a lone parent earlier. She explained that the closure of the community employment childcare, CEC, programme and the childcare education and training support, CETS, programme means that the maximum contribution those working on a community employment scheme had to pay is now gone. They will end up having to pay more. Lone parents will have to pay more. The new scheme will be a disincentive. We will not have labour activation, but labour deactivation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What months will it cover?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think the Minister understood the other question. With the winding-up of the CEC and the CETS programmes, those who were availing of them are telling me that they will be required under the new scheme to make a bigger contribution to expensive child care from their already low incomes. Consequently, they will be in a worse position. It will be more difficult for them to go to work because the scheme is quite minimal. This is the problem. To make all these different elements work, we need a lot more money.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what I am talking about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As far as we are concerned, Deputies are paid too much. We believe the pay of public representatives should be linked to that of those they represent. In this way, public representatives would have an incentive to improve the lot of the majority. Part of the disconnect between politics and the majority of people is in the fact that the material circumstances of public representatives, in our case Deputies and Ministers, are on a different planet from those of the majority of those whom they represent. Against that background, it is a no-brainer for us to state that it is unacceptable for Deputies to receive a €5,000 increase when somebody on the minimum wage gets an extra 10 cent an hour. Some 23% of workers in this country are officially low paid, a figure that has dramatically increased in recent years, and people on social welfare and pensioners got a miserable €5 extra per week, while a young jobseeker got even less at half of that - an utterly miserable increase. Secondary schools across the country are closed and may be closed for quite a long period if this Government does not relent, instead of refusing to pay the €6 per week extra per teacher that was promised to them under the Haddington Road agreement. The Government reneged on a promise, not the teachers - as suggested by the Taoiseach earlier today. The teachers stuck to the agreement and wanted to be paid €6 per week per teacher, some €300 per year, but it has been decided that we cannot pay that. We are willing to allow the schools of the country to close and to lock teachers and students out but it is okay for Deputies to get an extra €5,000 to take them up to the extremely well-paid salary of €92,000. That is unacceptable but the Government, and the political establishment of Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party, do not understand how unjust it is. I heard somebody say that Deputies worked hard and that is true but so do people who work in Tesco. So do nurses and many of them, I suspect, work a lot harder than Deputies. So do teachers and so do firemen. So do the ushers in this House, who will leave here an hour or two after we leave and who also do not have equal pay for equal work. It is not just the teachers and nurses who do not get equal pay. A teacher who joined after 2012 gets approximately €6,000 less for doing the same job than somebody who was already employed. We are going to give ourselves a €5,000 increase but we cannot give it to low-paid nurses or teachers or the ushers here who will leave an hour or two after we have all gone. Their family lives are often wrecked by the ever-changing hours in this House but it is okay to do that to them and to teachers, nurses and other public servants. I do not think that is acceptable. It is important to give them a shout out because they make this place function as public servants, like teachers and nurses make the State function. If the Government forces this through we will publish where we are giving the extra money to. If it is next week, we will give it to the ASTI strike fund; if it is next year and the nurses are on strike, we will give it to them and we will publish other good causes where we will put our money. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is pro-choice.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, Deputy Mattie McGrath is perfectly entitled to his views on us but he should withdraw the remark about us spitting at gardaí.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What did the Deputy see?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What did the Deputy see?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is disgraceful.
