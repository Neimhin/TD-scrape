RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Barry. I thank Deputy Funchion for introducing this important Bill, which I obviously fully support. It should be acted on immediately. I am very conscious of how important this Bill is, particularly because as an adoptee, I am lucky that I did not have to wade my way through all the barriers and difficulties that many adoptees have faced in trying to secure access to their history, identity and the basic facts of who they are. In my case, my mother actually came and found me although she encountered extraordinary difficulties and closed doors in a process completely mediated by the church, which decided what information one could have. Institutions of the State essentially shut the door and said my mother was not entitled to the information she was seeking but, luckily for me, she managed to wade her way through all the barriers. I cannot imagine what it is like for people who seek out their identity to have such barriers and difficulties put in their way and, even worse, for those who had their identities and histories criminally stolen from them. This is shocking beyond belief. What was revealed in the “RTÉ Investigates” programme about the role of Mr. de Valera’s son in Holles Street was stunning beyond belief. It involved the faking of pregnancies and the taking of children from individuals, in most cases from less well-off sections of society, in order to give them to respectable families. This was done in a criminal way involving the stealing of people's history and identity from them and, potentially, blotting that out forever. On the sampling review, 260 out of 1,500 in the sample had the markers which suggested the possibility, at least, of illegal adoptions. That is approximately 16% of that small sample of people. We could be talking about 20,000 with those markers. There has to be an investigation and a forensic examination of all of that in order to uncover the criminal actions that were perpetrated and discover, to the best degree possible, the culprits involved and the mechanisms and so on by means of which those actions were perpetrated. Beyond that, as others have stated, it is not just about birth certificates and so on, it is about all the information, everything about people's history and identity, the circumstances surrounding their adoption, etc. People have to have access to all of that. For adoptees and for mothers whose children were taken from them by the twisted morality of church and State, there is no doubt that the legacy of that continues to block people individually and society as a whole from getting to the truth we deserve in terms of that history for the individuals involved and for our society. This is a basic thing. The fact we need comprehensive legislation, as the Minister indicated, in respect of a range of matters should not be a block to processing this measure, which will at least give people basic access to their birth certificates. Too often, what we are going to do in the future becomes the excuse for not doing what we could do right now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is looking for a waiver of pre-legislative scrutiny of the residential tenancies Bill, in which he intends to extend the enhanced Covid protections for tenants in arrears, but it is not clear whether it will keep those protections for other tenants where they face eviction on grounds of sale or refurbishment. I have cited on numerous occasions here the plight of tenants in Dún Laoghaire who have always paid their rent. A ruthless vulture fund is moving to evict them immediately these restrictions are lifted. I am looking for clarity and appealing to the Taoiseach to ensure that the enhanced protections for tenants are not just on the grounds of arrears but are also maintained for others facing eviction in the context of the pandemic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not pretty embarrassing that Boris Johnson's Government has managed to do a better job of rolling out the vaccination programme than our Government? This is the Prime Minister who made an absolute hames of the initial response to the pandemic and who, to put it mildly, has shown incompetence at many levels during this crisis. However, Boris Johnson's Government is streets ahead of us in terms of securing the vaccine and rolling it out. Does the Taoiseach have an explanation as to how we could get it so wrong and even Boris Johnson could get it so right? Serious questions need to be asked. As difficult as I suspect it might be to do so, did the Taoiseach obtain any insights from Boris Johnson on the telephone as to how the British Government got it so right and we got it so wrong and why our vaccination programme is in serious trouble and so far behind the UK? This has potentially serious consequences in terms of there being an all-Ireland epidemiological unit, with high levels of vaccination in the North and pitifully low levels here, with all the possibilities that has of encouraging variants and so on, which could undermine everybody's efforts. In all seriousness, I would like an explanation. Does the Taoiseach have an explanation as to the incredible contrast between what we have done here on vaccination and what Boris Johnson has managed to do?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It seems the European Union has performed extremely badly in securing the supplies of vaccine that we need and the contrast with Britain is stark. I wonder the extent to which this is because the European Union is deferring to the big pharmaceutical companies that are producing the vaccine because of their desire to make money and so on. I say that because, for example, the World Health Organization is calling for support for the People's Vaccine issue, which will be voted on at the World Trade Organization where Europe is holding out against the waiving of intellectual property rights, the sharing of technology and so on that would be necessary to ramp up supplies. It seems to me that this is because they are kowtowing to the companies, which are securing to maximise profit from the production of the vaccine. Even the contrast with the United States is interesting. Joe Biden has seized the means of production. He has done a socialist thing. He seized the means of production with the Defense Production Act in order to ramp up supply but we do not seem to have the same attitude. The Taoiseach might also comment on what efforts have been made - I asked a question but I did not really understand the answer - in engagement we have had with Russia and China over their vaccines and why we are not trying to secure supplies of those vaccines. Every day we do not have vaccine rolled out is another day of hardship and sacrifice for the people of this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could we get a brief answer on the Chinese and Russian vaccines?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Sisters of Charity have been again implicated in really quite shameful practices, in terms of the revelations about illegal adoptions and their involvement in St. Patrick's Guild. The order has also been implicated in the mother and baby home scandal but, incredibly, this same religious order will be running the National Maternity Hospital, against a background where Archbishop Diarmuid Martin said last May that under no circumstances, regardless of the outcome of the transfer to the St. Vincent's Holdings group, which is controlled by the Sisters of Charity, was there a place for abortions in hospitals run by the Catholic Church. This is extraordinary stuff. There are visually impaired and disabled residents near the campus of St. Vincent's Hospital in St. Mary's Telford, who themselves went through mother and baby homes and who are now being evicted by the Sisters of Charity. Elderly women who are blind are being evicted by the Sisters of Charity. This is a publicly funded critical part of the national health service but run by a religious order that is unaccountable to anybody and has behaved in these ways. Does the Taoiseach raise these issues? Is it not way past time that our hospitals and the assets these religious orders own are taken back into public ownership?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Barry. The Minister may not know it but he has People Before Profit to thank for the opportunity to debate this issue. We specifically requested it at the Business Committee. Such is our commitment to this matter, we have also tabled a motion that will give the Minister another opportunity to discuss it tomorrow. I will have more time to set out our stall in that debate. Covid has brought us to a moment when long-overdue, radical reform and overhaul of the further, higher and third level education sector and access to it is due. There are many different aspects to this. I agree with the point about the words "further" and "higher". There is an implicit class distinction there that we need to eliminate. That is part of the problem which starts with the leaving certificate. The latter creates stress, mental health pressures and a hurdle over which one has to jump at a young age in order to get to higher education. It is fundamentally perpetuating an inequality and a hierarchy and is limiting access to education in a way it should not. If we are serious about an overhaul, we have to get rid of all barriers. We would consider it unthinkable to ration access to primary and secondary education. Why on earth would we ration, through leaving cert exams, fees and other barriers, access to further and higher education, apprenticeships or whatever? It makes no sense. It creates competition, pressure and a hierarchy. It leads to people dropping out and it is bad for our society at every level. Those barriers should be removed and that starts with the leaving cert. It has no place anymore, as it is blocking entrance for some to further and higher education. Fees in this country are now the highest anywhere in the European Union. There is no justification for that or for anything that puts pressure on people to drop out of education. Nor is there justification for the thousands of people working in higher education in temporary, insecure positions who would love to be working full-time in a better, radically reformed higher and further education system. Should we not, as an objective, say that all the barriers must go? Education to the highest level is a right for everybody and barriers, whether exams, financial barriers or others, must be removed.
