RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In so far as the delegates are here to warn against a further attack on the pay of public sector workers, I am 100% with them.  I will back them all the way, as will the United Left Alliance and, I suspect, quite a few of the other Independent Members.  Contrary to the mythology and demonisation which has occurred for several years, public sector workers have been slaughtered through the imposition of pay cuts and pension taxes, alongside significantly increased demands.  I am nauseated by their demonisation.One could argue that many of the problematic practices within the public service emanated from the desire on the part of the Government and those at the top of the public service to mimic the private sector.  The attitude was that if CEOs in the banks and the corporate sector were being paid €500,000 or €1 million, those at the top of the public sector should be paid the same and that politicians should earn more than President Obama.  This nonsense was not driven by unions or public sector workers on low or middle incomes.  I suspect the delegates would agree that no one in the trade unions, or on the left for that matter, would oppose reform in this regard.  Frankly, much of that carry-on was alien to the public service in the first place.Perhaps the delegates might comment on something very important.  Many of the problems - I still think many of the poorly spent funds must be examined - stem from the degree to which public services are being privatised or contracted out.  I have tabled parliamentary questions on this issue to try to get answers.  I have some evidence that in so far as one gets rid of directly employed public service workers and replaces them with agency workers, it costs the State more and, in many cases, the quality of service is seriously undermined.I am on the delegates' side of the fence, but are they claiming too much success for the Croke Park agreement?  I am coming at this issue not from the angle of those who wish to unpick the agreement and attack the pay of low and middle income workers but from the point of view of whether it has protected public services and unions' members or is part of a strategy to deal with the economic crisis.  The unions talk a great deal about the need for an alternative strategy.  Is the Croke Park agreement helping in that regard?At the level of services, one cannot take 38,000 people out of the public service and not have a deterioration in services.  Is it not the case that there has been a deterioration in services?  Some 7,000 have left the health service and that figure will increase to 15,000.  Is there not a connection between this and the fact that ambulance services are being removed in west Cork and that local accident and emergency services are being downgraded throughout the country?  There must be a connection.  There must also be a connection with pupil-teacher ratios disimproving, caps on the numbers of special needs assistants, reduced social housing maintenance services and so forth.  In the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area the maintenance crews have been steadily run down, as a consequence of which council houses are boarded up for months on end, much to the anger of local residents who are desperate to obtain a council house.  The maintenance workers tell me this is directly related to the fact that there are not enough maintenance workers directly employed.  The work is contracted out and the tendering process takes forever.  Half of the time the contractor who gets the job goes bust.  He or she must be taking a slice of the profit.  We cannot protect services if we allow that number of public service workers to be sucked out of the system.  The medical card system is a disaster.  We have been inundated with telephone calls since the service was centralised in Finglas.  People cannot get their medical cards and appeals take forever.  This is due to the cuts in staff.  I do not see, therefore, why we should defend the agreement.That leads to the central point I wish to make.  The unions have, correctly, criticised the folly of austerity in general.  The ICTU has produced a document entitled Austerity is Not Working, in which it makes the point that any sane person would make, that if one takes €3.5 billion out of the budget for this and the next two years, one is essentially choking off the possibility of economic recovery.  One is doing enormous damage if one reduces people's income and the number of public service workers.  Furthermore, if one lets the retirement age be raised to 68 years without firing a shot in resistance - all of Europe was in flames, yet there was no resistance here - is that not doing damage to the employment prospects of younger people?  If public service workers are forced to work for three years longer, surely there will be fewer jobs at the other end for young people.  That is obviously the case, but we are not resisting.  That is not to mention how regressive it is that people have to work longer.  If the unions state, on the one hand, that austerity is damaging and not working and that we must move away from it if we are to have any chance of economic recovery, how can they oversee, on the other, a deal that is essentially managing or imposing that austerity?  I do not understand the connection between the two.  I see a contradiction in it, although the delegates will no doubt say it is realpolitik and that they must do it.Mr. Cody has made the point that we are broke and must accept this.  It is bad that the unions are accepting that argument in their document.  The delegates might say it is secondary to the details that follow, but I do not believe the unions should accept that argument.  It is the argument used to justify the current austerity measures.  Surely we should point out that the reasons we have a deficit are, first, the actions of the banks and, second, the rich are not taxed enough in this country and too many are paid too much at the top.  There is also the fact - this is something the unions would state - that we cannot bridge the deficit unless there is investment and a stimulus in the economy to put people back to work.  It is worrying that the unions use a phrase such as "the country is broke".  The country has plenty of wealth and resources; the problem is presented by their distribution.Given that the unions are stating austerity is not working and is wrong and counterproductive and that we must move in an alternative direction, why are they not more active in mobilising protests and resistance to the austerity agenda?  I do not understand it.  Before the general election, they mobilised people in significant numbers on the streets; when they asked them to come out, they did.  Now, as the austerity agenda continues, even though the unions were so critical of it, they refuse to call people out onto the streets in a significant way to resist it.  Why are the unions not doing this?
