RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Government consider having some discussion on what it has been talking about doing in regard to a vacant property tax, of which we are very much in favour? There has been some discussion on this in the Oireachtas committee, which I understand will publish a report today on the whole issue. It is a matter of extreme urgency that we address the issue of vacant and derelict properties, which could be used to help us to deal with the housing crisis. Does the Government have any plans for some sort of discussion about its own thoughts on the housing committee report and to give us an opportunity to debate this urgent issue?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is not here but he should know that 5,300 taxi vehicle licences will expire next year because of the vehicle age limit. That represents a huge proportion of our taxi fleet. Let us remember that taxi drivers were hammered for two years. They essentially had no income for two years, so they are asking for a further vehicle life extension to allow them to raise the money to buy other vehicles. In many cases, they will be raising money to buy electric vehicles. I am told the latter are not available. It is almost impossible to get electric vehicles that are suitable as taxis. Also, they are very expensive. You can get a grant of up to €20,000 but the vehicles cost up to €55,000 or more. Taxi drivers therefore need some assistance. Taxi drivers are also asking me about the statutory instrument that would require them to have a cashless payment facility. While 90% of them have such a facility, drivers need to be protected to ensure the onus is still on the customer to pay the fare.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On 14 March, Pierre Zakrzewski, an Irish-Ukrainian journalist, was murdered by Putin's murderous forces in his savage war on Ukraine. In the last week or so, we have seen Shireen Abu Akleh, the Palestinian journalist who spoke out fearlessly for 25 years to try to get across the truth of what is being done to the Palestinian people by the apartheid state of Israel, be murdered in a premeditated fashion. We have seen the utterly shameful scenes of Israeli forces attacking the pallbearers and mourners at her funeral in a premeditated way. Something that has not been mentioned is that they raided the deceased journalist's house a short time after word spread that she had been executed to seize Palestinian flags. It went beyond disrespect for the person they had just executed. Journalists are murdered by brutal regimes because they want to hide the truth of the crimes those regimes commit, including war crimes, crimes against humanity, oppression, persecution of their enemies and so on, and to silence the truth and criticism. Between 2011 and 2020, 900 journalists were killed worldwide, including 50 last year. It is shameful. We must condemn it as criminal and hold to account those who carry out these crimes against people who are doing us all a service by trying to bring us the truth about war, conflict and the abuse of people by brutal regimes. Why is the response different? It is so blatant. When war crimes are committed and journalists are murdered by Putin's regime, it elicits an instantaneous response from the European Union, the United States and our Government, demanding and imposing sanctions, cutting off trade links, arming those who resist Putin's invasion and doing everything else they can. They understandably and legitimately say that it is not acceptable and they must act. However, when a Palestinian journalist, who is the latest in a long line of Palestinian journalists killed, wounded, injured and beaten by the apartheid rogue state of Israel, we get condemnation but no action. Is the life of a Palestinian journalist worth less than the life of a journalist elsewhere? Are the Palestinian people any less deserving of accountability, justice, truth and a response from the international community, our Government and the European Union to a regime that commits crimes against humanity and war crimes against the Palestinian people? They are not, yet the difference is clear. The Government condemned Shireen Abu Akleh's execution and the barbaric scenes at her funeral, but there was no response. The Government will not call Israel an apartheid regime. There is no talk of sanctions. Even though the condemnation has been quite strong, it is not anything like the sort of condemnation and action that followed the actions of Putin's bloody regime. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that when the state that commits the war crimes, murder and execution is an ally of members of the European Union or the United States, we take a different attitude. The war crimes committed by our so-called allies or the allies of our allies, whether the United States or the European Union, are somehow less deserving of a response, including the sanctions and accountability that should follow for those crimes. It is plain that this is the case. One would not even feel the need to underline that so much, except what they did to Shireen is part of a systematic campaign of attacking journalists. Some 144 Palestinian journalists have been wounded by Israel since 1992. They were beaten, shot, tear-gassed and so on. Since 1992, 19 journalists have been killed in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, of whom 16 were Palestinians. During the Gaza assault by Israel last year, Israel targeted and destroyed a building containing Al Jazeera and the Associated Press. This is a systematic campaign by the state of Israel to kill, execute, beat and silence journalists who are trying to expose the truth of the apartheid regime, yet we refuse to impose sanctions. When will the Government impose sanctions on Israel for its murder of journalists, brutal war crimes and crimes against humanity and the Palestinian people?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputy Ó Broin for bringing forward this Bill, which we support. When in Dublin there are 2,700 Airbnb short-term lets being advertised but only slightly over 400 long-term lets, we know the Government's policy is failing yet again. Despite some efforts being made to limit or regulate this area, they just have not worked.Those who are pursuing profit from property are simply ignoring the rules, and we do not have a regime to do anything about it. These measures will at least attempt to address that problem. I refer to forcing estate agents or platforms that advertise short-term lets to at least try to establish whether they are within the planning regulations. I refer also to the establishment of the power to issue spot fines to those that do not do so or that offer short-term lets that are not within the law. I agree with that. We need to go further, however, because there is an emergency. This House agreed some time ago that we have a housing and homelessness emergency, but we just do not act accordingly. The Government most certainly does not although it pays lip service to it. An emergency means you do unprecedented things to address it. Not doing so is obscene and immoral in the teeth of this crisis. If we had a functioning housing sector and did not have 10,000 households in emergency accommodation, 20-year waiting lists for social housing and rents and house prices that the vast majority of working people cannot afford, we could operate in a different way. However, in the teeth of the incredible suffering that people are going through, we need emergency measures. Deputy Cian O’Callaghan is right that in the epicentre of the housing crisis, there simply should not be short-term lets available. They should not be allowed when we need people, including families and children, to be housed properly. Let me raise the case of a woman whose case I have raised many times. Hers is one of many cases but I am referring to it again because I received a text from her today. She told me how her youngster, who is 11 years old, is now seeing a psychological counsellor to assess the impact on his mental health and his trauma because the family is three and a half years in emergency accommodation. She has been thrown off the housing list because her income is too high. She is not even entitled to the housing assistance payment now and her child is being damaged. That there are others making money out of short-term lets when this family needs a place to live is just obscene. We need emergency measures. If we had a functioning housing sector in which the State had built a sufficient amount of public and affordable housing, we might operate in a different way; however, in the face of an emergency, you have to do unprecedented things. We need to start doing them. Short-term letting should not be allowed, full stop, in the areas where the housing crisis is focused, which is in the major urban centres, including Dublin, Cork, Waterford and Galway. Seeing as we are talking about advertising, let me highlight something else. The development up in Cherrywood really drives me insane because it is the biggest residential development in the State. It is basically a new town. The State put in the Luas. The site is off the N11 and millions of euro have been spent on infrastructure. For a brief period, the development was in public hands, in the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, but we flogged it off to developers and speculators. Finally, more than a decade later, housing is starting to appear there. There are apartments and so on. An outfit that was drawn to my attention this week – Hali, which has offices on Mount Street – is advertising studios for €1,500 and single-bedroom apartments for €1,800, going up from there. They are not exactly cheap. It gets worse, however. With regard to Cherrywood, two people came to me this week. Both are working and on reasonably decent incomes. One, a young woman, is earning €3,000 per month and does another job for which she earns another €500 or €600. The other, a man, is in the same boat. The two emailed Hali and said they wanted to rent one of its apartments. Hali said it was pre-approving them. Later, after months of emails, they were told they were progressing brilliantly, that it was all looking good and that they should just send in their bank documents, and this and that. At the end of the process, however, this crowd just turned around and said it was not giving them the apartments. There was no explanation whatsoever and the people affected are absolutely gutted because they are so desperate. They looked up one of the directors of the company and saw that, in a tweet or post, Hali referred to how it was very glad to be doing work with big corporations to house their talent in some of their apartments. It is a new twist to the housing tale that the apartments are being let en masse to big corporations that gazump ordinary individuals who have been engaging in good faith to try to rent them. They are gazumped because the company is interested only in money. That is the problem with our whole housing policy. Irrespective of whether short-term lets or this kind of behaviour is in question, these companies cannot be let dictate what happens in our housing sector and the availability of rental property. The State has to dictate.
