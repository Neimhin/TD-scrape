RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 12:In page 20, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following: “CHAPTER 4 
Wealth Taxes 

Reports 
16. Within three months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before Dáil Éireann, on the amount of revenue that would be raised if he were to tax the top 5 per cent of households 2 per cent of their accumulated wealth less 1 million for a family home.”.We raise the issue of wealth taxes every year. We are consistent in believing that we need to have wealth taxes in order to have a just taxation system and additional resources which are badly needed to fund our public services. Of course, the following point is an obvious one but nonetheless well worth reiterating. People ask where we will get the money for the national health service we need and the increased capacity we urgently need, now more than ever, after Covid, for our health service to give us those ICU beds and the public health teams we need; staff our health services; and fix all the school buildings in our education system, many of which are dilapidated, a matter that is now more than ever important given the issue of overcrowded classrooms and Covid transmission. One can go through the list of the money we need in retrofitting and public transport. One has to have the money. One has to get it from somewhere. However, we are consistent in not making calls for additional spending without proposing sources of revenue. We are the most prudential party in the Dáil. The Government is financing most of its additional expenditure through debt. While interest rates are low, that can change, and our debt profile would be pretty scary if it were to change. We are not against some borrowing, but we would not need to borrow as much if we got the wealthy in our society to pay their fair share of tax, which they do not. That would provide billions extra which we would not have to borrow to put into health, education, housing, public transport, climate measures and so on. One does not get much change in this country for raising these questions, from the media or political commentators, but the time will come when the wealth tax will be discussed in a serious way and we will keep battering away at it until such a moment. Other countries have wealth taxes and some of them have introduced those wealth taxes recently in the context of Covid-19, which is right and proper because many people suffered significant economic hardship and impacts as a result of Covid-19 whereas others did extremely well during the pandemic. Ireland is one of those countries. I doubt whether anyone is taking any notice in media circles and they just think these are the sort of things the left always talks about. However, it staggers me and I was staggered once again, when I looked at the latest Central Bank quarterly report with its figures on household wealth, published in November. When we wrote our alternative budget and the wealth tax we proposed, the net household wealth for the entire country, after debts, was €883 billion. At that time, that was a staggering increase of €89 billion on the figure for the previous year. However, when I looked just two months later, it had gone up to €935 billion. In just a few months, the extent of household wealth in this country has jumped enormously. I hope the Central Bank provides a figure on what that would mean per household. It was €177,000, per capita, per household. If that money was spread out, each household on average would have €177,000. In the latest figures, each house, on average, would have €186,000, if that money was spread out evenly. However, of course, the vast majority of people do not have anything even closely approximating that. I know the Minister will say that is mostly households assets, but it is not. More than €400 billion of that is financial assets. The financial assets have jumped by €13 billion since the last figures produced by the quarterly report. The facts speak for themselves. Rich people have become much richer, because ordinary people have not seen massive jumps of that proportion in their wealth. Many have seen their incomes fall. Many are impacted by energy price hikes, inflation and all that kind of stuff and have been limited to 1% or 2% pay increases, if a public sector worker. Where is all this additional money going? It is going to the 10% who have 53% of all that wealth. They are getting richer. Having money makes money and one becomes wealthier and wealthier, whether it is property or financial assets. We propose a modest measure to have a tax targeted at the richest 5%, which is 85,000 households that have approximately €3 million to €4 million each in average income, to allow them €1 million for a house. The house does not get taxed. After that, we propose putting a 2% annual tax on what is left. They would not even feel it. Their wealth is accumulating at a much faster rate than that, annually, according to these figures. However, in our budget estimate, doing so would raise €4.9 billion. It is probably more now, given the increase in figures and they would barely even feel it, but that is a considerable sum of money which could come in every year to help fund the social housing, public transport, health and education where we desperately need money.Once again, we put the proposal and challenge the Government as to why that would not be a fair and reasonable thing to do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said it would be scary if interest rates rose. That is a vulnerability. I accept interest rates are low at the moment and it is sustainable at this point but that could change. We learned to our cost after the crash in 2008 where that can lead. I will make an elementary point about the borrowing of money. You borrow off rich people, and you pay them interest. People who have surplus money lend it to people or states who do not have enough money and charge them interest. Therefore, the people who have surplus money are getting richer all the time. That is how the financial assets of the wealthy grow each year. It is simple. I pointed out in terms of wealth accumulation that financial assets, setting aside property assets, grew dramatically by €13 billion since the last figures produced by the Central Bank. Some €400 billion of that €936 billion is financial wealth, not households. A significant amount of that wealth is constituted by multiple properties owned by landlords, vulture funds, real estate investment trusts and so on. All of that is accumulating and generating more wealth for those people. I do not find the excuses plausible. The amendment would be reasonable and fair and there would be a lot of money raised by it. That is money we badly need in housing, health, education and public transport. Now more than ever with Covid-19, wealth tax is an idea whose time has come.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 14:In page 79, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:"33. Within three months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before the Dáil, on the functioning of section 481 relief for investment in films, particularly in relation to the degree to which it is meeting the requirement to meet "quality employment and training" and to examine whether film producer companies in receipt of the relief are hiding behind short lived designated activity companies (DAC) to avoid taking responsibility for workers employed on film productions supported by the relief.".This amendment relates to the film tax relief available under section 481 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997. I am proposing that we have a proper look at whether the relief is delivering on the conditions that are attached to it to provide quality employment and training, which is the legal requirement of those who receive it. I have raised this issue many times with the Minister and I acknowledge that he has changed some of the rules, including the introduction of a requirement that the film producer companies in receipt of the relief give an undertaking that they are complying with employment legislation and so on. However, as I have pointed out, those companies are not, in fact, respecting the rights of workers and are not fulfilling the conditions of section 481. They get the relief specifically and only if they provide quality employment and training, which means they must take responsibility for the people employed to work on the films they produce. However, when workers are treated badly, or feel they have been treated badly, when they have been dismissed or not re-employed by these film producers or where collective agreements are not honoured, and they take cases to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, the same people who take money from the Government on the basis that they will provide quality employment and training go into the WRC and say, "We could not possibly have an employment relationship with this person." That is really serious. To give an example, a case was taken to the Labour Court against Element Pictures by a stagehand who worked for the company, which has taken millions of euro in relief over many years, takes money from Screen Ireland and gives the Minister undertakings that it will provide quality employment and training. The CEO of the company told the court: "I wish to illustrate to the court how the specific working arrangements in the production sector prevent a relationship of employment from having existed between the parties." These people are going into the Labour Court and WRC and saying they could not possibly have an employment relationship with the person taking the case, who has worked on a film that is funded by section 481. If there is nothing else the Minister will do, I appeal to him or his officials to go to the WRC when some of these cases are being taken. The people in the film production companies are speaking out of both sides of their mouth. At the same hearing, a representative of Screen Producers Ireland - I am not sure why a representative body for producers was represented at the hearings - said:I will give further evidence to the court that there is no possible basis, having due regard to the realities of the sector, on which a relationship can be said to have existed between the parties hereto. This is on the basis of the clearly established industry norms and practices governing working arrangements in this sector, including in the operation of section 481.The representatives of the film producer companies, which are in receipt of €60 million, €70 million or €80 million of section 481 relief a year, are taking the money and saying they will provide employment and then going into the WRC and saying not only is the person not their employee but they could never be their employee because the industry prevents the companies from being an employer. They are saying they are not an employer, which cannot be the case. They get the money to provide employment and then say they do not create any employment and do not have any employees. How do they manage this trick and how does the Government let them get away with it? The same applies in respect of skills training. A case is being taken at the moment by an apprentice painter who has worked on successive films for Metropolitan Films but was dismissed because he got injured on set. He thought he was an apprentice painter but when he went to question how he could be dismissed, he discovered there was no accreditation. He has been working for several years as an apprentice but is not, in fact, an apprentice, because the company is registered with nobody and there is no qualification process. He is not only out of a job because the construction manager got rid of him but he does not have the three years of qualifications he thought he had and could take somewhere else. He may as well never have been a painter. This has been going on for years and I have been saying it for years. As I pointed out to the Minister, some of the witnesses who came into the Oireachtas committee in 2018 and raised these points have never worked again in the industry, even though they had a long history of working for the same companies that receive the section 481 relief. I appeal to him to look at this issue. Let us remember that only a few years ago, back in 2018, the film producer companies told the Oireachtas committee there were 17,000 jobs resulting from section 481.When the Minister examined it - and fair play to him for doing so - in the tax strategy papers, we discovered there were only 2,000 jobs. That is a big difference. It was scrutinised and there were 2,000 jobs. In none of those jobs does the worker accumulate any rights as an employee. Under the operation of law, the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 confers rights on the workers in this sector who work for the same employer, even if they work from project to project. They are working for the same producer company that is collecting the money, albeit behind different designated activity companies, DACs. That is, of course, how the companies get away with this three-card trick. They say “I'm not the employer, it is the DAC”, even though they set it up and a wholly owned subsidiary of the producer company collects the relief. This is a scam to get away with taking no responsibility for the people who work in this industry. I will finish on this point. We saw the problem with not having proper regulation of this industry with the Alec Baldwin issue, when somebody got shot and killed on a set in the United States. It was discovered that people were working excessive hours and so on. The apprentice I mentioned earlier in this contribution was being asked to work massively excessive hours.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are real consequences to not having proper employment relationships between the producers and employees in the film industry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I acknowledge that the Minister engaged, listened and took action. That action has brought some improvements and it has put a bit more pressure on. However, to be honest, what the Minister is being told by Screen Producers Ireland is not the truth. He needs to look beyond it. I have quoted what its CEO said in a witness statement this year in the Labour Court. She does not just say “this person was not an employee” or a recipient of section 481. She goes on to say that nobody could be. I want the Minister to absorb the significance of her statement that nobody could be. They are taking money from the taxpayer on the basis that they are going to provide quality employment and training, and then they say they could not possibly be the employer. As a result, they try to prevent the case from ever being heard. The Minister has to issue an instruction that this is not an acceptable position for recipients of this relief to take. They hide behind the DAC and even though it is the producer companies that gets the money, they deny that they have an employment relationship with individuals who worked on those productions. Then all the undertakings mean nothing. The producers are saying that if they had any employees, they would absolutely vindicate their rights under the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 or the working time directive but they do not have any employees so it does not matter if none of those rights is vindicated because it is nothing to do with them. That is what is happening and certain people do not want the boat rocked. These same companies are getting money year after year so of course they are telling the Minister it is okay. He needs to look beyond that objectively at what protections workers have to ensure their rights are actually being vindicated.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In order to have that relationship between employer and employee somebody has to be the employer, but the people who are getting the money are saying they are not employers. This is the point. It is so elementary and it has to be addressed. Screen Producers Ireland is like the film branch of IBEC. It has no entitlement to making an agreement for an industry, particularly when its members say they have no employees. How can it have an industry agreement when its members say that? It is not just about this individual case. Screen Producers Ireland's representative made it clear that the argument it was making on this case applied across the board, regardless of who it was, because its members do not have employees. Therefore, an employment relationship is not possible. The Minister mentioned skills and training. Imagine a painter who had been working since 2015, thinking he was an apprentice who had accumulated his years in an apprenticeship. The Minister knows how apprenticeships work. This person works away thinking he will be qualified as a painter in four years. This person had been working since 2015 and his worksheets show he was working 70 or 80 hours a week, which is against the law. He then lost his job because he got injured on the job and the producer did not want to take responsibility for that. He then found out he was not an apprentice painter at all, so all that time is gone. Providing skills and training is lip service. People are going to courses but they do not get any accreditation and there are no apprenticeships. This cannot be allowed and it is not allowed in other jurisdictions. It is not allowed in the EU. If cases were taken to the EU courts, and maybe that is where this is going to have to go, they would call out this stuff.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 15:In page 81, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:“(c) whether the employment generated in the development of the digital game ensures quality employment and training for those employed in its development and in particular to ensure that the digital games development company is not engaged in bogus self employment or employment practices which limit the ability of employees to avail of employment rights legislation,”.The Minister is proposing to introduce as part of the Finance Bill a relief for the digital gaming sector similar to the section 481 film relief. It will be an additional subsection of section 481. I welcome the idea that we would encourage employment and investment in this sector. There is no doubt it has job potential. While that is very much to be welcomed, as a general point I question whether tax reliefs are the best way rather than direct expenditure to give support and strategically develop employment in a particular industry. In discussions we had at the Committee on Budgetary Scrutiny over the years, a lot of expert economic advice suggested that direct expenditure is often more beneficial in terms of creating industries and employment than tax reliefs. There is always a necessity for some sort of cost-benefit analysis or examination of the best way to support an industry. Any support must be regularly reviewed to ensure we get quality employment. Given the discussions we had on the earlier amendment on film relief for the audiovisual sector, we have concerns, and we do not want to do anything to facilitate poor quality employment or bogus self-employment. In my view, that is an issue in the film industry. There is a general lack of security in these kinds of industries for employees. We are seeking a review to ensure this is the best way of supporting employment in a sector that we consider to be strategically important. As an aside, given the previous discussion, because the two are part of the same Finance Bill, it is telling that those who have given the Minister a particular viewpoint on section 481 – I accept I have given another viewpoint – did not want to go into a room with people who disagreed with them when the Minister asked them to agree in principle to set up a stakeholder forum where all views could be heard. The groups to which the Minister referred vetoed that, and they got away with it because they did not want to go into a room with people who had different viewpoints. In order to have a proper assessment of an issue, we need to get everybody in the room.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed, but let us be honest, we are dependent on the information from the ground. It is difficult to establish the real facts on the ground. It is a hard thing for the officials to do as well. We are all dealing with multiple issues. We are talking to particular people, but we get a better sense when we get everybody in a room, and we hear the different perspectives, especially when we can get in some independent people who have no stake in the game to assess the information. The Minister should consider that also in terms of the previous discussion. It is very telling when somebody does not want to go into a room and openly stand over his or her position. It speaks volumes. While we welcome the support the Minister is trying to give to an emerging sector and the potential employment that could generate, given that it is a huge growth sector in the world generally, it must be looked at regularly to ensure we are getting the best quality employment and that this is the best way to support that employment and the growth of that sector.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be clear, insofar as this is modelled on section 481, does the same designated activity company, DAC, approach apply where it is done on a project-by-project basis? What was the Minister's favourite cartoon when he was younger? Was it "Tom and Jerry"? Let us say I am employed by Tom and Jerry DAC and then I am employed by Speedy Gonzales DAC.I am then employed by Wile E Coyote, DAC, but they are all Warner Brothers. Who was I employed by then? Was I employed by Warner Brothers or by Speedy Gonzales? He was there and he is gone, which is like the DACs. By the time I can take Speedy Gonzales to the WRC-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----it will take me two years to get into the WRC and Speedy Gonzales is gone over the horizon but Warner Brothers will still be around. I am asking this as a serious question because there is a distinction between how the live-action film industry and the animation industry operate. The animation industry does not go cartoon by cartoon. People are employed by an actual company and they have a job, but in the film industry, they are not. Which is it going to be in the digital gaming sector? Will it be digital game by digital game or will it be a company that actually has employees and a premises that can be seen and it can be verifiably assessed whether there is a growth in employment and that the employment is quality employment and that there is an actual employer and employee?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, I am.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Farrell has made most of the points and it is her and Deputy Doherty's amendment. My wider view on banks is that, after we bailed them out, we should have kept them in public ownership, taken them over and developed a not-for-profit banking system. These private banks we bailed out are carrying losses forward and dramatically reducing their tax liabilities year on year. Then their customers pay the highest interest rates anywhere in Europe and they are ruthless when it comes to dealing with their customers. For example, they unload their portfolios of loans to vulture funds. How they get tax breaks is obnoxious to me, but that is an aside. The Committee on Budgetary Oversight has agreed, whatever about our views on particular tax reliefs and allowances, that they should be seriously scrutinised regularly to assess whether those reliefs, allowances and tax credits are justifiable. While the Minister will clearly not undertake to compile this report, or many of the reports we are looking for, there is agreement in the committee that we need to look at these things because they go under the radar and have gone under the radar for long periods of time. Whereas we rightly have a lot of scrutiny of direct expenditure measures during the budget, we have far less scrutiny of tax reliefs, allowances, deductions and so on and whether they are justified. The issues at stake in these myriad reliefs are as big as the direct expenditure issues. A wide body of opinion is expressing the same view, namely that we need to study these things in a serious way and on an ongoing basis to assess if these measures are delivering on the objectives for which such reliefs, allowances and deductions were originally established. In this case, are they delivering a good banking sector for us? That is a good question, is it not? A lot of people might seriously ask that question. I was asking about films earlier on but there are many reliefs and we need seriously to scrutinise them. I ask the Minister to consider that and he knows the committee is asking for that. Some of this work has been done in tax strategy papers, but on an ongoing and systematic basis we need to study, scrutinise and assess these tax reliefs, which effectively are a shadow budget that does not get the same level of scrutiny as the conventional budget we hear about on budget day.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 17:In page 94, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:
“Reports
37. Before the publication of the Finance Bill 2022, the Minister shall lay a report before the Dáil, on the impact of the change of the corporate tax rate to 15 per cent, and what measures are needed to ensure that this rate is a minimum effective rate which cannot be circumvented through the exploitation of reliefs allowances.”.The amendment calls on the Minister to produce a report on the degree to which the 15% corporate tax rate, established as a result of the OECD base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, process, to which the Government very reluctantly signed up, will be an effective rate of 15% rather than a nominal one. The Minister will be very familiar with the reasoning behind this kind of amendment. We do not believe the 12.5% rate, which was already one of the lowest in the western world, was ever paid nor anything even close to that because the corporations exploit the array of allowances, reliefs and deductions which allow them to write down their taxable profits to negligible levels. The latest figure the Minister gave at the committee discussions on this was that the effective rate was just under 11%. That calculation can only hold water on the basis of the profits deemed taxable. The problem is that through the use of allowances, deductions and reliefs, these corporations manage to have far bigger profits deemed not taxable. I always find the figures pretty remarkable. I am surprised there is not more scrutiny of them. There is quite a bit of scrutiny at international level by the OECD. That was what prompted the global push for an effective rate because these incredibly profitable corporations were not paying the nominal rates they were supposed to. That is why there has been a push for an effective rate of 15% or more. We think it should be more. The average worker is paying about 20% of their income in tax and we think corporations should at least pay that level of tax on their profits. However, they do not because of the allowances and reliefs. The figures are fairly dramatic. The Minister will be familiar with them but it is always important to put them on the record. Last year, 2020, the pre-tax profits of corporations in this country were an absolutely staggering €203.815 billion. That was up from 2012 when those profits were €74.775 billion. It is an incredible jump of a 172% increase in profits for corporations between 2012 and 2020. Think about the average worker and how much their pay has gone up over that same period. Is it 1% or 2% in real terms? Arguably, workers' pay has gone down when you take energy price hikes, the cost of living and of accommodation and so on, but the profits of the corporations have gone through the roof. These figures are rarely remarked upon. There is an occasional headline in the business sections of newspapers or the RTÉ website which allude to the staggering profits but there is no real scrutiny of it and less of the actual tax they paid. Of the €203 billion in profits in 2020, which were up 172% since 2012, how much of that was taxed? We do not know for 2020 because the figures lag but we know that in 2019, when there was €195 billion in profits, only €106 billion, about 50% was taxed. The companies wrote down their pre-tax gross profits by €100 billion using a series of reliefs, deductions and allowances that are detailed by Revenue. I look at them every year. I find them fascinating. Some of the main headings under which they manage to write down their taxable profits include capital allowances, which are defined by Revenue as costs to the Exchequer, that is, the taxpayer. In 2018 the capital allowances were €9.4 billion. Intra-group transactions were €12 billion. That is a cost to the Exchequer. Reconstructions and amalgamations were €273 million. That is a cost to the Exchequer. Losses brought forward were €1.8 billion. Group relief was €536 million. There are slightly lesser ones such as the research and development tax credit which was €335 million. These are some of the big headings under which those gross profits are written down.The capital allowances and intra-group transactions are in effect the corporations writing their own tax bills by ascribing values to their own intellectual property where they charge themselves for the use of it. One subsidiary of a company charges another subsidiary of the same company whatever cost it likes on the use of an intellectual property - on what is a patent, effectively. They can ascribe almost any cost to that they want. That allows them to write down their taxable profits. Thus the real effective rate is not the 11% the Minister will, I have no doubt, claim it to be in the next few minutes but 5.4% on average. It is very considerably less for the big IT and pharmaceutical companies that are responsible for the vast majority of these profits. We think that matter should be examined and we need to ensure they actually pay 15% on their gross profits.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Under socialism, we would want foreign direct investment. I welcome the jobs. I understand how important they are in many areas, including my own constituency, where a number of these multinationals are located. That does not mean they should not pay their fair share of tax. I will give an example from The Irish Times this year, "Google used 'double-Irish' [which was supposed to be gone in 2015, but lasted until 2020] to shift $75.4bn in profits out of Ireland". In 2019, it shifted them to a holding company, Google Ireland Holdings Unlimited Company, which is based in Bermuda, where there is a zero tax rate. It has no employees at all. That money was shifted out of here. Due to some of us questioning those things, those companies have started to onshore the intellectual property rights to Ireland. That has given us a significant tax boon, although we still let them off on some of the taxes they should pay. This has happened because some of us started to question the sacred cow of these multinationals. When I was on the finance committee in 2013, Deputy Doherty and I proposed a motion asking for Google, Apple and Facebook to come in to the committee. The committee voted against them coming in and, in fact, turned off the cameras when we were discussing whether they should come in. That is how scared we were of these companies and I do not think we should be. As Deputy Ring rightly pointed out, they are making a lot of profit out of an educated Irish workforce that speaks English within the EU and they will stay here because they are making so much money. It is reasonable, therefore, to ask them to pay their fair share in tax and that is all we ask. The world is asking them to do that and we should be part of the campaign to make them pay their fair share rather than resisting that just call.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said we questioned the issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There was international questioning. We were part of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would not claim credit for major international changes in corporate tax. However, until we arrived in the Dáil, nobody was willing to question these things. I speak no word of a lie when I say I was on the finance committee and we asked for Google, Facebook and Apple to come in to the committee to explain their tax affairs and effective tax rate. Not only did the committee vote against it, members insisted the cameras were turned off while we discussed whether they would be invited in. That happened. Deputies can check the record. We were so fearful of questioning how much tax they paid. Popular anger across the world, among NGOs and so on, involving countries and people, including people in this country, forced some change on this and the world has not fallen apart because the effective rate has been pushed up to 15%. I would like to see it go a bit further. I will finish on hard-working people. Last year's figures show that 2 million workers in this country in total earned €130 billion between them. They paid €27 billion in tax between them. Corporations earned €203 billion and paid €11 billion in tax. Workers earn far less but pay far more; corporations earn far more and pay far less. Is that fair or just? If they do not pay a just amount of tax, where will we get the money for the universities, infrastructure, water and housing that, in the end, they depend on too? They will not come here if we do not have those services.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 40 relates to the tax treatment of institutional investors and corporate landlords and their impact on the housing sector, affordability and rents. I did not hear all of Deputy Lahart's contribution but the thrust of it seemed to suggest that there was a time when we needed these investors and that they brought some beneficial impact to the housing sector but that maybe we need to tighten up a bit. I disagree with that narrative. I think it was a terrible mistake to invite them in, for which we are paying a terrible price. That was done in 2012 or 2013, when there were a lot of meetings - 65, I think - between the Department of Finance and these investor funds, where they no doubt became acquainted with the tax breaks that were available if they invested in the Irish property sector. They moved in at scale and bought up NAMA's portfolio, which was the biggest property portfolio in the world at the time and was in public hands. NAMA had cash sales of approximately €40 billion but the actual value of that portfolio is nearly double that now. The State had in its hands the biggest property portfolio in the world. Even in the depths of a severe financial crisis, we could have solved the housing crisis, which predated the crash in 2012. It has always been present in my area and it has always been a disaster. It is heartbreaking having to deal with it day in, day out. We could have solved it with sites such as Cherrywood, which is being built out now by one of those investor funds, although it flipped quite a bit of it. Johnny Ronan has gotten his hands back on it, courtesy of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council selling off some of the site. It is unbelievable stuff. I met with Hines staff who said they could not deliver the apartments there for anything less than €400,000. Someone would need in excess of €100,000, maybe €120,000, to buy one of those apartments. Average house prices in my area are now €560,000. It is just mind-boggling. A person would need an income of €150,000 or €160,000 to get a mortgage from a bank for a house of that price. These investors have contributed to all of this. The rents in my area are now in excess of €2,200 a month. Someone would need net after tax income of €26,000 just to pay the average rental price. I do not know how anybody could describe this situation as anything other than a disaster. It is resulting in the social cleansing of places like Dún Laoghaire, because working people are clearly never going to be able to afford those prices so they are just being driven out. Hines sat on that huge portfolio for quite a long time, which I am sure was about waiting to get the prices up and flipping some of it on. Even though €15 million of funding from the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, went into Cherrywood, we still do not know how much affordable housing we are going to get for that. When the LIHAF was originally brought in, we were told that at least 40% of any development it funded would be affordable housing. Within a few weeks, that commitment disappeared from the conditionality around LIHAF and now we are getting next to nothing. We still do not know. Years on, we have no idea how much affordable housing we are going to get and what price that housing will be. Similarly, Shanganagh Castle, which was a public site, has now been taken over by the LDA. We have been campaigning for nearly 15 years to get public and affordable housing built directly on that site. There is still not a sod turned and we still do not know how much the affordable housing is going to cost. It will be at a discount to the market but the market is at €560,000. Even a 25% discount would be worse than useless in addressing the housing crisis in our area. All these investment funds build very little. There is some building going on now but only where they have deals to lease the housing back to the local authority at extortionate prices. Even then, after 25 years of those lease arrangements, those entities could pull out and the tenants could then be left high and dry. We know the likelihood of that happening on an individual level because we have seen it with HAP. People are socially housed under the HAP scheme with landlords who are getting extortionate money from the taxpayer, and week in, week out, landlords pull out of these arrangements. They decide it is more beneficial not to be in such arrangements, or they decide to sell their asset that has accumulated in value, or they just opt out of a HAP deal because they think they can get higher rent elsewhere. They do it for whatever reason. I have brought up the St. Helen's Court residents around 50 times at this point. That complex was bought out by Apollo Global Management, a big American-based investment fund, which tried to increase the rent by 60%. It then tried to mass evict the residents but could not get away with that, so it flipped it on to another vulture fund, which tried again to mass evict them. It has slowly whittled down the tenants, who just could not bear the stress and anxiety of it all, and has now succeeded in legally mass evicting them. The tenants still have nowhere to go so they are still physically there but every day they wonder when they are going to be evicted. They have now gotten letters from that vulture fund saying it is taking them to court. It is going to sue them for costs unless they get out but they have nowhere to go because they cannot afford rents of €2,200. They were paying €1,000, which is hefty enough rent and they are willing to pay a bit more but they cannot afford the rents in our area. Where are they going to go? That is what these entities have done to the housing sector. In addition, they pay very little tax on the enormous increased value of their assets, which we gave them for the most part, or on the huge rental revenues they generate for themselves.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where would we get the money if we did not have these investors to build the houses we need? Credit unions have said repeatedly they have the money, which are savings as well, but in a not-for-profit institution, where they have the interests of our communities and the social objective of housing people at heart. That is one source of money. I refer to what we discussed earlier about household wealth in this country. Of the €936 billion net household wealth, more than €400 billion of it is financial assets, the savings of people here. Where is that money? It is in the banks, the banks we bailed out. There are lots of savings here. One of the things credit unions informed me, which I did not even know, is that they want to make decisions about what they put their money into, but they often have to put it into commercial banks, who may invest it in all sorts of things they have no interest in. They would like to be able to invest it in building social housing for the people in their communities at affordable levels. There is money to build houses. If we bring these people in, their concern is how much money they can make, and they will only build if they can make a lot of money for themselves. That means charging high rents and high prices for property and trying to minimise the tax they pay, which the Government facilitates. It has not worked and there are alternatives. I reject the Minister's suggestion there are not alternatives.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is an implication that we could not do it without them. When this country was effectively a Third World country, we were able to build public housing. It can and should be done.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mandatory quarantining cannot stop Omicron, yet that is the only reason mandatory quarantining is being considered. What is the point? What is the endgame of putting a large amount of resources and money into putting a draconian measure into place? Although we did not agree with the Minister's version of mandatory quarantining, we called for mandatory quarantining when the population was not vaccinated and it was believed that vaccination could produce the possibility of the disease's elimination. We believed it was preferable to try to eliminate the disease in Ireland until a vaccine arrived. There was an objective - keep the disease out until we got the vaccine and it was possible to reopen. We now know that, even with more than 90% of the population vaccinated, we cannot eliminate the disease and we cannot stop the variants, so there is no point in this measure. It is telling that the WHO has from the word "Go" on Omicron said that there should be no knee-jerk travel restrictions and that there should be tests. We have started to test. That is the sort of thing we need to do - identify the cases, isolate them, trace, have the hospital capacity to deal with the cases and start taking the sort of measures that can limit the transmission in buildings, as we discussed on the ventilation Bill, and so on. This measure is pointless, so I do not understand why the Minister would pursue it at this stage. We will oppose the measure because it is pointless. If the Minister can set out a reason or objective, then I will be all ears, but I do not see any purpose to this. On that basis, we oppose the measure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not all.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Equality of treatment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It really directly follows on from that and goes back to the point I made earlier in asking what the point is here. My understanding is that the Minister does not envisage introducing mandatory hotel quarantine for UK arrivals, or at least, that is the signal we got. What we were talking about is states like South Africa, where there have been restrictions placed on travel. I think they are pointless, as does the WHO. The restrictions are punishing the people who helped us to identify Omicron, which may not even have originated in South Africa. It quite possibly did not originate there. In any event, it is in the UK. Every single day, people are travelling north, south, east, west, and so on. It all seems rather pointless. I am beginning to wonder whether we are debating a piece of legislation, which I know everybody is saying we do not want to have to put into place, when the Government does not even envisage any remote possibility that it is going to be deployed. I support Deputy Duncan Smith's amendment, because the thought that somebody coming back from having a termination would be put in mandatory hotel quarantine against the background of something that seems rather pointless, in any event, seems absolutely unbearable. It begs the question of what the whole point of this is and what the Government sees happening. The Minister was scoring a few political points - and fair enough - about our position before, but our position was linked to a strategy. There was a purpose. The purpose was to keep the virus out until we got vaccinated, because we were close enough to elimination. If we eliminated it pending a vaccine, we could open up. The Minister disagreed with that strategy, but it was a legitimate strategy. It was a strategy that was followed by New Zealand.  I am trying to find out what the strategy is here. If the strategy was to keep out Omicron or even slow it down, then the restrictions would be applied now. They would apply, for example, to England and the Netherlands - not just to South Africa and the rest of them. If the Government wanted to slow down the virus, they would apply the restrictions now. If we do it in two or three weeks, when Professor Tony Holohan or somebody decides that Omicron is actually a real problem, it will be absolutely too late. I do not see the logic of what the Government is doing. I am not out to score political points; I am just trying to understand the point. I do not really see the point, unless the Minister is actually telling us that he is thinking, in the relatively short term, that it is a serious possibility that mandatory hotel quarantine could be required for people coming from the UK, the Netherlands or wherever. In the case of abortion services, obviously, we are primarily talking about the UK.
