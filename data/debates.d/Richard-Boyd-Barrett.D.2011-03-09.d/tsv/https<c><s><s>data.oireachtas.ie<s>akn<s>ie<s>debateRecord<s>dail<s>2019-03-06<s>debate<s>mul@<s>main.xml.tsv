RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not surprise me that the legislation has moved through the House as quickly as it has. The main purpose of the Bill is not controversial; it is to maintain as fully as possible the status quo in the common travel area to avoid disruption. No sane or sensible person in this Chamber would want to cause unnecessary disturbance or massively disrupt the status quo, particularly in the areas covered by the Bill such as electricity supply, health, transport and education services, education programmes for students and so on. Who would want to see such disruption? That is why I find Deputy Lisa Chambers' little barb utterly bizarre. As much as anybody else in this House, we want to avoid disruption and unnecessary arguments. We put forward a few amendments where we thought the legislation could be strengthened, but most of them were ruled out of order. We made a point about our disappointment about this, but we have not slowed the passage of the Bill. It was unnecessary politicking for no good reason. It was disappointing but perhaps not terribly surprising. I was surprised, as was Deputy Cullinane, about the ruling out of order of some of our amendments. I conveyed our disappointment to the Office of the Ceann Comhairle. The objective of the Bill is to avoid disruption in the event that there is a no-deal Brexit. Our amendments sought to include a firm statement and an assurance that if things were to unravel and there was a no-deal Brexit, something we hope will not happen, we would set down a clear statement that there would be no hard border and that we would not entertain one. In a no-deal scenario we will not entertain pressure from anybody, whether in Britain or the European Union, to erect a border. I still think that amendment should be included. While these are all important issues to be dealt with to maintain the status quo, everybody knows that the discussion in the next few weeks will all turn on what will happen if there is no deal and whether there will be a hard border. I am not saying the other matters do not affect people; they are important.  I commend the civil servants and staff of Ministers. Even if the Bill is not politically controversial, it is technically difficult. There was a lot of work put into it and I commend those who did that technical but important work. However, the big issue confronting us is what will happen if there is no deal. We all hope there will be one. In the House and private conversation the Minister has said there will have to be hard conversations. There certainly will. Perhaps he sees it as a necessary tactical negotiating position not to get into that matter too much at this point. However, there are certain things that he needs to say. Pressure will be exerted if that is what transpires eventually. We have to say we are not submitting to that pressure. In the end it is other people's problem if that happens. Whatever issues they may think are important - the Single Market or anything else - they are not as important as peace on this island. It needs to be stated clearly that under no circumstances will we risk that danger.  On the crazy politics that is driving the Tory right and the Brexiteers, the little Englander nationalism, we are very much focused on its English manifestation because it is impacting directly on us. However, we should not imagine that it is a uniquely English phenomenon.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is very dangerous growth of that type of politics all across Europe, including within the European Union, and we cannot lay the blame for it on Britain. It is a failing of politics generally in the western world. We have also seen it in the United States. While we have to deal with a very immediate problem and the consequences of Brexit, we should not imagine, whether it resolves itself for the better or worse, that the threat posed by dangerous xenophobic right-wing nationalist politics is going to go away. It is not. It is a serious threat and we need to think about from where it is coming. We must ask what has failed in politics that has led to that type of politics in the first place. I welcome the decision I believe Fine Gael has made to call for Mr. Orb√°n to be expelled from the European People's Party. We have been advocating this for quite some time. Beyond that, this type of politics is very dangerous and we need to think about from where it is coming. It is not good enough just to condemn it; we also have to ask to what problems is it giving rise. I do not understand why a couple of things are not being done in the Bill. I do not see why we would not deal with the issue of UK driving licences being accepted here. That was the subject of one of our amendments which were ruled out of order. I think most Members of this House would say they were in favour of a united Ireland, although they would differ on how we would achieve it and when. We are in favour of a Border poll. It is possible to make a purely democratic argument for it, given the possibility that there could be a hard border and how it could change minds. However, it is our view that we will never achieve a united Ireland through a sectarian head count. That is the kind of politics that leads people into entrenchment. Where we can win is by putting forward our common interests, the things that unite people and undercut sectarian division. That is why, in the aftermath of the overwhelming popular power in favour of repeal which was a youth and women-led movement and which, like the movement in favour of marriage equality, has spilt massively into the North, we have proposed that there be a new basis to unite people across the sectarian divisions in the North and the South and elsewhere. Lots of young people from the North came here to canvass for repeal. After the referendum, lots of people from the South were in the North to march for a woman's right to choose. That is why we said it would have been a good idea for the Government to make provision in the Bill or state elsewhere that abortion services provided free in the South would also be provided free for everybody in the North. That would have been a massive gesture in showing real solidarity that could begin to lay the ground for unity. That is part of the bigger political debate on the future of politics on the island. I welcome the passage of the Bill, but the big questions remain unresolved. It is critical that we say to Britain, the European Union, the World Trade Organisation and anybody else that a hard border will not be tolerated because peace on this island is far too important.
