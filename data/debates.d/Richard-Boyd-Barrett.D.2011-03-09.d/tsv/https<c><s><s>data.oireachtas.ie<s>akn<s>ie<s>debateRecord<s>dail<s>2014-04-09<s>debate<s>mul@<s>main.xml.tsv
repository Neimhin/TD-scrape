RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have been contacted by a constituent who has a son, Michael, who has Down's syndrome. He is in fourth year, but he has been informed by the school that owing to the decision in the Sinnott case which limits the right of children with special needs to an education up to the age of 18 years, he will have nowhere to go when he reaches that age. His mother is distressed by this and also points out that he is one of many in this position. She believes it is unfair discrimination against children with special needs who should have the right to complete their education.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister clarify that if the school makes an application for Michael to remain in the school to complete his leaving certificate examinations, the Department will approve it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is good news. It is a mystery why the school is so adamant that that is not the case. I presumed from my discussion with the mother that there was a resourcing issue. I will pass on the Minister's reply.The mother made a general point on moving children with special needs - her child has Down's syndrome - straight from school settings, in which they would be with other young people, into adult services. She stated children with special needs were often placed in such services alongside adults who were much older than them. This is really not suitable. She also informed me that Carmona Services in Dún Laoghaire had received 200 applications for two places and that - as she discovered, much to her amazement - Roslyn Park College did not take children with Down's syndrome. Again, this appears to give rise to a problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That would be appreciated. The mother has indicated - she was not clear on the details and neither am I - that there is a UN convention with deals with the rights of people with disabilities. While the Government has signed up to it, it has not ratified it. Is the Minister in a position to enlighten us on the matter?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This Bill deals with two important issues and I am very concerned about both. There are changes to the Central Bank Act with regard to building societies, particularly allowing building societies to transfer assets, infrastructure and so on to banks, which is precluded in the 1971 Act. It was reported to us on the finance committee that this is being done because the European Commission is requiring this of Bank of Ireland because of state aid rules. If I am correct, this would allow the ICS platform, which may be attached to a mortgage book, up for sale. That is very worrying, given what we have seen happen in the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, mortgage book. That book, containing debt from the former Anglo Irish Bank, is being put up for sale and vulture funds are seeking to get hold of and profit from it. As a result, there is great concern among mortgage holders about changes in circumstances and the fact that somebody else will hold the mortgage. These funds are not regulated so they do not necessarily have to comply with any codes of conduct or regulations that mortgage holders would want. We debated this at the finance committee and departmental officials suggested that the logic was conditional, as it was as possible that the book would be sold to regulated financial entities as it would not. Given what is happening now, it is highly likely that regulated entities will not buy the book, and we seem to be witnessing vulture funds from the US and elsewhere making the purchase. They were probably prompted and encouraged by the words of the Taoiseach when he was in New York on St. Patrick's Day, telling American investors that Dublin was the place to go in order to make a killing on the property market. Those were highly irresponsible comments from a Taoiseach in encouraging speculation in Irish property, mortgages and so on. These vulture funds and financial institutions seem to be moving in here at a rapid rate, and the Government seems very keen to facilitate them. This case involves state aid rules from the European Commission, which are obnoxious anyway. The Commission is very selective in its application of state aid rules, which are largely a pressure on states to privatise certain institutions, and in this case it involves the selling of assets to what are potentially unregulated bodies. I asked the very simple question at the committee of whether the ICS customers even know this is happening, and that their mortgages could be transferred to another financial institution or unregulated vulture fund. Has anybody bothered to contact them to indicate legislation is going through the Oireachtas facilitating this process? It is something with potentially profound implications.There will be no conditions put into the legislation to protect those people. The Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform discussed this but, as I understand it, no changes have been made. That is typical of the very shoddy way the Government treats the innocent victims of a financial crisis created by the activities of bodies such as the European Union, the banks and property speculators who speculated on mortgages and so on. The same people are once again a party to moving things in their own interests, regardless of the potential consequences for innocent customers of ICS. That is pretty rotten. I strongly suspect many of these people do not even know this is happening and will not know till after the event, when it is too late. For that reason I oppose this Bill. It should not go any further. The distinction between building societies and banks no longer exists because there are no longer building societies in the proper sense. A distinction was drawn between the two in the Central Bank Act 1971 because there was an awareness that building societies operated on different principles from commercially oriented profit-driven banks and should therefore be treated differently. That has changed; building societies no longer have that ethos and are in effect banks. It is worth remarking on that fact because there was somehow an understanding that one might be better off with a building society or that some people might prefer to be with a credit union because of banks’ profit-driven agenda. People wanted to be treated differently, more humanely. That distinction between building societies and banks is gone, and while I do not know enough about ICS to say, it may have had a different style or relationship with its customers which could dramatically change after the handover to Bank of Ireland, but even more so after the handover to some other entity to which these things could be sold. This will suddenly be inflicted on the people concerned. It is rotten, and may produce another crisis for those people similar to the one that occurred with regard to the Irish Nationwide mortgage book. I will oppose the Bill for that reason. In respect of the Greek bailout, as I understand it, we will forgo the profits we might otherwise make on Greek bonds and give Greece cheaper loans to get it out of its difficulties. Why the hell did we not ask for the same facility? I would not want to deny that facility to the Greek people. When we ask why we did not ask for the same facility, the answer is that a lot of conditions were imposed on Greece, the implication being that those conditions were so harsh and so awful that we were better off not asking for it. I do not accept that, because conditions were imposed on us for the deal we did with the troika which were absolutely brutal and have savaged people in this country and done extreme damage to our economy and society. I do not understand why the Government did not ask, apart from the fact that its whole policy has been to be the best little boys in Europe and do exactly what the troika says in the hope of reward, but that reward is not forthcoming for the majority of citizens in this country. I am concerned about it because it is tied up with a so-called bailout which imposed brutal conditions of austerity on people. We should not sign up to it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is good news that the Government is not opposing this Bill, and I commend Sinn Féin on its introduction. For the most part it is a tribute to the people in the midlands - in Laois, Offaly, Westmeath and elsewhere - who have campaigned and forced this issue onto the agenda. Neither they nor I are opposed to the development of renewable energy resources, but major questions arise in the development of those resources about the impact on local communities, about proper public consultation with those communities, about health and safety issues and about the efficiency and viability of this industrialised, corporatist approach to developing renewable energy resources. The bottom line is that the Government has not done its homework in these areas in order to establish the case for these things, to set out a regime which ensures proper environmental protection, proper consideration of local communities and indeed, the business case for the real environmental efficiency of these huge turbines. I learned the simple fact today that a wind turbine requires 200 tonnes of concrete to construct it and every tonne of concrete results in one tonne of carbon dioxide. Given the relatively short life span of wind turbines, even there one can see there will be serious problems, not to mention construction and transport costs and the infrequency of wind. These are major issues that need to be considered. This is true not just in the midlands but also for the Dublin Array project - that is, the plan to put one of the biggest wind farms in the world a very short distance off the coast in Dublin Bay in a way that could be seriously detrimental to that bay as an amenity. It could well be a case of cutting off one's nose to spite one's face, because the damage to a tourism amenity and a piece of heritage could far outweigh any supposed or spurious economic advantage. I am ringing alarm bells about the corporatist and industrialised approach to developing renewable energy resources. That is not the way to go. One of the players in this is Element Power, previously owned by the person who owned SWS Energy, who got the interconnector rights for wind energy into the national grid from, as I understand it, Noel Dempsey. He got them for a song - a few million euro - but recently sold them to Bord Gáis for half a billion euro. The company happens to be owned by someone who was a former Fine Gael candidate or somebody very close to Fine Gael. This is the sort of information that needs to be examined. Was a tender in place for those interconnector rights? Was there an open competition? Is this another case similar to that of Eircom, in which people are plundering natural resources for their own profit and not for the benefit of our economy, our society or our environment?
