RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The programme for Government has a chapter of extensive commitments from the Government to people with disabilities, particularly to provide them with access to the maximum supports necessary for them to participate fully in society. Against that background, members of the visually impaired and blind community in the south-east Dublin region, basically from east Wicklow up through Dún Laoghaire to Ringsend, were shocked and distraught to discover that the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI, which is mainly funded by the HSE, intends to close down its office in Dún Laoghaire. I was protesting with them on Friday and some of them believe they will be lost, isolated and left with nothing in terms of the brilliant supports that are provided by the NCBI if this office closes. They have been told that the only option is to travel to Tallaght or Drumcondra, which will be impossible for many of these service users. Will the Taoiseach contact the HSE about this? If this NCBI office closes down this will be the only HSE community healthcare organisation, CHO, area in the country that will be without an NCBI office. It cannot be allowed to close down.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	During his discussions with European colleagues, has the Taoiseach raised the issue of Palestine? This year, the EU has the chair of the Kimberley process, which is the certification process for the diamond industry and its exports. Ireland will hold the chair between 12 and 16 November. A key aspect of the Kimberley process is to prohibit the export of blood or conflict diamonds. Palestinian activists and civil society have called for the Kimberley process to include conflict diamonds coming from Israel on the grounds that the latter is engaged in ongoing systematic abuse of human rights, most recently launching a bombing raid on Gaza in which five people were killed. That followed a covert Israeli military operation on Sunday during which seven Palestinians were killed and also the killing of four Palestinians only a few weeks earlier. Over 200 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the Great March of Return this year. Should Ireland not use a power that we will hold this week as chair of the Kimberley process, to call Israel out and impose a sanction which would have a real impact? We ought to demand that Israel no longer has a diamond trade while it continues to deny and suppress Palestinians their basic rights and wantonly kills individuals as part of its brutal oppression of the Palestinian people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not but I know what the source of the problem is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The failure of the Government to deliver social and council housing for people on housing lists or in homelessness hubs is well known. What discussions has the Taoiseach had, which sub-committee deals with it and to what extent does the Taoiseach have a handle on the issue of affordability for those whose incomes are above the eligibility threshold but too low to get a bank loan? Yesterday, for example, I had a distraught mother telling me about her son and daughter-in-law. Her son is highly qualified and works for a telecommunications company. He cycles all the way from Ballybrack to Dundrum every day and gets a reasonable wage while his wife works as a hairdresser. They applied for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme but were refused without explanation. They have their deposit and a clean credit rating but they were refused. That mother simply asked me if the scheme was a scam. If someone like her son and his wife, making the efforts they have made to get themselves educated and working, cannot get this scheme, who can? How could they possibly be turned down? She went on to say that her research shows that 67% of applications for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme are being refused. Can the Taoiseach confirm that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a shocker. What is the Government doing? What sort of scheme is that to help those who cannot get on the housing list and yet have absolutely no chance of being able to afford a home on the open market?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is extraordinary. Does the Taoiseach have a handle on this? Does he understand it? What does he have to say to that distraught mother and her son?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will begin where Deputy Barry ended in appealing to people to take to the streets on 1 December in what is the follow-on demonstration from the 3 October mobilisation outside the Dáil. It is the anniversary of the death of Jonathan Corry, who died yards from the entrance to the Dáil two years ago. Shamefully, the crisis that contributed to his death has continued to escalate. I thank Deputy Healy for putting forward this Bill calling for a declaration of a national emergency and for emergency measures to deal with the housing crisis. It is not the first time that has been put forward, yet the Government continues to vote them down and defend the indefensible failure of its housing policies that have created this crisis, particularly the NAMA policies, the abandonment of the construction of council housing when it first came into power and, more recently, its continued reliance on vulture funds, real estate investment trusts, REITs, and the private rental sector to solve a crisis that it created and that it is exploiting now, jacking up rents, evicting people and speculating on land and property. Why should people protest? Last Monday morning in my clinic, but it could have been any Monday, Elaine came in. She has four kids. She got a notice to quit in April, being evicted on the basis of one of the loopholes that the Government failed to close because the property is being sold. She has gone through all the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, appeals and will be homeless very soon. She went to the council, which told her to find a place to rent on housing assistance payment, HAP. The limit for HAP is €1,800 or €1,900 per month, but rents in Dún Laoghaire are €2,200 or €2,300. We asked if she could get an uplift. The answer was no. She cannot even get the homeless HAP until she is almost homeless. The council has known for months but it will not give her the homeless HAP until she is about to become homeless. Months have been wasted in between. We do now have a placefinder service, but it cannot find a place because there are no places. The next person who came in was a mother with a two year old child. She burst into tears, crying helplessly in front of us, begging us to get her out of the hub in Monkstown she has been in for the past year. She cannot take it any more, psychologically and emotionally. She was pleading with us to see if there was any way she could get out of this place. I then got a call from a mother, distraught about her son. He is working in telecoms, he is highly qualified, and his wife, a hairdresser, is also working. They are over the limit for social housing so they applied for the Rebuilding Ireland home loan scheme. They were refused because they cannot demonstrate the capacity to repay. They have the deposit and a clean credit record. The scheme for people earning between €35,000 and €75,000 a year does not work. The mother told me 67% of people applying for that are being refused. What the bloody hell is the point of this scheme?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Then the Minister of State should explain how they were refused.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The mother wrote to the Minister's office and asked him to explain this. He said it was nothing to do with him and he could not interfere. That is why we need to get out on the streets.
