RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who is getting that contract?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My heart is very much in the debate about the fiscal treaty.  I hope the Taoiseach will answer directly the questions I have for him.  At the outset of the referendum campaign, the Taoiseach said the "No" side would raise issues external to the treaty.  Exactly the opposite has taken place.  The Taoiseach and the Government have discussed everything except what is actually in the treaty, its provisions and the impact it will have on our economy and society.  Instead, the Taoiseach has made threats about imposing worse austerity in the next budget, the dire consequences of a "No" vote and the tax policies of the United Left Alliance, although he refuses to discuss any of these in a debate on national television in front of the people.Will the Taoiseach discuss the treaty?  The treaty is about deficit and debt reduction.  Will the Taoiseach inform the public and the House about it?  What is a structural deficit?  What will our structural deficit be in the year when we exit the EU-IMF programme?  What cuts will be needed in that year and in following years to meet the treaty targets?  What will our national debt be in the year we exit the EU-IMF programme?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What cuts will be required to meet the debt targets in the treaty?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What will the impact be on all these forecasts if the Government's current growth projections are too optimistic?  How much larger will the cuts be?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Most important, who will the Government cut and tax?  Will there be more property taxes, water charges, health cuts, special needs cuts, education cuts or more sales of natural resources?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should show us the cuts, tell us who will feel the pain and how much pain they will feel to meet the targets of the fiscal treaty which the Government is promoting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said "national debt".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I have not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach does not know.  What is the structural deficit?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was a master class in political deflection of which Bertie Ahern would be proud.  The new Teflon Taoiseach has arrived.  The Taoiseach's definition of "structural deficit" is extraordinary but I would like him to repeat it to ensure we all understand it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He said the structural deficit was in the cyclical between the growth and the decline of the economy.  That is the Taoiseach's definition of "structural deficit", and that is the target we must meet according to this treaty.  That is not an explanation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked the Taoiseach simple questions because this is on what we are voting, and it is compelling us to meet those targets.  What are the targets?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What will the structural deficit be in the year we exit the EU-IMF programme?  Going on the Government's figures, what cuts will be required to meet those targets?  What will the national debt be in the year we exit the EU-IMF programme?  What cuts will be required to meet the debt to GDP ratio targets in that year and in the following year?  The Taoiseach has those figures.  What will be the impact on those projections and targets if the growth forecasts are off, for example, by 1% or 2%?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach answer those questions?  Who will he cut to meet those targets?  Which sections of society will be cut?  Will it be the unemployed, workers' incomes, special needs or the vulnerable in society?  Who will the Taoiseach cut? Will he answer the question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Cuts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach will not give us the figures on the cuts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach committed in the programme for Government to protecting the vulnerable and to burden sharing on an equitable basis.  The programme also placed a big priority on job creation.  Yesterday in Athlone, a man who worked for 30 years in a small business but who recently lost the business challenged the Taoiseach about the Government's policies, and was told by the Taoiseach that "You could do with a day's work".  That is a very demeaning and insulting comment to a man who had worked very hard for 30 years.  Aside from the need to apologise to Mr. Gordon Hudson for that dreadful comment, does this indicate a new shift in policy from that outlined in the programme for Government?  Is the new policy now contempt for people without work and contempt for people who have worked all their lives and who tried to contribute to our society?  What about the glib comment on emigration that we heard earlier today?  Tens of thousands of our young people are being forced out of the country as they cannot find work here, because the Government has failed to deliver on its promises to get the country working.  The Taoiseach now simply describes that as a fact of life, when in fact it is a fact of politics and economics and the disastrous policies of austerity.Is it the new stance of the Government to be contemptuous of people like Gordon Hudson, contemptuous of the people who are forced out of the country, contemptuous of the fact that one in three young people in this country is without work?  Is that just a fact of life?  Does the Taoiseach feel any responsibility whatsoever to update the programme to deliver on his party's campaign slogan to get the country working and the programme for Government slogan to protect the vulnerable and burden sharing on an equitable basis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Those are fine words, but does the Taoiseach seriously believe that it is appropriate to tell a man who has worked for 30 years in a small business, and who only recently lost that business, that he looks like a man who could do with a day's work, in response to him expressing his concerns about the impact of austerity policies?  Does the Taoiseach not think that was a serious error of judgment and that he should simply apologise for it?  What worries me, taken alongside his comments that the high levels of emigration from this country are just a fact of life, is that there is something glib and callous about the way the Taoiseach sees the problems affecting real human beings out there, who are at their wits' end-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----because of the failure of this Government to deliver on its promise to protect the vulnerable and to get the country working again.  The facts speak for themselves.  I do not know people in Athlone, but I understand that Gordon Hudson was not threatening the Taoiseach or anything like that, but was expressing his frustration.  This is someone who has worked all his life-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and cannot believe that he finds himself in this situation now.  He is like so many other people who want to work and contribute to society and cannot believe our Government is unable to allow them to contribute their skills and abilities to getting our society out of the mess it is in.Is the Taoiseach going to help people like Mr. Gordon Hudson and prevent the outflow of our talented, willing and able young people who want to contribute to our society and are being forced out of here or being forced to protest because there is no work for them, or is he going to continue with insulting comments such as, "You look like someone who could do with a day's work", when people are looking for work and want work, but cannot find any because the Government has failed them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should have said that to the man in Athlone.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Through cutting.  Eight billion euro of cuts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is the small matter of â‚¬3 billion in cuts this autumn.
