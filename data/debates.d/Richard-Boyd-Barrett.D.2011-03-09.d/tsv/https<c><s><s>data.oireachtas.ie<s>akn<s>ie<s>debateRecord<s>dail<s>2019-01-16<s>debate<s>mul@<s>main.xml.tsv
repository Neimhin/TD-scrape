RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I talked to people who signed the letter as well as to people who were asked to sign it and made the decision not to sign it. As we can see, there is quite a polarised debate on both sides of this question. To some extent, it is up to the theatre and arts community to sort this out themselves. There has to be a balance between making the national theatre a space for all the people, all the theatre community and all the different theatre companies while at the same time guaranteeing decent terms and conditions of employment and some sort of security for actors and theatre workers generally. That is what I want to focus on in my question. Will the Minister accept that what is really at the bottom of this situation is that workers in the arts, whether actors, performers or film workers, whose concerns I have raised with the Minister incessantly for the last year, have no security at all? They have no security of employment, no security of income and no security of career path. That is the problem. We take them for granted. We wheel out these workers in the arts for the celebrations of the centenary of the D치il but we do not care that they are living in poverty and have no security of employment. It is possible to work in the film industry or the arts sector for 20 or 30 years and not know whether there will be a job next week and an income or if it will be possible to pay the rent or get a mortgage. That is the problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Many of these issues are complex and nuanced, but one issue that is beyond question is that people involved in co-productions from other theatre companies who work on the Abbey Theatre stage should be paid Abbey Theatre rates. There is a two-tier pay structure. The other point, which the theatre forum people made, is that the smaller theatre companies have been effectively dismantled over recent years because of cuts in funding. We end up with the theatre community taking lumps out of each other in a desperate scramble to get the small amount of work that is available in the Abbey Theatre or in the places where there is funding. The bottom line is we are not valuing arts and culture. I repeat the point made about film as well. There are people working in the film industry, a publicly funded industry, for 20 years yet they have no jobs. It is similar in the arts. Some 80% of our artists are earning approximately one third of the average industrial wage. It is totally precarious and there is no security. Our spending on arts is at one of the lowest levels in Europe. I was talking to somebody who worked in a theatre in Germany.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Theatre workers in Germany, artists, performers and dancers, have permanent jobs. They get six weeks holidays, sick pay and pension contributions. They have real jobs. Workers in the arts in this country have no rights or security.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the debate on the Solidarity-People Before Profit Anti-Evictions Bill 2018 just before Christmas, which the Government unfortunately opposed but which fortunately was passed by a majority in the D치il, to address part of the reason for the current homelessness crisis, the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, promised that there would be legislation dealing with residential tenancies that would come in immediately in the new year. He said it would deal with some aspects of the loopholes that allow landlords to mistreat tenants and to evict them. I mentioned a woman called Elaine who yesterday received 20 anonymous texts that were clearly linked to her landlord trying to bully her and her four children out of her house. She is still in that situation. The Minister said legislation would be introduced in January to deal with and improve the lot of tenants in such situations. The Bill is not on the priority list or the legislative programme. Where is it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While I made the main points I wanted to make about the arts sector during Question Time with the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht this morning, I would like to put it to the Taoiseach that we need to urge the Abbey Theatre to engage with those who signed the letter we discussed this morning. It is quite a polarised and complicated debate. All of the different stakeholders need to get together to sort out these issues.However, at the back of it - this is where the Government comes in - all across the theatre, art and film sectors, which I have been talking about repeatedly for the past year, there is no job security, income security, no rights or entitlements and no jobs. There is just total precarity. The Government needs to address that. In Germany, a person who works in the arts is effectively a public servant and has public service conditions, whereas in Ireland, the land of saints and scholars, we treat artists with contempt. That is the problem and the Taoiseach needs to address it. Has the Taoiseach's Cabinet committee on social policy and public sector reform addressed the fact that an industrial action by the National Ambulance Service, which will have serious consequences, is due to take place on 22 January? It involves a serious matter regarding trade union recognition whereby the HSE is refusing to engage with the National Ambulance Service Representative Association, NASRA, which is affiliated to the Psychiatric Nurses Association, PNA, or recognise its right to represent ambulance workers. As a consequence of that, a national ambulance strike will take place on 22 January. The Taoiseach has talked a good deal about urging negotiation in terms of the nurses' dispute. I strongly urge him to contact the HSE and tell it that workers have the right to choose their own trade union and that it should engage urgently with the PNA and NASRA to avert a national ambulance strike on 22 January.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did the Taoiseach discuss what is going on in Sudan in any of his meetings? A popular revolution is happening against the al-Bashir Government in Sudan, triggered by a brutal, murderous response by the al-Bashir regime to protests over bread price increases. There have been mass arrests of students, schools and universities have been closed down, and 24 people have been killed, yet the protests continue which shows how serious they are. There has been vast mobilisation of the poor and working people. I am interested to know the Taoiseach's thoughts. The al-Bashir regime is in receipt of EU money. It is part of the set-up where Europe pays to keep people out of Europe. Is that why it is so silent on a popular revolution being brutally attacked by the Sudanese Government?I have absolutely no doubt about the bravery, commitment and determination of the Irish Defence Forces, those involved in the training mission in Mali and the rangers who might be deployed there. However, I have very serious questions as to whether the Government should be sending them there. This is a counter-terrorism operation. It is not peacekeeping. It is a dangerous mission in a very messy conflict in which there are no real good guys. The Malian Government has even itself acknowledged that it has killed innocent civilians in its counter-terrorism operations; there are ethnic complexities involved; and the French have a colonial history and an agenda there. Our deployment there potentially causes very serious reputational damage to Ireland's high standing as a neutral country that does not back or side with imperial powers, big powers, in very messy situations. Perhaps the Taoiseach could comment on that as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have been saying for some time that my concern is that if there is no deal Europe will insist, in order to protect the Single Market, that there should effectively be a border with customs checks and so on, North and South, and the conversation between the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, and the T치naiste rings alarm bells in that regard. We hope there will be some sort of deal even if it is not this deal - I think at one point the Taoiseach referred to the "no-deal deal" that could be done between Ireland and the UK in that event. If all that fails, will there be pressure from Europe on us to impose a border? Europe says it will stand with us on all these issues. Will it stand with us to the extent that it will make funds available to protect certain sectors of the Irish economy, workers, small farmers and so on from the impact if there is a crash-out Brexit with all the potential consequences of that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Then what?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	George Orwell, in his fantastic work 1984, described a dystopian future where the world is divided into three big geopolitical military blocs in a state of permanent warfare, but that reality was glossed over by ideological doublespeak from the rulers of those blocs whose motto was "war is peace, freedom is slavery, ignorance is strength". That is precisely what we are getting from the Government and Fianna F치il when it comes to our involvement with the increasing process of militarisation and the creation of a European army.Incredibly, they acclaim it. It is encapsulated in the name - PfP with NATO. This is an oxymoron, it is doublespeak, and it is a contradiction in terms. NATO is a nuclear, military, expansionist, aggressive alliance. It has a first-strike nuclear policy, which means you fire nuclear weapons at other people before they fire them at you. The EU is integrating with the organisation and the Government is dragging us by stealth into that through the process of PfP and these sorts of agreements while claiming it is not affecting our neutrality. It is rubbish. Let us look at the current deployment in Mali. Mali is a place where the French have a colonial history, and not a very good one. We are deploying 12 Army rangers, just enough so we do not have to invoke the triple lock, but we are not involved in peacekeeping, where peace has been established, but instead we are in-between, maintaining the peace but basically in a civil war situation where the Government we are supporting has itself acknowledged it is killing innocent civilians in a complicated conflict. Why the hell are we sending our troops into that dangerous situation and aligning ourselves with aggressive imperial powers like France? In this case, we are aligning with NATO, which is instigating an expansionist policy in eastern Europe and intensifying conflict with Russia, one of the other aggressive geopolitical military blocs. It is madness and we absolutely oppose it.
