RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This morning, I attended the press launch of the Raise the Roof campaign at which trade unions, student unions, housing groups, anti-poverty groups and many more, including Opposition parties, outlined details of the national housing demonstration that will take place in Dublin city centre on the Saturday after next. We expect many thousands of people to take to the streets to demand action that has not been forthcoming from the Government to address the shameful, intolerable, ever-worsening housing and homelessness crisis.There are many reasons for the crisis. I urge those affected by or angry about the crisis to come out on the Saturday after next. The reasons for the crisis include: the failure of the Government to control rents and house prices to make them affordable; the failure of the Government to stop the constant flow of families and individuals into homelessness and emergency accommodation; the failure to deal with the scandal of empty properties; and the failure to deal with vulture funds and property speculators that profiteer and benefit from the housing and homelessness crisis. I want to ask the Taoiseach about another reason that people should come out on the streets, that is, the Government's commitment to the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement, CETA, between Canada and the EU. Last Friday, as a result of Deputy Costello's Supreme Court action, we found that CETA is, at least at the moment, unconstitutional because it has the potential to bypass the sovereignty of the court system and fundamentally undermine democracy in the interests of multinational investors. I want to ring the alarm bells about this matter for the public and remind them what is at stake here. In simple terms, the agreement gives multinational companies the right to sue governments that introduce progressive legislation or regulation to deal precisely with matters such as the housing crisis, environmental issues or workers' rights by means of a system that bypasses our courts. I refer here to the investor court system. Despite this, the Government continues to be committed to this attack on democracy in favour of the profits of multinational companies. This opens up the potential, for example, for property speculators and investors to sue governments that introduce measures to protect tenants, control rents and regulate the behaviour of vulture funds, property speculators and so on. Yet, the Government remains committed to this unconstitutional agreement and refuses even to agree-----

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I did not. I connected the housing issue to CETA.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am saying it is another reason with CETA.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach want parallel courts to cover it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We can develop trade between Canada and any other country without introducing a system that bypasses the court system and which favours multinational investors. I will tell the Taoiseach what I do not want, and this is the connection between housing and CETA. I do not want what has happened to the United States, which is that the National Apartment Association, which represents big investors in apartments, has taken the US federal court to court through the investor court system and is claiming billions in losses because of the introduction of a moratorium on evictions. That has just happened in the United States. This is not a hypothetical danger. Who is the biggest apartment owner in this country? IRES REIT. Who is its parent company? A Canadian property company. Therefore, if the Government were to introduce regulations that controlled or reduced rents or regulated the behaviour of vulture funds and speculators that are benefiting from the housing crisis, we could be sued through the investor court system, as governments have been on a whole range of environmental issues. The French Government has been sued over trying to limit fossil fuel extraction, for example.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, told this House that we could not ban further fossil fuel extraction because of the threat of possible legal action by fossil fuel companies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do not say this is a red herring. It is true, and you will not even let people have a say on it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Eamon Ryan told this House we would be sued.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should read Eamon Ryan's comments on the climate emergency Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Read the judgment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Once again, we have further evidence of the Government trying to soften up public opinion to abandoning Ireland's neutrality. In respect of the Ukraine conflict, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, stated that we were not neutral. This begs the question of what neutrality means if we abandon it when there is a conflict. The Minister went on to say that people should talk to the Russians. We all condemn Putin's bloody invasion of Ukraine, but is it not precisely the role of a neutral country to be the voice on the international stage that argues for a peaceful resolution to conflict? I do not see how we can tally that with the repeated statements of various Ministers about rethinking neutrality and so on and the presence of representatives of the State at the Ukraine contact group, which is establishing military alliances to involve themselves in the Ukrainian conflict.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the Government position but it is not Irelandâ€™s position.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is an outrageous invasion, but the Government did not say this about the Iraq war in the context of neutrality-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	And sacrifice everything else.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sacrifice everything else.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Give it all to housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Without the interruptions of previous speakers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the next two weeks, People Before Profit and others will be doing everything to urge people to get out in their many thousands on the streets of Dublin on the Saturday after next for the Raise the Roof housing protest.One of the components of that protest will be people from places such as Tathony House, another multi-unit apartment complex in Rathmines, St. Helen's Court in my own constituency - all places where landlords are threatening or attempting to implement mass evictions on people who have done absolutely nothing wrong. There are many individuals who have done nothing wrong whatever, some of whom are not covered by the Government's recently passed Bill to defer certain notices to quit, who face the imminent prospect of homelessness. Under pressure, the Government has somewhat conceded in theory that local authorities could intervene to stop people from being evicted and purchase these complexes or individual homes. In practice, all the excuses are coming out, in many cases from local authorities. One of the big excuses, enunciated by Owen Keegan, for example, is that not everyone in these places is on the social housing list, they are above the threshold and so the council cannot possibly intervene to buy the property. Many others are in that situation as well. Will the Government do something to prevent people being made homeless by ensuring properties are bought and that people being over the threshold is not an impediment to such purchases?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are not doing it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are looking for excuses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are using the income thresholds as excuses not to do it.
