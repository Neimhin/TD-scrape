RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Following on the same line of questioning, do we know how many customers, in particular mortgage holders, ICS has?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Following on the same line of thought that we might consider the implication of this legislation for real human beings and families, maybe it would be useful to find that information out.  Is there any intention on the part of the Department to notify or alert customers with ICS that legislation in the offing which could affect their mortgages or deposits?  Has that been discussed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that after the legislation or before it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That means after the fact, or after legislation has been passed to facilitate the transfer of people's mortgages and deposits to Bank of Ireland to be sold on to some unknown party, they will be notified that this will happen.  Am I correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Am I not correct in saying that it will be utilised and that is why we are passing the legislation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thought it was a condition and that the European Commission requires this to happen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is slightly semantic.  I understand-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that and the constraints on them but from the point of view of the lay person, that is kind of semantic because, in reality, we will decide whether to pass legislation which is being put before the Dáil specifically for the purposes of transferring ICS to Bank of Ireland which then is required to sell it on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have established it is highly likely or possible that would be attached to a mortgage book.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is that but I would go further.  They should be informed that legislation pertaining to them and which could affect them in a very substantial way is now being discussed.  They might have views.  We just discussed whether it might be the case that Bank of Ireland would deal differently with mortgages than ICS or whether another third party purchaser might deal even more differently with them.  We can speculate on that.  Would it not be fair and reasonable that we should hear from the mortgage holders, or at least that they should know about this and have the opportunity to express their views in the pre-legislative discussion because they might tell us building societies have quite a different regime in terms of how they deal with mortgage holders than banks?Building societies have quite a different regime to banks in terms of how they deal with mortgage holders. ICS might tell us. I do not know enough about ICS to say it but part of the reason a distinction was made between banks and building societies in the Central Bank Act 1971, which precluded them from selling on or transferring those assets, was precisely because of the unique character of building societies because they operated on a different philosophy, which one might argue is a slightly more benign, less commercially profit-orientated approach.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that in many ways building societies have started to function like banks but that said, in ICS there might be a legacy in terms of how it deals with customers, which means it has a slightly different approach to dealing with customers than banks, which some might argue – perhaps not me - have a more hard-headed approach with mortgage holders.  There are questions to which we do not know the answers in terms of what this might mean for ICS customers.  I do not know how we would do it but I suggest to the Chair that in discussing the heads of the Bill in the pre-legislative stage that ICS customers might be given the opportunity to give their views.  I do not know if that is possible or how we would go about doing it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In other words, there might be an opportunity for stakeholders to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do you mean now or later, Chairman?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will have to think about the response.  I would make the point to the Department and whoever is listening -  I hope the Minister is listening – that some effort should be made to alert the customers that legislation is being considered which could impact on their mortgages or deposits so that they might have an opportunity to come forward and make their views known.  We do not even know the number involved but it probably runs to thousands or tens of thousands.  That is an entirely reasonable suggestion.  I hope it will be taken on board.  I wish to turn to the other issue relating to Greece in order to get clarity on it.  Europe had a bond-buying programme whereby it bought Greek bonds on the secondary market at a significant discount, therefore anticipating a significant profit.  We were part of that.  The anticipated profit made from buying distressed Greek bonds will be given back to Greece.  Europe, and Ireland as part of Europe, is making a benign decision not to profit from Greece’s misery but to give the money back to Greece and the legislation will facilitate that.  Is that a reasonable layman’s summary of what we are doing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point has already been alluded to that it was a pity we did not get this deal or even ask for such a deal because the other side of the equation is that people did profit and are profiting from our distress and from purchasing our bonds at discounted rates and making the full whack on them because they knew we were going to pay every cent back at the point of redemption.  The Government had made that clear.  Europe decided not to offer such a deal and we decided not to ask for a similarly benign deal.  That is shameful.  Therefore, it seems reasonable we should do this for Greece but it is an awful pity we did not ask for the same for ourselves.  Mr. Ó Brolcháin said the difference between the two situations is that there was conditionality on Greece getting this deal but there was conditionality on us too in terms of what we did or did not get, depending on how one looks at it.  Is it not true that we had lots of conditions attached?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not labour the point except to say that we are subject to conditionality still.  There are all sorts of post-programme monitoring mechanisms.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it correct to say that we are giving the money in anticipation of a profit we will make?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The reason I ask the question is because, if for any reason Greece defaulted, is it the case that we would not get the money back?Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To clarify, Ireland is putting in money now from the Central Fund, in anticipation of a profit we will make on the redemption of the bonds.  If the bonds were not redeemed, for whatever reason, that is, were Greece to default, we would have given away the money and would not be getting it back.  Am I correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I fully get that, because we are not talking about the interest, which is a different matter that was discussed earlier.  However, if the bonds were not redeemed, we would not get our money back.  Am I correct?  I ask just so members know.  As it happens, I still believe we probably should do it because it is a benign thing to do but if members are passing or discussing legislation, they should know what is involved.  In this case, what is involved is that Ireland will be paying out money from the Central Fund in anticipation of making a profit from these bonds if they are redeemed.  The assumption is they will be redeemed but it is possible that they might not be redeemed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The full amount, that is, the €160 million.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I will mull over that response.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Although not many members are present, would the committee-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The legislation is being brought forward.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is up to members to ring the alarm bells individually, as it were.
