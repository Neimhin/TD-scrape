RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We would support it also.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said we support that debate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question is-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will comment on what I see as the stunning lack of self-reflection and self-criticism from Donald Tusk and, for that matter, from the Taoiseach. Donald Tusk said in his speech here that people are turning against what they perceive as an irrational openness and that they see the world around them getting more chaotic with uncontrolled migration and terrorism. First, these are unfortunate concessions to the scaremongering of those in the far right who are trying to whip up fear and racism against immigrants coming into this country. They were not helpful words from Donald Tusk in that regard. Moreover, they show a complete lack of self-criticism in the sense of asking about Europe's role in creating the sense of disillusionment that is widespread throughout Europe. In the case of the meeting with the Taoiseach, I note that Donald Tusk declined to comment on Apple. Is it not a fact that the economic inequality throughout Europe is substantially a result of the fact that giant corporations evade tax or do not want to pay tax, the banks get it all their own way and people take it in the neck? Is that not why we have such widespread alienation? Is that not the seedbed for much of the racist sentiment that is then, wrongly, directed at immigrants? I note the conversation with Deputy Martin earlier about Aleppo and so on and the absolutely justified criticisms of Russia's disgusting actions in Aleppo, its bombing there and so on. That criticism is right and proper. However, something is absolutely missing when they are talking about the Syrian crisis and the migration crisis. This much is clear from the comments of the Taoiseach, those of Deputy Martin or those from anyone in the European Union. What is missing is any sense of the culpability of Europe and the West in the very same cynical military intervention, intervention in Syria and in the wider region.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where is the criticism of Britain bombing Syria 43 times in the past six months? Where is the criticism? There is none.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where is the criticism of US, French and British arms sales to the Saudi regime that has killed 10,000 people in Yemen? Where is the criticism? If there is no consistency in our humanitarian standards and in our opposition to bombing and war, then we have no standards, and everyone knows that it is no more than opportunistic and cynical.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the disaster in Syria, what is happening in Yemen and so on not an opportunity for Europe, the Government and, for that matter, Deputy Martin to start having a little consistency in their human rights standards?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do we support bombing of Syria by the West?
