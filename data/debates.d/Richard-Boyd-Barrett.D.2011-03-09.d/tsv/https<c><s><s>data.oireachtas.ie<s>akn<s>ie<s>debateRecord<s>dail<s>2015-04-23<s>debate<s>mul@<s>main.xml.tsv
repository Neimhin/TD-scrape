RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Figures were released earlier this week showing that there has been a disastrous 55% increase in the number of homeless families and children in the past year. Most of those are in Dublin - 911 children, or 411 families - on top of an already disastrous homelessness crisis in Dublin for individuals, families and young people. How can the Minister say he is taking serious action to deal with this crisis when what he promised goes nowhere near dealing with it, and the allocations he has made for new houses in Dublin are lower in percentage terms than the national average, according to his own figures?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the third time since I entered the Dáil in 2011, I have brought families, who were directly affected, into the Visitors Gallery. They are either now homeless, threatened with homelessness or have been on the housing waiting list for ten, 12 or 13 years. Many of them now sitting in the Visitors Gallery are in absolutely dire circumstances. The figures released today by the Dublin Housing Executive show that the situation has become worse by 55% in the last year, despite all the announcements. Frankly, somebody is telling porkies about these figures. When the Minister says there is €3.8 billion extra it sounds like a lot, but it is €1.5 billion. The rest is coming from the existing social protection budget in the form of RAS and leasing. In other words, people will stay exactly where they are in precarious circumstances. Meanwhile, landlords are evicting people daily because they can get higher rents in the private market. It is bogus and a fantasy to say that there is this big extra injection of money.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In these announcements, the Minister promised a national average 25% reduction in the housing list but it is not even being met in Dublin. The allocation is lower in Dublin where the housing crisis is at its worst. How can the Minister explain this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In recent months, the grim facts of a dramatic increase in families, including children, being driven into homelessness speak for themselves. I will give an example concerning targets in my own area. In a letter sent to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the Minister mentions a target of 681 new houses. When one breaks it down, however, there are only 300 new houses, or less. The rest are leases, RAS or HAPs, which are not new council houses. Much of it is not new money either. The housing waiting list in Dún Laoghaire is growing by 100 per month. The Minister is going to give us 300 new houses over three years, when 1,200 people are joining the list in a year. That means the list will be a million miles longer in a few years if this is all the new social housing construction the Minister can provide. It is not even a drop in the ocean. We will not even be standing still and the crisis will get worse. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it existing money?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Notwithstanding the bogus propaganda that €3.8 billion has been allocated for the provision of 110,000 social housing units, the reality is that €2.3 billion of that relates to the existing rent allowance budget of the Department of Social Protection. That is a fact, as verified by the Department in the reply to a parliamentary question I submitted earlier this week. Two thirds of the houses the Minister is promising come under the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, that is, they are properties rented out by private landlords. When landlords are increasing rents and evicting people on a daily basis, how can the Minister seriously expect us to believe the HAP scheme and the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, that he is promising will deliver the housing that is desperately needed by people such as those in the Gallery today?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hundreds of families are being evicted on a monthly basis by landlords who are running away from rent allowance arrangements with local authorities. At any point in time across the Dublin local authority areas, dozens of RAS landlords are evicting tenants. How can the Minister of State expect us to accept that all these people will be brought into the HAP scheme? That is not going to happen. Will he at least admit that of the €3.8 billion allocated, €2.3 billion is for the existing rent allowance budget of the Department of Social Protection? The new funding being provided is actually €1.5 billion, and that is simply not enough. Indeed, it goes nowhere near dealing with the problem in the short or long term. What is required is new houses. In the meantime, however, I can offer the Minister of State a solution to meet existing need. The National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, has €4 billion in cash. That is our money. Putting even half of it into an emergency programme of social housing construction, to commence immediately, and using whatever empty properties the agency has to provide emergency accommodation would go a good away towards addressing the need that is out there.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I work every day with a local authority that is firefighting in the face of this disastrous situation. The worst-case scenario is being experienced by the people in the Gallery, who represent only the tip of the iceberg that is the disaster unfolding in Dublin and other urban centres. I want to work with the Minister of State to find solutions, but we must be honest here. The numbers he gave in reference to the sign-up rate for the HAP scheme relate to existing rent allowance landlords. Nothing has changed for the people on housing lists, who will not get a council house as a result of these changes. A few landlords will sign up to HAP, but many of them are walking away.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How can the Minister seriously base the future housing strategy on the disastrous crisis we are facing in the hope that he will get tens of thousands of private landlords to sign up for these schemes when they are walking away from rent allowance or arrangements with local authorities?
