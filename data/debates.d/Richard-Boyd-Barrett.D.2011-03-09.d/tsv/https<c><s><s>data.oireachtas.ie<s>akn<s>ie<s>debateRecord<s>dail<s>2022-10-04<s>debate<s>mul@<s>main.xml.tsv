RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On behalf of people who are studying to be psychologists, I have raised with the Taoiseach on numerous occasions the fact that educational and counselling psychologists who were doing doctorates did not get funding for very expensive courses. In the budget, the Government extended the funding to counselling psychologists but not to educational psychologists, which is madness when one considers the huge waiting lists for assessments of special needs in the area of education and for services and supports. That needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency. I was contacted yesterday by a person studying social work, another area in which we need lots of qualified people. The person is doing a master's degree in UCD and stated that students are now required to do 14 weeks of placement unpaid while doing their master's, with no capacity to pay for that because it is not funded. That needs to be looked into as a matter of urgency.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have an email in front of me from an accidental landlord who has a tenant in receipt of the housing assistance payment, HAP. The person has to sell the property but does not want to evict the tenant. The landlord asked Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council if it would it buy the place at a reasonable price of approximately of €295,000. The council said it would not do so if a tenant is residing in the property. This is a social housing supported HAP tenant. For four years I have been highlighting a similar case in the St. Helen's Court apartment complex owned by a vulture fund, which is trying to evict. This is going on all over the place.Will the Taoiseach please answer without clever sliding around with language, as the Minister does on this when he says he has told councils they "may" buy properties where people could be evicted? Can he instruct local authorities that they must - I emphasise “must” - buy houses where families and households are going to be evicted into homelessness, particularly when they are already HAP, RAS or leasing tenants?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach says “can” and “should”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want the Taoiseach to tell them to stop people being made homeless.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Send a memo to them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It contains the word “may”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Liz Truss and the Tory right have faced a humiliating defeat over their attempts to cut taxes on the rich to the levels that we have in this country, as Deputy Paul Murphy pointed out. In better news, though, in another part of the United Kingdom, the Scottish Parliament has introduced a rent freeze and an eviction ban in response to the cost-of-living crisis. The Tories in Scotland are going mental about this development and making exactly the same argument that the Taoiseach has been making in opposing these measures. Thankfully, however, the majority in the Scottish Parliament voted to protect tenants from evictions and rent increases, given the cost-of-living crisis. Does the Taoiseach not think he and his Government should follow suit?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has not read ours obviously.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a member of the Business Committee, I was the one who asked for this debate to take place. I have been asking for it since several weeks before the summer recess. It was refused before the summer, it was refused until now and, finally, the Minister has deigned to allow a debate but has left before the vast majority of the Opposition spokespeople on housing even have a chance to respond to his speech. The reason I asked for this debate is because I think some of us have some things to impart to the Minister about just how dire the housing situation is out there but, again and again, the senior Minister leaves. This is not the first time he has gone and left in his place a Minister of State who is not responsible for this area. I am sick of it. The contempt is not really even for the Opposition spokespeople. It is for the people who are suffering, and I mean really suffering, from the housing crisis. An email came to me today from Nenagh, County Tipperary. It is from a woman, although I will not mention her name. It reads:My husband, two children and I are homeless in Nenagh. We have been told by the council that I earn too much to receive any help. As such, we are staying in a tent. As winter approaches, I am very worried for my children, who are both autistic, and how we will manage. We have been applying for houses with no luck. There are not very many available and landlords and realtors do not seem to want to give us a home. I am emailing you to see if there is anything you could do to help us.She is contacting a Deputy in Dún Laoghaire about this but the Minister could not be bothered to stay and listen to her story. In my own area, I am speaking for Magda, who is in a two-bedroom house. She has been overholding because she got a notice to quit on grounds of sale on 2 August. She lives in a council-built estate, where the house is on sale. Because it is a corner house, three other houses could be built on that site if the Government stepped in and bought it. Instead, who will buy it? It will almost certainly be property investors. At the current price, it certainly will not be the people affected by the housing crisis because it is being sold for €650,000. A person would need an after-tax of income of well over €100,000 to have even a prayer of buying that house in a former council estate. Four houses could be built on that site and it would prevent Magda from being evicted. I am speaking for Debbie, who has been on the housing list since 2009, nearly 14 years. She has three children and she is facing eviction on the grounds of sale. We have asked the council, on Debbie's behalf, to buy that house. We have been saying this to the Minister for years, in particular with regard to the St. Helen's Court debacle, where again a vulture fund bought that multi-unit apartment complex and has spent four years trying to evict all the tenants. They are still there but the local authority has not stepped in and bought it and the tenants still have the sword of Damocles hanging over their head. In the case of Debbie, we have asked the council to buy. The Minister says that, in line with the request we have been making for a long time, he has instructed the local authorities to buy houses where people are facing eviction on foot of a notice to quit on grounds of sale. What the Minister says is not true. That is not what is happening. I got an email today from a landlady who contacted Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in July. She did not want to evict her HAP tenant because she is a decent person. She is an accidental landlady and she has to sell, but she cannot sell because she will not put a HAP tenant into homelessness. She contacted the council after the Minister said he had instructed local authorities to buy in situations like this. She asked Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council if it would do it and it said, sorry, but it does not buy where there are tenants in situ. This is after the Minister said he had informed councils to do this. When I look at the circular, it is clear that it is much more qualified and subject to caveats than the Minister implied today when I asked him about it, and it uses terms like “if resources allow” and “if the council”. There should be no ifs or buts. We need a firm instruction to local authorities that where people are being evicted into homelessness, the local authorities will step in and buy those properties. That just has to happen. That is how we will stop the record numbers of people who are now homeless. We need to look at where that spike is coming from. These are families, mostly working families, who are being evicted for no reason other than landlords selling up to capitalise on high prices or accidental landlords who have no choice, but the Government will not step in and buy these properties. It is crazy. I would go further. I really want to get this out there to the Minister as a serious debate. We should be going further than that. We have €5 billion that we have just put into the rainy day fund. This is the rainy day when it comes to the housing crisis. There are 96,000 HAP, RAS and rent allowance properties out there. We should write to every single one of those property owners and ask if they are interested in selling to the State. It is costing the State and every taxpayer in this country far more money to pay them RAS, HAP, leasing costs and rent allowance than it would if the State owned that property. There would be an immediate saving to the State and it would secure the future housing needs of all of the people in those arrangements. Let us remember that every single one of the people in those arrangements has been let down by the State. They are all on housing lists because the only way people can get HAP, RAS, leasing or rent allowance is to be on a housing list. The State has let them down if they are on it for 15 or 20 years. That should be done immediately. We could make a serious and immediate impact, a practical impact in the here and now, if we do that. We should also do it with all of the build-to-rent apartments that are being completed at the moment.Why on earth would we let international investment funds like the pension fund of the arms dealer British Aerospace, as we discovered in Swords, and all sorts of other international wealth asset management operations - the global rich - invest in Irish property to make a fortune by buying up these properties? Is it better that they or the State own the property? We would not be crowding out first-time buyers because first-time buyers cannot afford any of this anyway, and the State can afford it with the money in the rainy day fund. The State could designate some of it for affordable purchase housing and the rest for social housing. If we do not, British Aerospace or some other investment fund will buy it and lease it back at extortionate rates to local authorities and we will pay for it anyway.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is insanity, yet the Government continues to allow it to persist, resulting in people entering into homelessness. Regarding income thresholds, I will return to the example of the woman in Nenagh. She earns too much to get social housing support, so she is living in a tent with her kids. For a year, I have been raising the case of a woman who has been in homeless accommodation with her kids for four years. She is working for a State agency that looks after vulnerable children. She is over the threshold, so she is not entitled to social housing support. This is a major stealth cut. Ten years ago, the percentage of households that were entitled to social housing support was 47%. It is now 30%. This is a major cut in the weekly supports that the State is giving to people who cannot afford to buy or rent on the open market and who number more now than ever before. At a time when we need this support more than ever, we are slashing it and driving people into desperate situations, yet the Minister will still not tell us why he will not raise the income thresholds. It is outrageous. When is the Government going to raise the thresholds? I have been looking for an answer to this from successive Ministers for five years, but I still have no answer. People are suffering because of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister of State may know, I also put in, before the summer, a whole series of detailed questions on this area of the OPW’s property portfolio. Since we returned to the House, frankly, I think we need to take a serious look at the management of that portfolio. Another thing to add to this debate is that in one of the answers the Minister of State gave me before the summer recess, we discovered that the OPW has 108 unoccupied properties, most of which have been vacant since 2013, and a small number are empty for almost half a century. Some 70 of these are buildings and 38 are unused sites. Some 47 of these are Garda stations that were closed in 2012 and 2013 and still lie empty, including two in my own area: Kill of the Grange, Deans Grange and Dalkey Garda stations, and many other such stations litter the place. As to the question as to whether we should lease, buy or build, I ask what we are doing with all of this empty property and why are we not putting it to public use?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do not sell Dublin Garda stations-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure, or I hope, the Minister is aware that we have a major crisis in being able to recruit and retain teachers, nurses, other allied health professionals and people in the mental health area and many other key areas, such as construction and so on. At the back of all of this, as the reports coming out make clear if it was not already clear, is the lack of affordable housing for people, particularly in areas like Dublin and the epicentres of the housing crisis. I ask what the Minister is doing from a public expenditure point of view to address this recruitment crisis and the housing crisis that lies behind it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are a hell of a lot more than challenges. There is one nurse to 14 patients on wards in St. Vincent's hospital. We have major shortages of staff across the healthcare system, including mental health services, and among special needs assistants, SNAs. Teachers are leaving Dublin - we have seen the reports - because they cannot afford to live here. Reeling off statistics about public sector recruitment will not cut it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They may be facts but they do not explain why we have major staff shortages across our health service and, therefore, long waiting lists and a crisis in our emergency departments, and classes being cancelled because teachers have nowhere to live. What are we going to do about this? I have a proposal. The Minister stated that we should not spend the windfall tax receipts on ongoing expenditure. He was right. Why do we not invest those receipts in buying more housing instead of letting the large investment funds buy up property and charge extortionate rents that teachers, nurses and construction workers cannot afford? Would that not be a sensible investment of that money?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do. I invite the Minister to drive with me along the N11 towards Cherrywood and down to Shankill. At the end of the road, he will find the LDA's first site, but there will not be houses there for another two years. Before we get there, he will see many large apartment developments that are nearing completion or have just been completed. Who will own them and who will live in them? Currently, international investment funds will own them. They will rent them for €2,500 to €3,000 per month, which none of the workers at St. Vincent's hospital or the schoolteachers who are leaving Dublin can afford. If the State uses the money it has in the rainy day fund to buy them and then designate some for affordable purchase and some for social housing, those teachers, nurses and construction workers who need to work and live in Dublin could afford to do so. Would that direct investment in housing people now not be better expenditure than paying large amounts on the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, the housing assistance payment, HAP, and leasing, which is ongoing current expenditure?
