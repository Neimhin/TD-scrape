RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  I am still trying to work my way through this substantial amount of information.  Our view is that we need write-downs because forbearance, restructuring and the various models the bank is developing or has put in place are not enough to deal with the issue of mortgage arrears.  The witnesses have made it clear that write-downs are not on the agenda.  Can they justify that position?  The figures we have been given, which show that the bank is getting an additional 1,400 requests for forbearance each month, indicate that the mortgage crisis is getting worse.  More and more people are encountering trouble and asking for help.  Although many people are already in trouble and the crisis is getting worse, we are continuing to approach this problem on a piecemeal basis rather than looking for a radical solution that could take this albatross from around people's necks, get them out of trouble and boost the economy.  We all know that the level of mortgage distress is operating as a huge macroeconomic dampener on the economy.  Can the witnesses tell me why it is better to take a piecemeal individual approach, involving restructuring and forbearance, than to adopt our approach of writing down to current market value the unsustainable debt that was incurred during the period of the property boom caused by developers and banks?  If our approach was pursued, how much would it cost?  On the basis of the bank's figures - we have been told that the volume of negative equity is approximately €6.8 billion and that €1.9 billion of that is currently impaired - I estimate that the additional cost of writing down the negative equity would be approximately €5 billion.  Is it not the case that the bank has been recapitalised to do that?  The Irish banks are probably among the most recapitalised institutions in Europe.  Why can this not just be done?  It would help distressed mortgage holders and the economy at the same time.  If we string it out, it will act as a continuous burden on people in an unsustainable situation and damage the prospects for economic recovery.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I reject the argument that by coming to an arrangement with people that enables them to just about manage, AIB is somehow offering a solution to the damage to the economy that is being caused by the fact that so many people are in mortgage distress.  I understand the logic of AIB's point of view, but I do not understand its rationale from the point of view of the economy as a whole.  Even if an arrangement is reached that allows people to just about manage, as long as they are continuing to pay off the inflated mortgages that resulted from the property madness, they will be limping along for many years to come and therefore will not be able to contribute substantially to the restoration of economic demand.I do not accept that is the case. Furthermore, I put it to AIB that given it is getting more requests for forbearance - 1,400 extra requests - the situation continues to worsen and deteriorate. It is obvious we need more radical solutions. AIB asserted in its response that this is not the answer for the economy. I cannot see what evidence it as for that assertion, given there is no evidence the current approach being pursued is getting us out of the crisis with anything like the urgency we need, both for the householders involved and the wider economy, where demand continues to be strangled by this debt burden.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will agree to disagree.  Obviously, this is also a Government policy matter, but it is also Government policy to allow AIB the freedom to make these decisions.  I believe AIB is making the wrong decisions, because unless we get radical debt write-down, we will continue to bump along the bottom.  I believe AIB is failing to grasp the significant influence it has on whether we will have the recovery AIB hopes will arrive magically.  AIB is part of the solution or the problem in the context of producing the recovery.  To what extent is AIB policy in this regard connected to the fact that its objective is to resell the bank and make it attractive to private investors?  I see this as part of the problem and see these two issues as connected.  In so far as AIB has responded - not sufficiently in my opinion - to some public pressure in terms of how it operates and its willingness to pass on ECB interest reductions, that has to do with the fact AIB is now in public ownership and more subject to public pressure.  However, in the opinion of many, AIB is not responding fast enough or significantly enough to that public pressure and this has to do with the fact AIB is trying to make itself attractive to private investors.  Is that a reasonable assumption?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one final short question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My final question concerns the land and development and investment property loans of AIB, which are a significant part of its loan portfolio and impaired loans.  In fact, they comprise a larger portion of the impaired loans than residential property loans.  What is going on with regard to these loans?  Tell us more about them and what is happening with them.  Do these loans relate to commercial and residential property that is sitting around empty?  Many people feel we could be doing something useful with this property, such as helping encourage small and medium enterprises or housing homeless people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The bank was provisioned for the first of those, was it not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is investment property.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question asked what was happening with that portfolio, in particular the investment properties.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is happening with the investment property?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	By whom?
