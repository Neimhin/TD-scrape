RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am optimistic this issue is an oversight or an anomaly that the Government can rectify. It should not cost money to do so, which should provide some relief, as it is simply a matter of trying to sort out a problem faced by teachers, particularly those in vocational education committees. It was brought to my attention by teachers in the VEC in Dún Laoghaire but I understand it may affect up to 5,000 people working in VECs. The Education (Amendment) Act 2012 required people to be registered with the Teaching Council for them to be paid by the State. There are many teachers working in the VECs who are unable to register with the Teaching Council because they do not have degrees, although they have worked for a long time with a VEC and are very well-qualified to do their teaching job. That is certainly the case with the individuals who came to me.However, due to this legislation and a departmental directive to vocational education committees, VECs, teachers were told that they could no longer be paid out of the State purse as of the end of October. Will the Minister of State rectify this anomaly? It is perfectly reasonable to introduce regulations on teachers' qualifications and registration. When the Act was passed, it may have been focused on the primary and secondary sectors wherein one would expect everyone to have degrees. In the vocational sector, a degree is not necessary for many people. The person who approached me was a soccer coach and had the highest possible qualifications in that regard. As he does not have a degree though, he cannot register with the Teaching Council, which means he is threatened with the loss of his job. He has worked for the VEC for 17 years. The person in the Dún Laoghaire VEC has worked there for 12 years and someone else has worked in a VEC for five or six years. Apparently, as many as 5,000 people may be in this limbo and are threatened with losing their jobs. Will the Minister of State amend the directive to allow for the teachers in question, many of whom have been working for a long time and are qualified in other ways to do their jobs, to register with the Teaching Council so their jobs will not come under threat and they can be paid by the VECs? A related issue is that these workers should have contracts of indefinite duration, which is not currently the case. It seems that the VECs have failed in this worker's rights issue. We are referring to people who have been employed for 12 or 17 years. They are essentially working on a month-to-month basis with a guillotine hanging over their jobs. Does the Minister of State understand my point on the need to act on this matter and to ensure these teachers do not lose their jobs? The Teaching Council should be told to allow them to register and the VECs should be instructed to give contracts of indefinite duration to those who have an entitlement to such so they can have security of employment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that the Minister of State is working from a prepared script, which is fair enough, but I need him to address the issue. I understand the current position, but a dispensation is necessary. In the case I raised, and I suspect many others, the necessity of registering was not clear to teachers in 2006. A large number of teachers who have been working for many years, who possess qualifications and who are needed in their schools are not registered. They can no longer register because the Teaching Council will not allow them to do so. A dispensation should be made for this group of teachers so they do not lose their jobs. It seems the legislation was focused on the primary and secondary sectors and did not take into account the peculiar characteristics of vocational education, including the different subjects and types of qualifications that do not necessarily fit neatly into the degree model required by the council. This needs to be recognised and accommodated. There are likely many teachers with different types of qualifications who should be allowed to register. The Minister of State did not respond to my point on people's rights as workers. One is supposed to be entitled to a contract of indefinite duration after three years, yet the VECs do not seem to have provided them. Will the right of these workers to be employed be upheld? I appeal to the Minister of State to provide a dispensation and to require the Teaching Council to allow teachers to register. It would be fair and reasonable. Will he address my points?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was not being critical.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I add my support and the support of the United Left Alliance for this amendment. We should all be on the same page, that the purpose of the legislation is to lift the burden of unsustainable debt from the backs of ordinary people who found themselves in difficulty through no fault of their own, simply because they were trying to put a roof over their heads in a market that had gone out of control. Those people deserve relief. It is right that legislation should be passed to offer them some relief. It is also reasonable that people who, in many cases, were actively encouraged by their banks and by advertising on television at the time to invest, to buy investment property for old age or to put their savings away, might have bought one property to let. It is reasonable to offer those people some relief. Such people are not big speculators and all of those people are captured by the threshold of €1 million. Above the threshold of €1 million, I do not see how we are talking about anyone other than professional speculators, who were speculating in the property market hoping to make large profits from the crazy property bubble that had developed and speculation in land and property. They were borrowing crazy amounts of money to pump up the bubble and I do not see any moral or economic justification for giving such people relief. I am interested to hear why the threshold is set at €3 million. Most people feel the ordinary housebuyer and the person who is doing reasonable things but was caught up in the extraordinary situation that developed during the boom, should get relief. The idea that speculators or those who were looking to profit from the market in a big way should get relief is not acceptable to most people. Legislation should not be used to provide relief to such people. I urge the Minister to accept the amendment and, if not, to give some explanation as to why not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the cordial spirit we are discussing this, the Minister has made some reasonable points about the threshold.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I still think, however, that the figure of €3 million is hard to justify. It is reasonable to say there were those who were not speculators who bought a property, often on the advice of the bank, as an investment for their old age.They were not profiteers in any way but just did not know where to put their small savings and the bank advised them to invest them in that way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, and that was outrageous. People actually believed their bankers were responsible people who knew what they were talking about and did that. I suspect there were many people who were like that and were not of the speculator variety. Certainly those people should be given a chance to restructure those debts. I equally take the point about small businesspeople. Such a person might be a small trader with debts resulting from the business and be hit by the downturn. Particularly in areas where property values were quite high, it could plausibly have taken a person to in excess of €1 million. I still believe that €3 million is somewhat problematic because with an ordinary person, who might have a loan on his or her house, one property and even some debts to do with being a small businessperson, it could perhaps take him or her to €1.5 million. One could even argue €2 million to be safe, but €3 million seems to create - to use that difficult and often misapplied term - moral hazard. Speculators, who do not deserve any relief and who helped cause the problem that we are now addressing, should not be allowed to benefit from legislation that is aimed at people who are innocent. In that regard, €3 million is a bit hard to justify and creates moral hazard for some of these speculators.
