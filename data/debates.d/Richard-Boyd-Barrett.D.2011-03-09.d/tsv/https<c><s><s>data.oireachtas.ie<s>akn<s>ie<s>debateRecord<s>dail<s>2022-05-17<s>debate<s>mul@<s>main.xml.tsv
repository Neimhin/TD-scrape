RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My four colleagues from People Before Profit and I have just come from the Palestinian embassy, where we signed the book of condolences for Shireen Abu Akleh, who was assassinated in cold blood by Israeli snipers during a criminal raid by Israeli forces on Jenin last week. Over the weekend, this new low by the apartheid State of Israel was surpassed with the absolutely bestial behaviour of Israeli forces attacking the coffin of Shireen Abu Akleh at her funeral and attacking the pallbearers, an act of such savagery that it is difficult to describe. This was a journalist doing her job, who was cut down and whose funeral was attacked. At last week’s meeting of the Business Committee, it was asked that there would be statements about this shocking murder and we thought we had Government agreement that there would be statements, because we need action to be taken to make Israel accountable for this murderous action and its actions over the weekend at Shireen's funeral.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will have a debate then.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about sanctions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I find the timing of the Taoiseach's visit to Finland and Estonia interesting because this weekend sees the biggest NATO military exercise in decades, which was planned before the war in Ukraine, taking place in Estonia involving Finland and Sweden, countries which are now planning to abandon their neutrality. That is the decision for them. It is interesting, however, that in advance of the war in Ukraine, NATO was planning massive military exercises, which it is now carrying out all over eastern Europe. We must all rightly continue to condemn the unjustifiable, brutal and murderous aggression of Putin but as a neutral country do we have nothing to say about this growing move into essentially dividing Europe into two armed military camps which are sideling up against each other in a pretty alarming way?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Taoiseach any thoughts-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----about the fact that Ireland, on foot of its position as a neutral state, should warn against this military escalation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have raised the case of a particular woman multiple times. This week after a long fight, it was confirmed she has lost nearly a decade on housing waiting list because her income went €38 over the income threshold. Another family of six only earns €31,000 but because of an averaging of income earned by another member of the family over the previous year will now be evicted from homeless accommodation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know of another couple who have just been cut off from the housing list because of their income.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When will the Government raise the income thresholds for social housing as I have repeatedly requested over five years?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When will that happen?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to raise an issue that I am surprised did not get more attention and about which more concern was not expressed, namely the recent departure of Ms Anne O'Connor, the chief operations officer from the HSE to take up a post with a private health insurance company, VHI. There has been a lot of talk about the need to have some sort of cooling off period between going from very senior positions in the public service to private companies when there is potentially a conflict of interest. VHI's job is to make money out of healthcare whereas this Government and the State is supposed to be committed to a single tier, public health service under Sláintecare and yet there is a revolving door through which the chief operations officer of the HSE goes straight into a private health insurance company. That is just not on. We need public sector reform so that there is a significant cooling off period for very senior staff, like the chief operations officer of the HSE, who have access to a lot information which could potentially be beneficial to a private company operating for profit in the healthcare sector.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a bit of a conflict though.
