RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to ask the Tánaiste about the Government's commitment to what it calls reform of the public service, and particularly of the health services. His use of the word "reform" is beginning to gain Orwellian characteristics in that it seems to mean the very opposite of what it suggests, that is, savage cuts being imposed on front line services and on some of the most vulnerable sectors of society. I would like the Tánaiste to prove me wrong on that point. More important, a group of parents and their children who are in the Gallery would like the Tánaiste to disprove that assertion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are the parents of children with severe intellectual disabilities from our constituency in Dún Laoghaire. They have found out in the past few weeks that respite services provided in Dunmore House, part of Carmona Services, are being slashed. What was previously a 24-7 respite service is proposed to be watered down to a fraction of the service that it previously was such that, for example, one mother who had an allocation of two days a week and one weekend per month of respite will now only have one day a month and one weekend every two months. Another mother told me that if these cuts go ahead, she will have to cancel an important medical procedure next week as she will have no one to mind her child on the day of her appointment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is the extent of these brutal cuts, what the Tánaiste calls "reform". These result from cuts in funding by the HSE to these services and the public sector recruitment moratorium. Simply, will you tell me and, more important, tell the parents in the Gallery and the others who are users of this service and their children-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----that you will reverse these cuts, that these services will not be touched and that you will honour your commitment to protect the most vulnerable in society, particularly vulnerable children and their families?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The reason I have brought this issue in here is because 16 parents came into my clinic on Monday looking for help. I did not raise the issue; they did. What they want from the Tánaiste is an assurance that these cuts will be reversed - if it is necessary to lift the public sector recruitment embargo in order to provide the services as they have been, that he should do that - and for him to state here clearly and publicly that he will provide the resources and staff to maintain the Angel's Quest Respite Service for 140 families and their children. If the Tánaiste does not do that, it makes a mockery of all the Government's talk of reform of the health services and all of his talk of commitment to protecting children's rights in the forthcoming referendum. What good is a commitment to children's rights and to protecting children if the Government is slashing the services to the most vulnerable children and their families in the State?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	By the way, the parents are quite willing to meet the management of Carmona Services, and will meet them. What they need from the Tánaiste and from the Government is a commitment that the staffing and resources will be provided in order to maintain the Angel's Quest 24-7 respite service for these people who desperately need it and whose lives will be devastated if these cuts go ahead. Would the Tánaiste please give them that assurance?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That e-mail has nothing to do with me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is onwards and upwards for the United Left Alliance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How much of that is debt interest?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How much of the total is debt interest?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does that mean we will not reach my Question No. 9?
