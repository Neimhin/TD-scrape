RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I call Deputy Boyd Barrett on behalf of People before Profit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am glad the Government finds the current crisis in Europe so amusing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I find Deputy Buttimer amusing as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amusement is not the reason we are here.  Given the severity of the crisis ripping through the eurozone and the serious uncertainty about the outcome of this crisis, the very least the people of this country are entitled to is that the Taoiseach would report back after the European Council meeting to discuss the outcome and the implications of it.Given that even the Taoiseach has acknowledged in previous discussions on the possibility of a significant write-down of Greek debt that this might open up some opportunities for Irish debt to be written down, although that has not materialised——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——we also deserve a proper report on the outcome in regard to that issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Greeks got a write-down because they resisted.  We have got nothing because we kowtowed.As we approach the budget, and ordinary people in this country are quaking in their boots at the prospect of further austerity measures, surely we deserve a proper debate before next Wednesday on the Taoiseach's plan to hand over almost €0.75 billion to the bondholders of Anglo Irish Bank when he does not have to.  Can we at least have a proper debate next week before he makes that momentous decision in advance of a budget about which people are very fearful?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Make it Tuesday and Wednesday.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ye proposed it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The deference and submission of this Government to the diktats of the EU and IMF would be understandable if the troika's strategy showed any sign at all in the last two years of working and any measure of success in containing the crisis and helping to move Europe in a positive direction.  It is bizarre in the extreme, given the utter disarray at the European Council, that the Taoiseach should seek to put a positive spin in this House on what is happening.  We have had one crisis summit after another, delays, postponements and talk of treaty changes.  It goes on and on as the crisis worsens and spreads further.  We are now at a point where there are serious fears of a massive collapse in the European economy.The Government does not seem to comprehend why all of this is happening.  The reality is that the policy of bailing out banks and imposing austerity simply does not work.  It was always unfair and brutal but, above all, it just does not work.  Rather, it contracts growth, which leads to worsening public finances as growth declines, and the downward spiral continues.  Greece is in trouble not because its citizens are resisting and, as a result, have forced at least some of the pain onto bondholders.  Greece is in deep trouble because the austerity measures demanded of it continue to intensify, on top of those measures already imposed in the last two years.  That is what is causing the Greek economy to contract.It is now proposed to do the same to Italy, after which it will be done to the rest of Europe.  The austerity measures this country is facing will only intensify.  How can one expect a different result in the rest of Europe from the disastrous outcome in Greece?  The alternative is to say that jobs and economic growth come first and that we will not sacrifice them in order continually to bail out bankers, financiers and bondholders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is simple; the Government must stop paying off the bondholders.  The State must then take over the banking system, decide its priorities and invest in jobs and economic growth.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should refuse to pay the next instalment of €750 million to Anglo Irish Bank's bondholders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should refuse to pay €3 billion to those bondholders next year and for ten years thereafter.  That is the alternative.  It is about time this Government broke its addiction to the failed neoliberal ideology of austerity and bailing out bankers and bondholders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State always heckles because she does not want to listen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could the Minister of State explain what appears to be the bizarre position the Government is articulating in its statement today?  She correctly condemned the last Government for getting us into this mess and for signing up to an unsustainable deal to pay off the gambling debts of bankers and bondholders.  It is nauseating in the extreme that Fianna Fáil can pontificate about deals it set up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, you are.  You make it up as you go.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Having correctly criticised the last Government for this, the Minister of State is seriously telling us it is a bad thing for Greece to get an unsustainable debt written down and it is a good thing for us that we must continue to pay off the gambling debts of bankers and bondholders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am nearly there.  How can it be a good thing?  The Minister of State might argue it is necessary and I would strongly disagree with her, but it is bizarre in the extreme to say it is a good thing for Ireland because the financial markets will be happy.  The financial markets got us into this mess.  Who cares what they think?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What are we going to do about jobs and growth and how does paying off gambling debts to bankers and bondholders help jobs and economic growth?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am looking at the statement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach's statement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tell that to the 450,000 unemployed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where is the investment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where is the investment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tell us where there is investment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Investment is collapsing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to share time with Deputy Catherine Murphy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the two officials from the Department of Finance for going through the Bill with me for approximately an hour and a half and trying to explain its dense content.  As I understand it the Bill must be introduced in the context of a complicated situation in terms of the more than 200 legislative items relating to the Central Bank and the financial services sector.  Anyone who can work his or her way through that body of legislation deserves much credit.  Whatever I may think about the ultimate content or policy direction of the Bill it must be considered a step forward at some level to move towards a situation where we can at least understand what the laws are that govern the banking system in this country.  Perhaps it is somewhat telling that this is the situation; that we do not understand the legal situation surrounding banking — that it is incomprehensible.  That is not a great place to be and it may be somewhat explanatory of some of the problems we face.Without having forensically analysed what I heard at the briefing or having forensically gone through the Bill, there may be aspects of it that need to be queried, but its general direction is at least moving the right way.  I accept that it is a positive move, in so far as there is an acknowledgement of the need to regulate the banking sector to a greater degree than has been the case until now.It is a step in the right direction, in so far as the Bill refers to an increase in penalties on financial institutions and individuals who are guilty of inappropriate or illegal malpractice or behaviour.  Anything that might encourage and provide legal backing for more whistleblowing among people in the industry is to be welcomed.The context of the Bill is important because if all this legislation is not to be just tokenism it must tackle the problem we have had.  I do not believe that this Bill or the credit institutions legislation will tackle the problem we now face.  It is not a problem.  It is a major, and possibly catastrophic, financial and economic crisis.The legislation is tokenistic and does not address the key problems.  Let me say why this is true.  I find it difficult to credit the Government or the troika, which demanded the legislation, being serious about reining in the banking and financial sectors.  With the new supercharged bailout facility for the banks and the talk of greater recapitalisation of the banking system across Europe, the Government is telling banks that no matter what crimes they have committed, how irresponsible they have been or how much damage they have done to our economy they will be bailed out and there is no end to the extent of the bailout.  A trillion euro is now being spoken of while it was originally €440 billion.  Some people say the figure could be €2 trillion.  There is no end to the bank bailout.Austerity policies are currently being implemented and are inflicting terrible suffering on ordinary and vulnerable people in Greece and Ireland, and soon in Italy and elsewhere in Europe.  We can do those things with gusto.  We can lash into the innocent and vulnerable, massacre jobs in the public service and privatise like crazy because we are able to pay.  As the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, said, "We can pay".  She means ordinary people can pay.  She and the troika think we can pay.  That assessment is questionable.  Can ordinary people pay?  The question of payment is not abstract.  It is a matter of livelihoods and even of lives if the cuts apply to health and education.When Europe and the Government are engaged in an ongoing and endless bailout of the banks that caused this crisis, would anyone in the financial sector take seriously the intent of a Bill such as this?  It is laughable to suggest that our Government or the European political establishment are serious about taking on the malpractice, sharp practice and irresponsible and reckless behaviour of the bankers and the financial system.  How can they take the legislation seriously when we are saying that no matter what they have done we will bail them and make society pay for the bailout?Yesterday, the Minister for Finance said the Bill was based on various analyses of why the crisis had taken place.  He referred to the Nyberg report.  Some of the measures in the Bill relate to points made by Peter Nyberg.  In so far as these measures represent moves in the right direction they are to be welcomed.  However, the fundamental points made by Nyberg — Nyberg does not go half as far as I would go in his analysis — are not addressed in the Bill nor in the previous one.Deputies on this side of the House continually raise issues with regard to the financial and banking crisis but the Government does not want to engage on these issues.  Opposition Deputies have raised the issue of markets.  In the second paragraph of his report Peter Nyberg says the crisis arose from "group-think reinforced by a widespread international belief in the efficiency of financial markets".  The observation is repeated on page 2 and several times throughout the report.  Nyberg says, "The paradigm of efficient financial markets provided the intellectual basis for the assumption that financial markets would tend to be stable and efficient".  He also repeats this observation on a number of occasions throughout the report.This point is not addressed in this Bill or in the previous Bill dealing with banks and credit unions.  Everything indicates that the policy of the Government and the European Union is to continue to defer to those financial markets.  We heard the Minister of State and the Taoiseach saying precisely that.  The entire strategy of the Government in dealing with this unprecedented economic crisis is to get back to a point where the financial markets will be pleased with us and happy with what we are doing.  Government strategy is to prove to the financial markets that we are, so called, competitive.The Government refuses even to entertain a debate about the merits of competition.  Members of the Government are addicted to the idea that competition is a good thing and they will not even acknowledge the role played by competition in the crisis.  I argue that it played the pre-eminent and crucial role, which is what Peter Nyberg says.  He says, "Globalisation of markets and EU membership increased foreign competition in the Irish financial market putting pressures on bank margins" and so followed the reckless behaviour.  Why do we not address this matter or even acknowledge that it may be an issue or that competitive pressures are not always be a good thing?We saw how concrete and practical this view is when we heard representatives of the Irish Bank Officials Association, IBOA, speaking at a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  Despite all the legislation, which is quite technical and tries to reduce the problem down to being a technical one, the IBOA, the people who work on the shop floor in the banks, tell us that nothing has changed in the banks.  The culture is just the same.  There is pressure to sell, sell, sell and to persuade people to use credit cards and buy products whenever and wherever possible.  That is the banking culture.  Workers feel under major pressure to behave in that way.  Why has the culture not changed?  It is because of the pressure of competition and profit.If one questions these practices, as we do, and asks the Government to address these fundamental questions and their contribution to the financial crisis, we are told we are being ideological and utopian and do not understand how things really work.  Pardon us if we think, given all that has happened, that the question of what really works and is realistic should be thrown back at the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Although the Minister is not spelling it out, it sounds as if the dye is already cast from his point of view in that he will go ahead with the proposed barrack closures.  If that is not the case, will he clarify his recommendations or the process within which this review will take place that will lead him to make a decision on this?  The military personnel, their families and the towns associated with those barracks do not want the barracks to close or the anxiety that would cause.  They do not want to be uprooted and the longer distances military personnel would have to travel would result in them being away from their families for a longer time.  Taking account of the totality of matters, they seriously question what economic advantage could be gained from the closure of these barracks.  From the Minister's point of view, it seems the dye is cast and that is a cause of concern because it seems to be very like what is happening with our local hospitals.  Government thinking seems to be to centralise and close down small and local services as in the case of the health service.  That seems to be the Minister's intention when it comes to small local barracks, regardless of the consequences for the military personnel, their families and the towns associated with them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could the Minister give those people some assurance that he is not already recommending these closures and that his priority is to keep those barracks open and cause the least possible disruption to these families and towns?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have certainly moved on from the rebellious Irish in terms of this Government's approach to dealing with the troika — that is for sure.  Setting aside that issue, the Minister seems to be suggesting that his advice is primarily being dictated by the military considerations of the heads of the Army, the officers and so on, while my concern is primarily for the rank and file military personnel, their families, the towns with which they are associated and the detrimental effect barrack closures might have on them.In the Minister's consideration of this as a financial matter, is the Government taking a holistic approach or is one Department doing something which may ultimately cost the State money elsewhere?  There is little benefit in cutting costs in one area if there is a further negative, knock-on impact on a town, increased transport costs incurred in travelling to upgraded barrack locations, costs associated with the upgrading or centralisation of barracks, social welfare costs that may ensue and the long-term impact on a town of a barrack closure.  The Minister said there is no evidence of people uprooting immediately because a barracks has closed but in the long term the closure will have a medium to long-term effect on the town as personnel migrate to other locations over time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would be happy to.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Unless one is a banker, of course.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the former Deputy the reason the Government is making cuts?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We were not here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yesterday the Minister took offence at the fact that we used words such as "massacre" to describe the cuts in the health service and "war zone" to describe the situation in our accident and emergency departments.  He accused us of hyperbole.  What else can one call removing 2,300 beds from the hospital service, and 5,000 over a longer period, aside from a massacre of bed numbers?  What else can one call taking 1,000 nurses from the health system in two years, along with 5,000 other health staff, most of them front-line staff?  What else can one call, aside from a nightmare, the fact that 429 people are on trolleys today?  That is a war zone for patients and staff alike.  What else can one call €1 billion being taken from the budget but a slashing and a massacre of the health budget?Although the Minister is a doctor and I am not, one need not be an expert to understand that a health service is made up of ambulances, beds, nurses, doctors, hospitals, machinery and, dare I say, money.  If one cuts those, one does not get a better health service but a worse one.  If one slashes those things in the manner we have seen over the last number of years and if one intends to continue with an IMF-EU programme that insists on further cuts to those budgets and staff numbers, things will not get better, regardless of what words one uses to describe it.  Reconfiguration, reform and all the other slogans mean nothing.  The nightmare gets worse and the numbers on trolleys increase.The evidence is clear from Roscommon.  What the people of Roscommon feared has happened.  The situation has got worse for them and it has got worse in Galway, where the overflow has gone.  That is what will happen if Bantry, Youghal, Mallow or Victoria South Infirmary are downgraded to the remaining hospitals in Cork.  In my constituency, Loughlinstown hospital has 21,000 accident and emergency cases per year.  If it overflows into St. Vincent's Hospital, where there are 20 or 30 people on trolleys every day and where the hospital had to go off call for several days last week, will the situation get better or worse?  One need not be an expert to work that out.  Our motion is asking the Minister not to make things worse.The link between the downgrading and the cuts and the real agenda of privatisation in the health service is clear in my constituency.  Loughlinstown hospital is to be downgraded and the overflow is to go to St. Vincent's Hospital, which cannot cope.  However, the Beacon Hospital, a private hospital, has opened in Sandyford and the Blackrock Clinic is advertising on the radio, urging people to come to the clinic.  That is not movement towards a single tier system, but the stealth privatisation of the system.  The public system is run down, people become fearful and anxious about a system that cannot cope so they are forced to go to the private health care providers.  That is what money following the patient means.  Money following the patient means the patient walks out of the public health system that cannot cope and into a private hospital out of fear.  Money should go before the patient, so the bed, doctor, nurse, machinery, ambulance and resources are in place.  That is where the money should go; that is the relationship between the two.I do not have time to discuss the Dutch model other than to point out that a majority of Dutch people think health services have got worse since the introduction of universal health insurance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The average household is paying between €4,500 and €5,500 of its income per year for this wonderful health system the Minister cites.  Half of the Dutch hospitals are bankrupt.  Half a million people in The Netherlands do not have any insurance cover at all.  It is not better.  It is stealth privatisation, and we reject it.  We want a national health service.
