RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach's Government has again and again talked about the objective of exiting the bailout and has tried to lure the public and the media discussion into a belief in the idea that if we exit the bailout things are going well, the Government is a success and that we are on the road to recovery but what is clearly apparent now, as the Minister, Deputy Noonan, goes scurrying around meeting IMF, EU and ECB officials to discuss the conditionality around any future funding support or backstop for the Irish economy after we exit the bailout, is that the exit of the bailout is a complete mirage. There is no exit of it, there is only a technical exit of it. We will go out of the frying pan of troika control into the fire of more troika control under a different guise. Even if it is not set out in these arrangements that are now being discussed for some sort of funding line from the IMF or the troika, we have the fiscal treaty, which will also bind us in with all the same constraints. I would like a straight answer from the Government on this issue which was raised during the fiscal treaty debate, namely, when does the conditionality and the requirements of the fiscal treaty start to kick in after we exit the bailout? As I understand the treaty, we have to pay down our debt at 5% over a 20-year period. That is a massive pay down of an enormous debt that has been loaded onto the backs of the people of this country. As I recall the provisions of the treaty, there is a transition period of a few years before we have to stick strictly to that timeline but according to the treaty we have to start to move towards it immediately. We have to begin to move in that direction. Why does the Taoiseach not come clean and tell the people that we are now tied into a situation where we will have to enforce even more austerity for decades to come to pay down this enormous mountain of debt that has been loaded onto their backs?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the reality. It is going to kill our economy for decades because the Taoiseach never asked for a write-down of a debt that is not ours. Instead he continues to pedal the message here and in Europe that everything is fine, we are not defaulters, we are the good boys and girls of Europe who will do whatever we are told no matter how painful and unjust it is for the population of this country. The evidence that the Taoiseach is not succeeding in any meaningful sense of the word "success" was the mobilisation of our pensioners yesterday who finally spoke out about the truth of what the Taoiseach's Government is doing in imposing measures the impact of which are cruel and cause suffering and anxiety for some of the most vulnerable sectors of our society.As Deputy Healy said during Leaders' Questions, in that process it is doing enormous damage to the legitimacy of the political institutions of this State as exposed in the quotes given in the House earlier, and I believe on television yesterday, by the Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, and the Taoiseach in opposition when they railed against even the suggestion that this would be done to pensioners but who are now doing exactly the measure they railed against. Does the Tánaiste not understand how damaging that is to the credibility of politics? We should consider the frightening situation developing in places like Greece where such is the level of discrediting of political institutions that there is the rise of fascist and far-right organisations exploiting people's misery and despair and turning it in the most obnoxious directions. The Government is playing with fire. I ask the Tánaiste, as others have asked him, to stand up for the people and for the vulnerable and stop toeing the line of these corporate lackeys in the European Central Bank, the European Commission and the troika.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Following on from that last sentiment, I equally have little confidence that the Bill will deal with this matter. People from all sides of the political spectrum repeatedly state they want improvements in local government. Undoubtedly, this sentiment is shared by the majority of citizens. Sometimes, people spit the word "council" in the same way they spit the word "politician" because of their frustration and anger with the failure of councils, much like the failure of the Government, to deliver what people want and expect from them. When one seeks to address people's appetite for better local government, one must start with the basic question of what local government is for. If one does not set out to develop legislation and policy based on an accurate assessment of what local government is for and what people expect from it, one will not get far. One needs to start with the brass tacks. What people want from local government is apparent to me on a weekly basis, namely, the availability of affordable housing, the maintenance of roads and parks, support for the local economy, the local community, youth projects and sporting activities, the provision of playgrounds, decent local public transport and amenities, and the protection of the environment. They want proper planning and development that is transparent, in which they have a say and is rational as opposed to the irrational, anarchic and developer-driven economic and planning development we saw during the Celtic tiger period and that played such a critical role in crashing this economy. If these are the service priorities that people believe local government should have - I should add basic elements such as decent water infrastructure and proper waste, recycling and environmental policies and services - they also want some say in setting those priorities. They want real influence, not pretend influence or fake consultation, on a weekly and monthly basis. This seems to be what the starting point should be. The way for a Bill to address this matter - generally, Bills do not do this - is to provide resources. Without resources, activities cannot be undertaken. It is evident that the Bill will fail, as we are doing the opposite of providing resources. We are slashing the funding and the number of front-line staff needed to deliver these services. This slashing has been intensified and accelerated by the financial crash, the economic crisis and the austerity imposed by the previous and current Governments, but it is worth saying that there has been a long-term process of robbing local authorities of the resources they need to provide the services that people expect. Year on year, people in my locality and I have watched the steady decline in the number of individuals employed by the council to perform basic functions, for example, cleaning streets, maintaining houses, and so forth. Councils used to perform these functions, but they no longer do because they have no one to do them. People are driven around the twist by seeing council houses boarded up for months or years. Does the Minister of State know how angry that makes people who have been on a housing list for ten or 12 years? Not a week goes by in which people do not say this to me. They are driven demented by it. In many cases, they are the very tradespeople who could fix those houses. They wonder why they cannot be employed to do the work. Thousands of unemployed tradespeople in the area are just sitting around and would love to do that work. They would also love to provide local services and to maintain, protect and develop the local environment and its amenities. They do not understand why this is not being done. We are moving in the opposite direction. This Government imposed a 9% cut in the local government fund in 2011 and another 9% cut in 2012. In 2013, the figure will be 2% against the laughable background of the introduction of a property tax and the big lie that it would improve the level of resourcing to local government when it was really just going to be absorbed by paying off bankers' debts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was just in full flow.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put it to the Minister of State that her social housing policy is a total shambles and a disgrace. Earlier she mentioned 4,000 new social housing units, mostly through leasing arrangements where we are subsidising private landlords. That does not even cover half of the increase in the numbers on the housing list, which has now reached 110,000 families and individuals - it had been 100,000 and previously 96,000. There is sleight of hand in the announcement of €30 million for 500 new houses. The figures in the expenditure report show that the other side of that coin is €15 million less for local authority housing, €15 million less for voluntary and co-operative housing and €2 million less for social housing improvement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I could go on through the list. I want to ask one simple question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	According to the Minister of State's figures, €30 million equates to 500 houses new houses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just one second-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why can we not multiply that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	----- put €2 billion or €3 billion into building new social housing, save ourselves the rent allowance, house people on the housing list-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	----- and put some building workers back to work?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The situation is getting worse. I put a simple question to the Minister of State. According to her figures for the cost of building a new house - we were building 90,000 houses a year during the boom so she cannot say we cannot do it in a short time-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To build 100,000 council houses according-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To build 100,000 council houses would cost €6 billion. We would save €1 billion a year, according to the Minister of State's figures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	She said €30 million for 500 houses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So 100,000 houses would cost €6 billion and we would save approximately €1 billion a year in rent allowance payments and in the extra rental revenue that would come back to the State. On that basis we could even get the money from the European Investment Bank because we would pay for those houses-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	----- over a minimum of a ten-year period and then we would be into surplus as well as solving the housing crisis and we would put building workers back to work. Why can she not do that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am using the Minister of State's figures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State said 500 houses for €30 million.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fine. Then maybe it will go to 100,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A 12-year housing list.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be happy when I do not have people crying in my clinic over this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State has no interest in a debate on housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It borders on the preposterous to be debating local government reform against a background whereby 25% of local authority workers have been axed, a total of 9,000 jobs, and massive cuts have been inflicted on the central fund for local government. Local authorities need resources and front-line staff to provide the services required from them. Everything else is shifting the deck chairs on the Titanic. In recent years, as funding and staffing have been axed, we have seen the creeping manifestation of outsourced or privatised services and, as a result, more charges being loaded on local communities and residents to pay for the services they used to receive in return for the taxes they paid to central government. Local authorities are being forced to ramp up parking charges and they cannot give small businesses a break on rates. They are required to find ways of making money at every hand's turn, whether from local communities, amenities or other areas, and in the process many people are effectively excluded from services for which charges are imposed. The attempt to deal with the controversial position of county managers, who - let us be honest - are not the most popular people in the world as they stand because they are so unaccountable by describing them as CEOs is indicative of the corporatisation of local government. That is the last thing we need. Local government needs to be brought back to the people. We need real civic involvement by the community in policy making and real accountability from public representatives and, particularly, powerful senior officials such as county managers. Local communities should be able to decide the priorities for big capital projects and services.None of this is included in the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy will have his chance. There is nothing in the Bill concerning managers' large salaries. Dublin County Council's manager, its new CEO, gets €190,000 per year. What will we do about the junket culture in which people get thousands of euro every year to attend conferences, most of which provide no benefit to local authorities or communities? If the Bill is to be in any way meaningful, binding requirements must be placed on local authorities to provide permanent - not leased - social housing within a specified time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There must be binding requirements to the effect that housing, community facilities and so on must be maintained to certain prescribed standards. There must be civic involvement through popular assemblies, directly elected senior officials and so on. These measures would bring real reform, but none is in the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In the final paragraph after “UN Convention on the Rights of Older People” to insert thefollowing:“ — the reversal of previous budget cuts to the household benefits package and fuel allowance; and — the restoration of the full entitlement to the medical card for all pensioners over 65 and for the Government to deal with income inequality through progressive taxation on higher incomes, not by attacking universal health benefits; andfurther calls on the Government to safeguard the free travel pass into the future.”It is nothing short of obnoxious to cut away at the entitlement of our senior citizens to proper medical services. It is appalling in the extreme to take away their telephone allowance. Symbolically as well as practically it is disgusting to take away the bereavement grant, and to remove the subsidies for those who feel forced to take out private health insurance, which will now make it unaffordable and throw those people back into the public health system, from which the Government intends to take €1 billion and which will not be able to cope with the pressures it will face in the coming year. These cuts mean misery, suffering, cruelty, anxiety and, in some cases, may even lead to unnecessary deaths of people. That is the reality and it is all the more appalling that it could be done by a Minister and several members of his Government who railed against precisely these measures when they were attempted by the last Fianna Fáil Government. How can the Minister look people straight in the face after saying the things he said in 2008? How can the Tánaiste or the Taoiseach do so, and then do what they are now doing to our pensioners and vulnerable citizens? This is appalling and I ask the Minister to pull back from the brink. It is not fair. I appeal to the pensioners to get out on the streets again because it seems it is the only way to stop this cruelty that the Government is trying to inflict on them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy supported the protests in 2008.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is just what the Minister, Deputy Reilly, promised in 2008.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If they can afford gold-plated health insurance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The ones who are left.
