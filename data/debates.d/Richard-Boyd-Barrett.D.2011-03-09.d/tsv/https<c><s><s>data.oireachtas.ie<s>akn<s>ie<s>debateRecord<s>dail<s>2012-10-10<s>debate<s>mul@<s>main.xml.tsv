RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Taoiseach will be aware, the mortgage crisis faced by approximately 160,000 households in this country is one of the most pressing issues facing this country. In the context of the Personal Insolvency Bill coming back for its final Stages, will the Taoiseach release the information that Mr. Simon Carswell of The Irish Times indicated the Government was refusing to give out-----

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----on the Personal Insolvency Bill before we discuss the final Stages?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was only asking for information on property legislation being discussed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While I do not propose to support this legislation, it is not because I do not respect the decision of the electorate in the referendum on the fiscal treaty. I accept that decision. Nevertheless, a substantial proportion of voters opposed the proposal and it is right and proper that I and others who took the same position should represent that view when it comes to the vote on this Bill. The Government is committed to the proposal and its majority in the Chamber means it will be passed. However, this debate affords an important opportunity to take stock, as Deputy Kieran O'Donnell and others have done, of where we are at. The strategy that has been pursued in recent years is now effectively enshrined and institutionalised in the fiscal treaty, which means we are locked into a particular strategy for dealing with the financial and economic crisis for up to a decade, irrespective of whether that strategy is working or not. Nevertheless, it is important to reassess its effectiveness thus far. Any fair and objective analysis of the current situation would have to conclude that the chickens are coming home to roost in regard to the austerity agenda generally and the specific model that is locked into the fiscal treaty.All of the claims made in the referendum campaign by the "Yes" side were found by the electorate to be plausible and people voted in favour of the treaty. They now lie in tatters. The Taoiseach sold the treaty on the basis that it would "create stability in the euro zone that is essential for growth and job creation." He added that a strong "Yes" vote would create the certainty and stability "our country needs to continue on the road to economic recovery." The International Monetary Fund has finally cottoned on that this is nonsense. Despite pushing the treaty and being the architect of austerity, the IMF has admitted it was wrong and austerity is not working. The fiscal council, in its latest quarterly report, has admitted it was wrong and that the effects of austerity and trying to cut our way out of a recession have been much more damaging, devastating and destructive of the prospects for economic growth than it suspected. Consequently, all its growth forecasts are being downgraded as they are no longer reliable. The IMF went further by stating that austerity has been more damaging, euro for euro, than the money that was taken from the economy in the austerity measures - in other words, there has been a negative multiplier in terms of the economic damage that has been done by trying to cut our way out of a recession. Under the fiscal treaty we are required to take such an approach for years in an effort to deal with the economic crisis. This policy is not working. On every indicator, the position is as bad or worse than it was when austerity commenced. At a human level, unemployment is as bad as ever and shows no signs of reducing. There are 35,000 fewer jobs in the economy this year than there were last year. In addition, the unemployment rate would be even more disastrous were it not for the emigration of 40,000 people each year. The position is serious and deteriorating. There is no sign of light on the horizon. Small firms continue to go out of business and all the talk of small and medium enterprise being the engine of the economy is not being translated into concrete measures to relieve the pressure on this sector. As a result, companies are going out of business daily. Nothing is happening because the economic demand small and medium sized businesses require to thrive is absent. Every time we cut the incomes of ordinary people, demand collapses further and more small and medium firms go out of business. The sector is also being crushed by high rates and parking charges as well as-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes; credit is an issue I will discuss in a moment. None of these areas is improving. Moreover, the incidence of suicide is increasing, as is homelessness, housing lists are lengthening and people must look forward to paying hundreds of euro more in property and water charges and a further €700 million in cuts to the health service, which the Government promised the troika it would deliver in the budget. In recent weeks, a major crisis arose as a result of additional cuts of €130 million in the health service. What will €700 million of cuts in the budget look like? There will be no health service left. Who will the Government attack and what will it cut next, having gone after the disabled, respite services, care allowances and care packages? Its position is immoral, socially and economically unsustainable and a recipe for destruction.  Deputies on this side have been arguing for the past two years that imposing crushing austerity on countries on the periphery such as Greece, Italy, Ireland, Spain and Portugal will have a contagion effect as the recession spreads to the core of Europe. Finally the IMF has admitted that this is precisely what is taking place. We were ridiculed when we made this argument two years ago. The Government told us the books would be balanced, market confidence would be restored and investment would start to flow. The exact opposite has occurred, with economic contraction spreading into the core of Europe and choking off the only hope for economic recovery. We all know that austerity has crushed the domestic economy. The Government was riding on the hope that we would get out of the economic difficulties by increasing competitiveness and exporting our way out of the crisis. We now find that our biggest trading partner, the European Union, is in recession and may be heading towards a depression. This has choked off the only prospect the Government held out for the country to emerge from its current problems. This approach is not working. At some point one must stop digging if one is in a hole as otherwise one ends up digging one's grave. The Government is digging the grave of our economy and society.  Every time Deputies make this argument the Government argues that we are good at levelling criticism but unable to produce alternative policies. I will set the record straight on this false claim, which the Government also used during the referendum campaign, by setting out our alternative in broad terms. We will do so again in the economic debates that will take place in the weeks ahead. Our alternative is to cancel all of the debt that was not our debt. Irish debt in 2007 amounted to €27 billion and debt servicing cost 3% of Government revenues before the crash. Since then, debt has increased to €170 billion and debt interest will account for 15% of Government revenues next year. This increase is not the fault of ordinary citizens but that of bankers, speculators and the political elite in Europe and Ireland. It is critically important that we repudiate this debt because it is not ours. The Government's argument that we are spending well beyond our means and that repudiating our debt would leave us with a huge deficit of €15 billion we could not possibly repay is not true. According to the fiscal council, which produces useful information, we will have a primary budget surplus next year. Even now, the primary deficit is only €3.1 billion. That is the gap we must make up to match revenue with expenditure. The rest of the €15 billion is accounted for by interest on a debt that is not ours. If we repudiate this debt, we will not have to repay it or the interest on it and will be required to cover a deficit of only €3.1 billion. The fiscal council has provided these figures. Would this be the morally correct position to take? Yes. Would it also be an economically sustainable position? Yes, because otherwise our debt will reach €200 billion at the end of next year and we will be required to make €9 billion in interest repayments. That is an unsustainable position. As the markets and society know, recovery is not possible with such a high level of debt and forcing us to pay it down at interest rates of 5% per annum will require crippling austerity for many years. If, on the other hand, we were to pursue the policy of debt repudiation, we would have to find €3.1 billion. This would be achieved by taxing the wealthy. Every time we make this argument the Government tells us not to be ridiculous as there is no pot of gold. Last week, again, I tabled parliamentary questions on the tax yield to the Minister for Finance. I will be screaming about the facts that I gleaned from them coming up to the budget. The top 5% of earners, 108,000 people, have a gross income of €20 billion. Their average earnings are €185,000 a year. To get a yield of €3.5 billion, one would have to take €32,000 extra in tax off that group. Could they afford it? I think they could. They could certainly afford it a hell of a lot more than our health service, our disabled citizens, people on social welfare, low and middle income workers and all the other vulnerable sectors of our society such as those in mortgage distress who are being crucified. Would it be such an imposition for those with average earnings of €180,000 a year to lose €30,000 of that to save the rest of our society? One could graduate that tax take so that those at the top end paid more. When one sees the figures broken down, decile by decile, of who is earning what in society, it is shocking. The 120 richest people have average earnings of €8 million a year. Could they afford to take a hit of a few hundred thousand quid? Up to 2,000 people are on earnings between €500,000 and €750,000. Could they not afford to take a bit of a hit instead of hitting people on social welfare, the disabled and the poor?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The top 5% are paying an effective tax rate, including the universal social charge, of 36%.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why can they not pay an effective tax rate of 50%?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the poor who are leaving the country - 40,000 of them a year. Is it okay for them to leave the country because there are no jobs and they are crippled by limited services, austerity and poverty?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is not true?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just told you. Get out your calculator. Multiply €35,000 by 108,000. It comes to €3.5 billion. That is how we would make up the gap. In addition to that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the deficit and that is the adjustment that should be imposed in the next budget.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Leas-Cheann Comhairle?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In addition to dealing with the €3.5 billion deficit by taking €35,000 in taxes from the richest 5% in our society, which would still leave them very rich, we need money for a stimulus investment programme. One cannot have jobs or recovery without such a programme. Where would one raise the funding for it? From the corporate sector, which is creaming it in profits and pays an effective tax rate of 10%. Last week when I asked the Minister for Finance for the latest figures on the yield from this sector, he said they were not available yet. However, in 2008, after the collapse, total corporate profits in this State came to €51 billion, on which tax paid came to €5 billion. That is an effective rate not of 12.5% but of 10%. By bringing up the effective corporate tax rate to the nominal rate of 12.5%, we would raise €1.25 billion. I am sure the multinationals will not go running out of the country because they have to pay a nominal corporate tax rate of 12.5%. We could also raise €750 million by housing the 100,000 people on the housing list. We now spend €500 million in rent allowance to private landlords to house these people. If the State housed them, we would save that €500 million and get €250 million in revenue back in the form of rent. Why can we not do this? Deputy O’Donnell said we needed to deal with the unemployment crisis because it is costing us €20,000 per person to keep these people unemployed when they would prefer to have jobs. With 340,000 people, that cost comes to €6.4 billion a year. Alternatively, if we employed those people in public works and infrastructure programmes, strategic industries and so forth on an average wage of €30,000 a year, it would cost us only another €3.2 billion. These people would be put back to work developing the infrastructure, strategic industry and enterprise we need to get the economy moving. This money could be raised through wealth taxes, a small increase in corporate tax and resolving the housing list issue. While Deputy O’Donnell rightly bemoans the fact the banks are not investing - they are risk-averse, as he called it – I ask why we cannot do something about it. We bailed out the banks, making us their majority shareholders. They are now the most highly capitalised in Europe but they still will not lend or invest in the economy. Why do we not simply assert control over the banks directly and force them to invest as a strategic investment bank, just as Deputy O’Donnell said? The Government is committed to the idea as it is in its programme for Government. However, it has not materialised, as there is no strategic investment. We do not even need to set up a new bank as we own the banks already. Why can we not take direct control of the banks that we own and force them to invest in the economy and extend lines of credit to small and medium-sized enterprises? I do not understand why we are not willing to do this, although it is possibly an ideological commitment of Fine Gael not to interfere with the private ownership of banks. That strategy is failing, however.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They confirmed it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Murphy did a good enough job of that himself.
