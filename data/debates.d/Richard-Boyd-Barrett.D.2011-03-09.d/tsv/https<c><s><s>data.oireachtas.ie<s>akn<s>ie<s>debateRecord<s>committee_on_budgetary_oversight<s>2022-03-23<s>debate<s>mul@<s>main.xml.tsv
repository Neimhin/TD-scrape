On the last point about the nature of the energy price increases, Europe has substantially increased its renewable energy production. I think I am correct in saying that 2020 was the first year in which the majority of electricity in Europe was produced renewably. We have actually increased the renewable energy supply in Europe and in this country but that has not made a damn bit of difference to the cost of energy. I ask Dr. Cassidy to explain that conundrum. The narrative we are hearing from the Government is that faced with these shocks, we have to wean ourselves off our reliance on fossil fuels. Now, for climate change reasons, we should do so anyway but there is an implication that if we do that, and develop more indigenous renewable energy, it will somehow lead to a reduction in the price of energy and electricity. Is there any reason to believe that, other than the ideological assumption underpinning it? It would be interesting to hear the Central Bank's response to that because when I look at the situation, given that the market is setting these prices regardless of where or how the energy or electricity is produced, there seems to be no evidence to support that suggestion. The difficulty we have is that when we are talking about inflation and the cost of energy rising, there is an implication that we are all in this together in suffering the consequences, that this is a big problem for everybody. Is it fair comment to say that it is not a big problem at all for those who produce energy? Actually, they are doing extraordinarily well and this is a tale of two shocks. There is the shock for the majority who have to buy the petrol, energy or electricity from the producers and suppliers but what we are witnessing is a bonanza in profit for those same producers and suppliers, whether the energy is renewable or fossil-fuel based. That is actually what is happening here. I would be interested to hear Dr. Cassidy's comments on that. Is that an accurate description of what is happening in this country, in Europe and globally?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Dr. Cassidy. I think there are important implications of this. In a globalised economy, the owners of the energy supplies are really the shareholders, who are not limited. The companies will be based in a particular country, whether that is BP or Shell in Britain or Aramco in Saudi Arabia, but people with additional wealth in this country buy shares in these companies. I often find the Central Bank's quarterly report at the beginning of the year fascinating, in which it shows the increases in household wealth, which have been pretty dramatic over the past ten years or so. Many households in this country would be stunned to hear that household wealth had increased dramatically year on year for the past decade or so, but the Central Bank's reports demonstrate that. That clearly indicates that very wealthy households have seen a very significant increase in their wealth. Some of that is property based, given the rise in the value of property, but if I read the report at the beginning of the year correctly, it indicated that many of those increases were accounted for by increases in financial assets, that is, shares, dividends, savings and all that kind of stuff. The wealthiest households in this country - this is probably an international pattern - have seen their wealth increase greatly. Is it fair to say, therefore, that if they are shareholders in companies that are making significant profits, such as energy companies or arms companies, which have also been doing well recently, the inflation crisis is not a problem for them at all? The increasing value of their investments, if they have investments in companies such as petrol, energy or arms companies, means they actually are benefiting from the inflation crisis that is crucifying everybody else. Is that a fair comment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was not saying it was just that, I was just giving that as an example. This predates Covid. The Central Bank's reports show a consistent increase in net household wealth for the past ten years or so, with fairly dramatic increases pre-Covid. It is interesting that is happening. Most people, particularly with the increasing rate of inflation and so on but even more generally, will not have felt their household wealth has increased. They will have been struggling already with the cost of living. This suggests there is a layer of the population that has additional money and that has seen its household wealth increase. Much of that relates to property, because these people are doing well out of the housing crisis, the high rents and so on, but they are also generating it from investments and savings.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the housing aspect, we all agree that it is an absolute priority to address the housing crisis. What is the Central Bank's view about our ability to do that? Even pre-Ukraine, we were reaching the point where rents are completely unaffordable for most people, house prices are completely unaffordable, and the cost of construction has reached a point where the market at least is not really capable of doing any better than that. It could not actually bring the prices below or to the level where the majority of people could afford them. Now we are seeing another inflation crisis on top of that, which means that the cost of building materials and so on is going up further. Is it not the case that we are absolutely goosed in our ability to do the most basic thing, the thing that the Central Bank representatives have certainly identified, and on which I and most people would concur, as an absolute priority? We are completely goosed in our ability to deliver on this. Even if we did have significant increases in labour from anywhere in the world, as alluded to by the Chairman, it does not really deal with the bottleneck that we had reached. I have a very definite view of this, which is the unthinkable. We are looking at catastrophic market failure.It is absolute system failure. The market just cannot deliver any more and we must start thinking about the unthinkable, which means nationalising whole sections and effectively doing war economy stuff in order to be able to deliver the most basic things. Arguably, we are reaching similar points with energy and other key services and goods we need to simply sustain our society at all. What we are facing with inflation and all that is simply a market not being able to deliver and we must consider going beyond the market if we are to meet those basic needs and demands. I do not expect the officials to agree with my ideology but do they think we are at an existential kind of crossroads here, in that all the orthodoxies, rules and economic consensus have come up against a brick wall and we must think of radical measures outside the box if we are going to address these basic things?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is one other thing. Dr. Cassidy quoted some statistics there on the distributional impacts of inflation on different deciles of the population or whatever. Was that a document? I was trying to find it on the bank's website.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, but the officials will send it to us as well.
