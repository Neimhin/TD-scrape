RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs indicated yesterday that the Children First guidelines will be implemented in the form of legislation quite soon.  Given that those guidelines suggest the issue of neglect by omission, particularly in the area of vulnerable disabled children who may miss school and as a result be deprived of intellectual stimulation, that is a form of neglect that must be addressed.  When will that legislation be brought forward and will it guarantee, as a matter of right, the special needs and other educational supports required to vindicate the rights of special needs children to a full and proper education as against the current policy of caps and quotas, which in effect mean cuts in special needs educational support?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will that come before the Dáil?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not contemptuous, arrogant and insulting to the representatives of the people in this Chamber that the Taoiseach has decided to absent himself when questions about his accountability — my question is not only about accountability to the Oireachtas but to the people — are being discussed?  Is it not the case that the reason he has decided to absent himself from questions about accountability is that his credibility on accountability is under serious question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking questions.  Is it not the case that the Taoiseach has absented himself from the Chamber when questions about accountability are being discussed because he is not being accountable to the people who elected him in respect of the solemn promises he made to them about issues such as hospital services in County Roscommon and elsewhere?  Is it not also insulting, contemptuous and arrogant that, in the gravest economic crisis the country has ever faced, when Deputies ask serious questions about the Economic Management Council in his Cabinet, which deals with the economic affairs of the country, we receive glib, smart alec answers from the Minister of State——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——in which he informs us we should raise the matter with the Minister for Finance when he knows well that the Minister for Finance is only available——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——for questioning every four weeks?  Is it not entirely legitimate for public representatives to ask about the Economic Management Council?  Does Government accountability for its actions, the debates it is having and the issues that affect our country and people in a grave situation not require it to answer questions rather than running away from, slithering out of them or setting them aside by making the glib excuse that they should be asked here or——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My contribution consisted solely of questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am a member of the United Left Alliance, no member of which made insulting comments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did and it was——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a supplementary question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have been misquoted too.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Everyone else has been allowed to ask three or four supplementary questions.  I have had only one chance to speak.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No member of the United Left Alliance made any comment——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	An allegation was made on the floor of the House.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister of State allowed to make an allegation but I am not allowed to respond to it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will ask a question.  I simply want to speak one sentence to clarify a false allegation made by the Minister of State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a supplementary question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is one rule for me and one for everyone else.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question was about the accountability of the Government.  That is not just about Dáil reform.  It is about the accountability of Government.  The Minister of State might agree that we are not allowed to make suggestions because we are only allowed to ask questions.  Our question to the Minister of State is: What measures is he taking to ensure the accountability of the Government?  If the Minister of State wishes I will say what I mean slowly, so that I can get a clear answer from him.  What measures is he putting in place to ensure that when, for example, solemn promises made to the electorate before an election in order to get their votes are then broken, the public have some recourse to hold the Government accountable on those broken promises?  Will he, for example, introduce a measure whereby people can get half a million signatures for a petition to call a referendum on an issue where such a controversy arises?  Will he introduce such a measure so that the people of Roscommon, Loughlinstown and elsewhere, who had promises made to them about their hospitals, can hold the Government to account for what it said before the election?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We all agree with that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be taking Deputy Higgins's question also, if that is okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am extremely disappointed with the Minister's response.  The people involved in the flotilla and their supporters will be very disappointed with that response, as they are angry at the collusion with the Greek authorities and, they believe, the collusion of all European political leaders with Israel, in preventing this peace flotilla reaching the beleaguered people of Gaza with aid and solidarity.Why did the Minister ask the Israeli authorities merely not to injure people during an interception of the flotilla rather than ask them not to intercept the flotilla but to allow it free and safe passage to breach an immoral and illegal siege that has been causing immense suffering for the people of Gaza for several years?  That is what many people and I believe the Minister should have asked them.  Why did the Minister not ask them simply not to intercept the flotilla?I am extremely disappointed by the Minister's response to the sabotage allegations.  It is not true, as the Minister said, that the Turkish authorities have stated they do not believe the damage was caused by sabotage.  This is based on a report from a newspaper that was put out a few hours after the official investigation by the Turkish authorities in Turkey began.  The report has since been recycled in the press across the world.  An official investigation is going on, with which the flotilla participants are co-operating, and which has not concluded.  How can the Minister state that the Turkish authorities have concluded there was not sabotage when the official investigation has not concluded?Has the Minister not seen the evidence of sabotage?  I have, and the media in Ireland have seen it.  Two boats in different ports were damaged in exactly the same way and in a way that, had the damage not been detected, would almost certainly have resulted in the loss of life of Irish citizens and others.  The boats were damaged in exactly the same way in two different ports, one in Turkey and one in Greece.  This is cast iron evidence of sabotage.  I ask the Minister to look at the evidence.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am genuinely not trying to score political points but I was disappointed with the Minister's answer.  In reply to a written parliamentary question tabled by Deputy Mac Lochlainn, the Minister stated: "I have no grounds on which to dispute these views or to demand a further investigation."  That is why I expressed disappointment.  There is no evidence to support the claim that this matter has been investigated.  Who in the Turkish Government told the Minister that this matter had been investigated and it was concluded that this was not sabotage?  On what basis were the conclusions drawn?  Did he inquire about the nature of the investigation that led them to these conclusions?  The official investigation involving the coast guard had only begun hours before the report that it was not sabotage appeared in a newspaper.  It has not even concluded and, therefore, how the Turkish authorities could conclude it was not sabotage is beyond me.  From whom and on what basis have they given the Minister this information?He got somewhat annoyed when I referred to the collaboration between European governments.  Why did the Government and other European governments say to Israel "Just do not do any harm to anybody when you are intercepting the flotilla", which is more or less what the Minister said earlier, instead of saying to them "Do not intercept the flotilla because these are peaceful activists bringing aid to people who are unfairly and brutally besieged"?  That is what anybody would expect our Government and European governments to say because the siege is wrong.  My interest is in the lifting of the siege and not in the protest.  I became involved in politics having visited the Palestinian occupied territories at the beginning of the first intifada.  The appalling plight of the Palestinians and the failure of western governments to do anything about it motivates me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government just does not get it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputies opposite get obfuscation, smoke and mirrors and justification but they do not get the issue or the concerns expressed by parents of the most vulnerable children in our society.  The reason there was a protest tonight is that the Deputies in the Technical Group have been inundated with calls from desperate parents since we were elected to Dáil Éireann.  The parents, some of whom are sitting in the Visitors Gallery, said they do not know if their children would have the education they need in September.  When they first came to us, they were unsure but in the past few weeks they have found out that their children will not have the education they need and deserve as a right because hundreds of schools have received letters saying they will not receive the special needs assistants they sought or the educational support they sought.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In my area, a school that sought three additional SNAs was given a cut of three.  It is down six SNAs compared to what it needs.  This Government does not get all of the nonsense about cuts, quarters and caps.  Some 10,000 additional children come into our education system every year.  Either we provide for them and for their education as a matter of right or we use excuses about the EU-IMF, the programme we have signed up to, economic realities, being in a straitjacket and all the nonsense we get from the Government.  The Government is in a straitjacket because it made a decision to adhere to a programme that is stripping this country of the services it needs to look after our most vulnerable children.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Members opposite can keep heckling because they do not care about the parents or the children.  They just want to heckle and score political points.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the Children First guidelines, which the Minister says the Government will implement as a matter of legislation, it says that neglect can be defined in terms of an omission "where the child suffers significant harm or impairment of development", including intellectual stimulation or a lack of.  It continues:A child who consistently misses school may be being deprived of intellectual stimulation.  The threshold of significant harm is reached when the child’s needs are neglected to the extent that his or her well-being and/or development are severely affected.This is defined as neglect and the guidelines suggest neglect should be a criminal offence.  If Government Deputies say the provision of special needs assistants and support will be governed by caps and quotas, not rights as demanded by the guidelines, they are engaging in criminal neglect of children.  How else can they explain that people who need supports have been denied them in the past number of weeks?  Are Deputies saying that is not happening?  Are they saying the parents who contacted us are lying, or are out there for no good reason?  They asked us to do something and as public representatives we feel duty bound to do so.  When the Deputies opposite were in opposition, they were saying exactly the same.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes, stated:It is not an exaggeration to say that the range of supports offered to children with special educational needs in this country is nothing short of scandalous.  Despite new legislation, many commitments, new funding and promises of better co-ordination between Departments, we are still a long way——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They do not want to hear their own words.  That is the problem.  This is another U-turn.  Just think about the devastating consequences on the lives of young children whose education is a right.  Our society will pay the price for this.  Deputies opposite are not listening but if they think we are stirring it up now, they should wait until they see what is coming.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The only message I have is to encourage people to get out and protest to hold these people to account for the promises they made and which they are betraying.  It is a scandal.
