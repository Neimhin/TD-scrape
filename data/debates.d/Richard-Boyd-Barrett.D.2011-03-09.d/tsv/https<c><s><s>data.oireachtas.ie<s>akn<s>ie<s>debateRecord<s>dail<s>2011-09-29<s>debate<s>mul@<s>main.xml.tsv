RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what the Estimates indicate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the Tánaiste's clear indications that he intends to connive with the EU/IMF troika in asset-stripping the country in order to pay off speculators' debts, when will the legislation which I presume will be required to sell off our State assets come before the House?  If the Tánaiste can give us the date I can get busy organising the protests which I hope will be taking place outside Leinster House.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appeal to the Minister to put as much as pressure as he can on Stena Line to pull back from downgrading to a seasonal service from Dún Laoghaire because the Government has committed itself to developing tourism infrastructure and if we do not have a proper year round service in Dún Laoghaire, it will make a mockery of efforts to improve the such infrastructure.  It has always been a vital route in and out of the country and I do not believe for a minute that it is unviable.  Fuel costs could be reduced by using a different ship.  The ship being used currently has particularly high fuel costs.There are also questions relating to the workforce.  The negotiations referred to by the Minister followed the company telling the entire workforce that it would be made redundant, despite saying it would maintain a service.  The workers should get a commitment that in so far as services are maintained, their jobs, pay and conditions will be maintained.With regard to the harbour company, all the cost cutting is being inflicted on the workforce via job losses and demands for swingeing pay cuts.  On the other hand, there is seriously milking and abuse of expenses by harbour board directors.  I do not have time to go through the figures but I ask the Minister to look into this.  It is the subject of a later question that we will not reach but there are serious questions to be answered about board directors abusing travel expenses.  For example, one claim was for €1,300 to travel to a meeting in Dún Laoghaire from Cork.  There are eight meetings a year and now someone is claiming expenses from Dubai.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is more to it than that.  This person is still on the board.  For example, according to the profit and loss account, in 2007, when the same director was living in Dalkey, he claimed €458 in expenses to travel to Dún Laoghaire eight times a year.  In 2008, when he was living in Cork, he claimed €1,300 per meeting to travel from there.  The fare for a return train journey to Cork is €71 and it costs €25 for a taxi from Heuston Station to Dún Laoghaire and probably a similar amount for a taxi in Cork.  That totals approximately €170, yet he claimed €1,300.  In February 2009, the chief executive officer used the company credit card to pay for dinner and accommodation in the Royal Marine Hotel for guests, partners and so on, even though most of them lived in the Dún Laoghaire area.  A sum of €450,000 was paid to consultants for fantastic, unrealisable plans.  This equated to a cost of €10,000 per day to a company that is losing the same amount per day but the workers are being asked to take swingeing pay cuts.  Will the Minister look into this?  It is unacceptable.  Jobs are being slaughtered while people at the top are abusing expenses.
