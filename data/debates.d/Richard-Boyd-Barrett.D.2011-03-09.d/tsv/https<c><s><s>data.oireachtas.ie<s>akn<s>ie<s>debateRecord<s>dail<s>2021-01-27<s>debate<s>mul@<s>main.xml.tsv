RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed. I am not exaggerating when I say that the Government is using the Covid pandemic to gag the Opposition and minimise the opportunities for the Opposition to hold the Government accountable at a time of national emergency when people out there are asking questions about the strategy around Covid, around the state of our health services and all the different knock-on issues that are profoundly affecting our population. One of those opportunities, which is being denied to us because of the severe curtailment - we accept there has to be some curtailment - of Dáil activity is Taoiseach's questions. We have asked for this for weeks. The Taoiseach's questions slot, that normally comes after Leaders' Questions, is where the Taoiseach is questioned about the matters under his Department, all the various subcommittees that deal with Covid, etc.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are not allowed ask the Taoiseach these questions. That is not acceptable, as far as I am concerned. It is a 40-minute slot. We have asked for it for the past two weeks and it is being denied. That is not accountability. That is not leadership on the Taoiseach's part. It does not give the public the opportunity to ask really urgent questions they have of Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed. I do not want to waste the Dáil's time by calling votes, particularly if I am not getting support from others. Nonetheless, I will make the point that we have six and a half minutes to question the Minister for Health tomorrow because the Government insists on limiting the time to debate with and question the Minister. We have raised this repeatedly over the past few weeks. It is unacceptable. We have a raging debate about the refusal of the Government to even take seriously the calls for zero Covid. We have a desperate crisis in our health services in terms of sickness of health workers, the situation in ICU, the vaccine roll-out and so on. By the way, we asked that the debate would be about Covid response and not just about vaccines.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am pointing out it is not acceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Nor it is acceptable that, at the end of Thursday, it seems the Government wants to ensure that we organise things so that there cannot be Tuesday sittings of the Dáil. I object profoundly to this. It is essential work for us to act as messengers to the Dáil of the issues that are being raised by people in the context of this dire crisis and the hardships they are suffering-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and their concerns about the lack of a plan from this Government to deal with Covid.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I raised it at the Business Committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When the legislation relating to the CRSS was passed by the Houses, I argued as forcefully as I could that it was unfair on people who did not have a premises, whose premises might be, for example, their taxi or van or whose livelihoods involved overheads in terms of loans or rents on premises that are not public-facing, such as musicians, people who work in the arts and many others who operate small businesses. Those businesses and their employees have been devastated, most of them, particularly regarding taxi drivers, musicians and many others, far more than the 25% threshold which allows businesses with a public-facing premises to get the CRSS. One only has to go out onto the streets to see the situation for taxi drivers at the moment. Their ability to earn an income is down 70% or 80%. They have car repayments, insurance costs and other ongoing overheads, yet they are excluded. There is no justice to this. It is completely unfair. They need help. The vast majority of taxi drivers have also been excluded from the €1,000 restart grant because people have to sign off the PUP in order get that grant. A person cannot sign off the PUP at the moment with any hope of earning even a fraction of what he or she would normally earn for the obvious reason that people are not on the street because of Covid restrictions, and rightly so. Why are taxi drivers being excluded? They still have to carry the costs to which I refer. The position is similar for people in music and the arts, and it is completely unfair. It is precisely some of those who have been worst hit who are not included. In the case of musicians and artists, they have been shut down completely since the beginning of the pandemic, yet many of them are excluded from these schemes. It is not fair. I support Deputy Doherty's amendment. These points were put to the Minister forcefully when the legislation was pushed through and I do not know why he is ignoring them. Also in the context of taxi drivers, the electric vehicle grant is very limited in terms of who it is available to. A car has to reach its ten-year expiry date in order for the owner to access this grant, which means that the vast majority of taxi drivers will also be excluded from that grant. At every level, taxi drivers are being denied supports because their cars are their premises and their means of business, even though they have been more adversely affected than many of those who are availing of scheme and who are rightly getting paid. I do not see why the Minister would not extend it to taxi drivers or to musicians, people in event-related areas, the arts and so on. I appeal to him to do so. Some of the support given out to bigger businesses and the willingness of the Government to give this support contrasts sharply with the way it treats PAYE workers, who will now receive tax bills even though the wage subsidy scheme limited the amount by which employers could top up workers' pay to the net amount. The limit the Minister imposed in respect of the wage subsidy scheme means that people have taken a pay cut and that they are going to be taxed subsequently on it. That is completely unfair. Finally, I will say a word on the wealth that dare not speak its name. Oxfam published a report earlier this week which shows that Ireland's billionaires have increased their wealth by €3.3 billion during the pandemic. Rather than exclude people who really need support from schemes, could we not impose a little bit of tax on the billionaires who have done well out of Covid in order to assist some of the workers and sectors which have been absolutely hammered by the public health restrictions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have no particular difficulty with the individual nominations, although I do point to the point made by many people about gardaí investigating gardaí. I would like to see more civilian oversight of gardaí to ensure we genuinely have independence in oversight of the Garda and that it is perceived to be independent. Given the recognition and acknowledgement that we need a new model for oversight of the Garda that genuinely has that credibility, I believe the case of George Nkencho, referred to by a number of Deputies, indicates the need to have an Abbeylara-style, fully independent inquiry. Concerns have been expressed by the family solicitor about the failure to interview the family, even though they have important evidence regarding the shooting. There is a very concerning independent pathologist’s report about George Nkencho receiving two shots in the back of the six shots that killed him on the doorstep of his house, particularly when the family have important evidence to give in terms of what they saw and their belief that the shooting was unnecessary. I also think there are quite striking similarities that need to be acknowledged between this and the Abbeylara case: two young men, both aged 27, with 20 years almost exactly between these two events, and both of whom suffered from mental illness. In both cases, there were attempts to demonise the individuals and downplay the impact of mental illness on the circumstances. Of course, we know that the Barr tribunal eventually found that, really, had things been handled better, the shooting of John Carthy might not have been necessary. It is important we have that kind of independent public investigation into the shooting of George Nkencho, not least because, of course, the far right have, in the most vile way, demonised the family on racist grounds. It is very important for that reason as well that it is seen to be a genuine, independent public inquiry.
