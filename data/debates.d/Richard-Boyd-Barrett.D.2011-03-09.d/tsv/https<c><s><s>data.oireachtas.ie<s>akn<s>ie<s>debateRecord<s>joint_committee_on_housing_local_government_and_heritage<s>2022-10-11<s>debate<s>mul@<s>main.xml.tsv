RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have quite a few questions and, therefore, I hope the witnesses will give brief answers. The local authority of Mr. Curran and Ms Keenan is going to deliver 2,318 new social homes by the end of 2026 but it has 2,458 households currently on the housing waiting list, another 1,768 that are in RAS or HAP tenancies and on waiting lists, and it projected as of July that a further 2,825 will join the list in the next five years. Therefore, on a simple calculation, in 2026 there will be a worse housing crisis in Dún Laoghaire and a bigger waiting list than there is now. How is that an adequate response to the housing crisis there? How many housing applicants have been removed from the housing list because they have exceeded the housing threshold in recent years? Do the witnesses have those figures?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take that point but let us be clear that I am correct. There will be 4,400 households on the list at the end of this plan whereas, according to Mr. Curran, there are currently approximately 3,000 households on it.That is a grim scenario. I do not blame Mr. Curran, but it is just not good enough. We have a flipping disaster in Dún Laoghaire. The suffering it is causing to people is beyond what is acceptable. We have a plan that is going to leave us in a worse position in four years than we are in now. I feel like pulling my hair out when I hear it. This must be called what it is, and this is what the figures are telling us. Let us be clear what we are talking about. I understand the difficulties involved and that this is more than we have done before, but it is a fact that we are going to be in a worse position in four years than we are now. That is going to be the case, unless someone is going to tell me I am missing something in the context of these figures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do not forget, though, that even if we just take those on the list now and put that figure against what the council is planning to build, it will fall short. If you add to that the 2,825 people expected to be added to the list in the next few years, it means we will be in a worse position at the end of this period, with thousands of extra people on the list. Something must be done about this. We have to do more. The Government needs to know this, but we must do more. I presume we do not have an answer as to how many applicants were removed from the housing list between 2018 and 2021.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I request that those figures be provided because we need to know how many people are being removed from the list as a result of the failure to raise the income thresholds. The phrase "we are not actively in the market" was used. I have been urging the Government to go into the market and buy houses, especially in circumstances where people are facing homelessness. The Government has been stating that its policy is shifting on this issue, but the witnesses are telling us that the council is not actively in the market. We need clarity on this. Is there an active policy to purchase houses in light of these shortfalls and the number of people going into homelessness? Specifically, what is happening with the St. Helen's Court complex? There are 15 empty units there and several tenants are still threatened with eviction after several years. Are we going to buy that apartment block?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How many affordable houses are we going to get in Cherrywood and how much will they cost? Do we have any idea of how much the affordable and cost-rental units will cost in Shanganagh when they are constructed? Turning to Kelly's Hotel, which is owned by the council, and which has been empty for about 20 years, what is happening with it? I refer to Kelly's Hotel in George's Place in Dún Laoghaire.
