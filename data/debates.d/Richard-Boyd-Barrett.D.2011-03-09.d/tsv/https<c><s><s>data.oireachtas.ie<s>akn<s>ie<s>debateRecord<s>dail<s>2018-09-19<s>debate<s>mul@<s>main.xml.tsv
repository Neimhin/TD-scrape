RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Most people would welcome more frequent buses on main bus corridors, cycling infrastructure, orbital routes and so on. In many other areas, however, this plan should not be called BusConnects but "BusDisconnects". We have engaged with people in our communities about this. I have a list of the 2,700 submissions we have so far collected from people who are furious, worried, anxious and angry at plans to remove local bus services in a way that will particularly hit the elderly, the less mobile and working-class areas. Route No. 4, which serves Stradbrook and Blackrock, is gone altogether, leaving that area with a replacement bus service that will not go into the city centre and will be half as frequent. Bus services direct into the city from Ballybrack, Loughlinstown and Sallynoggin are gone altogether. People will have to go to Dún Laoghaire and change to another bus there, which still will not go into O'Connell Street but will stop at Merrion. The No. 63 will be replaced by a less frequent service in the Monkstown Farm area, which has already lost the 46A service, which used to go every ten minutes. Dalkey will lose 50% of its bus service because the 111 and the 59 will be replaced by another service that will be half as frequent. In particular, people who need to get to St. Vincent's Hospital will no longer have a direct bus route from a whole number of inland areas such as Sallynoggin, Loughlinstown, Ballybrack and so on. This is why we say this is a Trojan horse for privatisation. What the privatisers want is routes that make a lot of money on a high-frequency basis and to cut the public service routes into areas serving high numbers of pensioners and people with mobility issues. That is not acceptable and will be resisted. There have been huge turnouts at meetings, huge numbers signing petitions saying we want to retain our public bus services. Yes, we should have high-frequency and orbital routes, but they should be additional to existing services. There should be no cuts to existing services. We also need to increase public transport subsidies to the level of the European average if we want to improve our bus services. By the way, let us cut bus fares as well to encourage greater use of our public transport system.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This Bill is apparently technical in nature. I got a call last week asking if I would have a problem with this Bill going through the Dáil without debate. I said I did have a problem with it going through without debate because it deals with two issues that are of considerable importance to the people of this country. One of these issues is the local property tax, a tax which, frankly, is despised by huge numbers of people, which I resolutely oppose, and which is causing very great hardship for huge numbers of our citizens. Although this particular measure just talks about extending the deferral period for people, we need to point out that, in most cases, these people have to defer it because they do not have enough money to pay it. I was just checking the Revenue statistics for this. In discussing the local property tax we need to point out that 96% of the deferrals being sought in respect of the property tax, and for which there is now going be an extension, are sought by people because their incomes are so low that they cannot afford to pay it. This was our point about the property tax when we marched, when we opposed it and when we encouraged a boycott which the Government cleverly got around by handing the tax over to Revenue. The Minister of State should not think for one minute that bringing in the heavy hand of Revenue to collect it from people forcefully makes it okay. It is certainly not okay for people who are clocking up a debt in respect of this property tax, a debt arising from the fact that they do not have enough money to pay it. What is fair about that? That debt is clocking up and it is now going to clock up an extra year. Those who cannot pay it are probably glad that they can defer it for an extra year but the debt is clocking up. These deferrals are for people whose income is less than €15,000. How does anybody survive on €15,000, never mind pay a property tax? It is worth taking the opportunity to say this tax was justified at the time it was introduced on the basis that it would be a sustainable source of income and that it would be a progressive tax. The proposers said that it was a tax on wealth. It is not. It is a tax on the least well off who are then forced to defer it because they cannot pay. To that can be added the fact that 85,000 have it taken forcefully out of their wages by their employers at the behest of Revenue. Why? The Minister of State can be certain that it is because they are low-income workers who cannot afford it. Is Deputy Mick Barry speaking on this? Am I sharing time?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How much time am I supposed to have?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. I did not know Deputy Mick Barry was speaking. I am sorry. It is very important to flag this. It is very strange that it is hidden in a housing building finance initiative Bill. I do not quite know why it cannot go in the Finance Bill. It is a bit odd. The property tax has proven to be unfair and it continues to be unfair. The other great justification for it at the time was that it was going to dampen the property market. That was the big thing. Has it dampened the property market? Not at all. The property market has gone out of control. It has had no impact whatsoever. If the Government wanted a wealth tax that would impact on the property market, it should consider a windfall tax on all the vulture funds, corporate landlords, and the people benefiting from section 110 who are hoarding land and speculating. Why do we not tax them and get rid of this unfair regressive property tax?
