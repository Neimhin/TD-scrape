RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Since 2011 when I was elected to this Dáil I have posed dozens of questions to the Minister and his predecessor about what I believe to be the gross mismanagement that is going on in Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company. I have raised the enormous waste of money on crazy, madcap plans that nobody ever asked for, the latest of which is a plan to mortgage the assets of the harbour to raise €18 million to build a cruise ship berth. There is a complete lack of accountability at Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company. Now that the harbour company is finally going to move under the control of the local authority, I ask the Minister to assure the House that in the forthcoming Bill dealing with this matter, the company will be under direct council control and will no longer be an unaccountable semi-quango, a law unto itself and a company about which we cannot get any answers. Will he assure us that it will be under direct public control?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would strongly urge the latter option for Dún Laoghaire. That is the point I am making. I have heard about these two options for quite some time. The harbour company, with its executive and board, needs to be dissolved. There are enormous savings to be made in executive salaries and expenses, some of which were falsely claimed and never repaid, not to mention the hundreds of thousands of euro that have been wasted on crazy master plans that never came to fruition, that nobody ever asked for and that would have been completely inappropriate. Money has been wasted in all sorts of ways, which I do not have time to enumerate now. The company is leeching money out of the harbour. It has run the harbour into the ground, as evidenced by the loss of the Stena Lines ferry service. Now we have another crazy plan, hatched by a so-called "stakeholder group" to mortgage the assets of Dún Laoghaire harbour to the tune of €18 million to build a giant cruise berth for luxury cruise liners. A planning permission application has been submitted but there is no business plan. The People Before Profit Councillor Melisa Halpin asked to see the business plan but there is none.I can show it to the Minister some time. This is the crazy stuff that is going on. There are no minutes taken by the members of the little cabal that are hatching this plan. We have asked if there are minutes of any of their meetings. They go off on junkets to the United States. There are no minutes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has to be dissolved.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am very serious about this. There is a rebellion taking place in Dún Laoghaire. A public meeting this week was packed. There is overwhelming anger against this plan. Save Our Seafront, a group in which I am involved, is having another meeting tomorrow which, I think, will be absolutely packed. Protests will almost certainly follow because of extraordinary anger at the fact that it is a cabal. What would the Minister call a group of three people who are accountable to nobody, who do not take minutes of meetings, who go off on junkets and who come up with plans that will have a massive effect on the harbour, potentially threatening it with privatisation because it involves mortgaging the assets? They do not take minutes of the meetings and when we ask questions about what they are doing we are told: "We're not giving you the answers." That is what is going on and it is not acceptable. Let us consider the state of the harbour. It has lost Stena. Hundreds of thousands of euro have been lost on master plans that just dissolved into thin air. It is crazy stuff.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the interests of democracy and in the best interests of this important amenity and the Dún Laoghaire area generally, we should dissolve the harbour board and bring it under direct public control where there is real accountability and genuine public input into the plans to develop and protect this harbour as a unique public amenity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Should I take the Minister to a meeting?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is because I am annoyed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the moving of the writ for the by-election in Carlow-Kilkenny. I particularly welcome the fact that the People Before Profit Alliance will have a dynamic candidate, Adrienne Wallace, a recent graduate who is now working in Carlow. She typifies the new generation of people who have come into politics largely as a result of the complete failure of the political establishment and typified by Phil Hogan, the man whose move to Europe has provoked this by-election. It says everything about Irish politics that the primary architect of the fiasco that is Irish water, the man who presided over the greatest political debacle seen in recent times in this State, gets conferred with the premier political reward that any Government can give, namely the most senior position in Europe. It is precisely that which has spurred people like Adrienne Wallace to enter politics and to get involved in the anti-water charges movement. They are sickened by the political establishment and feel compelled to become politically active. Apart from making the election a referendum on water charges and austerity, Adrianne Wallace also wants to highlight the whole question of political accountability, as well as the lack of it, the failure of politicians to keep promises they made and the need to have mechanisms-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not talking about Deputy Ann Phelan. There is a need to have mechanisms to make people accountable and replace them when they fail to honour political promises they made. That is the feeling that drove hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets in recent times, as well as the unprecedented entry into politics of new layers of people demanding political change. As a young woman, Adrienne Wallace is also particularly keen to highlight issues affecting young people such as the cut in social welfare benefits to those under 25 years of age and the provision of youth facilities. She would be a welcome addition to the Dáil. It would be good to see a young woman elected who has come newly into politics, arising out of resistance to austerity and water charges. I hope she does well and we see her here very soon.
