RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 3, to delete line 19 and substitute the following:"In this Act—"Act of 1998" means the Education Act 1998;"Act of 2000" means the Equal Status Act 2000;"The Council" means the National Council of Special Education.".This amendment provides that under this section, we would make reference to the Equal Status Act 2000 as well as the Education Act 1998, which is in the Bill, as put forward by the Government. Everybody knows why I have put forward this amendment to make reference to the Equal Status Act. It is because the Equal Status Act contains the infamous section 7(3)(c), which, incredibly and disgracefully, gives a derogation to religious schools to discriminate. The Equal Status Act is supposed to eliminate discrimination and ensure equality, yet that subsection gives a derogation to schools to discriminate against the children of all people, which is shocking. Amendments related to my amendment have been ruled out of order. I find it extraordinary that an amendment relating to admission to schools has been ruled out of order simply because it relates to another Act. That subsection of the Equal Status Act is the key to facilitating the ongoing discrimination against children in the vast majority of schools. This intolerable provision has to be dealt with. To discriminate against anybody is bad but to discriminate against children is outrageous. A total of 72% of parents believe the law should be amended in order that baptism would no longer be a requirement for school admission, while 24% say they would not have baptised their children if they had not needed to do so to gain entry to schools. It is incredible that people are baptising their children purely to gain admission to schools. More than 90% of schools are Catholic and children who are not of that faith are segregated, excluded, isolated and made feel different because they do not share the dominant faith, yet they do not have the choice in many cases to attend a multi-denominational or a non-denominational school. They are, therefore, forced into this invidious position. Any reasonable person would say this is not acceptable. Whatever reasons successive Governments had for kowtowing to the Catholic Church primarily and allowing them to dominate schools and pursue this discrimination, times have changed. Even people who are of the Catholic faith recognise the inequity and injustice.  As the Minister will be aware, another reason has emerged in the last while; as if the substantial discrimination against kids was not enough, those who run Catholic schools are now sick and tired of the Catholic Church's domination. That has emerged in the recent period because of religious denominations selling off facilities and degrading the quality of schools and their facilities to pay off their debts or whatever else. There is nothing for the Minister to be afraid of anymore because even the people running schools who may have long subscribed to their values and ethos are fed up with the church's domination of schools. There is nothing to fear politically. The discrimination is partially due to the political establishment being in hock to a particular religious viewpoint, but, more recently, it probably has just been caused by political fear of standing up to the Catholic Church because of the consequences that might flow from it. However, there is no need to fear anymore. On a moral, reasonable level, we should remove the baptism barrier under this legislation. Even on a purely pragmatic, expedient, political basis, there is simply no reason to fail to do it anymore. The Government should get on with it and do it. It should even go beyond it and separate church and State completely in the entire education system and other areas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am afraid that is not good enough. Do not get me wrong: people have a right to their religion and if they wish to instruct their children on a particular religious view in their own time, privately or some other way, they are entitled to do so, but the idea that publicly funded schools could discriminate in any shape or form on the basis of religion, or any other basis, is just not acceptable. That is what equality and equal status mean. That is what equal admission to schools means. Equality means no discrimination. It is an unambiguous concept which does not need to be qualified. The reason it is being qualified by the Government in its proposals which represent some improvement is we have outsourced our responsibility in the area of education to religious bodies. Therefore, we are forced into trying to find compromises with them, but we should not have to and I do not accept it. Equality is equality and equal status is equal status. Eliminating discrimination should occur across the board or it is nothing. Therefore, I will press the amendment. With regard to the rest of the Bill, the removal of some of the soft barriers is an improvement. I am not disputing that but to have a Bill about admission to schools that does not deal comprehensively with the issue of ensuring equality of access, on religious grounds, is not acceptable. I forgot to mention in my introduction that I also have an amendment on the issue of special needs, special needs units and the obligations of schools in that regard, but it, too, has been ruled out of order. That just does not make sense to me. What I am describing are barriers to admission. Barriers that are discriminatory or create a playing field that is not level are not acceptable. Therefore, I will press the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is welcome.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support this amendment. We should perhaps have philosophy classes instead. The idea there would be instruction in a particular religious denomination or viewpoint during school time inevitably creates a discriminatory atmosphere for, as well as isolation and segregation of, those who might not share the school’s religious view or have no religious view. It is wrong. It is not the job of the State to finance that. I would fight to the death for somebody's right to freedom of religious expression. However, it is not our job to allow public moneys or the law to uphold a situation where particular religious views are pushed in school at young people. We are long past the time when that should continue to be the case. That is not to say there should not be a general discussion about religious, philosophical or humanist ideas. There should be but not specific religious education and instruction of a particular viewpoint.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Children are sensitive and vulnerable. Making them feel different by pulling them out of a class is tantamount to abuse. There is no other way to put it. If a child is taken out and treated differently from the rest, separated from his or her peers and put wherever else, without guidelines being provided as to how that should be done, it is a form of abuse. Without guidelines, it is left open to being even worse. I hope and believe most of the staff and principals in schools are very decent and compassionate to all children. If we are honest, however, when a particular ethos is at play and prioritised and this behaviour is considered acceptable, it can be the case that the child who does not fit in is looked down on, frowned upon or seen as lesser. The system is open to that potential possibility which no doubt has manifested itself in children who have opted out being singled out. Whatever way one cuts it, I cannot see how it is not totally unfair to sensitive, vulnerable young children and how it will not have a significant effect on them. Anyone who has children knows how sensitive they are. They ask questions about obvious contradictions and conflicts in the treatment of one person or thing against another. It hits children really hard in how they look at and feel about the world and their place in it. It is just wrong. I again note, to quote from the survey of these matters commissioned by EQUATE, that 71% of parents agree that we should introduce a subject in school on all religions and ethical systems, while 18% neither agree nor disagree and only 12% disagree. Only 12% believe we should hold on to the idea that a particular ethos should prevail and that, as a consequence, those who do not subscribe to it should be separated. Most see the sense in it. We know that a majority in the country have some religious views.People with religious views understand that this has to change. Any fair and reasonable person would say that is the case. Let us not be behind the curve of where people in Irish society are at now and the intelligence and sensitivity they are displaying, instead of upholding what is the fundamentally and unfair and potentially abusive treatment of children who are the minority and are stigmatised, isolated and separated in this way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we dealing with amendment No. 11?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just so I understand, this is to say that it is okay for a school to give preference to Traveller children? Is that the logic behind it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand the logic behind the Government's amendment, but I also see the legitimacy of the concerns expressed about behavioural disorders and the failure to acknowledge or recognise them. I am curious to know why the Minister believes the amendment is necessary.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps the Minister might allow me to finish. I find it a bit odd that he has been prompted to do this. It suggests children with mainstream needs are clamouring to get into special units for children within specific categories of special need, which I find a little hard to comprehend. What prompted the Minister to introduce the amendment? Is there a major issue-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not finished.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am curious to know what prompted the Minister to introduce the amendment. It is the case that all legislation is open to all sorts of interpretation. It is not possible to frame legislation that would address all possible bizarre interpretations, but the Minister must have concrete evidence of the experience of parents in trying to get children with mainstream needs into special units such that he was prompted to introduce the amendment? I do not see the point of it unless it is a phenomenon. Is it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where is that stated in the Bill?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where is it again? I cannot quite see it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Page 7.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is exactly what I was coming to.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a bit of a problem. How do we define what is maintaining the ethos of a school, or how does a school make the case it is necessary to discriminate to protect the ethos of the school? It is not clear to me whether it is clear in the legislation. I do not think it is from reading it. If a school is undersubscribed it is clearly and explicitly prohibited from discriminating. A school could say in a particular year that it has only ten Catholics because there are a lot of Muslim people and non-religious people so to maintain the proportion, as it would see it, of Catholic students it would start refusing people even though the school is not oversubscribed. It seems this would be allowed because the section does not explicitly state that if a school is not fully subscribed section 61(2)(b) does not apply. The Bill does not say that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 15:In page 6, to delete lines 13 to 21.Amendment No. 15 has not been ruled out of order, so I will move on to the substantial issue in a moment. I am making another point to the Minister which he has not really satisfactorily answered, namely, even from its own point of view and its stated objectives, the legislation is defective. The Minister stated that discrimination on religious grounds-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not at all. I just said I am not going to do that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was being totally specific. You have just allowed another member to talk about a totally different amendment. I just said I am not going to talk about amendment No. 15 because we will be talking about it in a minute. I am talking about the amendment-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are not on amendment No. 15. We are on amendment No. 14.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are not-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My apologies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Then I will talk on amendment No. 15, although I had been dealing with amendment No. 14. My initial comments were about amendment No. 14 before I moved on to amendment No. 15.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have not got an answer from the Minister on the point about the defectiveness of the legislation itself, on its own terms. Setting aside amendment No. 15, which I will come to in a moment, the legislation is not clear in its execution of its own intent. That is the very specific point I am making. That is what we are dealing with. The Minister stated that the legislation would not allow for discrimination on religious grounds where there was not oversubscription. I do not believe there should be any discrimination and I will come onto that point shortly. However, even if that is the Minister's intent, the legislation does not make it clear. It leaves the door open for discrimination in cases where there is not oversubscription because it does not spell it out clearly. I think the drafters need to look at it because it leaves this open. On amendment No. 15, which I did not realise we had moved on to, this is where I disagree with Deputy Burton. The Labour Party approach to this is a fudge between allowing some discrimination to continue but minimising it somewhat with the issue of catchment. However, there is the problem of how to define a catchment. As Deputy Burton rightly pointed out, one can expand the concept of catchment to anywhere so how is catchment to be defined? It is problematic to define it in any sort of meaningful or legal way. Therefore, I think the only way to deal with the issue is to delete the offending discrimination which is contained in section 61(2)(b), which echoes the wording of the infamous section 7(3)(c). It is worth stating the irrationality of the wording of section 61(2)(b), which reads: "a statement that the school does not discriminate in relation to the admission of students where it admits persons of a particular religious denomination in preference to others or it refuses to admit". What the legislation is saying is that it is not discrimination to discriminate. It is just bonkers. It is so Irish, it is unbelievable. It is not discrimination to prefer one group over another on a religious basis. That is the definition of discrimination. Nowhere else could do this, except some sort of tin-pot dictatorship. It is Orwellian wording - freedom is slavery; war is peace; discrimination is not discrimination. That is what we are proposing to put into law.It is already in the Equal Status Act and now we are going to repeat it in the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2016, which purports to be reforming the problems in equal admission to school but is actually restating an Orwellian form of discrimination and trying to claim it is not discrimination or is somehow acceptable. It is totally wrong. I restate that it is unnecessary to do this, never mind that it is actually wrong to do this to children of all people. I have made that point already, but who is the Minister doing this for? I presume he has read the survey of Equate, which is campaigning on this issue. The survey, which was done scientifically by a proper surveying organisation, shows that 71% or an overwhelming majority of parents, whether religious, non-religious or of minority religions, state the law should be changed so that baptism can no longer be a requirement for school admission in State-funded schools. Another 12% state that they do not care. Only 16% want to retain the status quo that the Minister is retaining. In this legislation, the Minister is pandering to 16% over the vast majority. Why is he doing this? I do not understand it. The Minister has continued to refer to constitutional issues. I really want to get to the bottom of this, and I should have asked earlier, but at one point the Taoiseach and the Minister claimed the Government had legal advice about the constitutional difficulties involved in removing this discriminatory element of the law. I have asked repeatedly if we can see the legal advice the Government received, but we have never seen it. I do not believe the Minister has legal advice. That was spoof from the Taoiseach. In my opinion, it was "the man with two pints" talk. We have heard it only as a spurious justification for maintaining an utterly discriminatory law directed disgracefully against children. Could the Minister answer that point? How can he justify it? Why does he feel the need to do it when he is pandering to a tiny minority of the population? Where is the famous legal advice about the constitutional problem that might be involved in removing this discrimination from the legislation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a different point and, to be honest, a more legitimate debate. I refer to the difficulty of one-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a more legitimate debate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My view is that there is a real debate to be had on the extreme difficulty posed if two children and their mother or father or both must go to two schools at the same time because they could not both be enrolled in the same one. One can understand the very practical case for having two siblings attend the same school to make transport relatively easy and in order that parents do not have to endure the extreme trial of having to bring children to two schools at the same time of the morning which might be physically impossible in some cases, but that is totally different from retaining a 25% quota within a school for pupils whose parents or grandparents happened to go to it. There is no practical, logistical imperative in that regard. The measure is about maintaining some intergenerational family clique within a school. I imagine the practice is restricted almost entirely to fairly elite private schools.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but I am not afraid to lose votes if I believe something is right. The Deputy is absolutely right that I will get flak in my constituency over this, but sometimes one has to say something is right, regardless of whether one will get a bit of flak.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not see the case in rural areas. I totally understand the case to be made for having siblings attend the same school in rural or urban areas. I understand the difficulty even more in rural areas. Having to bring children to two villages or towns could be a real hassle. It is not necessary, however, for somebody in a rural or an urban area to go to the same school as his or her father, grandfather or grandmother. Why is that necessary? Why would one allow discrimination on that basis? If somebody can make a case for it, I will be interested in hearing it, but I do not really see how one could possibly justify it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 37:In page 7, line 22, to delete "or".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not want to elaborate the debate we have already had but is this not a terribly topsy turvy way to do things? We are writing legislation which we know we will have to change all the way through on one of the most substantive issues it develops. Would it not have made sense to run these things together?
