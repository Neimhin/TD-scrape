RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Ceann Comhairle knows I understand.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a serious issue and the Tánaiste knows it.  People are reeling with shock; lone parents, low income families and the elderly are reeling from the attacks meted out in this Bill.  The very least they deserve is that the full implications of the attacks on their living standings are explained, particularly the Government's commitment to labour activation measures designed to get people back to work, when it is absolutely clear that, particularly for lone parents, these measures are a direct disincentive to work.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They will drive lone parents out of work and back into poverty.These serious implications deserve to be discussed in detail and not rammed through in this way by a Government that promised a new type of politics and a new type of openness and transparency.  These austerity measures are being rammed through in an unfair and undemocratic way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There will be 1,000 people outside the gates of Dáil Éireann appealing for a proper debate and a reversal of these cuts.  Will the Tánaiste at least allow for a proper discussion?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is nonsense.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not for lone parents.  The money is being taken from lone parents.An Ceann Comhairle: The Deputy had his say.  Will he stay quiet for a moment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Tánaiste should read the expenditure cuts outlined by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  He has obviously not read them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, given the limited time available to deal with Committee and Report Stages, will the Ceann Comhairle set out how we can cover as many amendments as possible?  Perhaps we might group them in some way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Other Members might have better ideas, but I was going to suggest——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a one-by-one basis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will never get through them all.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could we take them in groups of five?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wholeheartedly agree with the Deputy.  This measure should be called the social destruction Bill, not the Social Welfare Bill.  This legislation will hit people on social welfare through the reduction in qualified child increase.  It will also hit the eligibility of pensioners to receive contributory pensions.  It will hit widowers, child benefit and the one-parent family income disregard.  This will force single parents back into poverty.  The Bill should be described as a poverty creation measure as a counterpoint to all of the commitments made by the Government to provide for labour activation measures.  It is hitting the concurrent payment which will also hit lone parents.  In what sense, therefore, can the Minister for Social Protection talk about this being a social welfare Bill when all it will do is increase poverty levels?  It will increase the level of child poverty, as well as hitting lone parents and the elderly.  It will make things worse for some of the most vulnerable sections of society.  The Minister simply cannot stand over the Title of the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister should see if the people outside welcome them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is deflecting from the issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why did she not load on PRSI for high income earners instead of hitting pensioners and lone parents?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deal with the concerns of the people outside.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister think the people outside give a damn about what she says?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a common theme to many of the Minister's cuts.  What these cuts will do is attack people and families trying to make their way forward, who want to work and contribute to society and get out of poverty.  These cuts will act as a disincentive to work and will hit people at the margin of a certain level of earnings.  This is wrong.  The suggested threshold is €400.  If the other spouse is on social welfare and they have two or three children, the hit will be €60 or €90 a month if they happen to be just above the threshold.  An amount of €600 is not a lot for a family with children.  Therefore, the Minister is hitting people at the low end, people who are trying to work and contribute, and is taking a significant chunk from them.  That is the difference between poverty and some sort of living standard for people who are working and trying to contribute to society.  This is wrong.  It hits the people who should not be hit and the Minister should withdraw it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has said that three times.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The fact that Fianna Fáil sold out the country to the troika, bankrupted it and did equally disgusting things in the last budget does not in any way justify the Government's actions in continuing the same policies.  We will not reach and properly scrutinise other sections of the Bill because the Government is ramming the legislation through.  This is the most important Bill the Government has introduced since it took office because it is tangible, concrete and will affect huge numbers of ordinary families, yet it is being rammed through.  We spent days talking about stuff which, frankly, was of marginal importance to the majority of people, yet when it comes to something which matters to tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of low and middle income families, lone parents, the elderly and children, legislation is rammed through and we are not given a chance to discuss it.  The income disregard, the qualified child increase and the transitional payment will hit people struggling out of poverty traps if they exceed certain earnings.  Is there an easier and fairer way to do this that would address the question of high income earners?  The Minister for Finance could do it.  If the Government taxed incomes of more than €100,000 at a higher level it would not need to hit struggling families.  The Minister for Social Protection could have done something via this Bill.  Why not increase PRSI on earnings of more than €100,000?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister should increase it further instead of hitting people at the bottom.  We would not have these anomalies then.  However, the Government has resolutely refused to impose higher taxes on those who can afford them.  If people at the bottom are hit, it will create more poverty and cost society more.  It will not just cost the Labour Party many seats at the next election, or cause people anger and anguish.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Many people will no longer qualify for the contributory pension.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister said in one of her last comments that she was not touching pensions, contributory or non-contributory, but section 5 suggests the opposite, that now people must work not five years, but ten years to contribute.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will support it and I want to move on to other matters.  The difficulty is that the Minister has the advantage on us because we want to scrutinise this and the Minister again has not given us time to look at it.  I hope she is right and I will support it if it is a measure to maintain pensions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what we are supposed to do now, on Committee Stage of the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish we had enough time to debate this properly.  This means people must work much longer in this category to qualify for the contributory pension.  If they do not have sufficient years paid in contributions, they must rely on the State non-contributory pension, a lesser pension that is means tested.  That is an attack on a particular group and the pension entitlements they might have reasonably hoped to have.  Was it not one of the justifications for not inflicting far more deserved cuts in the pensions of politicians and Ministers and former taoisigh, who walked off with massive pensions of €145,000, that we had to be careful because they had a reasonable expectation they would have these pensions while they were working?  Would this category of people not have a reasonable expectation that they would qualify for the contributory pension, which is a better pension that is not means tested?  It is another nasty cut at a group who should not be cut.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Part-time workers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, it has not been withdrawn.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Cheann Comhairle——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When one considers this measure and the other measures, namely, the concurrent payment and the income disregard, all of which are directed at lone parents that might be trying to return or that have returned to the workplace and when one also takes into account the community employment cuts, it is difficult to believe the Minister has not resorted to specifically targeting——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hold on.  Is the Minister——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——specifically targeting single mothers?  Can the Minister respond and——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——explain how she can honestly claim——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——she wishes to encourage lone parents to return to work when she is removing precisely those supports that allow them to so do?
