RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are many issues arising from the recent controversy surrounding INM, including the lobbying of the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Denis Naughten, and the data breach involving journalists' and barristers' emails. Another issue which to my mind is the most important is the lack of media plurality in this country.The hallmark of any meaningful democracy is genuine freedom of the press and media and that it is not dominated by one or a small number of individuals. In this country, however, Mr. Denis O'Brien - one of the richest men in this country - dominates or outright owns the Irish Independent, the Sunday Independent, the Sunday World, the Evening Herald, 50% of the Daily Star, a host of local newspapers, Today FM, Newstalk, Dublin's 98FM, Spin 103, Spin Southwest and we can carry on through the list. This is outrageous. It is particularly so in the light of the allegations made. I was reading back over emails from Mr. Gavin O'Reilly back in 2010 where he was rebutting requests from Mr. Leslie Buckley, Mr. Denis O'Brien's representative on the board. He was asking that Mr. Sam Smyth be moved off his coverage of the Tribunal of Inquiry into certain Payments to Politicians and Related Matters. That was direct interference in the freedom of journalists to write. Mr. Smyth subsequently lost his job. To add to that, Mr. O'Brien is a tax refugee. Then the Taoiseach has private meetings with this guy in Davos. It is extraordinary. Is the Taoiseach concerned about the monopoly of one individual over the Irish media and does he have any desire to do, or intention of doing, anything about that? The Taoiseach says it is the BAI and it is this, that and the other. In the end, as he said, it is the Government, the Cabinet or the Minister. It is a political decision. Are we going to do something about this? If we are not, we cannot talk in a meaningful way about press freedom, plurality and diversity in this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked the Taoiseach yesterday whether he and the European Union should condemn the shooting of what is now a total of 44 unarmed Palestinian protesters in Gaza in recent weeks by the Israeli forces. I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach condemned it, but really what I want to ask in the context of Europe, Donald Tusk and our role in Europe generally is whether we can move beyond the Taoiseach individually or this Parliament condemning what is going on to something actually being done about it by Europe. Europe is not some external observer to what is going on in Gaza. We give Israel favoured trade status. Israel is effectively an associate member of the European Union.A great deal of European money goes into the West Bank and Gaza and, in many cases, the products of that funding get blown to pieces or demolished by the Israelis and then we have Israel flagrantly breaking international law, killing unarmed civilians at present and they will continue to do so for the next two weeks and Europe will do nothing. Could the Taoiseach speak up about this? When he meets Donald Tusk and is engaging at the European Council could he appeal to Europe to do something about this, to put some pressure on Israel to stop killing innocent people, to stop breaking international law week in, week out and to demand that some sanctions be imposed? In any other circumstances sanctions would be imposed on people when a state kills innocent people, breaks international law or illegally occupies a territory. We would say something should be done about that but, for some reason with Israel, Europe does nothing. It just stands by and allows it to happen. Could we be a bit more forceful in demanding that Europe shows some ethical principle in terms of what Israel is doing to the Palestinians?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to raise a brief point of order on this question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I submitted the exact same question, word for word, as Deputy Martin, which appeared on the Question Paper, and it was refused by the Taoiseach's Department. I contacted the Ceann Comhairle's office which told me it was the Taoiseach's Department that would not allow exactly the same question with exactly the same wording on the paper, and there was back and forth communication on that. A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, it is unacceptable that you would allow one question but not allow the same question from another group in the Parliament.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is absolutely unacceptable. The rules are the rules, and they apply to one and all.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is bizarre.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just saying it is bizarre.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have been canvassing for the past four or five weeks and one learns much about what people are saying and thinking on both sides in the course of canvassing. Whatever side people are on, they are overwhelmingly shocked by how vile the imagery is. They are really upset by and very angry about it. I take some consolation from the fact that many who were considering voting "No" will now vote "Yes" because they are appalled by this stuff. Nonetheless, the vile, offensive and traumatising nature of some of the imagery is below any standard of decency, both for women who have been through abortions and people in general, and particularly for children who are sensitive about such matters. Children are asking their parents, "What is that?" It is disgusting and some measures must be taken to deal with it. A point I do not know whether the Taoiseach is prohibited from making given his original answer but which I want to make to those campaigning for a "Yes" vote that arises from my experience of canvassing was borne out in the findings of a poll that came out at the weekend. The findings of the IPSOS poll were much publicised. They indicated that 47% of people would vote "Yes" but strangely what was less publicised was the answer to another question about the percentage of people who believed the law should be changed to allow women to choose to have an abortion, if they wished to do so. The Taoiseach may be aware the figure was 62%, which is strange. A total of 47% said they would vote "Yes", while 62% believed women should have the right to choose. That suggests we need to up our game in explaining what is at stake because when one calls to a door, people ask, "Yes to what? Repeal what?" People are not clued in to political debates. When one explains the position, many say that personally they are not sure about abortion but that they think people should be allowed make their own decisions. We need to get that simple, factual explanation of what those campaigning for a "Yes" vote are campaigning for to many of the "don't knows" who are a little confused.
