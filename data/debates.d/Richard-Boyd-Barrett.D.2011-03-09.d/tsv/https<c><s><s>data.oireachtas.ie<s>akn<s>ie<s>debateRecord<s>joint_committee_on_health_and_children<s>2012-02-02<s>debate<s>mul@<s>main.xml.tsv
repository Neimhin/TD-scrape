RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have only gained the knowledge of the existence of the Irish Advocacy Network in very recent times but the idea of peer advocacy for mental health patients is excellent.  Pursuing the objectives that have been outlined and which feature in the brochure provided is of vital importance.  It is indicative of the fact that we have moved a long way from the terrible stigma that surrounded mental health in the past.  I look forward to the day when this stigma has been completely eliminated.  I wish the Irish Advocacy Network the best of luck in its work.  I am sure it is a little difficult for members of the network to come before the joint committee to face a grilling.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was referring to how the witnesses may perceive their appearance before us.  I am trying to set their minds at ease by indicating that this meeting is not an interrogation.A number of issues have arisen which deserve attention and I hope we will all benefit from examining them.  We often learn and move forward when crises occur.  In terms of how the Irish Advocacy Network perceives its role, it was my understanding from the earlier discussion that it perceives this role to be one of representing individuals and it places great emphasis on the confidentiality surrounding the individual circumstances of mental health patients.  It advocates and assists patients to advocate with medical professionals and the authorities, if one likes, involved in this area.  While this is clearly a valuable role, does the network agree that the recent case exposed the fact that there are different levels of advocacy?Apart from individual advocacy and representation with a strong emphasis on the desire of the individual for confidentiality, the other layer of advocacy relates to collective concerns.  In the case in question, this involved patients in a particular facility being faced with a particular set of circumstances with which they were not satisfied.  I cannot speak for the patients in question as I do not know their exact circumstances.  However, is it not the case that confidentiality may not have been the biggest issue, if it was an issue, for these patients?  Was it not the case that to advocate on their behalf, something more akin to the way in which a trade union operates was required, in other words, collective advocate on their behalf was needed?  Does the Irish Advocacy Network agree that confidentiality is not always the highest priority and that in some cases publicity is necessary to exert pressure in the interests of patients?  How does the network respond to that view?The Irish Advocacy Network presents itself as being independent and I have no doubt it wishes to be independent.  However, I cannot escape the idea that a conflict of interest arises if the network is being funded by the organisation which, while it may not be advocating against it-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, I would like to have the answer to the Chairman's question elaborated.  To use the trade union analogy, nobody would take seriously a trade union that was funded by employers.  They would certainly see a major conflict of interest.  This is not the fault of the Irish Advocacy Network.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not make that suggestion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My point is that while I do not doubt the Irish Advocacy Network's bona fides for one minute, in objective terms its funding position creates a conflict of interest.  Does Ms Nolan agree with that analysis?  Does the recent case not give rise to a requirement for the network's funding to come from an independent source?On the change in the models of training that surrounded the case in question, the individual involved was removed from the wards the day after the issue became public and was not returned to the wards.  That is a pretty worrying development, although it may have been a coincidence.  Will Ms Nolan confirm it was a coincidence?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Chairman, may I-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ms Nolan has not mentioned any names.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The representatives said the question of being public about the issues facing mental health patients is simply never considered.  I can understand why most of the time it is not considered.  Are the representatives saying there are no circumstances in which advocating effectively on behalf of mental health patients would not require it to say publicly that something is bad for them, for example, a ward closure?  If that is not the role of the Irish Advocacy Network does it agree that somebody must play that role?I have one other one line question.  Are the two trainees back on the payroll?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It worked in this case.
