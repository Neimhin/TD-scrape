RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will ask some quick-fire questions on facts before I get into the main question.  It was said that 20% of the 174,000 mortgages are in arrears.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How many residential mortgages are there?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How many of the 174,000 mortgages are residential?  Is it 20% of the 174,000 mortgages that are in arrears?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How many of those are residential?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we saying that 20% of 85,000 are in arrears?  A fifth of 85,000 is approximately 17,000, which implies that number is in arrears.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How much of that is residential?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is probably about half.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am trying to find out what it costs.  Someone said they were not interested in a blanket write-down, but we are.  People rightly say the State should demand a write-down of the unsustainable debts that are on the back of the State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that for residential mortgages?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What we are proposing is to write down to current market values the residential mortgages.  Approximately how much would that cost?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are interested in keeping roofs over people’s heads.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is probably approximately €3 billion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.  Perhaps it is between €3 billion and €4 billion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is my time to ask questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point is that all and sundry are saying that the State would like to write down its debts to sustainable levels in order that the economy can recover when it comes to debts.  We apply the same principle to residential mortgages.  That would be the easiest way to sort this out.  The bank has been provisioned to do that.  This gets to the heart of the question of whose interests the public interest directors are serving.  That is what the public want for national debt and mortgage debt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Exactly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, if Mr. MacSharry does not mind, I heard him say those things already.  That is not clear at all to me.  The 2010 Act states that the public interest duty imposed on directors takes priority over any other directorial duty.  That is clear.  They have a mandate to vindicate the public interest over any other duty.  If the public had any opportunity to instruct them as to what representing their interests would amount to, they would say that they should write down unsustainable mortgages to sustainable levels and that they should do it now because it is not their fault.Why would we not do that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So we have hundreds of people wading through, trying to figure out on a case-by-case basis what is sustainable and what the bank considers acceptable.  Enormous resources are being wasted on that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let me put it another way because I have two minutes left.  Is not everybody who took out a mortgage, more or less from 2000 to 2008 - or who lost their job as a result of the crash, and who consequently cannot pay their mortgage - an innocent victim of a crisis caused by other people in the banking system?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To my mind, surely there is no moral hazard in giving them relief.  It is in the public interest both in terms of the economy and for them as members of the public, that they get relief which should require debt write-down.  The moral hazard for most of the public is that the banks who caused the crisis are the ones who get bailed out across the board.  All the banks get bailed out but the mortgage holders, who are the innocent victims, do not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is because most people are not scammers like, arguably, the bankers and speculators were.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but would it not-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They would.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is very simple.  If we identify the bubble period - and it is not hard to identify it, between about 2002 and 2008 - that group of people, whether or not they are in mortgage distress now, or whether they are in negative equity - which is also a form of distress, although not as bad as being in arrears - are unique.  They are in trouble through no fault of their own.  We could quantify how much would be required to write-down their debts to sustainable levels, so they can start to pay and be treated as normal customers from that point.  Would that not be a reasonable position to take?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It seems to me that there is no way out of this mess if we carry on because you guys have a veto.  Mr. MacSharry has said he will continue to act primarily in the interests of the company.  On a number of occasions, he has stated that he finds himself bound by company law.  There is clearly a conflict between his loyalty or requirement to serve the best interests of the company as against the interests of those mortgage holders we are talking about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When Mr. MacSharry says that 20% of the bank's residential mortgages are in trouble, would it not be fair to say that a lot of those people, if not most, have lost their jobs?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In most cases, they are in arrears because they have lost their jobs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is Mr. MacSharry telling us that if a person has lost their job they are also going to lose their house?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Nothing Mr. MacSharry has told us gives us any reason to believe other than the fact that if a person has lost their job they will lose their house.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a fair point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Every member of the joint committee has expressed a frustration which represents the public view on mortgage relief and, though we did not go into it, lending to SMEs.  We have invested a great deal in the banks and the public is getting very little in return.  I ask the witnesses to disregard their current roles and to tell us objectively who is responsible for bringing about the change required to give us more influence over the banks we bailed out to effect greater lending and the writing down of mortgages to sustainable levels.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the Minister tell Permanent TSB to write down the debt to sustainable levels?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Nobody is responsible.
