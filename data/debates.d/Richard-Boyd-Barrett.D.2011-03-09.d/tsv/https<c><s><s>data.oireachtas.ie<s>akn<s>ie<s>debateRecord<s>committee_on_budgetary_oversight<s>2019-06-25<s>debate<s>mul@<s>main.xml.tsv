RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. McCarthy and Dr. Kinsella for their interesting contributions. Notwithstanding the dangers and threats they have outlined, do they believe there are certain problems that must be addressed and that they will cost money? If the Government works within the discretionary fiscal space it is talking about, the amount available is not enough to deal with those problems. I do not need to list them as we know what they are. They are issues in the areas of housing, childcare, primary care, water infrastructure, public transport and I can go down through the list. There are many demands or urgent necessities in which we must invest, yet we have only a small fiscal space available. The witnesses seem to be pointing in that direction, namely, that we must find extra sources of revenue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, that is fine.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The witnesses referred to stable sources of revenue. That was the basis of my first question. I take their point about volatile corporation tax heads and so on. Could they give examples of the more stable sources of revenue? The ones to which I would point include employers' PRSI, which is very low.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will agree to disagree on that one. What would Mr. McCarthy say about financial transactions taxes and wealth taxes? He pointed to this when referencing the opening up of loopholes. Our committee has started to examine this. Generally, a great deal of discussion focuses on what will be spent in current and capital expenditure but much less attention is given to tax reliefs, credits and allowances. We are starting to examine those and there is major scope in that regard. We should be as forensically focused on those tax reliefs and allowances as we are on budgetary expenditures, on which there is a great deal of focus.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In that case can I ask one further question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the likely impact of Brexit being somewhat negative or the possibilities of the downside risks that threaten us, the Government must respond by radically diversifying our economy away from being over-dependent on a few sectors. That is our best medium to long-term insulation against some of these vulnerabilities we have. Dr. Kinsella mentioned the agrifood sector and said we should design supports. There is a good case for that but, on the other hand, one might argue in the context of climate change that we need to scale down parts the agrifood sector and rather than bailing those sectors out, we should think about how we can get a just transition for the people working in those sectors into more sustainable, diverse forms of agriculture.
