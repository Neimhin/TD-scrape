RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for coming in. Sorry for the delays caused by the voting in the House. I will start with the final point that Mr. Lowe made, namely, that he would like us to consider increasing the cap relating to the level of investment that the State is willing to put into films. I would be happy to agitate for increased investment. In general, I am in favour of us spending more on arts, cultural endeavours and film. I do not think we spend enough. I am sure Mr. Lowe is aware that my enthusiasm for arguing for those things would be considerably blunted by my concerns about the extent to which the film producer companies, such as Element Pictures, which are in receipt of section 481 tax credits are complying with the requirement for quality employment and training as set out in the legislation and required under EU state aid rules. Those rules are clear that there is a requirement to meet an industry development test and a cultural test. Part of that industry development test is having quality employment and training. The EU directive is even more specific. I will paraphrase it. It is about creating a permanent pool of skills and uses that type of phrasing. My concern is that the section 481 tax credit is not doing this at all. Instead, as Mr. Lowe stated, the people in the industry work freelance as opposed to having permanent jobs. The industry operates project to project. Very few, if any, people have any kind of security regarding their place in it. For some reason that I do not understand, the producer companies insist that they do not want to give any rights to employees to have a legitimate expectation from one production to another that they will be employed in the future. I do not see why the producer companies want to insist on that position. I do not see how it is beneficial to the creation and growth of an industry. Surely developing and nurturing a crew and giving them security would be good for the industry? It would be good for attracting more investment and would be better at every level for the cohesion, skill and expertise of the industry if people were given security from production to production. Instead, it seems that producer companies, including the witnesses' company, insist trenchantly that they do not even have an employment relationship with the people who work with them again and again. The witnesses can tell me if I am wrong, but my understanding is that this is precisely what is going on. Some crew members would have worked on multiple productions that Mr. Lowe named, one after the other, going back to when Element Pictures was set up in 2001. Those people would argue, and I would agree with them, that they have those rights under the legislation for fixed-term workers, which Mr. Lowe referred to, and under the European Union directive. However, the producer companies want to insist that they do not have any employees who are entitled to such contracts of indefinite duration. I stress that nobody is suggesting that that means companies would employ people permanently, full-time, for 365 days. Nobody is arguing that, but they would have a legitimate expectation and right, having worked on "Ripper Street" seasons 1 to 4, to be re-employed and notified that the company is making a film when Element Pictures next makes a film. The company would tell them that they have worked on its last few films and it is now letting them know that a job is available for them on the next film. Instead, Element Pictures insists it has no obligation to them. I will not go into individual cases but, in general, when employees take cases to the Labour Court or WRC, the response of the film producer companies is to deny any employment relationship whatsoever with these people, even though they know them. The companies know that people worked on the films or television series, but they say they do not have an employment relationship with those people, just that those people have an employment relationship with a DAC that no longer exists. I want to understand why companies want to do that.I put it to Mr. Lowe that this is in breach of the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003, the purpose of which is to prevent the abuse of successive fixed-term contracts. The point of the legislation is that one cannot keep employing the same people repeatedly on fixed-term contracts but if one keeps employing them repeatedly, one starts to have an obligation to them as an employer. Why would Mr. Lowe not want to do that?  I was not aware that the section 481 guidelines state that the producer company, not the DAC, is allowed charge the cost of full-time employees to the DAC. They are allowed do it, and it specifically uses the phrase "film crew". I presume Element Pictures charges for some of its administrative employees to the DAC and section 481 pays for that, yet Element Pictures does not want to do it for film crew even though they are explicitly mentioned in the section 481 guidelines as persons whom it could charge to section 481 under the DAC. Element Pictures could charge and have them as employees. That is quite a long question but Mr. Lowe will get the point. I would appreciate an answer. I want to ask about the intellectual property end of it. Maybe I should do this separately or do them altogether.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Then there are the actors and performers. Their creative work is one of factors that is valuable in films from a commercial and financial point of view. It is fair to say that the way films potentially make any money is through the royalties or flow from the distribution and the performance of those films or television series, or their repeated downloading on Netflix or whatever. It is not at the time the DAC is set up for the production that money is made. The money is made on the basis of these being shown repeatedly. While the DAC is set up, the producer companies are insisting that the actors and performers assign their rights to the intellectual property to the DAC and that their rights to future royalties or residuals are bought out from them in a contract that is significantly inferior in this regard to the pact equity agreement that operates in the UK. Indeed, the inequality in this regard is even more stark when one finds that some people are put on the pact equity agreement but others are not, or that if Element Pictures or any other company is operating in the UK, for example, it has to honour the pact equity agreement and the performers get the benefits of a better deal in respect of their intellectual property and the residuals that would flow to it, but many of them, when they work in Ireland, face an insistence on these grossly inferior buy-out contracts and sign away their rights. Why would we do that to our performers and, indeed, where do those rights then go? While, as the producer companies insist, the employment relationship between film producers and crew does not survive the DAC, to use the parlance, they also seem to have it both ways because the benefit of the intellectual property rights survives the DAC. It goes somewhere. Where does it go when the DAC is wound up? For example, why, when the DAC is wound up, do the intellectual property rights not go back to the performers? Where do they go? Do they go to the producer company? Do they go to an international company? Did the people who signed them over to the DAC agree to sign them to an international company which they are required to do? Why, indeed, are they being asked to sign these buy-out contracts when the copyright directive insists that buy-out contracts should be the exception and not the rule? In Ireland, they seem to be the rule and not the exception.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise for the length of it, by the way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I just-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On that point, in cases heard before the Labour Court, Element Pictures has said that no employment relationship with it can exist because the relationship is with the DAC. Screen Producers Ireland has made the same point. I have seen transcripts in which the companies have said that. They have said that the relationship was with the DAC. I will point out that all of the employment legislation, including the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003, the Redundancy Payments Act 1967 and others, makes clear that companies that are associated with each other are to be treated as the same company. Mr. Lowe is surely not disputing that the DAC he sets up for any given film is a subsidiary of Element Pictures because, legally speaking, it is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	From an employment rights' point of view, there is no difference.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was hoping to.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was hoping to add on a bit more around the questions. What is the vote on?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a bit unfair on the witnesses but I would not mind. Will the Chair be going over to vote?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the witnesses hang on for ten minutes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The PACT-Equity agreement and intellectual property rights are contentious. The simple contention is that the PACT-Equity agreement is far superior. That is what workers want. I think our guests know that is what they want. Why not just give it to them? As simply as that, I ask the question. Why not just give it to them? It is a better deal and I do not understand why our guests would resist it. On the point about film crews, it may be okay for some people to be freelance. That might be true for the heads of department that Mr. Lowe has described. It might be okay to be freelance for certain creative people. I put it to our guests that they are reflecting the viewpoint of a particular layer of people that arrangement suits. Mr. Lowe said that Element Pictures employs 46 people, many on a permanent basis. I suspect that if he told those people tomorrow they were on fixed-term contracts and did not have any security of employment, they would not be very happy about it. On one level, Mr. Lowe needs a group of permanent employees. Dare I use the terms "white collar" and "blue collar" here? I do not like that phraseology but that is what it looks like.It looks like we can give secure employment to the white-collar workers but not the general operatives, for want of a better term. I am referring to the stage crew, transport workers and construction workers. They are telling us that freelance work does not suit them and that they need some kind of security. It is great for freelancers who might work for Element Pictures one week, Metropolitan the next week and another company the week after – good for them – but it is not so good for the person who makes the props, the driver, the stagehand and other such workers. Mr. Lowe is saying that the Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 just does not apply, even though one signs a declaration stating one will comply with it. He is actually saying it does not apply and cannot. There may be two or three categories excepted in the fixed-term workers directive but film is not one of them. Therefore, there is a problem. Even in the Abbey Theatre, there are certain people who have permanent jobs to make it work. They are not operating on a project-to-project basis. There are others who come in, such as the director of lighting or sound crew, who might also do this work somewhere else, but there is a permanent crew that makes things work. Some of the people I am talking about – Mr. Lowe knows who they are as they have worked for Element Pictures and Metropolitan time and again – are telling us they cannot get back into the film industry, even though Element Pictures says it is looking for crew. This is because the film producer companies do not want to acknowledge they have some obligation towards those who have worked for them time and again. That has to be addressed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do, unfortunately.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are not going to resolve this now but there are clear judgments at European level about the issue. What Mr. Lowe is saying is that somebody could have had 15 fixed-term contracts with Element Pictures DACs that did not apply over four consecutive years, therefore giving him or her absolutely no rights or an entitlement to a contract of indefinite duration. I presume Element Pictures does not have any employees who have acquired a contract of indefinite duration.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not a single one has a contract of indefinite duration, even though he or she may have worked for Element Pictures ten or 15 times.
