On the Covid payment and the income supports, do the witnesses agree that the talk of tapering off or even cutting the payment for those who are in receipt of it is folly at the current time or in the foreseeable future? The sectors that are going to recover are going to recover and people will go back to work, but the people who will lose out are those who will be unable to gain employment through absolutely no fault of their own. In fact they will specifically not be able to regain employment because of correct decisions the Government has made on public health measures, and their inability to return to work will be dictated by those Government measures. They are identifiable sectors such as tourism, aviation, taxi drivers, arts and leisure, and people who interact very closely with others. Is it not folly at the level of justice for those people but also from a macroeconomic point of view, because the more money they have in their pocket, the more it will boost demand at a time when we desperately need to boost demand in the economy to get things going and to keep things going? The private sector has stopped investing to a very substantial extent. I would like Professor Barrett to comment on this. According to the Government there is a 37.5% fall in private sector investment, which is way out of line in proportion to the overall reduction in growth that is being projected. The corporate sector is saying it is not taking any risks or investing. Against that background we need even more stimulus at every level and the State must step in and compensate for the lack of investment that is coming for the foreseeable future from the private sector. That is against a background where public spending in Ireland was already way below EU levels, even coming into Covid, but against a background of collapse in private sector investment, surely there is an even greater urgency for heavy State intervention, State investment and to keep people's incomes up to ensure demand continues. One last point in that regard is that while there are very obvious losers in the current situation, that is, workers in the industries I mentioned - arts, leisure, taxi drivers and transport - there are some winners as well. The pharmaceutical industry, the IT sector and financial services have been largely unaffected by this, as well as some of the big retailers and probably some of the big companies in the agrifood sector. They have probably done very well in the current situation. Should we not think about some taxes on the super profits they are making to redirect some resources towards those areas that need help?
