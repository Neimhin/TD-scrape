RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is apparently very concerned about the Chief of Staff meeting with the Russian ambassador. I wonder would he be as concerned if he met with the US ambassador or the head of NATO. I say that because I am concerned that the Minister attended a conference - maybe he will confirm this - in Brest, France, this month with EU foreign ministers, where he discussed the further project of militarising Europe and integrating with NATO.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This country is supposed to be neutral. That is, frankly, laughable, when you consider we have allowed Shannon Airport to be used again and again by the US military to prosecute brutal, murderous wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. I want to know what neutrality means when the Minister goes to a conference in Brest where we discuss the French project, which is a major European powers project to increase the militarisation of the European Union, including an absolutely open call for the establishment of a European army, and where NATO calls on the EU to increase military expenditure at the same time that NATO is expanding towards Russia. Do not get me wrong, the Russians should be condemned for massing troops in Ukraine and having exercises off our waters, but NATO is doing exactly the same thing. It is ratcheting it up and the EU is discussing more military expenditure. Where is the voice of neutrality in saying we should be stepping back from this? We should not be spending more on arms. Is the Minister saying that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a very strange definition of neutral. Yesterday, the Minister expressed concern because the Chief of Staff met the Russian ambassador. To me, neutral would mean that he would express similar concern if the Chief of Staff met the US ambassador or the head of NATO or at the fact that leading powers inside the European Union are looking for and, indeed, have achieved closer integration with NATO, which is a military and nuclear alliance. It is not some sort of benign body. It is the outworking of western, US-led expansion towards Russia, which is now provoking a dangerous escalation in Ukraine. Against that background, the voice of neutrality is to say that we do not pour petrol on a fire by arming up, spending more on weapons and expanding NATO, but by doing the opposite and saying that we do not need militarisation, which is not the solution to these sorts of situations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who is the Minister kidding? NATO is not some sort of protective entity. Its rationale, if it ever had any, disappeared at the end of the Cold War. At that time, people like James Baker, Secretary of State of the US, said that there would not be an eastward expansion. I reiterate that I believe Mr. Putin is a thug. He is dangerous. He has done horrendous things in Chechnya and Kazakhstan. The western powers were far less concerned about those things. The idea that NATO is some sort of benign, innocent force in this instance is ridiculous. It is actively recruiting states in the area and it has expanded dramatically in that area. At the same time, it is urging the European Union to increase military expenditure, which the European Union is going along with, as part of a broader militarisation project and neutral Ireland is not speaking out against it when it should be. This State was born in opposition to empire building. Frankly, it is a betrayal of our tradition of opposition to imperialism and neutrality not to speak out loudly against both military political blocs and their militarist manoeuvrings.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government has consistently defended the role of big property investment funds by saying that they could contribute to addressing the housing crisis and delivering the famous supply. Last week, a crowd called Occu, acting on behalf of a group called Haliday, advertised build-to-rent apartments. These are two blocks, Cualanor, in Dún Laoghaire. One young woman I know, who is facing homelessness and is approved for the housing assistance payment, HAP, went there and was told by the person present to look around and that she could have whatever apartment she wanted. They were advertised, by the way, at €2,200. She said she would have No. 11 and, having looked at it, then said she would need to sort this out with HAP. She said she would have to overpay on the HAP homeless rate, which is only €1,900, but many people do that. As soon as she mentioned HAP, she was told: "Oh, I'm sorry, we are not set up to do HAP". My office then phoned the same crowd to ask why they were not taking HAP. We were told that it was not set up for it and anyway all the places had now been rented out. That is outrageous. What will the Government do about that kind of thing? How can it defend that behaviour by estate agents and owners of apartment blocks?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We certainly need radical reform of further and higher education. Therefore, insofar as the Bill states as its objective a desire to improve the quality of further and higher education, one could not quibble much with its aspirations.It aims to do the following: promote the interests of students; advance equality, diversity and inclusion; achieve excellence in teaching, learning, etc.; and maximise the contributions of higher education to social, economic, cultural, Irish language and environmental development and sustainability. Those are all very worthy aspirations but I am not sure how the Bill achieves any of those things. I just do not see the connection between the aspirations that are set out in the Bill's own description of itself and what the Bill actually does. I am somewhat baffled as to what this Bill sets out to achieve. We have another new acronym now with the introduction of designated institutions of higher education, DIHEs. I do not see, for example, how reducing the governance bodies or boards of universities and these designated institutions from 40 to 17 improves things. I do not really understand that. I was just chatting to a student union representative about this. Currently, on those boards of 40 there are about four students, between four and six trade union representatives, some councillors and other appointees. With this new board of 17, there will be fewer students and there may not be any trade union representatives. There will certainly be fewer of them and there will be more ministerial appointees and appointees that the body itself selects based on expertise. I am not saying these boards function brilliantly at the moment but I do not see what this reduction achieves. This new Higher Education Authority, an tÚdarás um Ard-Oideachas, is to have 12 board members. If I understand it correctly, that board must be gender balanced, which is good. It has to respect diversity and so on and it has to have one student representative, but these are all appointees. Again, I just do not see how this guarantees any of the reforms or aspirations the Bill sets out. There are no radical departures in the Bill to address the problems in further and higher education. I just do not see it. In fact, I am a little worried about this matter because these are all external appointees and I wonder who they will be. One of the biggest problems with further and higher education is its corporatisation and corporate takeover over recent years. Due to the underfunding of further and higher education over many decades, higher and further education institutes, universities, colleges and so on have been pushed towards trying to get more and more sponsorship from the private sector and from business. It appals me, as someone who was in UCD, that there are monuments to Tony O'Reilly and all sorts of other people up there. There is probably a Denis O'Brien building somewhere, or will be soon if there is not already. That horrifies me, quite honestly. The idea that our universities, colleges and higher education institutes will have to depend on the patronage of billionaires and the super-wealthy to get buildings and fund courses and research worries me deeply. There are many statistics about the mental health problems experienced by first year students. For example, NUIG did a survey about the extraordinarily high number of students who are suffering with mental health issues, as well as the high level of dropouts and so on. I did not see that when I was in college. I can see the difference when I go up to UCD, which happens to be where I went. The whole place has become almost terrifying because it looks so corporate. The pressure on students is exponentially greater than it was when I was there. It has become much more dehumanised and based on everything I hear from students and students' unions, that is where it is at. Lots of students feel incredible stress and pressure, including financial pressures. They face huge problems sourcing affordable accommodation as the accommodation built on campus is incredibly expensive. Colleges have a massive overreliance on non-EU students. I do not have any problems with non-EU students but they have to pay full fees and that is a big problem for many of them. Colleges want to get people who pay full fees because they are not getting enough of a subsidy from central government to fund further and higher level education. There have been some improvements but one of the most terrible facts, which we discussed as part of our motion on open access to further and higher education last March, is that 99% of people from Dublin 6 go to university and college whereas the figure for predominantly working class areas is about 15%. That is a shameful fact about the inequity that exists in access to universities and further and higher education. I know it has improved somewhat but we have a long way to go in terms of unequal access. Those pressures carry on once people get into college or university because of the extraordinary difficulty in getting accommodation if they need it and the extortionate rents. People who have to work their way through college could work all the hours God sent and they still would not be able to pay some of the rents being charged in on-campus accommodation, never mind all the private student accommodation that is being built by investment funds charging €1,000 a month. How are these students supposed to study when they are working like a dog to pay these rents, if they can even manage to pay them? Many just cannot do it. Student poverty and mental health issues are rampant. I have highlighted this again and again. It is very relevant in the week we are in with the scandal in south Kerry but it is part of a wider problem of chronically deficient mental health services for young people, whether they are adolescents or young adults, and many of them are students. I have highlighted this huge irony, prompted by some of the people who are studying subjects in areas such as psychology, occupational therapy and speech and language therapy, where there is a chronic shortage. The Tánaiste said again today that there is great difficulty in recruiting people to fill these posts. The irony is that we need counselling services but we make it virtually impossible, or extraordinarily difficult, for the people who actually want to fill those posts, study those subjects and do those jobs in psychology, occupational therapy, speech and language therapy and so on to qualify. That is because of the extortionate postgraduate fees and the lack of funding for many of those doctorate courses in psychology. As I pointed out, there is no funding whatsoever for doctorates in counselling and education psychology, which is precisely the sort of thing we need in our schools and colleges to help our young people. There is no funding whatsoever. I talked to some young people trying to get qualified in psychology and they said they are in a dire situation. They are landed with these fees and are trying to work at the same time while also being on placement and trying to study.We are putting every barrier we possibly can in the way of them getting qualified, when there is a desperate need for these people to deal with the waiting lists for child and adolescent mental health services. That is a slight tangent. The point is that our further and higher education institutions should be helping us solve these problems, but we are making it very difficult for people to get into these institutions and then do the things they want to do when they are there. We need radical change in that regard. It is because the institutions are not funded properly that they are increasingly being pushed towards trying to become more like corporate outfits and raising their own money, which means a rise in or over-reliance on fees or extortionately expensive accommodation. I apologise for going on about counselling services, but I spoke to a student representative today about them. I know that this Bill has a governance framework for accountability around expenditure in terms of central government funding and provides that there should be accountability. However, what does that mean when in UCD, for example, there are some internal counselling services, but the number of people outsourced to private external counselling services has shot up twentyfold in recent years? This Bill does not say anything about stopping that. The college will probably say it is cheaper to outsource. I doubt that is the case, but that is often what is said, probably because the college does not want direct employees. It does not want the hassle of having to employ people and have obligations towards them. Therefore, it outsources the counselling services to the detriment of the students. Many of the academic staff, including postgraduate students who are doing master's degrees, PhDs and so on, are on crappy hourly contracts and part-time hours. Approximately 50% of academic staff are in precarious working conditions. What will this Bill do to address that? We very much need to increase the capacity of our third level institutions to meet the demands and aspirations of young people coming out of school who want to progress their education in the things they want to do. It is very hard for them to do those things because of the stupid, unnecessary and anachronistic leaving certificate system. Even if people get in, we do not have half enough places to meet the demand for what they want to do. When I told the Tánaiste that we should have open access, he said we do not have the staff or the capacity, but of course we do because we have all these academic staff on precarious part-time contracts who would love permanent jobs working in our educational institutions. However, we do not want to force the universities and colleges to employ more people and increase that capacity by giving them proper jobs and job security. I do not see what this Bill does to change any of that. Those are the big issues. I listened to the Minister earlier on and I read through the stuff, but I do not see what this Bill achieves. I would like to see it being much more specific and tied down in terms of the objective to ensure absolutely open access for everybody to the further and higher education of their choice. It would be far better for the students, for the staff, for our society and ultimately for the economy, although I hate reducing education down to the economy, if people were able to access the higher education they want. If resources were put into making sure a state-of-the-art education is provided, if all the financial and other barriers to people doing what they want to do were removed and if we resourced our further and higher education institutions to support students in providing that kind of education, it would be better for the students, the staff and our society. I do not see precisely where this Bill will help achieve that. I do not have much more to say. Maybe the Government spokespeople will respond by saying that I am completely wrong, that it is all in the Bill, that this will revolutionise further and higher education and that it will achieve all of these things, but I do not see where the Bill provides for that. There is nothing particularly objectionable in the Bill, but I do not see what in the Bill will change things. I am specifically concerned by the reduction in the numbers and the changes in the make-up of the governance bodies of our colleges and universities. I would like to hear the argument for how this Bill will make things better in that regard. The alternative in terms of governance would involve the students and the academic and non-academic staff, rather than appointees and overpaid executives and administrators, being the dominant group in the governance of these institutions. It would be best if democratically elected representatives of the students and the academic and non-academic staff, including the porters, the caterers and everybody else who works in these institutions, elected the majority. Of course experts in finance and others will be needed, but the dominant force in running our institutions of education should be the people who study in them, the academic staff who deliver the education and the other workers who make these institutions function. That is what I would like to see. It would be a real revolution in the governance of our further and higher education institutions. All of that will be no more than the moving around of deckchairs unless we put in the resources to ensure we have open access to further and higher education and all of the financial and other barriers to people realising their full creative and intellectual potential are removed. At present, those multiple barriers fundamentally distort and damage the ability of our higher and further education institutions to do the job they should be doing, which is now more important than ever when one looks at the skills shortages we have in so many areas. It makes absolutely no sense that we allow those barriers to persist. We need to overhaul radically our approach to further and higher education.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Well done to the committee for producing this document on the important issue of bogus self-employment. The first introduction that Deputy Joan Collins and I got to this issue was on picket lines outside building sites on many a cold morning. Some of the first of those were probably more than decade ago, perhaps 15 years ago. It is scary to think about how long ago some of those pickets took place outside the premises of some big, wealthy building contractors that are still operating. Building Workers against the Black Economy was one of the activist groups that was established to highlight the plight facing its members in terms of bogus self-employment. They literally and metaphorically stood out in the cold and were victimised and blacklisted for protesting over bogus self-employment. There was a large irony to that. One of the refrains the workers would repeat was that they had to go on strike and protest for the right to pay tax. The rich in this country do everything they can to avoid paying tax but those workers had to go out on strike for the right to pay tax. That is the truth of all this. It is deeply ironic, but that is what the struggle against bogus self-employment was about for the workers. It was about the right to pay tax and the right to have the benefits and employment security that flow from that. Those workers were up against big building contractors that did not want to pay PRSI or to have any obligations to workers. Those contractors did not want to pay sick pay or to have to pay workers if work was rained off or whatever. They would go to horrendous ends, much of which I witnessed first-hand. Nasty tactics were deployed against the workers who tried to highlight the issue. I pay particular tribute to a man who has since passed away in tragic circumstances, Mr. Billy McClurg, a bricklayer from my area. He was one among many fantastic activists who suffered as a consequence of their actions.Some of them never worked in the building industry again because they sought to highlight bogus self-employment. It has taken this long to get here but I am glad it is now officially acknowledged that this is a serious problem and we must do something about it. It was very heartening to hear departmental advertisements advise people who believe they have been misclassified that there are places they can go now and that it is acknowledged. It is a pity it has taken so long but at least we have come some way in that regard. There is no doubt that bogus self-employment is still going on. Everybody is losing out. The workers obviously lose out. We do not know the exact scale of bogus self-employment. I believe an Irish Congress of Trade Unions report estimated it could be costing the Exchequer €600 million per year. The 2018 intervention in the building industry by the joint investigation unit and scope section, which identified 500 workers who were misclassified by building contractors, yielded the State an extra €60 million. Those 500 workers resulted in €60 million in additional revenue that year. We can see what a big loss this is to society in terms of tax revenue. Obviously, it is also a loss to the workers who are treated this way and are then vulnerable. Of course, the other big advantage of bogus self-employment is the idea of a hire them and fire them workforce that can just be got rid of because there is absolutely no obligation to them. I am very glad we are moving forward on this issue. I hope the Government will take on the recommendations. The onus should be put on employers to prove they are fully compliant, not misclassifying people and so on. One point I really want to make is that if such employers are identified, they should be hauled over the coals for everything. It should not just involve an individual adjudication which, of course, the employers appeal in many cases. It is often at the appeal that decisions get overturned. I take the point about the scope section responding and it does respond. It often goes into an organisation and finds that the workers are right but then the barristers come out for the employers. They wheel in the heavy guns against the workers who do not, in many cases, have any representation. Sometimes they have union representation but other times they do not have any representation. They certainly cannot afford barristers and so on. Decisions get overturned at the appeals level in many cases and the matter gets dragged out. In the meantime, the workers are out in the cold and often blacklisted at that point. There is one recommendation I would like to make to the Government and the Department if they are serious about this. First, if any employer is found to have bogusly misclassified workers, there should be a forensic audit of everything it does. That audit could involve every single employee and all the employer's accounts and books. The whole thing should be gone through with a fine-tooth comb because if there are one or two cases, it can be guaranteed there is more dirt in that company. We should go after such employers to provide a real deterrent that will stop these people doing what they are doing. While they may have got caught in that instance, very often they will just carry on regardless. That must be stamped out. The second recommendation I will make, which I hope the committee and Government will take on board, is that where a company or employer that is guilty of bogus self-employment is in receipt of public money, that money should be stopped immediately. There should be a big black mark over that company preventing it from getting any public money in future until it has wiped the slate clean, having been fully sanctioned and penalised, the truth established and so on. Too often, the same companies involved in this sharp practice of exploiting workers, breaking the law and robbing the taxpayer get a slap over the wrist and are back in business and getting Government contracts, funding, grants and tax breaks the next week. There is, therefore, no real deterrent. That has to stop. I did not hear if the Minister of State responded on the recommendation about the blacklisting legislation. That needs to come forward. That is a serious business. Blacklisting is a real thing and it must be stamped out. I appeal to the Government, as the committee has recommended, to bring forward the blacklisting legislation. I may not get answers now but I am hoping perhaps the officials or the Minister of State will respond to the issues I raise. I would like to see the scope section and the joint investigation unit expanded in respect of the resources available to them. In addition, they should deal not only with bogus self-employment but any breach of employment rights and employment legislation. Perhaps they already do so; I do not fully understand all these mechanisms but I do not think that is the case. I have raised one issue repeatedly and I would really like the Government to go after this. Sometimes, we think these things only go on in construction or maybe Deliveroo. RTÉ, the respectable State broadcaster, was found to be engaged in massive bogus self-employment and misclassification of staff. There is another area where this kind of sharp practice of bogus self-employment goes on. The scope section has found in favour of a couple of workers in the film industry which is in receipt of substantial State money every year. I do not think anybody wants to investigate the industry. I think the view is that because these are the glamorous film people, we should not look into it too much. It might be too much of a can of worms. Bogus self-employment is taking place, however. Another practice that is taking place - this is why I would like to see the scope section's remit expanded - is abuse of the fixed-term workers legislation whereby workers accumulate service for employers in the film industry but the employers do not want to recognise that service. They do not want to acknowledge it, even though they must do so under EU law and the fixed-term workers Act. The employers then go into the Workplace Relations Commission and argue that they are not actually the employer. They say they get all this money from the Government to employ people but they do not actually have any employees. That is what they say to the WRC. When the workers tell the WRC that their rights have been abused, the employers argue that while these people worked on their film, they are not technically their employer and, therefore, they have no obligations to those workers. I would like workers to be able to tell other agencies, not just the WRC but agencies such the scope section, the joint investigation unit and similar bodies, that this is happening and ask for an inspection or investigation to establish that something is going on in order that action can be taken.
