RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to ask the Taoiseach about two particular issues.  First, on the financial transaction tax, I was not here for the Taoiseach's outburst about what he described as our fantasy economics.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know.  We give straight answers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the Taoiseach's misrepresentation of our position on the €10 billion in taxes, he fails to add on who would pay those taxes and we argue very clearly that the very wealthy in our society and the sectors of our society in possession of considerable amounts of money should be taxed in a progressive and fair way to prevent cuts and austerity being imposed on working people and the more vulnerable sectors of our society.  Contrary to what the Taoiseach constantly claims, there are huge amounts of money at the top of our society which if taxed fairly and progressively could offset the need for brutal attacks and austerity being imposed on working people and the less well-off who have borne the brunt of the austerity agenda pursued by the Government and the masters in Europe.One area we have highlighted is precisely the financial transaction tax.  I find absolutely extraordinary the Taoiseach's trenchant opposition to even a small bit of extra taxation being imposed on the financial sector.  It shows the quite perverse economics being pursued by the Government that it is okay to cut fuel allowance for pensioners, domiciliary care allowance for families with disability and child benefit, and to attack lone parents, but we cannot touch the enormous wealth in the hands of speculators and bankers.  Even a tiny increase in tax is unthinkable as far as the Government is concerned and it is absolutely perverse.Let me remind the Taoiseach, when he considers the matter of whether we should support the financial transaction tax, that it was the speculators and bankers who caused the current economic crisis in this country and Europe.  Surely it would be fair and sensible to support imposing some extra taxation on this sector to offset the need to attack working people and the less well off and to regulate to some extent the casino capitalism that has been at the heart of wrecking our economy and the wider European economy.  Will the Taoiseach please tell me what is fair or rational about his position of opposing the financial transaction tax and standing alone with David Cameron in his opposition to it, particularly when there is now a sea change throughout Europe whereby people are demanding a fair way of dealing with the economic crisis stating clearly that continued austerity and cuts being imposed on the least well off sectors of our society is failing disastrously and we need a new direction if we are to get ourselves out of the current economic crisis?My next question is on the fiscal treaty and the Taoiseach's discussions with David Cameron and his views on this given what has happened.  I have very serious differences at almost every level with the politics of Prime Minister Cameron, but at least the British Prime Minister had the sense not to sign up to the fiscal treaty.  Now he is being joined by forces throughout Europe in France, Holland, Greece, Spain and Portugal with huge movements on the street saying enough and that this is madness.  The austerity approach is a disastrous failure and is making the situation worse not better and we must abandon this approach in favour of promoting jobs and growth and not continuing down a disastrous road of institutionalised austerity as proposed in the fiscal treaty.David Cameron had enough sense to recognise how stupid it was to put this level of control over economic policy into the hands of the EU Commission and the European Central Bank, and how detrimental it could be to the British economy and to British citizens to be locked into this type of policy in perpetuity as the treaty proposes.  Now people and political leaders throughout Europe are coming to the realisation that the treaty and the approach contained in it of austerity for years to come is a failure and must be abandoned.  Why does the Taoiseach continue down this road?  Did he speak to David Cameron and ask him why he chose not to support the fiscal treaty?  Will he speak to the political parties which won the day in France and Greece and to the burgeoning movement of opposition to the insane logic of the fiscal treaty throughout Europe and ask them why they have a radically different approach from the one that seems to be favoured by him and Angela Merkel?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would you like to outline them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be honest I will not even dignify the comments about Galway with much of a response except to say-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----I gave a very clear account of what went on and what I saw in Galway-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and it did not match at all the hysterical hyperbole of those opposed to the protests.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the question of a financial transaction tax, the Taoiseach has not given an answer that is in any way credible.  He describes it as fantasy economics.  He thinks that denouncing as a fantasy alternative ways of financing this society that are fairer and more progressive is an adequate explanation.  It is not.  People want fairness in how this issue is dealt with.  The figures were provided in the United Left Alliance's pre-budget submission, in which we outlined where we would get €10 billion.  Instead of attacking vulnerable sectors of our society and working people who spend their money in the economy and help to keep it going, we clearly set out how we should tax those with obscene amounts of wealth, who are hoarding it in banks and are not spending it in the economy.  Taxing them would not do any damage to our economy.  What is damaging our economy is attacking low and middle income earners, allowing the decimation of our small and medium enterprise sector through excessive rates and rents and slashing the income of people who buy in the economy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is destroying our economy.  Instead of that, why not impose higher taxes on the bankers and speculators who helped wreck this and the European economy?  The Taoiseach says we cannot do that.  The alibi that nobody can do it until everybody does it is an alibi for never doing it, and the Taoiseach knows that well.  Somebody has to have the political courage-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----to go first.  Why will the Taoiseach not have the political courage to do what is fairer and rational, that is, impose a little extra tax on the bankers and speculators, which could generate hundreds of millions of euro for the State, and show leadership in Europe on this issue by joining with the progressive forces in Europe on a fair way to deal with the crisis, instead of constantly attacking low and middle income earners in a way that is unfair and disastrous?On this fiscal treaty, the Taoiseach did not tell us what reasons Prime Minister David Cameron gave for not supporting the treaty.  Is the Taoiseach not even remotely interested in the fact that there is a huge political tidal wave sweeping across Europe that says "No" to the logic of the fiscal treaty and the austerity contained within it?  Is he not even remotely inquisitive about the thinking behind that huge sea change in viewpoint on austerity across Europe whereby people are rejecting it?  Should that not give him pause to reconsider this austerity treaty?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am deadly serious.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am very positive about the French and Greek elections.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is it always too complicated and why are there always excuses as to the reason one cannot tax the wealthy, the speculators, the bankers and the bondholders, as would a financial transactions tax?  Even a rate of 0.1% would raise €500 million, while a rate of 1% would raise €5 billion.  The Taoiseach states it is too complex to do that, there are so many excuses for not doing it, every reason under the sun, but it is not too complicated to attack working people and the vulnerable in our society-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	----- which is morally unfair and is proving to be economically disastrous.  In his response, does the Taoiseach seriously suggest there simply will be no taxes imposed on the bankers, speculators and so on, whose casino and gambling activities caused the crisis in the first place, but they all will be imposed on working people and the least well-off?  Is this the point being made by the Taoiseach?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So we will never have one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So it will never happen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As stated by other speakers, the scandal of thousands of children being abused in church-run institutions, which children the State failed for decades to protect, is one of the greatest, if not the greatest, shames of this State's relatively short history.  Many heinous crimes were perpetrated against thousands of children.  We must, in trying to deal with this issue, ensure we do everything in our power to provide whatever redress, support and compensation we can to those people whose lives were ruined.  Nothing we or this Bill can do can ever fully compensate people for the suffering they endured.  In so far as we have a duty and obligation to help victims of abuse and their families to cope for the rest of their lives with the consequences of the crimes committed against them, we must ensure we do so as well as we possibly can.  It is of the utmost importance that nothing we do results in further stress, difficulty, anxiety, humiliation or suffering for people who have already suffered far too much.  We must in the first instance listen to their view on how we can address the issues affecting them.  Whatever we then put in place must result in no further trauma, suffering or stress for them and their families.  It is vital we get this right.The church, whose role in visiting this suffering on so many people, must end its shameful foot-dragging and instinct for self-preservation and self-protection whether of the institution of the church or of particular individuals within it who believe their self-preservation is of greater priority than are the victims of this terrible abuse, their concerns and needs.  In this regard, it is disgraceful that the church has still not put up all of the money to meet its obligations on this matter.  As far as I am concerned, the State has a responsibility to force it to do so and to seize its assets if required.  Whatever needs to be done should be done to ensure the church comes up with the funds and supports required.  The institution and individuals within it matter not a whit compared to our obligation to the victims of child abuse.  To my mind it is equally shameful - this is out of our power - that Cardinal Brady, given his failure to discharge his responsibility to the victims of Fr. Brendan Smyth, will not resign.In so far as we in this House have the authority to do something for the victims, we must ensure we get this right and, critically, with an ear to what the victims and their families say they need.  I do not pretend to be an expert on this issue.  I met this morning, as I have done on other occasions, with two victims representing other victims who have major concerns about this Bill.  When I asked them at the end of the meeting if they believed this Bill as currently drafted should be scrapped, they said it should because it does not deal as it should with the issue.As regards eligibility, there should be no question of limiting eligibility to those given awards from the Residential Institutions Redress Board.  Anyone who was a victim or resident in one of the relevant institutions should be eligible to access this fund and services provided therefrom.  As stated by Deputy Joan Collins, the victims' organisations raised with us their fear that significant resources that should be going to help victims will be squandered on administration, salaries, expenses and so on.That must not happen.  They propose a much simpler system where we do not need large boards, a large staff and so on and that we just give the money directly to the people who are eligible for it in the form of some sort of universal credit card, as Deputy Collins said.  We could work out the proportion of the available fund to be given to each individual on the basis of much of the information we already have from awards given by the Residential Institutions Redress Board.  This could be done and it would save on the necessity for administration and would not waste funds which should be going to the victims.They also expressed deep concern that we are just talking about transferring over the administration and infrastructure from the Education Finance Board because they reported real problems with, as has been described, people spending months trying to gain access to this fund but giving up such was the onerous nature of the process and the difficulty of making an application with all the documentation, proof and so on that they had to provide.  People literally gave up.  That cannot happen.  What they propose is a much simpler system where we simply give them the resources in the form of a universal credit card, so we do not have to deal with all of that.The key point for them is that the State already has most of the information it needs to adequately disburse the resources, supports and funds via the Residential Institutions Redress Board and the awards.  Anybody who came in after that could be looked at.  They also stressed the need for it to be independent.  In so far as any administration of this is required, it must be completely independent but there is a problem if the Minister is appointing the chief executive.  There may be a conflict or a tension in regard to a Government which has concerns about cutting back on services while at the same time having an influence on a board whose priority should be not a concern about the Government's concerns about services but about what the victims and their families need and providing for that.  It should be separate from the Government and the Minister and completely independent and funding should be provided in a much more simplified form and in a much more direct way than this Bill proposes.
