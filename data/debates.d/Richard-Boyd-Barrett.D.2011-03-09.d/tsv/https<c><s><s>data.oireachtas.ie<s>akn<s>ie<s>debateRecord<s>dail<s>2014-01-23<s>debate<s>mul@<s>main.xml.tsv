RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the Visitors Gallery there is a delegation of workers from Lufthansa Technik Airmotive Ireland, 400 of whom have learned in recent weeks that they will lose their jobs. Sixty-five were laid off last week, with the remainder to go in the coming weeks and months. I am asking on their behalf whether the Government intends to do anything to seek to save and maintain this highly skilled workforce and the skills base they represent in an industry the Government has designated a priority. In addition, will the Minister address the question of the pension deficit left behind, in a context where, as the workers understand it, €40 million of IDA Ireland money was given to the company? What has become of that money and can some of it be retrieved to fill the pension gap or maintain the plant and the jobs it provides, thereby facilitating Ireland's involvement in this industry?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a strategic closure by Lufthansa. The idea that we have a contracting market opportunity is nonsense. The reality is that the aircraft industry is booming. The Government's commitment to seek investment and expand employment in this area is proof of that. The Government is taking that approach because it knows it is an industry that is expanding. Therefore, we should not take too seriously what Lufthansa is stating. This is a strategic closure in its own interest by a company which, at a large meeting in Hamburg on 10 December, spoke about the ambitious growth plans to be implemented in the coming months and referred to its dominant position in the market and so on. That is the reality.I am glad to hear of the Minister's commitment to protect skilled jobs in this industry. In that context, it makes absolutely no sense to allow these jobs and this skills base to be lost and for the plant to be stripped down, as it will be, if we do not intervene in some way. The workers particularly want to know about the €40 million that was put in. They understood that €40 million was conditional on the plant being maintained. The State is a shareholder in Aer Lingus. The workers also tell me that a load of CFM engines will come on the market soon for maintenance and overhaul and that this work could be done in Rathcoole if we were to maintain the plant and these jobs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the short time available I will not get into an argument with the Minister on this issue, except to say the workers have a different perspective, wide knowledge of the industry, skills and so on. They tell me there could be a glut of the engines in which they specialise in the market soon and that work could be done in Rathcoole but not if the plant is stripped down. I appeal to the Minister to meet the workers and hear their side of the story to see if there is anything that can be done. The Government is a stakeholder in the aircraft industry and these were Aer Lingus workers. It seems that where there is a general commitment from the Government to this industry and maintain the skilled jobs in it, we must do everything we can to see if these skilled jobs can be maintained. What can we do to fill the pension deficit about which the workers are very concerned, given that a large sum of public money was given to Lufthansa? Can we put pressure on it to fill that gap? Can the State intervene in some way? I urge the Minister to meet the workers to discuss what can be done.
