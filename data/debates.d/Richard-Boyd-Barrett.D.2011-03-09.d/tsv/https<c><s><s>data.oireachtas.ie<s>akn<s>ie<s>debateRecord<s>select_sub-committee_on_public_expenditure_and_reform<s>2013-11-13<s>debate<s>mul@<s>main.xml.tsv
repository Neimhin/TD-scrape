RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While we have had a substantial discussion on the issue of fees and in response to Deputy Dara Murphy's question-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The word "freedom" includes the word "free", for which there is a good reason. If information is to be freely available and the Title of the Bill is to mean anything, the accessing of information must be free, otherwise some people who do not have the money required will not have access to information. That is as simple as A, B, C, as the Minister knows. That was the position of a previous Government, of which the Minister's party was a member, that brought forward the freedom of information legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not the €15 charge.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To my mind, "freedom of information" means free access to information.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	According to Emily O'Reilly, the full amount realised from all of the charging, whether of retrieval or up-front fees, in 2011 was €87,000. That is peanuts in terms of the public finances. I ask the Minister not to make fools of us by suggesting this is important for the finances of the State. Clearly, it is not. If it not about raising €87,000, it must be about something else. The Minister should be open and up-front on what that something else is. Deputy Sean Fleming was right when he said it was about managing demand. A sum of €15 is a good deal of money to some people, while €87,000 is not even small change for the Government. Applying a charge is a disincentive for ordinary people. On a point of clarification - I do not care whether this is a U-turn or a climbdown; it does not make any difference - I gather that the outcry is that pressure is being experienced, but that is what this committee is for and if the Minister listens, that is excellent. That is what democracy is supposed to be about. Nobody should be ashamed to say, "I am responding to pressure in the media or from the public." That is precisely what we are all here for - to respond to that pressure.  I draw the Minister's attention to examples he gave yesterday. Deputy Stephen S. Donnelly gave a hypothetical example, to which the Minister gave a clear answer. He provided examples - I have only had a chance to look at them now - of what he described as multifaceted requests which ran foul of his concerns and which, presumably, even with the new amendment he is proposing, involved multiple charges rather than a single charge. FOI/213/1882 is a request I randomly read, a request for all records within the Department within the timeframe 9 March 2011 to 14 May 2013 related to a list of items. It is clear from these eight items that they all relate to expenses incurred by the Taoiseach during the Minister's party's period in government. That is what they are all about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will read them. They cover the use of Farmleigh-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. It is about the use by the Taoiseach and Ministers of what one might call-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but the point is-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a coherence. It lists laundering, cleaning and ironing services for the Taoiseach-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----new clothing orders for the Taoiseach, parking-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Stop interrupting me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister want me to go through all of them? The list also includes the helipad on the roof of Government Buildings; parking within the quadrangle of Government Buildings; exercise equipment for use by the Taoiseach or any member of his Department; new clothing orders for the Taoiseach - suits, ties shirts, cufflinks, etc.; refurbishment, extension or purchase of any office, room, accommodation, fixtures, fittings, furnishings and decorations intended for principal use by the Taoiseach.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a consistent theme running through the list; the Minster knows damn well there is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Come on, Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. That was probably a request made by a journalist looking for a particular story about the costs incurred by the Taoiseach and perhaps Ministers - I acknowledge that point - which people might perceive to be superfluous or because there was controversy around such expenditure because it might have been perceived to be excessive and indulgent against the background of an economic crisis. That is the logic behind that question and it is consistent through the eight parts. The Minister is now telling us that in the case of such a request which was almost certainly submitted by a journalist with a particular story in mind to reveal information that the public might want to know about this expenditure, there will be eight charges instead of one, which would be problematic, or is he telling us that there will be only one charge? His answer to that question will clarify if he has changed his position.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, the period of office of the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It relates to the period from when the Government came to power to the date of the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mostly by the Taoiseach.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister interrupted me constantly-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----when I was making my point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry, Chairman.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Thank you, Chairman.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister used to come from that tradition as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it €87,000?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I suspect it was a fraction of the €87,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the spirit of what the Minister said about trying to genuinely engage and be co-operative and non-confrontational, I wish to ask about the example the Minister gave. One of the eight clauses does not refer to the Taoiseach and expenditures related to his activities. That is a fair point. However, seven of them do. Clearly, the logic of it is that it relates to the period since the Minister entered office. It is the trappings of the Taoiseach’s office that is in question. According to the significance of the amendment proposed by the Minister, would the request encompass one charge, two charges or eight charges for the question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I worry about that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the cost is to be included, may I make an additional request on the other side of the equation? While I acknowledge it cannot be done on the spot, could one come back with the same question and state how much it would cost?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I mean how much would it cost a customer, that is, a member of the public or a journalist to ask that question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, two things are being mixed up, namely the cost of-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That did not stop Deputy Murphy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with the amendment, as I believe the lines in question should be deleted. Let me refer the Minister to one of the expert witnesses we had from England, Mr. Hammond. Perhaps the Chairman could remind us of his credentials. He was an expert witness during the pre-legislative discussions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To the members of the committee, he stated: On fees and vexatious requests, the issue is understanding what makes a vexatious request vexatious. We should not be conflating a vexatious request with one that is a little difficult, annoying, embarrassing or persistent. For example, one cannot have a vexatious requester. The Commons justice committee examined how someone who made a lot of freedom of application requests could be classified as a vexatious requester. That is a point we strongly argue against. Just because someone makes a lot of requests does not necessarily mean they are not valid or valuable. Just because a person may have made a vexatious request once before does not mean future requests will be vexatious.He gave an example of a request to all councils in Britain on how much they spent on biscuits, which request one could construe as vexatious. He pointed out, however-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	From the point of view of the requester, the information sought might be considered pretty important in that it might pertain to expenditure on hospitality in local authorities.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Maybe so, but Mr. Hammond was the expert witness making this argument, not me. I am simply reminding the Minister of what Mr. Hammond said. He made the point that what the Minister, I or a majority here might consider to be vexatious might be considered very important by the individual making the request. He stated that we should not second-guess the individual's right to gain access to that information. The point Mr. Hammond is making is that the notion of the vexatious requester is so problematic that we should not use it at all. Mr. Hammond stated that there is no evidence that if there is no provision blocking so-called vexatious requests, there would be a massive avalanche of so-called vexatious requests. Therefore, the presumption should be one of free access to information. Mr. Hammond, the expert witness called in by the committee, was absolutely spot-on in that regard. The clause should be removed because its interpretation is too subjective.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I read it differently.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I probably vex the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I respond? Maybe such people exist but I put it to the Minister that there are not that many of them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is of concern is that there is the potential for the Minister to be using a sledge-hammer to crack a nut because there are not many of these people. This particular wording gives a hell of a lot of discretion for people to make quite a subjective judgment about people or issues that they may be annoyed by. They may consider them to be frivolous and vexatious, but the requestor may genuinely consider them to be really important. The point that Mr. Hammond made was that the bar should be very high. If the Minister believes that section must be included, he should consider reframing it in such as a way that it is made clear that the bar is very high. I do not know how we would put it. We will have to think about a wording.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am nearly finished, Chair. I am just making a proposal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not repetition, it is a proposal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just making a proposal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough. Nobody wants to stay in here all day but our job is to scrutinise legislation. Any Deputy is entitled to come here and do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed, and I have tabled amendments. As the Chairman knows, I cannot table amendments in my name so they must be submitted via Deputy Donnelly. Committee Stage is also an opportunity for us to go through the legislation line by line and discuss issues as they arise. Therefore, my proposal to the Minister is-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking the Minister to consider reframing section 15 to put a higher bar for frivolity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputies had a cosy little chat.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In 2011 it was €85,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ms Emily O'Reilly told us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Most of the arguments have been fairly well rehearsed at this stage but I would like to challenge the Minister a little on the issue of the economic climate. The two main reasons he gave to Deputy Donnelly for retaining the €15 upfront fee were that the economic climate requires it and to make it workable, or manage the demand. The Minister said he did not say "manage the demand". Am I right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Managing demand is completely different.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let me put a couple of points to the Minister about each of those reasons he gave. I also put it to him that there is another reason. In regard to the economic climate, the Minister told Deputy Donnelly he cannot make an estimate of the cost. I refer to the evidence given by the former Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly. She said we currently get €85,000 per year. The number of areas covered by freedom of information has been expanded but surely we can make some sort of estimate. Let us say it doubles or even trebles, is it not fair to say the amount of money about which we are talking is really quite negligible? It is hard for me to understand how one can make a claim on economic or financial grounds for the retention of the fee when the money about which were are talking is so small. What is the worst case scenario? Is it a quadrupling of the volume? Will the Minister comment on that point because the money seems so small?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is not directly answering my point. I am reading directly from Ms Emily O'Reilly's evidence. She said the total amount of money between research, search and retrieval fees amounts to €85,000 in a year. Even if it quadrupled under the new regime, which I do not think it would, the Minister cannot seriously claim, in terms of the Government's finances, that this is a significant amount of money, although it would be for an individual.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I might say, the analogy of the leaders' allowance is pretty tenuous because that is about what the leaders of political parties get and somewhat controversial-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, indeed. The leaders of political parties get it while Independents get a different allowance. All parties get a leaders' allowance per Deputy, something which the Minister sometimes does not mention. The bigger parties get a bonus on top of that but let us not get into that. That is a contentious area and some people would say politicians get too much. The purpose of this Bill, according to the Government, is to give the public access to information. Therefore, if the money the Government is likely to drive is very small, but acts as an impediment to members of the public getting the information, then it is self-defeating in terms of the Bill.It is self-defeating in terms of the Bill and I will quote what Ms Emily O'Reilly, whom everyone praised as a wonderful Ombudsman, said in that regard: "The fee is an impediment to the public seeking records". What she said is very straightforward - the fee is an impediment. Does the Minister accept what she said?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have no desire to spend longer than is necessary here and this is the last, but one, of the major contentious areas of this Bill. I wish to make a number of points and do not believe I am repeating myself. I am asking the Minister a direct question. Does he accept what Emily O'Reilly said, that the fee is an impediment to the public accessing information?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put it to the Minister-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is self-evident that a fee of €15 is an impediment for those who are less well off. I do not think the Minister can claim otherwise. The Minister's argument is difficult to sustain. Emily O'Reilly also said in her evidence that she knew that the Minister was of the view that the fee acts as a brake on people who might be using the Act in a frivolous way. Was that just Ms O'Reilly's opinion or did the Minister tell her that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I raise this because the Minister was asked for his reasons-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am finished now except to say that in terms of the procedure here, at the outset of the discussion on this section, the Minister said that the amendment he intends to resubmit is this one, minus one part. We accept that this is an improvement and are now debating the rest of the section, which is the most controversial section, dealing with the upfront fee. In that context, I do not see why it is not acceptable to discuss it. The secretariat is saying that we should make these points when we are dealing with the section. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We can do it then.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not want to be pedantic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With all due respect, we are not wandering. We are dealing with the substantial issue of the fee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is the section of the Bill that deals with it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The arguments have been made for the deletion of this section. I concur with the view put forward by a person who I consider to be expert in the area, the former Ombudsman, Ms Emily O'Reilly. In her view, the reason the fee was introduced was to dampen people's ardour for seeking public records. It certainly worked. Retaining the fee will have that effect, notwithstanding the fact that I accept that the Bill moves things forward. Charges are being reduced in some areas, but I echo the point made by Ms O'Reilly: as long as we retain the up-front charge it can have no other effect than to dampen people's ardour for seeking out public information. I believe the Minister knows that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We had our discussion and I intend to raise this issue on Report Stage. The semi-State sector encompasses a great number of employees and it has a significant impact on society, on our economy and on our environment. Consequently I do not think it is acceptable to exempt those bodies. I appeal to the Minister to vary the approach by deciding they should be subject to FOI unless they need to make a case around specific areas of sensitivity. I wish to give one example. It was suggested to me by an environmentalist who is very concerned-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a particular example.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The felling by Coillte may have had an impact on the problems in Ballymore Eustace. That is a serious issue and it should be subject to FOI.
