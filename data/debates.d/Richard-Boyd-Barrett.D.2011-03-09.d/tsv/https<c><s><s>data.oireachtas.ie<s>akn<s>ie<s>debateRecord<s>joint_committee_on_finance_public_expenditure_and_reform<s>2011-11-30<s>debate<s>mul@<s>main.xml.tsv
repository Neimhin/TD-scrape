RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is public sector reform in the Minister's mind?  It might seem like an obvious question but it is a pretty fundamental one.  What is the objective of all of this?  If I were to define public sector reform, I would say it is to improve public services.  In terms of how the Minister has contextualised his presentation, I would also say that it is to contribute towards generally improving the economic conditions in society that will allow for economic growth and development.  So we might agree.  My series of questions relates to whether that is what this agenda will achieve.  In other words, is it an agenda that will improve public services and the country's economic conditions or will it do the exact opposite?  Is it a euphemism for an ideological agenda which is about downsizing the public sector, privatising and cutting costs, regardless of the consequences?  I believe it is the latter, which will not surprise the Minister, but I would like him to convince me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking this in all seriousness along with raising a few issues for the Minister to consider in this regard.  First, how will the Minister evaluate the success of the reform project?  On the face of it, much of it seems to be just about significantly reducing the public sector pay bill and the numbers working in the public service.  There are a few other things around the edges.  Yesterday, we discussed the issue of the pay and pensions of top civil servants but, as the Minister said, that is marginal in terms of the cost savings involved.  We have differences of opinion on the whole equity question as to whether the caps the Minister has introduced should not be significantly lower.  For what it is worth, I will ask the Minister what is a reasonable multiple of the average industrial wage for somebody in the public service to earn?  A cap of €200,000 or €250,000 is six or seven times the average industrial wage.  Is that reasonable?  Is somebody at the top of the public service seven times better than a nurse working in an accident and emergency unit?  I do not personally believe so and therefore I think the cap should come down.  Perhaps the Minister could comment on that.Even if the Minister agreed with me on that, however, the savings would still not be that significant.  The bulk of it is about the fact that approximately 10% of public servants will be gone by the end of this process.  Is that not right?  We are talking about 37,000 - starting from 2008 - gone from the public service.  That is a reform agenda, but it is only reform and not cuts dictated by the troika if at the end of it the public services are better, the same or at least maintained, and if it has contributed to the economic well-being of the State in terms of us being able to grow and develop.  Is that not how we should evaluate it?  What evidence is there that it is heading in the right direction if we are using those evaluation criteria?I believe it is just about attacking the public sector, making a scapegoat of it and opening things up for privatisation.  That is what I personally think the agenda is.  I am not even saying that is the Minister's secret agenda, I just believe that is what the troika's agenda is and that the Minister and his colleagues are the agents of that.  Even before all this started, is it not a fact that we spent less on public services as a proportion of GDP than most of our European counterparts?  Does the effect of this not mean just that we will spend an even smaller proportion of GDP on public services?  Is that not the actual effect?  We will therefore go from being pretty low down on the European league table of expenditure on public services to being even further down.  I do not see how the Minister can get more for less, even with all the nice words such as "better value for money" and "customer service", if that is the actuality.  Is the evidence not beginning to pile up in that regard?Can the Minister seriously suggest that the health service will be better if 6,000 staff are gone?  Get rid of the top managers, no problem, but I believe there will be another 7,000 gone by the end of this process.  Can the Minister really suggest that taking 13,000 staff out will produce a better health service?  Is it not obvious that it will mean the closure of local hospitals and the downgrading of accident and emergency units?Let us take the medical card scheme as an example of rationalisation.  Is the reconfiguration of the medical card system into a post office box in Finglas not turning out to be a disaster in terms of public service delivery?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Those are not the reports I am receiving.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	According to the reports I am getting, it is not better.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When lay people hear terms such as "shared services" and "an increased focus on technology" they know it means that whereas one used to get a human being to ask a question or deliver a service, one is now referred to a website, or there may be some convoluted phone arrangement where one cannot find out who is responsible.  I am not trying to score points but that is the actuality.  In my area, one used to be able to go into the local authority to pay rent and other bills, but due to the cut in numbers one can no longer do so.  It must be done online, which is extremely difficult for elderly people.  This is not an improvement in service delivery because fewer human beings are doing the jobs.  I would like the Minister to comment on that.  Does the fact that fewer people are doing those jobs not mean that the service has declined?  The same applies to pupil-teacher ratios which have disimproved.Will the Minister also comment on the outsourcing of services to consultants and contractors?  Anecdotally at least, it would seem that when the numbers directly employed by Government Departments, State agencies and local authorities are reduced, in many cases these services still need to be provided so we end up bringing in agencies, consultants and contractors, which is outsourcing of one kind of another.  Has a cost-benefit analysis been done on this?  I think this is ideological and is being driven by a privatisation agenda.  Can the Minister prove me wrong or can we have some evaluation of it to say that we are saving money on this?In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown the entire budget for 2010 was €220 million, but €140 million of that was paid to private contractors.  I asked the county manager if he could provide a list of all the contractors, what they had done for the council and how much the jobs had cost, so that we could evaluate it.  However, he said there were insufficient resources to provide the list.  That is extraordinary.  I put a series of questions to various Ministers about the use of agencies in their Departments.  When I first put the question, I was told my inquiry had to be parcelled out between Departments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform should have access to that overview.  He should know, or at least seek to discover, the number of agency workers employed and how consultants and contractors are being used.  When I sought examples in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, I discovered that a considerable amount of money was being paid to the large consultancy firm, RPS Group.  According to the company's website, its chief executive earns €9 million per annum.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we not paying for this?  Does it not offer better value for public money to directly employ people in public sector pay grades than to line the pockets of well-paid consultants?Who is responsible for assessing big areas of expenditure?  I presume the Minister has a role to play in this regard.  A bugbear of mine is the €500 million spent annually on rent allowance payments to private landlords.  I cannot understand the logic of these payments.  If those in receipt of rent allowance were housed instead in local authority accommodation, we would save €500 million immediately, as well as earning a further €300 million in revenue, giving total savings of nearly €1 billion.  Who can make the decision to do something about this?  That is big money we could be saving instead of allowing it to line the pockets of private landlords.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand the Minister's.
