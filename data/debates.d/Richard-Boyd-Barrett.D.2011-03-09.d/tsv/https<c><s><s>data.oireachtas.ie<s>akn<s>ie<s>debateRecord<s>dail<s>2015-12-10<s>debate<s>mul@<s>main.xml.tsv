RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Paris climate summit is attempting to prevent climate chaos as a result of global warming. Many people were very disappointed by the Taoiseach's comments to the effect that Ireland's emissions targets for agriculture were unrealistic and are fearful that the Irish Government is not serious about addressing the urgent threat to this country and to the globe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the context of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Bill 2015, the Government adamantly resisted including binding targets because it knew that with its current strategy, it was not capable of meeting the 2020 targets. The Taoiseach said that the targets are unrealistic and made a special plea for Ireland to be treated differently from other countries, even though the whole world understands the urgency of this problem. I have a number of simple proposals which would help us to resolve this problem and meet our 2020 targets. First, the Government should massively expand the afforestation programme to mitigate the effects of agriculture.We have achieved fewer than half the targets that were set years ago in respect of afforestation and the Government still has no real plans to increase activity in this area. Second, can we just introduce a ban on fracking? Why would we even consider allowing fracking when we are trying to meet climate change targets?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When one looks at the flooding engulfing huge parts of the country, one realises - given that this is happening so frequently - how serious this problem is and how much it is costing us. It is not a problem that will arise in the distant future; it is happening now. Our afforestation targets are pathetic. They are less than half of what they should be at 6,000 hectares per year when to achieve the forest cover we need, they should be twice that. Will the Minister of State respond on the issue of banning fracking? There should be absolutely no consideration of fracking and bringing up gas and oil for health and environmental reasons when we have to meet these targets and the Government is pleading that it cannot meet them. It resisted binding targets in the climate change legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As we face into Christmas, the housing and homelessness crisis continues to spiral out of control. My question requests that the Minister of State consider three measures to deliver immediate and permanent social housing on a greater scale and more quickly, including, rather than the construction of modular homes, the purchase online via Myhome.ie of 739 houses currently for sale for less than €200,000 which would ensure the availability of permanent homes for people before Christmas. The cost of construction per modular unit is €190,000. The houses to which I have referred are available at a cost of €200,000 each. The Government needs to purchase these houses and thereby provide people with permanent homes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is paying €190,000 per unit for 500 modular houses, many of which will not be delivered until the end of next near. There are 739 houses listed for sale today on the Myhome.ie website, each of which cost less than €200,000. Why would the Government choose to buy temporary modular homes, many of which will not be delivered until next year, when it could purchase 739 houses online today, many of which could be refurbished and ready for occupation before Christmas, thereby providing people with permanent homes? I am proposing that this is what the Government should do with the money it has available. In regard to the 2,000 housing units to be provided by NAMA, this is a pathetic return from NAMA as the biggest real estate agent in the world. We need to open up the books of NAMA, which is currently selling off huge blocks of land to vulture funds from the US, including LoneStar.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Rather than allow the sale of that land, the Government should be putting that land and NAMA properties into the hands of the local authorities to assist them in housing provision. To short-circuit the excess delays in the delivery of social housing, I propose that the Government provide housing in-house through the local authorities rather than outsource responsibility in that regard because that process only adds a further year to the delivery of social housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As we approach Christmas, 1,000 children are either living on our streets or in emergency accommodation. What is the priority? There are 739 apartments or houses available for sale in Dublin for less than €200,000 each, which could become permanent homes. Why would the Government choose to spend €190,000 per unit on modular houses, which are temporary homes in which it is proposed people will reside for only six months, when it could purchase 739 permanent homes in Dublin today, thereby removing those 1,000 children from the street, which is utterly unacceptable? Will the Minister of State respond to my question in regard to the opening up of the commercial books of NAMA? NAMA has failed us in terms of the delivery of social housing. We need to open up its books with a view to increasing the proposed 2,000 units return, which is a pathetic return from NAMA.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We had news again today that rents continue to spiral out of control, which will result in more evictions and make it more difficult for people to secure private rented accommodation. My question relates to a measure the Government could take to prevent evictions. I refer to circumstances where a tenant is working and his or her landlord wishes to raise the rent but is willing to enter into an arrangement with the local authority under the rental accommodation scheme. In such cases, the tenant may not enter the scheme because local authorities will not allow people to transfer to the scheme unless they are in receipt of rent allowance, even though persons who are in the scheme may work subsequently. This is a crazy anomaly. If the Government were to change the rental accommodation scheme to allow landlords who are willing to engage with the scheme to do so, it would prevent people who are working from being evicted.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State said he would do everything he could to prevent homelessness. I have cited a specific scenario, examples of which will increase as rents continue to spiral. I have encountered a number of these cases. People who are working and living in private rented accommodation for which the landlord is seeking to increase the rent are being unnecessarily evicted because local authorities are precluded, under the terms of the rental accommodation scheme, from allowing such tenants to transfer into the scheme. This is despite the fact that persons who transfer to RAS are allowed to work. In the cases I have highlighted, the landlords are willing to enter the rental accommodation scheme. Given that most local authorities do not operate the housing assistance payment, it is no good for the Minister of State to be telling us that the HAP is coming down the line. It is crazy that the Minister has not issued an instruction to local authorities to accept cases where the landlord of a tenant who happens to be working is willing to enter a lease arrangement with the local authority. This simple measure would prevent tenants being put out on the street.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The scheme is not available in many areas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not dismissing the HAP scheme. While I am not terribly happy with it, my point is that it is ridiculous to operate it in some local authorities and not in others. As a result of the failure of the Government to instruct local authorities to make a deal with landlords who are willing to enter an arrangement with them, tenants are being put out on the street. All I am asking is that an administrative change is made. There is nothing to prevent the Minister making this change to prevent people from being put out. It is a ridiculous anomaly that people who are working are being evicted, even though under the terms of the rental accommodation scheme, a recipient may remain in the scheme after he or she gets a job. Councils are not allowed to sanction the transfer into the rental accommodation scheme of tenants threatened with eviction, even in cases where the landlord is willing to enter RAS, simply because the tenant is working. This is ridiculous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Funding is not the issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State does not understand the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will explain the matter to the Minister of State afterwards.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government should be utterly ashamed of itself for the Bill and for bringing it to the Dáil on international human rights day. The Labour Party should be especially ashamed of itself, as its members parade around as champions of equality but support a Bill which is regressive, cruel and draconian with regard to some of the most vulnerable people in the world. It is deeply ironic that a Bill such as this could be put forward when we have a disaster in Syria which has forced half the country's population to flee in desperate circumstances. They have been herded into camps surrounded by barbed wire in Greece and elsewhere, they have drowned in the Mediterranean and they are desperately in need of assistance and refuge. What we should have is a Bill which offers a compassionate, generous and independent system of asylum which does away with the utter scandal of direct provision and gives rights to asylum seekers, particularly to their children, prioritises them, gives them the support they need and gives them the right to work and participate in society. All these things which should be in the Bill, especially at this time, are not in the Bill. Instead what we have is a Bill which is about fast-tracking cruel deportations and making them easier to carry out, with none of the safeguards necessary to vindicate the rights of some of the most desperate and vulnerable people in the world. It is utterly shameful. Mohamed Ali Sleyum was mentioned earlier. He is an example of what needed to be addressed in the Bill. He was a Tanzanian man who was deported from this country in April 2014, and within hours of going back to Tanzania he was beaten and a few hours later he was dead, because we got it wrong. We deported somebody who should not have been deported. Now we have a Bill which makes the kind of tragic mistake more and not less likely. The Bill removes the right to a proper appeals process and the necessary supports, essentially refuses to recognise the reality of people arriving here, and instead facilitates a fast-track deportation process and more dawn raids by gardaí bursting into people's houses without warrants from a court to pack them off on planes and, potentially in many cases, put them back to the horror they tried to escape in the first place. It is shameful and it is a damning indictment that the Irish Refugee Council, Nasc, Doras Luimní, the Children's Rights Alliance and Anti-Deportation Ireland, and the list goes on, have either opposed and condemned the Bill outright or have said it is way short of what it should be and needs to be very substantially amended. Instead this is what we get. All of the key issues of injustice in the scandal of direct provision that were identified by the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, of which I am a member, and by working groups were all ignored and instead what we have is a process to fast-track deportation and deny proper justice to people. I underline the point that all this is made even more shameful when the Government is again complicit in creating the conditions which lead to desperate people fleeing their countries by facilitating the US war machine at Shannon Airport, which has resulted in the barbaric wars in Afghanistan and Iraq and now another war in Syria. These have created the conditions that gave rise to organisations such as Daesh and have produced this unprecedented refugee crisis. We either create the conditions for people to be forced to flee their homes or we do nothing, at least, to speak up against the actions that lead to the crises in the first place, and then we have a cruel fortress which denies people the right to asylum and human dignity and the protection of their rights and the rights of their children and their families. The Government should be ashamed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We on this side of the House are too often obliged to voice our dissatisfaction with the guillotining of legislation and this Government's underhand parliamentary tactics in pushing through Bills in order to avoid debate or for some other political reason. What is being done in the case of this particular Bill is especially shameful because it is one of the most important legislative measures we have dealt with all year. For it to be pushed through at the last minute and the debate guillotined is outrageous. I may be wasting my voice and time here but I appeal to the media to take cognisance of the significance of the Bill. It might not be very sexy compared with the more sensationalist stuff the media likes to focus on but it is about something of great importance for people in this country, which is the provision of quality housing for those who desperately need it and dealing with associated planning issues. It also touches on a range of other issues which I will refer to presently. It is outrageous that the Bill is to be rammed through without proper consideration. Of course, this fits into a pattern that is becoming increasingly apparent whereby this Government is seeking to exploit the housing crisis. There is no other way to describe it. It is doing so in order to unleash once again the evils of the Celtic tiger, evils which brought us Priory Hall, the pyrite scandal and unplanned and unregulated development, with all the terrible consequences of these things for the entire economy and for proper planning and development in the key area of housing.This is about facilitating that. In this Bill, the Government is dancing to the tune of the Construction Industry Federation. There is no doubt about it. It is exploiting the justified demand to increase the supply of social and affordable housing and to deal with the housing and homelessness crisis, not as a means to deal with these problems but to let our developer friends off the hook again. These developers will not provide the social housing we need. They never have before and they will not do it in the future. The Government talks about supply and says we have to increase supply and incentivise the private sector. That is what this Bill is about: incentivising the private sector, relaxing the planning regulations and so on, to encourage our old friends, the developers, to believe they can make money in the current situation because if we do that, we will deal with the housing crisis. I ask the Minister and anybody else looking at this debate whether increasing the supply, per se, provides social and affordable housing or deals with housing and homelessness problems. It does not at all and this seriously needs to be debated on a national level. We were building 70,000 to 90,000 houses a year, mostly in the private sector, before the crash, in the boom period. Did it improve the housing and homelessness situation? No. The problem got worse during that period. It got even worse after the crash, but it got worse consistently throughout the period of the Celtic tiger. The idea that we can solve the housing and homelessness crisis by upping the supply from the private sector is a total fallacy. It is an ideological fallacy that rationalises the greed and profit-seeking of the private developers, which is what the Government is doing. It is an automatic impulse for the Government to imagine that in dealing with any problem, we have to facilitate our private developer friends. In doing that, we are now going to sacrifice proper planning and development and proper building standards. That is shameful, given the consequences this had in the past. We do not even fully know the consequences it had. We are going to find out in a few decades, but we have seen elements of it with Priory Hall, with pyrite and with God knows what else that was built during that period because of poor building standards and because the developers were let off the hook. Now the Minister wants the power to prevent local authorities from ensuring we have adequate standards at a local level if those standards go beyond the national standards. Shamefully, I believe the Minister has instructed Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council that some of the measures it agreed in the development plan in terms of ensuring good building standards have to be deleted from the plan. He is riding roughshod over democracy. Those proposals included that 50% of all non-residential development should have green roofs - a very sensible measure, given our aspirations on climate change and all the rest of it - and the passive housing requirement about proper insulation, which helps mitigate climate change, is much better for the health of the people living in these places and will save on heating and all that. Those provisions are almost certainly the ones the Minister has directed the council to delete. They are precisely the measures we need to have a good standard of housing, but instead he wants to delete them in order that developers can build cheap, poor quality stuff to make money out of it. That is what the Government is doing and it is shameful. I can see what is going on here in that we will have the modular housing, from which some of our private developer friends could make money in the short term, and then, because we do not want to build actual physical, permanent council houses, our private developer friends, the vulture funds and so on will come in with the permanent stuff, which they will then lease to the Government for social housing at huge cost and make a killing off it. It is outrageous. What should we be doing? The Minister of State will say we need the stuff fast. I will tell him how we will get it fast. It is very simple. Start with what I said earlier this morning: buy up the substantial stock of existing housing in Dublin and elsewhere for the people who need it on an emergency basis. That would be just as cheap but much more permanent and appropriate for the people who are in emergency situations. Provide the rent controls, not the flimsy rent certainty the Government was talking about, and increase rent allowance. Open the books of NAMA to see what it actually has rather than accepting whatever it throws at local authorities, which is undoubtedly mostly the crap stuff it thinks it cannot make money out of. We want to see what it actually has - land, property and so on - in order that we can give it over to those who need it. How do we fast-track without overriding proper building and planning and development standards? We set up a State construction company in order that we take a year out of the construction process. The Government is saying it takes two years to build houses. One year of that is a result of the outsourcing of the design and construction to private developers through the tendering process. That is taking up a year. We have a breakdown from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. A year of this big delay the Government is talking about is because local authorities cannot do it themselves directly. If we did not have to tender out and if we had the teams, the architect, the construction workers, the equipment and so on in the local authorities, like we used to have, we could deliver the social housing in a year, and not modular homes but quality stuff. That is what we should do. NAMA could be the vehicle for it if its mandate were changed and if it were resourced to construct these houses directly. We could build on the land it has, finish the properties that are not ready, and we could do it much quicker without having to sacrifice building standards, proper planning and development, public consultation and local democracy, which is what this Bill is doing. It is outrageous.
