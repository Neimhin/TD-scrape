RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have never heard that before.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not say anything in the last discussion because I wanted to get my head around it. As it happens, I commend the Minister. I think it is quite a radical measure. It is welcome. I am not sure how many properties it will free up but it will certainly help, so fair play to the Minister. My comment is on the Bill itself. The Bill contains plans to impose administrative sanctions, carry out investigations of landlords, to extend notice periods, registration of landlords and tenancies, publication of determinations and so on. They are all welcome and I will support the Bill. I think this is also a missed opportunity to go further given the scale of the crisis that we are facing. If it was me bringing forward this Bill, it would be called the residential tenancies (emergency measures) Bill and it would have more in it. However much this Bill is a step forward, which it is, it will not address the crisis. It may have some impact, which is to be welcomed, but it is not up to the scale of the crisis. Most obviously, evictions are a major reason for the flow into homelessness and the Bill does not address that. That is a missed opportunity. We have amendments to that effect in different sections so I will not delay at this point. I would like to hear the Minister's response to that. Across the road from my constituency office in Dún Laoghaire is a block of apartments. In that block of apartments, which I am pretty certain was in the hands of NAMA and then ended up in the hands of a crowd called Apollo Global Management-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise. A vulture fund and property speculator got hold of it. It first made attempts to ratchet up the rents by approximately 60%. That was resisted by the tenants with our support. It moved on after that to try to evict everybody on the basis of substantial refurbishment. The residents resisted it. That was successful. It is good that they are still there but many of the residents were so worn down and traumatised by the experience that they just left. Now there are just ten tenants in the place. The big fear that they have, given the previous record of this property investor, is that once it drops to nine, they can move on, because sale is a grounds for eviction. There are now, disgracefully, about nine units just sitting empty, but refurbishments are being done to allow the company to increase the rent and it will almost certainly sell it on. People phone me every few weeks to say that something is happening and to ask whether they are facing eviction, because there have been two attempts to drive them out. This Bill does not deal with that and it should. That picture is replicated across the country. I put that to the Minister. I will not delay. We will discuss some of these issues on an amendment-by-amendment basis further down the line but I think it is a missed opportunity and there is a failure to recognise the emergency situation that we are in.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that the substantial refurbishments definition is an improvement and it is why I am supporting the Bill, but it does not deal with the substantial fear that now hangs over those residents. When the number of residents drops to nine, which it will at some point, a vulture fund or property investor, whatever one calls it, which has a clear history of trying to drive those people out, will move. It will sell it because that is what it does. It will flip that property which has accumulated in value and it will evict those people. The Minister's Bill does nothing to protect them when it happens.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They have to sell with the tenants.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do I need to move amendment No. 13?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This relates to the definition of landlord. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It states that any financial institution, equity fund or investment fund that has taken possession of a dwelling that is the subject of an existing tenancy but where no receiver has been appointed would be included in the definition of landlord. It also proposes to change the definition of tenancy to include a periodic tenancy. It states:‘tenancy’ includes a periodic tenancy, a tenancy for a fixed term, a periodic licence to reside in student specific accommodation, or a licence to reside for a fixed term in student specific accommodation, whether oral or in writing or implied, and, where the context so admits, includes a sub-tenancy and a tenancy, sub-tenancy or licence that has been terminated. It also proposes to change the definition of tenant. It states:‘tenant’ means the person for the time being entitled to the occupation of a dwelling under a tenancy or licence to reside at student specific accommodation and, where the context so admits, includes a person who has ceased to be entitled to that occupation by reason of the termination of his or her tenancy or licence.I would like to hear the Minister's response.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not see why not. When debating the previous Residential Tenancies Bill, we highlighted many loopholes that existed. We turned out to be right and at the time we were either dismissed or promised that they would be addressed in the future. Those loopholes were subsequently exploited to the detriment of many people who were evicted or found themselves in difficulty because of loopholes in the previous Bill. The Minister should take the opportunity to address any loopholes or grey areas that could allow landlords to evade their responsibilities or to act in a way that is detrimental to tenants, particularly in cases of receivership. We should also cover all angles relating to students so that students can enjoy all the rights that tenants should enjoy. That is the purpose of the amendment and I fail to understand why the Minister does not want to deal with that in the Bill because we do not know when the next Bill will be.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will take on board what Deputy Ó Broin said about students and I will look at that. To use exactly the same example that I used earlier, the tenants do not know who they are dealing with, given the place has been taken over by a fund, and they do not know if the place is changing hands. One minute they are dealing with property agents or people employed by somebody who manages the place, but it is not clear. They do not know who to go to when there are difficulties. It is an unacceptable and stressful situation from the point of view of those tenants. I fail to not understand why the Minister would not want to deal with that in this Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is this amendment about registration fees?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I saw something from the Irish Council for Social Housing regarding its concern about AHBs having to pay registration fees, given that they are not for profit and are largely publicly funded, and the financial burden.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a later one - okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I see the logic in having as much up-to-date information as possible about all tenancies, including those of AHBs. I understand that that is presumably the consideration of the Minister and echoed by Deputy Ó Broin. However I have very serious concerns about the administrative capacity of approved housing bodies to deal with the proposed requirements. The extra burden under the new section would dovetail with substantial additional burdens that are being placed generally on AHBs large and small. In the past week or two, I came across a concrete example of how ill-equipped approved housing bodies are to deal with welfare issues, anti-social issues and complaints and so on about the quality of the accommodation. The case to which I refer arose in a new approved housing body development in my area that came in under Part V. AHBs do not have the administrative resources to deal with those issues. This amendment would place a further administrative burden upon them. Although I see the logic behind the amendment, I point out to the Minister that there is a real difficulty. A general burden is being imposed on AHBs and they simply are not capable of dealing with it. This amendment would add to that burden. The inability of the AHBs to cope with the administrative burden will become more and more apparent because of the over-reliance on AHBs. I do not understand what is the logic or criteria when deciding to give responsibility to develop a Part V social housing project to an AHB rather than the county council, which has more administrative capacity to deal with these issues. The decisions seem completely arbitrary. In my area, much of the Part V development seems to be going to AHBs, which do not have the capacity to cope. This amendment will add to their burden. I am raising a wider issue but it needs to be flagged. Notwithstanding that there is a rationale for the amendment, it will add to the administrative burden on AHBs. I would be interested to hear the comments of the Minister in that regard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I said at the outset, the Minister has a point.However, it is indisputable that approved housing bodies, AHBs, do not have the administrative resources that are available to local authorities. I do not understand how he can say that this does not add to the administrative burden on AHBs in a situation where I would strongly argue they are already under-resourced from an administrative point of view. They have said it themselves. The AHB representatives have come before this committee and said there is a burden being imposed on them, and that was prior to this, for which they are not geared up.  The Minister did not answer my question, and I am curious about this, as to the basis on which decisions are made that Part 5 tenancies, which are a significant part of the Government's plans to deliver social housing, be given to an AHB rather than taken on by the council. Does the Minister issue guidelines on that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister does not know the answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This abolishes substantial refurbishment or renovation as a ground for eviction, in line with our view that we need to stop all evictions for the foreseeable future, given the crisis we face. More generally, beyond this immediate crisis, we need for those who enter into the rental sector to understand that the people who rent from them have rights and require security of tenancy. We often talk about having a rental sector that is more like the European model. Various people say we have to accept there will be a bigger rental sector in Ireland. It seems to me that we cannot do that unless we change fundamentally the nature of the private rental sector to the effect that those who get involved in the business of renting out property understand that this is not just something they can flit into and flit out of again, treat tenants with contempt, disregard the impact of their actions on tenants or leave them high and dry.It speaks for itself. I do not see why renovation or substantial refurbishment should be a ground for eviction. I refer to the example I am familiar with, as it is staring me in the face every day across the road from my constituency clinic on Main Street, Dún Laoghaire. This is a loophole speculators and property investors are constantly trying to utilise. We need to close it down. If someone needs to renovate a place, it does not mean the tenants have to leave. They can be housed somewhere else for a while. Indeed, one of the points we made when they were trying to evict tenants from that particular development was that they had a couple of empty places anyway and there was no reason they could not undertake the refurbishments and move tenants around as they did so within the same development. That is what they should do. Landlords need to have a responsibility to tenants and understand tenants have a right to long-term secure tenancies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will comment on the Minister's first point. His intention may have been to prevent people coming in merely to benefit from capital appreciation. That is not what is going on. It was, indeed, the justification that was cited by the then Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, at the time and I have heard it repeated by the Minister and others. That is not what has gone on. What has gone on is people have swooped in precisely to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am commenting on what the Minister said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why did the Chairman not pull the Minister up then?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are not. I am responding to what the Minister said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am responding to what the Minister said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am pointing out to the Minister that is not what has happened. There should be measures to deal with that fact but there are not. The people who have come in are simply looking to buy into the market, wait for property values to increase and sometimes use refurbishment as the way to drive up the value. That is what they are doing. I, again, cite the place across the road from my clinic. That is exactly what they are doing. As we speak, they are making substantial refurbishments to ten of those apartments. That will drive up the value. When the number of existing tenants in the occupied places drops to nine, I guarantee they will move to sell that place and to benefit from the capital appreciation. On the amendment itself, we need to close off all loopholes that could lead to eviction at present and that is the logic of this. There is no justification for any evictions at this juncture.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. The amendment removes renovation or sale as grounds for terminating a tenancy. We have made the argument, and the Anti-Evictions Bill 2018, which seeks to do this, has passed Second Stage in the Dáil notwithstanding the Government's opposition to it. We think that it is unconscionable to allow any evictions in the face of a housing and homelessness emergency where evicting people from the private rental sector is a major contributory factor to the shameful level of homelessness. These grounds, therefore, should be removed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 49 echoes the Anti-Evictions Bill 2018 that has passed Second Stage in the Dáil and requires that where a tenancy is terminated for reasons of a landlord seeking to accommodate a member of his family, he should be required to pay six months' rent to the tenant as compensation for the termination of the tenancy. It is in line with comments I have made that the rental sector has to change and that only in exceptional circumstances should a landlord have the right to evict people. People going into the business of renting property need to know in advance that it is going to be difficult and costly for them to evict people because of the impact that has on tenants, families and so on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This amendment provides for longer notice periods than those proposed by the Government. I will not go through the details but we have to give people as much time as possible because it is nigh on impossible, in many circumstances, for people to find alternative accommodation. Even the Government's improved notice periods, in the current climate, are not adequate. We propose substantially longer notice periods.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sometimes tenants are unable to pay their rent for genuine reasons and those tenants should have protection if they have legitimate reasons for being unable to pay the rent. I will give the example of people who are currently topping up with HAP payments, of whom there are a lot, and it will become increasingly an issue. It seems to be semi-official policy now, because HAP limits are completely inadequate, that people are topping-up over and above what is provided by the HAP payment to meet the excessive rents that are being charged and that is unsustainable in many cases. Many of those people are going to get themselves into difficulty despite their best efforts. Some of the top-ups are in excess of what would legally be allowed, for example, for the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection to deduct from somebody's social welfare payment. The top-ups are driving people into extreme poverty. Somebody should not be evicted for being poor as a result of a dysfunctional market and the failures of Government policy. This is a protection for people who genuinely cannot afford to pay, to prevent them being evicted.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are complementary.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They cover the same sort of ground where landlords are falsely justifying the termination of a Part 4 tenancy. Amendment No. 170 proposes to hold them accountable for doing that and, similarly, amendment No. 180 is in the same territory and trying to tighten that up to ensure landlords are held fully accountable for any false declarations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 13:In page 6, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:“Amendment of section 5 of Act of 20043. Section 5 of the Act of 2004 is amended in subsection (1):(a) by the substitution of the following definition, for the definition of “landlord”—“ ‘landlord’ means the person for the time being entitled to receive (otherwise than as agent for another person, excepting where that person is acting as receiver) the rent paid in respect of a dwelling by the tenant thereof and, where the context so admits, includes a person who has ceased to be so entitled by reason of the termination of the tenancy. For the avoidance of doubt, ‘landlord’ also means any lender, financial institution, equity fund or investment fund that taken possession of a dwelling that is the subject of an existing tenancy but where no receiver has been appointed;”,(b) by the substitution of the following definition, for the definition of “tenancy”—“ ‘tenancy’ includes a periodic tenancy, a tenancy for a fixed term, a periodic licence to reside in student specific accommodation, or a licence to reside for a fixed term in student specific accommodation, whether oral or in writing or implied, and, where the context so admits, includes a sub-tenancy and a tenancy, sub-tenancy or licence that has been terminated;”,and(c) by the substitution of the following definition, for the definition of “tenant”—“ ‘tenant’ means the person for the time being entitled to the occupation of a dwelling under a tenancy or licence to reside at student specific accommodation and, where the context so admits, includes a person who has ceased to be entitled to that occupation by reason of the termination of his or her tenancy or licence.”.”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 14:In page 6, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:“Amendment of section 16 of Act of 2004 - to abolish substantial refurbishment or renovation as ground for termination of a tenancy3. Section 16 of the Act of 2004 is amended in paragraph (a), subparagraph (i) by the insertion of the following after “payment,”:“except in relation to periods when the property has been vacated for the purpose of substantial refurbishment or renovation,”.”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us take a concrete example, with which the Minister is familiar.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is in Sandyford which is not in my constituency, although the Minister will remember that I was involved in the issue. I-RES REIT tried to increase the rent by 40%-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was in the public domain.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the protection. The landlord there tried to jack up the rent by an enormous amount. It would have meant the rent increasing from €2,200 to €2,800, which is shocking. The fact that the rent was €2,200 in the first instance is just shocking, and the landlord was going to increase it to €2,800. It was affecting dozens of young people, many of them students and some of them young workers working in Sandyford. They were absolutely distraught.Because of the publicity the protest received, the company decided to back off but the loophole was clearly there and it was acting within its legal rights. Is the Minister's proposal going to prevent this kind of thing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that even if a place was not rented for two years previously?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was not captured by the RPZ provisions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was not quite €1,000 so maybe it was 30% - I cannot remember exactly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will thoroughly examine that to make sure that is the case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If it does the job, I will accept it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not think substantial refurbishments justify higher rents because rents are completely out of control at the moment and we should not allow any other mechanisms for rents to be raised over and above where they are. I do not think that doing things to an apartment or other property that need to be done should justify massive rent increases. Rents are not set at affordable levels and the Government is doing nothing to set them at affordable levels. Other amendments of mine will deal with other aspects of the problem but we should not provide any mechanism for landlords to put up rents that are already excessive, extortionate and unaffordable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I get the thinking behind extensions from two to three bedrooms with a genuine and significant expansion of the space but, as I understand the Minister's proposal, modifications to more than 50% of the floor space would be covered.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister for the clarification and it does improve matters so I will consider it again between now and Report Stage. If a property is at the lower end of the BER ratings, a jump by two points would not be very difficult and the box could be ticked relatively easily. It is different at the top levels.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have an amendment later which will propose that, to be deemed significant, there should be two criteria for BER improvements. One should be that it goes to the top two categories and the other is that it should jump three points. That is a tighter way of doing it and will ensure it will genuinely make a difference, rather than simply ticking a box. I can see potential for messing in regard to the internal layout. I believe they are doing this across the road from me at the moment. I do not think there will be any substantial change to the size of the apartments in question but I am certain they are going to ask to go beyond the RPZ limits. I would be highly surprised, however, if anything dramatic has changed but they might manage to get through these tests.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take the point that it is an improvement and the Minister is genuinely trying to put in safeguards. It may merit a little more thought and consideration of the detail on all sides. We have to look at certain test cases. One could go into that apartment block across the road from me to see what that company has put in for. It would be interesting to see. I am certain that what it is doing is to try to have a higher than 4% rent increase. Judging from what I can see from the outside, there definitely will not be an increase in space. We shall see whether that passes muster. What we propose is a little tighter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is on the same lines. I will consider what the Minister has said and we will possibly come back to it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are all related.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is exactly the same.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 31 provides that if the landlord fails to comply with the regulations of the Act, he or she will be guilty of an offence and liable to a class A fine or a maximum of two years' imprisonment, or on conviction on indictment, a fine not exceeding €50,000 or imprisonment for a maximum of five years. That is basically getting tough with the landlords if they-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----break the law or mess around. They will know it is a serious business.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Maybe we should add that in.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let me just clarify this. Does this mean imprisonment in certain circumstances or not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Leaving joking about stocks aside, some of the cases we have had have been of horrific abuses by landlords and we do need severe penalties for the real rogues.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did we discuss amendment No. 15?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 39 extends notice periods from 90 days to 180 days. I have pretty much made the case for this earlier so I will not repeat the argument, but particularly in the current circumstances and generally as well, we need to give people more time because being forced to leave one's home is a big deal, it often puts people in great difficulty, and they should be given the maximum amount of time possible to find alternative accommodation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 18:In page 6, to delete lines 8 to 37, and in page 7, to delete lines 1 to 6 and substitute the following:“(c) by deleting subsection 5(b).”.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 186:In page 33, after line 4, to insert the following:“PART 4MISCELLANEOUS
Amendment of sections 28, 34, 55, 56, 57, Chapters 4 and 5 of Act of 2004 - to make Part 4 tenancies indefinite
26. (a) Section 28(2)(a) of the Act of 2004 is amended by the substitution of “for an indefinite period from” for “for the period of 6 years from”.(b) Section 34(b) of the Act of 2004 is hereby repealed.(c) Chapter 4 of the Act of 2004 is hereby repealed.(d) Chapter 5 of the Act of 2004 is hereby repealed.(e) Section 55(1) is amended by the deletion of “or a further Part 4 tenancy”.(f) Section 55 is amended by the substitution of the following for subsection (2):“(2) A termination under section 34 on one or more of the grounds specified in paragraphs 2 to 6 of the Table to that section of a Part 4 tenancy or a further Part 4 tenancy shall not be regarded as a termination of that tenancy for the purposes of section 17(1)(a) of the Landlord and Tenant (Amendment) Act 1980.”.(g) Section 56(1)(a) is amended by the deletion of “, or under a further Part 4 tenancy,”.(h) Section 57(b) is amended by the deletion of “or further Part 4 tenancy”.”.This amendment aims to make Part 4 tenancies indefinite, something we discussed earlier in respect of other amendments. The Government has said it wants to go on this road but cannot do it now. We do not accept that; we think Part 4 tenancies should be indefinite to give security to tenants. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 187:In page 33, after line 4, to insert the following:“PART 4MISCELLANEOUS“Amendment of section 34 and 56 of Act of 2004 - to abolish sale of a property as a ground for terminating a tenancy26. (a) The Act of 2004 is amended by the deletion of paragraph 3 of the Table to section 34.(b) Paragraph 4(b)(ii) of the Table to section 34 is amended by the substitution of “the ground specified in paragraph 1, 2 or 6 of this Table” for “the ground specified in paragraph 1, 2, 3 or 6 of this Table”.(c) Section 56(c)(i) is hereby repealed.(d) The Act of 2004 is amended by the deletion of subparagraph (c)(i) of the Table to section 56.”.This amendment is to abolish sale of property as a ground for terminating a tenancy. It is a critical issue, which we will be marching to vindicate on 18 May. We hope there will be tens of thousands of people out marching for this demand. This is a critical measure to give security to tenants which is sadly lacking. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of my amendments was ruled out of order. It would affect the Title because it would be a substantial provision in the Bill. There is a big problem with new tenancies and the setting of their rents which neither current nor proposed legislation deals with. For a brand new tenancy the rent can be set at any level at all. We can see that rents are being set at extortionate levels. There was a place in the docks where they were talking about charging €3,300 a month. Something has to be done about that. I am not sure why my amendment was ruled out of order but I will check with the Bills Office. I am not challenging that decision but the proposal was that the RTB should set rents for new tenancies, that affordability should be a factor in setting them, and that the Minister should provide guidelines as to how that might be done in consultation with this committee. One of the reasons RPZs are not limiting rents to the extent that the Minister or we might want is that new tenancies are being created all the time. The more building there is, the more will be created and landlords are totally free to set rents at whatever level they like. Something has to be done about that but nothing is being done about it.
