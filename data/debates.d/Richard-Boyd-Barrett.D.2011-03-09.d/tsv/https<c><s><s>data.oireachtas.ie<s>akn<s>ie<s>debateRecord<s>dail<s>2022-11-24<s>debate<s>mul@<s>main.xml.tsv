RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Gaelscoil Laighean in my area was recently denied planning permission for temporary buildings on the Mount Anville site, which Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown county councillors agreed to dispose of earlier this year in order to provide a site for both temporary and permanent buildings for the school. Parents have expressed absolute disbelief and fury that this is now the third planning permission application for temporary buildings that has been put in by the Department and been refused. They asked whether the Department of Education knows how to put in a planning application for a school that has been looking for a location for seven years now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The conditions the planning application failed to meet were around things like lack of public lighting, lack of proper pest control, failure to put in correct waste management systems and other green conditions in those conditions mentioned by the Minister. What the parents of Gaelscoil Laighean find really hard to believe is that where there are particular conditions around building a temporary school building - bear in mind, this school has been authorised to exist since 2015 and has been in a completely inappropriate temporary situation in Deansgrange since then - the Department does not know how to put in a planning application that meets these conditions. Therefore, we get delay after delay. Can the Minister explain that? Can she give a clear timeline as to when the school will gain access to the Mount Anville site? What is the timeline for the completion of not only the temporary but the permanent school buildings for Gaelscoil Laighean?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It still seems quite extraordinary that some of those conditions could not be met and that we have delays around the failure to meet some of them, some of which I just outlined. One would have thought people would know how to meet these sorts of basic conditions, or "green conditions" as they were described to me. We must also remember that this is a long saga. The school was originally promised a site at Newtownpark Avenue. Then, there was a long battle to get another site. We had to have council land that had been originally zoned for housing disposed to the school.The site was given to the school because Gaelscoil Laighean needed a site. They seriously question when they will actually gain access. What is the timeline for access to the Mount Anville site for temporary buildings, and the timeline for the completion of the permanent school buildings for Gaelscoil Laighean? Is it possible to get answers to those questions because, otherwise, things seem to just drag on and on?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the last few hours, thejournal.ie reported that Irish troops were being assessed by NATO assessors in the uplands of north Cork, between Mitchelstown and Fermoy. They were being assessed by a US Navy commander, Sam Mason, who is part of the NATO command. Very worryingly, Commandant Daire Roache explained that this is "part of a program that is for partner nations within NATO." Every week, we see further evidence that this Government is trying to destroy what is left of our neutrality and bring us in with NATO by stealth. How on earth can anyone look at this report and see anything other than the Irish Government pushing into a military alliance with NATO, destroying our neutrality?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Despite having the best conditions in Europe for growing trees, we have a totally dysfunctional forestry model in this country, and that has not changed in the 11 years I have been a Deputy. I do not claim to be an expert on forestry, but my interest was piqued beyond a general interest in forests as just being beautiful places before that when, in 2013, the Government of the day agreed with the troika to sell the harvesting rights of Coillte's entire forest estate. At the time, I tabled what was the first Private Member's motion on forestry to the House - it was possibly the only such motion tabled in that Dáil - as part of the campaign to prevent the agreed sell-off of Coillte's harvesting rights to, most likely, an entity called the International Forestry Fund, which at the time was fronted by the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and was operating from a little office in Eblana Avenue, Dún Laoghaire, where the main financiers behind it were a crowd called Helvetica Wealth Management Partners, a Swiss wealth asset management operation. The plan was to go from the fairly dysfunctional Coillte model of planting Sitka spruce, which was commercially driven and was experiencing consistent failure to achieve afforestation targets, to simply the wholesale privatisation of forests. The large protests we held at the time were successful. We mobilised huge protests in Rathdrum, Avondale and elsewhere throughout the country and, as a result, the then Government abandoned the agreed plan in the memorandum of understanding with the troika to sell off the harvesting rights, which was an important victory. Sadly, however, while that should have prompted a fundamental rethinking of the forestry model, to move it away from that sort of corporatised focus with an industrial forest model based on Sitka spruce and monocultures, demonstrating a failure to take advantage of the climatic conditions in this country to develop Irish forestry, things have remained much the same for the interceding 11 years. Despite often reasonable rhetoric, promises of change and promises to hit increased afforestation targets and to move away from the industrial monocultural model, we heard recently that there is a plan for Coillte to team up with Gresham House Asset Management, an investment fund, to advance afforestation in Ireland.  That says it all. Coillte has been operating a largely for-profit venture, albeit with some decorative nods to the idea of getting back to developing native woodlands, diversifying Ireland’s forest estate, developing a sustainable forest model and acting generally as the guardians of the forest estate. Instead it is teaming up with an international investment fund to compete with farmers rather than support them, as its role should be. It is going to compete with them and, potentially, run them out of business, making it even more difficult for them to engage in forestry, when we should be doing precisely the opposite. This is happening to the extent that we are thoroughly discrediting the entire project of afforestation in the minds of many in rural Ireland, who might be interested in forestry if they were supported and if Coillte saw its role not as one operating as a dominant, business-corporate force competing with the small farmer but rather as one that would support them, and also as one that operates as the guardian of the forest estate, and it seems as though nothing has changed in that regard. We hear about some moves to transition the monocultural plantations of Coillte to more diverse native woodlands, but how much of that is happening? When we think about the campaign we had to have recently with Killegar Wood in Enniskerry, where Coillte had planned, quietly, to sell off a forest to whomever, we wonder what is really going on in Coillte and what its agenda is. Indeed, given that 57.7% of the personnel involved in the forest policy group that formed Project Woodland come from a commercial background, we again get a sense of the Government not understanding that we need dramatically to change our forestry model whereby, in particular, Coillte would have a role as the guardian of the forest estate while simultaneously supporting small farmers. If we want farmers to move into forestry and to assist us in climate action and in enhancing biodiversity, we genuinely have to support them, engage with them and listen to them.Simultaneously, Coillte's fundamental mandate has to change from the one it is currently operating. I suspect, sadly, that we are still a long way from that.
