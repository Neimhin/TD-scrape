RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As well as knowing about the potentially disastrous consequences of constructing further data centres for CO2 emissions and water usage, it is important that ordinary people, who may not know much about what data centres are, know what value they give in terms of employment, which is little. As Deputy Murphy explained, much of what they do is highly questionable in respect of their contribution to the betterment of society. People also need to understand that there is a connection between the significant energy price hikes that they have experienced over the past year and data centres. Energy prices are going up and people’s bills are increasing because there is a major surge in demand for energy globally, with data centres in this country and throughout the world contributing significantly to that surge. People need to understand that this issue is, in the first instance, about the climate emergency and the damage such centres do to our environment, but it is also hitting people in their pockets as we speak with hikes of between 20% and 40% in their energy bills. People in this country have been subject two, three or four energy price hikes, amounting to hundreds of euro annually. As well as saying we should stop the construction of data centres, we should insist that carbon tax increases be set aside in the next budget. Any increase on top of those price hikes for ordinary people would be grossly unjust. Carbon tax increases are aggressive and unfair. They should be set aside and energy price caps should be imposed to stop the hikes, which are robbing ordinary people because of issues that are not their fault.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to raise an urgent, disturbing and upsetting case which has wider ramifications for the State's responsibility to vulnerable children. A mother of a 17-year-old boy in my constituency - I will not mention names, obviously, because it is a sensitive matter - has asked me to raise this issue with the Taoiseach and anyone who will listen. The boy is on the very severe end of the autism spectrum and, as a result, his family were not able to manage him at home. He got a placement out of Dublin, away from where he lives, which broke down through nobody's real fault and he now finds himself in emergency homeless accommodation. This is completely inappropriate and his mother is distraught and seriously worried for his life, such is the nature of his intellectual disability. His autism behaviour is the sort of thing that requires specialised, residential supports, which we completely lack in this country. There are autism spectrum disorder, ASD, residential specialised units in the UK but we have none here and this is a young man who is on the streets and whose life is potentially in danger. This case has much wider implications in terms of Tusla's responsibility to young and vulnerable children. I would like to email the Taoiseach the details of this case in the context of the wider issue of our responsibility to young children with disabilities. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will continue to speak about the case I raised of the 17-year-old child with autism who is wandering the streets and reliant on homeless accommodation. As the Taoiseach rightly said, the agencies that are the first ports of call should work. In this case, we are talking about Túsla, which has constitutional responsibilities. We had a referendum in 2012 about the specific responsibility of the State in terms of children. We have also signed the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in terms of our responsibility to people with disabilities. The young man concerned has an intellectual disability and severe forms of autism. He is in homeless accommodation, wandering the streets and his life is in danger. His mother has gone to the ombudsman who is going to look into the case but that young man is still on the streets. His mother has gone to court to try to compel Túsla to provide the proper placement and services he needs. The first port of call is not working. That is where we come in. We have a constitutional and legal obligation to a child like this. I will pass on the details of the case to the Taoiseach. I appeal to him. The whip needs to be cracked and the services need to be provided.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government seems to be getting itself into a mess over the issue of recognising the huge role workers played in sustaining our society during the Covid pandemic. I will give a few suggestions in that regard. First, health workers who were on the front line in hospitals fighting to keep the disease at bay and getting infected are a particular category whose work must be recognised, along with that of other people, including home carers and anybody in the health service who was directly confronting the health consequences. Beyond that, there are other groups not in the front line in that sense, such as retail workers, transport workers, teachers, local authority workers, civil servants, contact tracers and so on, who need recognition. There is a more fundamental point, which is that during the pandemic we realised the key role played by many working people who suffer low pay and precarious work, and are generally not acknowledged, in sustaining us. In some cases, such as musicians, artists and so on, we really felt their absence because they could not work. That requires a more general response, rather than a once-off response, in terms of addressing low pay. We need to have something like a €15 living wage as a mandatory minimum wage, to do something serious about precarity in employment and to bring bank and statutory holidays, not on a once-off basis, up to the levels we have in Europe. They are much lower here. There needs to be a general recognition that before the pandemic, we failed to fully recognise how important many categories of workers are. If we are to learn the lesson of the pandemic and have a better future, we need to make those changes.
