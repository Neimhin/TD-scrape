RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need to seek clarification on several issues the petitioner has raised. Through the investigations of the secretariat, we have uncovered that the 2008 application form was cross-referenced to the 2005 application with regard to cross-compliance which seems to support the petitionerâ€™s assertion that he acted in good faith and not, as was suggested by the Department, fraudulently in claiming this payment. That seems to provide evidence. There may be other issues we need to look at but it suggests there is a genuine case to be examined. We should seek clarification on this matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support that proposal. The recent report showing a dramatic increase in suicide levels over the past several years, particularly among young people, means this is an issue that we need to take seriously. The suggestion that there would be a national campaign sponsored by the Government on suicide awareness would be absolutely beneficial.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is an issue that most of us have come across as public representatives. It appears there is a gap in the legislation or regulations in this area. The Minister for Justice and Equality has indicated that his Department is working on legislation to provide for some sort of scheme of compulsory mediation and restrictions on height.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should press the Minister on when the legislation will be introduced and suggest that he might look to the UK and elsewhere for templates for regulating this area.
