RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are nine questions in the first group. I suggest we manage the time in some way so that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A composite reply.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am shocked, surprised and disappointed at the muted and pedestrian response from the Taoiseach and the Government to the horrific events in London at Grenfell Tower, where up to 80 people lost their lives in the most horrific and - it looks almost certain - scandalous circumstances. As recently as November last year, the authorities had failed to heed warnings from residents to the effect that the tower was an accident waiting to happen. I said to the Taoiseach last Tuesday that I had been told by a fire expert the week before about how a vast amount of Irish housing stock had major fire safety issues. This was confirmed over the weekend by Kevin Hollingsworth, a quantity surveyor, who said up to 40% of housing stock built during the Celtic tiger period and far more of the Irish housing stock besides was an accident waiting to happen. Spokespeople for Dublin Fire Brigade have said the same, yet we get an absolutely muted response. I am amazed that there has not been a minute's silence in the Dáil. What is more, I am amazed at the lack of urgency shown by the Government in asking whether the cladding material is being used anywhere here. Are we going to do something about self-certification in the building industry whereby designs of buildings are certified but not the actual buildings? We have experts telling us that vast portions of the housing stock are an accident waiting to happen. What is the Taoiseach going to do about it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is also populism of the centre. It involves people making election promises that they do not intend to keep.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It had more to do with the young voting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about my question on the London fire?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, the Taoiseach did not answer the question about the London fire.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach respond to the question on the London fire?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a pretty serious question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach, please, answer the question on the London fire?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just answer the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like the extra time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will not hear the Taoiseach then.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Taoiseach going to update his strategy statement? It refers to quite a degree to the housing issue. There has been some acknowledgement with the transition to the new Minister that Rebuilding Ireland may not be all it is cracked up to be given the escalating crisis. Following my earlier question, given the potentially shocking consequences for fire safety in our housing stock, which I pointed out to the Taoiseach last week and which has been confirmed now by a range of experts with potentially 40% or more of the Irish housing stock being substandard in terms of fire safety, does he not believe that this issue must become a priority for the Government? That would merit it being included in the strategy statement and being given some urgency, which is distinctly lacking from the Government in the aftermath of what has emerged from the Grenfell Tower disaster and what is being said about the potential implications for the housing stock in this country. The self-certification process is a joke. We are having designs of buildings certified rather than the buildings themselves, and there is no enforcement worth its name. The Taoiseach got a letter, as did I, on the 19th from Mark Vincent Healy - I do not know if he has responded to him yet - where he pointed out-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----that the plans which were certified on his apartment block had fire doors facing one direction and in the actual building they are facing the wrong direction. This is what is happening in the Irish housing stock.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is more to be done.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputies each got one question answered.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We just want to hear the Taoiseach's answers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is because there are only two questions in this grouping.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach said that following his meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May, he was reassured on the potential implications that a Tory-DUP deal would have on Brexit as it affects this country. Setting aside the fact that a coalition of the Tories and the DUP would represent extremism to the right of Genghis Khan, how can the Taoiseach have been reassured when no deal has been done? We are still not clear whether a deal will be done but it is strongly suggested that the DUP is seeking to extract concessions which may not be remotely reassuring on matters such as a hard Border, the common travel areas, tariffs and so on. Whence does this reassurance come? Could the Taoiseach enlighten us about any communication he may have had with the DUP itself as to what precisely it wants and what it is trying to extract from the Tories on the issues that affect this island?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I note that the Taoiseach spoke about the European Union standing firm against hatred and violent extremism and mentioned that he would fight the spread of radicalism. That is very much in tune with some of the very interesting rhetoric coming from him and the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, in particular.There appears to be a move from the pragmatic approach which veiled any obvious ideological prejudice under the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny - not that it did not exist but it was veiled - to a much more gung-ho, ideological leadership for Fine Gael in the form of this Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, with all the talk of attacking the populists as against the sensible, moderate people whom apparently they represent and associate with in Europe. It is good that they are framing things in that way. At least, it is a political debate. However, it is completely topsy-turvy in terms of who are the extremists and who are the reasonable people. The left believes in human beings, internationalism, solidarity across borders and compassion for human beings. That is not an extremist position, but a moderate, sensible, human one. I contrast that with the position of some of the Taoiseach's mates in Europe. Robert Fico, the Prime Minister of Slovakia, who is one of the Taoiseach's colleagues on the European Council, has said that Islam has no place in Slovakia and that it is a necessity to monitor every Muslim. The Hungarian Prime Minister, Viktor Orbán, is a member of the European People's Party, of which Fine Gael is a part. He thinks migrants are "poison", every migrant is a terror risk and every refugee policy is a Trojan Horse of terrorism. He is already responsible for building a fence against migrants and he wants to build another, just like Mr. Donald Trump. What does the Taoiseach have to say about an association in the European People's Party with people who have those types of extremist views? The Bulgarian Prime Minister, Boyko Borisov, warns about the Muslim threat to the Christian demographic balance of Europe. This is foul, extremist, racist hate-mongering and I wish to hear denunciations and serious challenge to such hate-mongering from the Taoiseach and the Government. I also seek some criticism of the European Union's fortress Europe policy. This has resulted in 16,000 deaths in the Mediterranean since 2014, a miserable 3,000 Syrian refugees taken in by the European Union, as opposed to the 2.8 million who have fled that country and are now held up in Turkey, and the deal the European Union did with the Turkish regime, which is an extremist regime, to keep migrants out of Europe. It also did deals with Libya and Afghanistan, extremist regimes by any definition. The European Union is lining up with them at the expense of human compassion and decency when it comes to people fleeing from the most desperate circumstances. I will conclude with a comment on the austerity extremism of the European Union. I read an article today in which a Greek woman named Dimitra says that she never imagined a life of being reduced to food handouts, "some rice, two packs of pasta, a packet of chickpeas, some dates and a tin of milk for the month". That is against a background of deprivation in Greece that has now shot up to 22%. There were 2,500 people in receipt of food aid in Athens in 2012. It is now 26,000. This is because Europe will not give Greece a break on its debt. Could we have some criticism of that type of economic and racist extremism emanating from the so-called moderate centre of Europe?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The horror in Grenfell was murder by negligence. In November, the residents in the Grenfell Action Group wrote, "It is a truly terrifying thought, but the Grenfell Action Group firmly believe that only a catastrophic event will expose the ineptitude and incompetence of our landlord". That was prophetic. For two years they had been warning about fire safety and other issues. Critically, as a fire consultant explained to me today, it was not just the combustible nature of the material, it was the fact that the gap between the building and the material created a flue which allowed the fire to bypass the separation and fire resistance required between units. The question we have to ask, apart from the criminal negligence that needs to be accounted for in Britain, is whether it can happen here. Last week, I raised it with the Taoiseach and I met him again today. Kevin Hollingsworth has confirmed that the answer to the question is that it can happen here. The deficiencies in our regulations themselves, and not just in enforcement or compliance, allow for this to happen. There is supposed to be 60 minutes fire resistance between units. The Government has known since the 1980s that the fire regulations do not provide that. I watched a film today where officials who are still in the Department with responsibility for the environment, watched tests showing this and were asked to change the regulations to ensure separation, from the roof to the separating walls. There are problems particularly in roofs but there are problems in sockets and other areas, which mean we do not have the 60 minutes. The fire in Newbridge that was mentioned earlier proves this. There were eight units, which means that a fire starting in one unit should take 420 minutes to spread to the last unit. It took 26 minutes. Those houses were signed off and certified as compliant. There is a problem with the standards. Last year, the Minister asked fire consultants to make submissions, which they did. The fire consultant I spoke to met the then Minister, Deputy Coveney. The new version of the building regulations was agreed. Today, I was told that earlier this year they totally ignored the consultant's proposals for changes. Then we have the fiasco of self-certification off plans with no inspection of buildings. I could go on but I do not have time. This is absolutely scandalous. We are guilty up to our necks of refusing to listen for more than 20 years to experts who have told us the standards themselves, never mind the enforcement and compliance, are completely deficient, completely substantiate, and as recently as this year we ignored the advice of the experts in this area and signed off on new regulations. It is an absolute scandal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not fair.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Chairman, you should really stop the clock. It is not fair on the speaker.
