RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I understand the Taoiseach correctly, he has told the House that he met Timothy Geithner in March——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He has.  He met Timothy Geithner in March, he visited the United States again to discuss economic matters and he recently met the President of the United States.  He knows, I know and the entire country knows that Ireland is on its knees as a result of the requirement placed on us to pay off the gambling debts of bankers and bondholders.  Is the Taoiseach seriously telling the House that he got no inkling from Timothy Geithner or the US business people and politicians he met about the US Government's position of torpedoing a proposal that the bondholders should share some of the pain of the financial crisis they created and that we were being asked to pay for?  That is extraordinary.  I note——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Taoiseach telling the House that, despite the allegation, he gathered no knowledge in all of his meetings that this was the US Government's policy position on Ireland's economic situation?  After the allegation was out in the open, did the Taoiseach ask President Obama about it?  In the newspapers, he described the President as a political super star.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we to take it that the Taoiseach was so star struck by his meeting with President Obama that he forgot about the most pressing issue facing this country and did not ask whether the US Government torpedoed our plan——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——to force bondholders to pay some of the cost of the economic crisis they created?  It is staggering.  Has the Taoiseach any intention of asking the US authorities whether this most serious allegation is true?  It will have a devastating effect on our people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not obtained an answer to the question I posed, which relates to the Taoiseach's recent visit to the United States.  Given that the burden of the banking debt is the key to our economy being crushed and is responsible for the brutal austerity being imposed on all of us, is the Taoiseach stating that he did not obtain an inkling from US Government representatives that their attitude towards this crucial problem is that the Irish people should pay for the gambling debts of French and German bankers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did the Taoiseach not get an inkling that this is US Government policy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Martin was given much more time to pose his supplementaries.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one brief additional question to pose.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If that is what the Taoiseach is indicating——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Ceann Comhairle should come off it.  I have not finished asking my question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Ceann Comhairle continues to cut across me.  He should allow me to finish my question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is happening is not fair.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I had not finished.  The Ceann Comhairle cut across me before I had an opportunity to do so.  Will the Taoiseach indicate that he is going to obtain an answer from the American Government as to whether that which I have outlined is its policy?  The American Government is interfering in this matter and is insisting——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——that ordinary Irish people must pay for the gambling debts of these bankers rather——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It arises out of the Taoiseach's reply to the original questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Ceann Comhairle should allow the Taoiseach to answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is unbelievable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He had taken the action.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the second part of the question I posed?  Does the Taoiseach propose to discover whether that which I have outlined is US policy?
