RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the representatives of IFAC for their report and contributions. The impact of the inflation crisis has been uneven. Would our guests go even further and say there are winners and losers in this situation? It is not just that the impact is uneven. Would it be fair comment that some people are being hammered while others are doing very well? I would be interested to hear our guests' views on that question. I note that corporate profits and net household wealth are up. Somebody is doing well out of all of this and it is certainly not the majority of low- and middle-income households, who are being hit disproportionately hard, as our guests have alluded to. Even the headline inflation rate does not take into account the hit that low- and middle-income families are taking. I know IFAC does not get into policy suggestions but one possible approach to dealing with this situation is to insulate people's incomes against the impact of inflation and to do that, if I understood what our guests have said, would cost €700 million. Was that the relevant figure? The problem is that €700 million would take us over the 5% rule. I am generally in favour of insulating people's incomes, wages and so on from the impact of inflation. One approach could be to take money back from those who have benefited from this situation to insulate the losers fully and ensure there are no winners. The Government's mantra is it cannot fully insulate people against the impacts of inflation. That is the Government's view. I do not think that is a statement of fact but is rather a statement of policy. The Government has decided it is not going to insulate people fully from the impact of inflation because the cost would be too high and perhaps it would take us over the 5% rule. The Government could do it if it wanted to. That is a consideration. Another consideration that is never debated is we should ensure there are no winners. I am not asking our guests to advocate for that position but is it something we might consider as an option? In the current circumstances, no excess profits should be made because that is not fair when the income of other people is being hit. That would be a legitimate policy consideration. Perhaps we might even cap profits. We always talk about capping wages and a need to limit wage increases, social welfare increases and pension increases because the skies might fall on us if we let them rip. The possibility we might cap profits, wealth and very high salaries is never considered. As I said, I am not asking our guests to advocate for that position because I know IFAC does not advocate particular policy measures but is that a legitimate thing to consider in the range of options that is open to the Government? Is it possible for us to consider insulating all the people who are losing as a result of inflation through direct expenditure, income rises or whatever it might be and to ensure there are no winners and nobody is benefiting from this situation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will pull up Mr. Barnes slightly in that regard. I do not want to have a row with him but that is not the case when some people have surplus wealth to invest in the shares of BP or Shell.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These are legitimate considerations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have expanded the amount of renewable energy being produced. We are still dependent on imports and, therefore, vulnerable to price shocks resulting from international factors, but we use a great deal more domestically produced wind energy than we used to. Why has it made not a blind bit of difference to the price of energy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Regardless of how much we have expanded our domestic renewable energy production, there is no sign it has made any difference. One would have expected it to have had some impact, but it has had none at all.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is interesting that this is the case. The mantra is we will solve the current problem. Actually, the Taoiseach is saying we are entering an era of high energy prices and that the inflation we are seeing currently will be around for quite a while. Simultaneously, people are saying that, if we wean ourselves off fossil fuels and dramatically expand domestic renewable energy production, we can deal with that problem in the medium term.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was shorter than Deputy Doherty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Watch those taxes increase.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to pick Mr. Barnes up on the point about the large corporate tax revenues that are coming in and whether the best place to put them is in the rainy day fund or to pay down debt. I question that. I would have thought the lesson in the current situation is we need to invest rapidly in areas which are making us more vulnerable to this inflationary crisis - to insulate ourselves against it rather than thinking about saving up money against the rainy day further down the road. We should throw enormous amounts of money at education, training and apprenticeships. We should remove every barrier to educating and training, given that the greatest resource we have is the human beings who live here but who are wasted in their ability and talent to a very large degree because it is made so difficult for them. Large numbers of people could be contributing but it is made difficult for them to realise their potential and make a contribution. We are seeing it now with all these bottlenecks - I love these economic euphemisms - but we have a lack of apprentices, tradespeople and people trained in areas such as construction, health and education. It would be far better to take these windfall revenues or what might turn out to be temporary revenues from a relatively small number of multinational companies and really funnel them into an area like that, because that would actually protect us. Obviously, we need to invest in sustainable energy production in order that we become less vulnerable to international price shocks in that area. We also need a focus on the diversification of Irish agriculture when we consider that food security is becoming an issue again. We need to rapidly diversify Irish agriculture which would have a very positive environmental spin-off by reducing imports and therefore carbon footprint further down the road. It would also insulate us to some degree against inflation that is dictated by international market pressures. These are choices. There will be a debate potentially about this rainy day fund. I would be interested to hear Mr. Barnes's response. Regarding the wage thing, the RTÉ website has a headline to the effect that the Minister, Deputy McGrath, says there will be tough negotiations ahead over the public sector pay agreement. The debate has already started with the suggestion that we cannot give these workers too much to compensate for inflation. I ask Mr. Barnes to reiterate the figure that he gave, which might be helpful in our debate in the next while. He mentioned €2 billion for pensions wages and social welfare to keep pace with inflation. I ask him to tell us what that is based on, because it is an interesting figure. Is there not a danger that if we do not give workers, pensioners and social welfare recipients increases at least in line with inflation, we start to create the conditions for a possible recession as consumer demand begins to fall off? We know a significant driver of Irish economic growth has been consumer demand. If ordinary working people just cannot afford to spend and therefore fewer goods and services are purchased, is that not as big a danger? I take Mr. Barnes's point about not giving money to people who really do not need it or who have benefited and deciding where those thresholds would be is a matter for a serious debate. However, is there not a big danger that if we start imagining that there could be something really wrong with giving workers pay increases or giving people pension increases to deal with inflation, it could have an equally bad effect in terms of consumer demand?
