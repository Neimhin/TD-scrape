RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was a series of questions and the Taoiseach should try answering them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is called democracy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the second week of January, I was called by a La Senza worker and asked to come out to the occupation they had just begun because their jobs had been terminated and their wages had not been paid.  Yesterday, I received another telephone call from a La Senza worker who said their promised wages from KPMG had still not been paid.  In addition, they will be subject to emergency tax because KPMG has messed up their tax credit entitlements, which means they will not get much of their money for a considerable time.  They have also had massive delays in accessing the social welfare system because they did not get their P45 forms until yesterday morning, after two weeks of haranguing KPMG on that issue.  Since June, the Jane Norman workers have been without a month's wages due to them when the company went into administration.  Jane Norman is now trading in this country with a new workforce that is paid less and on lower conditions.  The Connolly shoe workers in DÃºn Laoghaire have been on strike for over a year after their employment was terminated.  Despite several Labour Court rulings in their favour, the employer has not yet paid the moneys owed.  These issues raise the question of what this Government will do to stop rogue employers treating workers like this.  It needs legislative action so that employers cannot do this to workers.  I ask the Taoiseach to intervene on the specifics of the cases I mentioned and to bring forward legislation to protect workers.  If we can do it to protect bankers, can we do it to protect workers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would prefer if it created a few.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is not all the talk of jobs coming out of the sub-committee or the EU Summit yesterday a bit preposterous when at the same time the key element of policy is to continue suffocating the economy with the debt of zombie banks and imposing crippling austerity?  Is it not a little bit like saying we have a magical formula to cure a sick man while we are holding a pillow over his face and draining him of his blood?  Is this not the reality of all the talk about jobs, namely, that it directly conflicts with the main thrust of policy coming from the EU authorities, which is being implemented by the Government?  It simply cannot create jobs, at least at a faster rate than it is losing them, if it is imposing austerity and all the funds that should go into investment are going into zombie banks.I was in Berlin on Thursday with the finance committee of the German Bundestag.  I asked them this question: how do they seriously propose to deal with the collapse of investment in Europe, given the austerity?  They said the main point was to increase competitiveness so we would get investment from China and India.  If that is the strategy, we are really banjaxed because, of course, the problem is there can be no serious investment, and there is very little investment coming from China and India, because they can see that the European economy is contracting under the weight of the austerity.  Although this is precisely the market that would buoy up possible investment, it is contracting.This is even the case with the German economy, which is the other piece of news people need to know.  The German economy itself is contracting and has no money.  The only reason we are even debating with the Germans about borrowing and bonds is that they can borrow money cheaper, but they do not actually have any money.  Their economy is contracting too, just like our economy and the whole European economy, because it is being suffocated by the banking debt burden and by austerity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should have gone himself rather than waffling on at Davos.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They certainly were not terrified by the Taoiseach's attack on the Irish people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is about what they told me.  Perhaps the Taoiseach should listen to them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At least we are not blaming the Irish people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I concur with Deputy Martin.  This is an issue on which there are very strong views.  I believe there is to be a substantial demonstration next weekend on this issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was not organised by me but by the people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am doing the Taoiseach a favour.  This could become a very big issue if it is not handled sensitively, or if it is seen in any way that we are dragooning something through which people believe interferes with the freedom of the Internet.Of course there are issues that concern musicians and artists and we must deal with those.  However, there is big concern about this measure and I do not believe it should be rammed through.  I apologise to the Taoiseach for again making reference to Germany but I was shocked to hear there is a new political party in that country, running at 10% in the polls, called the Piracy Party which relates to this precise issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a serious issue and we should allow for proper debate-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If we are to pass new laws on this-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----they should not be put through as a statutory instrument.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no requirement from Europe to implement this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not required by Europe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On Saturday.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is time but-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Cheann Comhairle, very briefly-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This must be before the statutory instrument is introduced.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We certainly need more time.  However, it is also important the statutory instrument is not implemented before-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we getting more time?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Acting Chairman stated we can only ask questions.  Since it was agreed that slightly more time would be allowed because this issue is somewhat complex, would it not be reasonable for me to make just a few short points?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a complex issue and it has many aspects, not all of which I understand fully.  However, I have been acquainting myself with them over the past week or two.  The issue is one in respect of which there is strong feeling.  It has considerable economic implications in that rash moves in this area could do reputational damage to Ireland as a hub for IT and new technologies.The Minister of State may inform me on the process.  I learned only in the past year what a statutory instrument is.  It is a ministerial order that does not require the normal legislative process, parliamentary scrutiny and debate.  Those watching this debate need to know that also.  Is there a reason, given the concerns that have been raised quite widely in Ireland, and which are causing uproar in countries such as Germany and the United States, we could not stop bringing this order into force and go through the longer process involving proper legislation, such that all sides would have an opportunity to make submissions and examine the issues fully?It is very complicated.  I have not made my decision but, as I understand it, it is not clear that we are in breach.  The European Commission has not said we are in breach and a recent ruling in the European Court of Justice stated the use of blocking had to be limited, precisely because it infringed on freedom of expression and could target lawful communications unfairly.  It would hit intermediaries, as others have said.  It would send out a very good signal if the Government did not just push this instrument through by order and allowed for a fuller debate and submissions from all sides so we could be ahead of the curve on an issue that has not been resolved, even at European level.  Let us lead the way and have a proper, informed debate and try to balance, in a fair way, all the various competing concerns of artists, musicians and holders of copyright with the importance of upholding Internet freedom and freedom of expression.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does it allow for blocking?
