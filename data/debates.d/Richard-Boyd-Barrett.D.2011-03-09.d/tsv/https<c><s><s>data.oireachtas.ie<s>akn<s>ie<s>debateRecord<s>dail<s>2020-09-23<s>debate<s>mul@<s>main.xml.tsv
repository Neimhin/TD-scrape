RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Workers in Debenhams in Blackrock, along with almost 1,000 other workers, were on the picket lines at 6 a.m. this morning. I joined them at approximately 7.30 a.m. They had to go through the immense frustration of watching strike breakers brought in by their former manager. To be honest, most of their disgust was directed at the former manager ushering in these strike breakers. Frankly, I do not think the strike breakers really understood what was going on. The workers were appealing to them not to do what they were doing. It would be a very strong message for the Taoiseach to stand up and say that this strike-breaking operation is absolutely reprehensible. I have an invitation to him from the Debenhams workers in Blackrock. If one talks to them, it is clear that they are some of the loveliest people one could ever meet. They did not blame the strike breakers. They blamed KPMG, the inaction of the Government and Debenhams. One of the workers, Martin, has invited the Taoiseach to go to Blackrock and he will buy him lunch in the McDonald's there and give him a cup of coffee. Martin wants to talk things through in a social dialogue, explain the workers' plight and ask what the Taoiseach can do. That is a direct invitation from Martin, Viv and the shop steward, Eilis, at Debenhams in Blackrock to the Taoiseach. They are asking him to go there and engage in social dialogue with them tomorrow morning as they fight for justice in a very just cause against reprehensible treatment at the hands of KPMG.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I suspect the suggestion from the Minister with responsibility for climate action, communications networks and transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, that taxi drivers should be removed from bus lanes was some sort of misguided notion about protecting the environment from CO2 emitting vehicles. I have already asked that that proposal be abandoned. I have a positive environmental, climate action proposal to put forward. If the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Ryan, accepted that the ten-year rule for replacing vehicles should be extended to 12 years to avoid financially penalising taxi drivers who might have to replace their taxis, that would also give them time to do something the taxi drivers would very much support, provided the State did it properly and gave them support, namely, electrifying the entire taxi fleet. This has been done in London. There are vehicles that are suitable, although the Government would have to do something about the vehicle registration tax, VRT, and give significant grants. In the interregnum that we have due to new restrictions and Covid, the Government could kill two birds with one stone. We could have a just transition whereby the taxi drivers are not punished by the Government but actually helped through this difficult period, while also using the interregnum to plan for the electrification of the entire taxi fleet. If I had more time, I would talk about the electrification of the bus fleet, which should also be considered. That is a serious proposal whereby the Government could help the taxi drivers who are now in trouble and also plan for the future by reducing CO2 emissions from cars.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the Taoiseach's engagements with representatives of the assembly he should consider engaging with our MLA, Gerry Carroll. People Before Profit in the North and South brings a unique perspective that goes back to Connolly and Wolfe Tone on the possibility of uniting Catholic, Protestant and dissenter in a project to fight for a different type of Ireland. If we look at the reckless behaviour of Boris Johnson and, for that matter, Arlene Foster, with the health and economic welfare of the North, there has never been a more opportune time to begin to break the grip of unionism and argue for the unity of Catholic, Protestant and dissenter in a fight for a different type of Ireland. Gerry Carroll would tell the Taoiseach that if we are to make that case, and we should, to unite working people for a different project and end partition, we also need to tackle the legacies of what Connolly called the carnival of reaction down here. They are manifest. I mentioned the case of St. Mary's Centre, or the Telford Centre, whereby religious organisations are turfing vulnerable disabled women out of nursing homes and social housing.In the past week, I heard the religious order in St. Laurence College, Ballybrack, is selling off the playing fields of a publicly funded school, similar to what happened in Clonkeen College with the Christian Brothers. If one was in the North, beginning to question unionism and loyalty to the likes of Boris Johnson, one's questioning would be checked if one looked down South and still saw the rule of religious organisations, taking facilities away from school kids, as well as elderly and disabled women, while the State allowed it to happen. If we are going to fight for a united Republic and end partition, surely we have to be seen to take the lead on matters like separating Church and State to show we are a progressive and modern Republic and, in my opinion, trying to fight for a socialist Republic which James Connolly, whose statue is behind me in this House, argued we should do many years ago.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputies Barry and Paul Murphy. For months, I have been raising the plight of 22,000 taxi drivers whose livelihoods have been devastated by the Covid pandemic. Apart from a little bit of tea and sympathy, this and the previous Government have completely ignored and failed to provide support to them. The taxi drivers who took to the streets in unprecedented numbers a week ago will be protesting again on 9 October. This time it will be a day-long protest with taxi drivers coming from all parts of Dublin city. They have been forced to organise another protest because of the failure of the Minister and the Government to listen to them or give them any assurances of real support. They cannot even get under freedom of information provisions the answer to the question as to whether the NTA made any recommendations to support them to the Minister or the Minister for Finance. They have had no traction on the request that the ten-year rule for the replacement of vehicles would be extended to 12 years because they do not have the money to do so. What are they supposed to do? There is nothing on an income subsidy. For many taxi drivers, they incur €11,000 in costs before they make a cent. Now, given the new restrictions, they have less of a chance of making a living. Will the Minister give the assurances and supports for which the taxi drivers are asking? They do not want to protest but they are determined to continue and will do so on 9 October if the Minister does not listen. The aviation industry has been decimated, as the Minister knows. Surely who we need heading the Irish Aviation Authority is somebody who will defend the rights of workers in the industry, who will be scrupulous about safety on the airlines and about protecting consumer rights. What do we get? We get the appointment of Diarmuid Ó Conghaile, whose former job was as chief executive of Malta Air, a wholly owned subsidiary of Ryanair. Ryanair is accused by its workers of running out trade union activists, forcing people into bogus self-employment, flouting all social distancing regulations, refusing to comply with the European Union Aviation Safety Agency, EASA, regulations and so on. It also has a rotten record when it comes to consumers. However, this is the person we put in charge of the Irish Aviation Authority. Seriously, what is the Minister up to?
