RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We all want a state-of-the-art national maternity hospital as quickly as possible. The reason for this shambles and this delay is that this Government and successive Governments have insisted that private companies controlled by religious orders must remain in the picture, even though every cent going into building this hospital is public money and that what is wanted is a public hospital being paid for with public money. The Government insists, and successive Governments have insisted, that instead we get a private company influenced by a Catholic religious order. That is the constitution of the new St. Vincent's Holdings company which, interestingly, has been signed - the plot thickens - by people representing a company called Porema Limited and another company called Stembridge Limited. Who are they?We have the holding company, the Religious Sisters of Charity, the healthcare group, the designated activity company, DAC, and now Porema Limited and Stembridge Limited, which are allegedly associated with thousands of offshore companies. We are in this mess because the Government insists on involving these people in a public hospital that is charged with providing healthcare for the women of this country, and it is influenced by a religious organisation. The Government says our concerns are baseless. Why did two members of the HSE board dissent to the decision to transfer the Religious Sisters of Charity shareholding to this new body, which was set up with the approval of the Vatican? What does it have to do with women's healthcare in this country or approving the overarching company which will own and control the national maternity hospital, as well as three other hospitals? It is unbelievable. One of those people is Professor Deirdre Madden, who dissented, reportedly on the basis that she had concerns regarding the legal ownership of the site, the building, and the governance and control of the proposed new maternity hospital. The Taoiseach said he is not a legal expert. Maybe we are not all legal experts but, helpfully, Professor Madden is a legal expert. She is a professor of law at University College Cork. She specialises in health law and medical ethics. She was concerned enough to dissent because of ownership, control and governance questions. She clearly has a basis for those concerns. What is the problem with having a publicly-owned and controlled national maternity hospital? The clue about having continued religious influence is in the name of St. Vincent's Healthcare Group. It should gift this land for the national maternity hospital to the State so that it is fully publicly-owned and controlled.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Three board members are from St. Vincent's Healthcare Group.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is it involved?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are fantastic staff in St. Vincent's and many of the other hospitals. I predicate everything that I say by making that point. They are fantastic people. The problem with these religious organisations is that, for example in St. Vincent's, one cannot get sterilisation or a vasectomy. Why not? This is a hospital that is publicly funded but owned by a religious organisation that has an ethos that does not believe in and does not want to give certain procedures. They continue to have an influence. In the new St. Vincent's hospital, they have three board members who will be on the holding group, which is the overarching group that will own the four entities, namely, the designated activity company, DAC, for the new national maternity hospital; the private St. Vincent's hospital; the public St. Vincent's hospital; and St. Michael's Hospital, which is in my own area. Why did Professor Deirdre Madden, a professor of law and the vice chair of the HSE have the concerns that she had if they are baseless? Why? Why does St. Vincent's insist on retaining a foothold in the new holding company? Why?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it because they want hold of an asset? Why do we need a private company that has other private companies as subscribers? Why do we need all of that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----rather than simply a publicly owned and controlled hospital on public land?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what I mean. That is what is causing the delays. I do not understand why the Government continues to allow them to influence the equation, to be involved in the equation, and ultimately be the cause of the delays we are now suffering.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no role for private companies in this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am aware that the issue is going to the committee. The Minister should, however, make statement in the Dáil and all groups should have an opportunity to make statements and ask the Minister questions on the critical issue of the future of the national maternity hospital before any decision is made by the Cabinet because there is dispute over the so-called guarantees and the future of this absolutely critical facility for the delivery of the state-of-the-art healthcare we want for women in this country. That uncertainty has to be resolved. We need to get the hospital the women of this country deserve. The Minister should come in here and make a statement and we should have an opportunity to make statements and ask questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Two 80-year-old US military veterans, Mr. Ken Mayers and Mr. Tarak Kauff, were yesterday acquitted of criminal damage at Shannon Airport and acquitted of trespass, although some headlines read that they were convicted. They were convicted for interference with the workings of the airport, which was a broader and more catch-all allegation. They were acquitted by a jury on counts of criminal damage even though they admitted criminal damage because their defence was that it was justified to prevent a greater crime, namely, the crimes of the US military, of which the accused were former members. The men had friends who committed suicide because of the terrible things they were forced to do as members of the US military in wars around the world. Does the Taoiseach think that the jury has something to tell him about the need to condemn US military action and to stop using Shannon Airport as a site for US military aggression around the world?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that what they are doing by backing the Saudis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Preserving democracy by supporting the Saudis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is absolutely not true. It is rubbish.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Members of Fianna Fáil met Putin. We never met Putin.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach's old boss met him.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A few of the Taoiseach's old mates are doing business there too.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Saudi Arabia especially.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are just anti-war.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some wars are good and some are bad for it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach will not criticise the US.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach mentioned the Assembly elections in the North. People Before Profit is one of a few parties in this House that is also represented in the North, with an MLA in Belfast West. We run candidates across the constituencies and will hopefully challenge for new seats in Derry, with a bit of luck. People on the doorsteps are talking about the cost of living and the same issues that the Taoiseach's Government has failed to deal with, including the spiralling cost of living, energy prices and unaffordable rents. Despite the attempts of the DUP in particular to divert people's attention back along the same old failed sectarian lines, people are talking about the need for action on the cost of living and rent controls, which we have being calling for North and South and which have been resisted by those in government both North and South. Actual rent controls would make rents affordable. There should be windfall taxes on the profits of energy companies and actual controls on the price of heating and energy fuel. Does the Taoiseach agree that that is actually what is really concerning people and that Governments both North and South are failing to address the concerns that affect people, whether Catholic or Protestant or in the North or South, including the cost of living and housing? Did he discuss with Boris Johnson the need to have a radical shift to address those issues in the way that People Before Profit candidates are campaigning for in the Assembly elections?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How much time is there for them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage made very reckless, irresponsible and somewhat bizarre comments on the rising homelessness situation at the weekend when he suggested that it was to do with the number of European Economic Area, EEA, and non-economic area refugees - which, by the way, is everybody in the world - coming into the country, but not Ukrainians. I find this a bizarre statement for him to make. This seems like reckless deflection but with a potentially dangerous subtext, which some on the far right, worryingly, have already tried to pick up on. The Minister needs to be completely disabused of his notions. The reason the homelessness figures are going through the roof is because we had an eviction ban and a rent increase ban that were effective during Covid-19. Then, the Government removed those things, and the situation has gotten worse since then. The vast majority of people - and they are the ones coming into my clinic week in, week out - who end up in homeless services do so because they are evicted by landlords on grounds of sale when they have done absolutely nothing wrong, or because rents are absolutely astronomical and they cannot afford them, and the housing assistance payment, HAP, limits will not reach to those levels. I appeal to the Taoiseach and the Minister not to engage in dangerous deflection tactics and admit that they need to bring in things like an eviction ban to prevent evictions and control rents to make them affordable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is little doubt in my mind or I think in most people's minds that Russia has committed and is committing war crimes in Ukraine. Any efforts to hold them to account, to bring out the truth of those war crimes, to prosecute them and to deliver justice to the people who are victims of those crimes should be pursued. We absolutely must do that. However, I have little faith in the International Criminal Court. I say this because previously, in most cases in which it has been charged to look at these things in other similar instances, it has failed pretty dramatically. I do not see why we would trust it to do this. It is also interesting to look at who has signed up to the ICC and who has not. The United States has not subscribed to the International Criminal Court because it does not want to be held accountable for its war crimes. At one point, I believe it signed it but then it withdrew its signature and it never ratified it. Israel did the same in order that it cannot be investigated. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates refused to sign it. Russia and Ukraine signed it but never ratified it. That is interesting. Many countries, including two of the countries that are directly involved in this, never wanted to ratify the International Criminal Court. There is a problem, is there not, if we are serious about this?  The whole point about war crimes and crimes against humanity is that they include any war crime. They are not just war crimes that occur in a particular place at a particular time and that we decide we are going to investigate. The whole idea is that a war crime is a war crime, no matter where it is committed. As for a crime against humanity, the clue is in the name; it is a crime against any member of humanity that falls within the definition of a crime against humanity. It seems we now have great enthusiasm, all of a sudden, to pursue the war crimes and crimes against humanity that are undoubtedly being committed by Vladimir Putin in his bloody and inexcusable war. Yet, many of the people who denounce the crimes against humanity and the war crimes do not themselves want to be subject to this court. They have avoided doing it because they might themselves be found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity. Is anybody going to call out this hypocrisy? If it is to be selective in this regard, I do not see what credibility the International Criminal Court has. If Putin’s war against Ukraine is a war crime and a crime against humanity, then the US-UK War in Iraq definitely is a crime against humanity. It was a war based on a pack of lies, with a million people being directly and indirectly killed. There was the horror of Fallujah, to name just one terrible example. There was the torture in Abu Ghraib. What did the ICC do? It had a preliminary investigation into possible war crimes that may have been committed. They could not investigate the US because, as I said, the US has not signed up to it. The preliminary investigation into the UK was closed down in 2006 with no prosecution. Some new evidence was provided later. They had a look at that and then they closed it down in 2020.  Israel has just been indicted by Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and a UN special rapporteur on the Middle East for committing war crimes, which come under the ambit of the International Criminal Court, as matters it should pursue. Where are the announcements that this will happen? There are none. There is no announcement about the fact that they are being accused by the UN special rapporteur and two of the most respected human rights organisations in the world of ongoing, 70-years-long crimes against humanity. As for the siege of Gaza, there has been no investigation. There has been no clamour for the prosecution of the war crimes. Therefore, I do not place much credibility in this. If we are serious about stopping war crimes and crimes against humanity, we have to be calling them all out. We have to be demanding investigations into all of them and not just the ones where it happens to suit the geopolitical or geostrategic interests of the European Union, this or that power, the United States or whoever else. We have to call out those countries that do not wish to be held accountable for crimes against humanity, which include many of Europe’s allies. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure the Minister had reasons for leaving the Chamber, but I am disappointed he is not here to hear what I have to say because the situation is just getting worse. We can bandy around alternative policies and plans until the cows come home but seeing is believing. I want the Government to understand, if it does not already, that the situation has got decisively worse in the past few months. It needs to grasp that. There is real human misery. I emphasise that worsening situation predates the significant arrival of Ukrainian refugees, the outbreak of the war and Putin's brutal invasion. It was getting very significantly worse and towards the end of last year things started to get very bad again. There had been a temporary break during the Covid pandemic because of the eviction ban and the temporary freeze in rent increases. That actually made a difference. It did not solve the problem but it started to improve things. The numbers going into homelessness were falling because evictions were banned. I want to plead with the Government at present. The main reason people come into my clinic, are facing and then end up in emergency accommodation and, increasingly, are people who are working, have jobs and families and end up in homeless accommodation, is because they are evicted by landlords on grounds of sale. That is why they get evicted. If the Government stopped that, as it did during Covid, it would stop people going into homelessness. I am pleading with the Government to do that. It did not solve all of the problem but it had an impact and since the Government removed that measure the situation has got worse again. Since rents were allowed to increase, it has got worse. If someone is in that situation where his or her landlord is selling up and the eviction of that person is allowed, he or she has to look for a rent that is affordable. If the Minister of State goes on daft.ie any day of the week, he will see I am not exaggerating in saying that, in my area, he will not find anything costing less than €2,200 a month. Seriously, that is not affordable by about 80% to 90% of working people. It is completely not at the races. People are goosed if they are looking for accommodation at that level of rent. They are facing despair. That is what people are feeling because there is nowhere to go.  When they go to the council, they are told they are not allowed look for anything costing more than €1,950 because of the housing assistance payment, HAP, limit. That is the highest they can get and before that, if they are not on the homeless HAP rate, the highest they can look for is, I think, €1,250. Imagine how hopeless it is for people checking daft.ie or myhome.ie who are told they are not allowed look for a place that costs any more than €1,250 when everything costs €2,200. They can only get the homeless HAP rate weeks before actually becoming physically homeless. That is another thing I appeal to the Minister of State to change; once people have a notice to quit, give them the homeless HAP rate to give them some chance. They still do not really have a chance but they have some outside chance. They might find the needle in the haystack if they get the homeless HAP rate. The Government has got to do something because it is just not fair. It is mental torture to say to people they have to find a HAP tenancy because there has been no social housing for 15 or 20 years and there is no social house for them, and that they are not allowed look for anything more than €1,950 if they are on the brink of being homeless, when there is nothing available for less than €2,200. That is mental torture. That is what the Government is doing to people with families, children and so on. If they do not find somewhere, which we know they will not, in one case they are going into a hostel in town when one child is going to school in Ballybrack and another is going to school in Shankill. That family will be in a hostel in Gardiner Street. Give me a break. That is torture. It is abuse of those children to put them in that situation but that is what is going on. We have to do something about that. I am not in favour of giving loads of HAP money to these landlords but, to be honest, the HAP rates have to be raised to at least the levels of the rents that are around. That has to be done otherwise people have no chance whatsoever. I agree with Deputy Sherlock, and I have also made the point, that if people are about to be evicted from a HAP tenancy the council should step in and buy the place immediately. The council is inflicting suffering on itself by evicting people in that situation because they will be knocking on the door of the council saying, "Will you please give me somewhere to live?", when they are evicted from a HAP tenancy. How long has the review of income thresholds been going on for now? Is it five, six or seven years? I know of one woman, as does Deputy Ó Broin, working for a State agency who has spent three and a half years in emergency accommodation and is no longer entitled to income support or HAP support because she has just gone over the threshold. That is now happening to people all the time. They are completely banjaxed because their income will not allow them to afford anything. They will not even get HAP, never mind a social housing unit, and they could potentially be, and some are, evicted from homeless accommodation. It is just unbelievable. This goes slightly further than Sinn Féin's motion, which I support, but could we possibly do what the French have just done? They have brought in a body that will set rents in each area at a level that is affordable and based on people's incomes. The French have just done it because all the other measures were not working. I propose we do the same.
