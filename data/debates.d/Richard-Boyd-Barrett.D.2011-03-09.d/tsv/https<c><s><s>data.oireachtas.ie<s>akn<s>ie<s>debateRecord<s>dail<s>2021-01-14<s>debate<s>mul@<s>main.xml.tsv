RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is important to say that the huge and detrimental impact Covid-19 is having on education at the moment is to do with the disastrous strategy this Government has pursued. We argued that it should listen to public health advice in advance of Christmas and that if it did not, we would be in a disastrous situation in January. Tragically, we now are. Now our young people and some of those most vulnerable with special needs are suffering the consequences of the Government's dire strategy, the so-called Plan for Living with Covid, the yo-yo in and out of surge and lockdown. It is important to stress that point. Having said that, on the issue of special needs, the Minister should just own up. There is a suggestion in the statement she has just sprung on us that she has got agreement on reopening on 21 January when she has not actually got agreement. Of course we need special needs provision and it is a priority, but it also has to be in compliance with public health. It must be ensured that teachers and children and their families are in a safe situation. Here is a suggestion. If I were the Minister, rather than making big announcements without having got agreement, I would have an urgent forensic audit carried out as to which parents want their children to go into school and which teachers are willing to go in and teach them and I would try to match those two things. I am, as I am sure all of us are, inundated with communications from leaving certificate students who are stressed to bits about not knowing what is happening. They need certainty and the Minister cannot give it to them. She is giving them fake certainty to the effect that, come hell or high water, there will be a leaving certificate, essentially. She cannot say that on epidemiological grounds. The Government could not predict in December that we would be in the situation we are in now, in January; how on earth can it predict what will happen in June? The truth is that it cannot. It is therefore absolutely wrong to force students to do a leaving certificate when the Minister cannot provide them with that certainty. She should give them choice, alternatives and the certainty that those choices and alternatives will be available now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy. I will take 50%. I will comment on the leaving certificate briefly. It was discussed earlier. There is no way the Government can guarantee the leaving certificate can happen in June. At the leaders' briefing, we asked Dr. Holohan whether the restrictions would be lifted by March. He said he could not possibly tell us and that he had no idea.There is therefore no way the Minister can remove the stress and uncertainty from students other than by saying they will not be forced to sit the exam. Where the Minister comes in, it seems to me, is offering an alternative that would allow open access for everybody to higher level and third level education. He should start now by establishing where the current cohort of leaving certificate students want to go. He should find out where they want to go and see how many places we have and then work out how many additional places would be needed to accommodate them in the courses of their choice. That is what we should do. That would remove the stress, allow everyone to advance and provide certainty. By the way, in some countries they do that as a matter of course. They just let people go to higher education, and if they cannot manage the course, they drop out of it. Fees of any description are unconscionable at the moment, particularly when we need more nurses, student nurses, doctors and engineers at a whole range of levels. When the ability of families and students to earn income is greatly diminished, and when the quality of the education experience is greatly diminished, how can the Minister possibly justify fees? We should remove all fees. Lastly, I wish to ask the Minister about the student nurses. I think 6,000 healthcare workers have been out since Christmas. Student nurses will now once again be working just as they did all last year and they are offered the insulting amount of €100. This is at the same time as the Secretary General of the Department of Health gets a €90,000 pay increase to make an unbelievable salary of €290,000. I want the Minister to answer this. One of the arguments he has used is that one can have either an apprentice programme that is paid or a degree but one cannot have both. Student nurses have informed me that student paramedics are getting €28,000 a year for a degree course as we speak. How come student nurses cannot get that? In construction engineering in the University of Limerick one is paid €12 an hour for doing frankly less dangerous work than student nurses are doing. How come it can happen there? One can have a degree and quality education and get paid, and now is the time to give that to the student nurses.
