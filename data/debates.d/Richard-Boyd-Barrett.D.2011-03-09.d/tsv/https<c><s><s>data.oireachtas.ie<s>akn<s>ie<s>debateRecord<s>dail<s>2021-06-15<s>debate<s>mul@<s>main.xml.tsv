One of the groups - I have raised this repeatedly with the Taoiseach - with a very uncertain future which has seen a massive and continuing adverse effect from Covid-19 is taxi drivers. After the Minister for Transport's announcement of a so-called package of support last week, taxi drivers wrote to the Taoiseach again to express their extraordinary disappointment at the failure of the Government to meet any of the demands they made. They made five very simple demands to save the taxi industry and their livelihoods. These included a financial package to cover ongoing costs, a moratorium on future licences and, critically, an extension of the requirement to replace a vehicle after nine years to approximately 15 years, given the loss of income and major debts taxi drivers would have to incur in a very uncertain position if they had to finance new vehicles. There were also requests to disband the taxi advisory committee, which the group feels is unrepresentative of taxi drivers, and the provision of access to bus corridors. None of those demands was met. When the Taoiseach met representatives of the four taxi groups that organised the recent protest, he said he would get back to them about their demands but he did not do it. There was an announcement but there was no response from the Taoiseach and none of the demands was met. It is really not acceptable.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If my constituency is anything to go by, there is a real problem with the Department of Education delivering school buildings, autism spectrum disorder, ASD, units, which we know are needed, and school facilities. The latest in a long line of examples is St. Mary's Boys National School in Booterstown. I met representatives from there this week. They have made a request of the Department of Education for the acquisition of an existing building. Nothing needs to be built. It has a parish hall available to it for an ASD unit and for the additional school facilities it lacks. There is an acknowledged need for a unit in the area but the Department of Education seems to be incapable of making a decision. When I ask questions on the school's behalf I cannot get an answer. Will the Taoiseach look into this? This special needs provision is desperately required. This speaks to a larger problem. Sallynoggin Educate Together National School has no temporary site for a school this September and no permanent site. Gaelscoil Laighean is moving between one temporary site and another and there is still uncertainty about a permanent site. Dún Laoghaire Educate Together National School is moving from one temporary site to another. For years, The Red Door School has been in a completely unsuitable temporary site. Gaelscoil Phádraig in Ballybrack has been in a temporary site for years. Does the Department understand the meaning of planning for schools that exist or for ASD units where there is an acknowledged need, and the urgent decision-making required to give people certainty about the provision of facilities and school buildings?
