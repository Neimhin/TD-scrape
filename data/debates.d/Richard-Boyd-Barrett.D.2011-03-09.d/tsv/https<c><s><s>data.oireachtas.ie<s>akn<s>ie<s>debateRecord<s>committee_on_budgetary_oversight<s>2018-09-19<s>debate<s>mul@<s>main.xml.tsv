On the housing issue and the references to overheating, are the witnesses saying that it would be perfectly okay to ramp up the provision of housing dramatically as long as it is not based on increasing the deficit or, for example, dramatic increases in tax revenue from other sectors of the economy? If that is what they are saying, I agree.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can help with that conundrum. Most of the construction workers that could be building houses are working as taxi drivers because the pay in construction is too low. If pay and security of employment in construction were better, they would move out of taxi driving into construction. Also, there would be no requirement for new houses because they are already living here. When talking about housing output, should we make a distinction between types of housing output? To me, overheating could arise if we return to private sector output of the scale we witnessed pre-2008. A dramatic increase in public sector housing output would be different, for two reasons. The houses that are being built are being sold at prices that nobody can afford. The banks, rightly, are not willing to lend to people amounts of money which their income cannot sustain, as they did in the past, leading to the market crashing. It was at the point everybody realised the emperor had no clothes. If the investment is in social and affordable housing, this problem does not arise because it is creating a revenue stream for the Government. One would not be financing housing in an unsustainable way. In terms of current social and affordable housing provision a huge amount of the expenditure is current expenditure, which is an accident waiting to happen. If the State has its own stock, it is not an accident waiting to happen - it is a revenue stream. Should we not distinguish between sustainable housing output, which is public, and non-sustainable housing output, which is being produced at market prices that are unaffordable?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps it is straying into policy but a report produced by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform confirmed a concern that had been raised by many members about the unsustainable cost of financing public housing output by leasing or renting social housing from the private sector. Mr. Mel Reynolds has recently said that even if Rebuilding Ireland targets were met in this way we could be talking about giving â‚¬1.7 billion each year to the private sector to lease or rent social housing, as opposed to the State building the housing itself. Even though the upfront capital cost would be greater it would be more sustainable in the long term because the drain on the current public finances would reduce over time. Does Mr. Coffey believe this is an important point to highlight?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To continue on the housing issue, and I accept the witnesses cannot discuss the policy and the structures, but from the point of view of overheating and the macroeconomic questions that are the council's remit, if the council sees a threat of overheating is it the council's responsibility to warn the Government about it? It is indisputable that the price of accommodation in the private sector is clearly an overheating threat. One could argue all roads lead to it. The labour and skills shortage roads lead to it, as do potential wage demands and potential social welfare costs in terms of the cost of emergency accommodation or renting from the private sector. It is arguable that if one were to look for overheating threats, the housing threat is way beyond any other threat. The council should flag that more strongly. That is incumbent upon a body whose remit is to warn against overheating. For example, NAMA has more or less redeemed all its bonds. Whatever case is made about what it did with its assets up until now, I believe that NAMA continuing to sell off land is contributing to the overheating threat. Would the council accept that it is?
