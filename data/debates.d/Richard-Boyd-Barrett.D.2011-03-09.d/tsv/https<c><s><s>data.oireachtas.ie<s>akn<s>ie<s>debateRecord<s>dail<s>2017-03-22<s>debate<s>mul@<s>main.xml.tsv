RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have to say I find this whole issue extremely distressing, as do huge numbers of people. As Deputy McDonald has already done, I want to pay tribute to those who have campaigned for truth and justice on this issue. I am glad that we are at least close to the moment of vindication for those who suffered and died at the hands of the Bon Secours order in Tuam and the State that colluded with it in its systematic, immoral, inhumane abuse of women and children over many years. Of course, the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam was part of a wider architecture of oppression, degradation, dehumanisation and, ultimately, murder of women and children. We need, even at this belated hour, justice and truth for the survivors and victims of that terrible regime of oppression, imprisonment, degradation, murder and exploitation - an immoral exploitation involving the sale and commodification of young babies who were sold for headage payments and sent to the United States and elsewhere. This is particularly poignant for me because I was born in a mother and baby home. I was one of the lucky ones, although that is not something that I realised at the time. I was lucky to be adopted by a loving family, to have a decent upbringing and to finally be reunited with my own birth mother. However, even the latter had to happen against the resistance of the State and the religious orders who tried to prevent that reunification. This issue makes me think about what my fate could have been. It also makes me very conscious of the terrible fate that so many suffered, quite possibly also in the mother and baby home where I was born. One of the things about which I am very conscious in all this is the issue of class, which has not been talked about enough. It was a brutal oppression of women and children but there was an overwhelming class dimension to it. The mothers who had children outside of marriage who were from poor or working class backgrounds were singled out for the worst treatment, exploitation and degradation. They were literally treated as subhuman. For women from slightly better-off backgrounds, the church still effectively enforced its rules, backed up by the State and forced the separation of mother and child and the adoption of that child but usually the treatment for those women was a bit better. The people who came from poor or working class backgrounds were essentially considered disposable. They were to be exploited and punished. Punishment was a very big part of what went on. There was punishment for sin but the punishment that was meted out to the poor women and children was of a particularly vicious and horrible kind. That is the legacy of this State. I want to conclude on what we can and should do about this. At a very minimum, the Bon Secours order should be forced to pay for the memorial that has been requested. We need a full audit of everything that happened at Tuam. In particular, we need to know the fate of the more than 2,000 children who were sold or exported to the United States. We need a full uncovering of the truth about the 700 babies who lost their lives. We must do everything possible to uncover the truth but we need to go beyond that. The Bon Secours order needs to reconsider its entire existence. It has profited and continues to profit, to an extortionate level, from the support the State has given it through all this, while doing all this to people. The order continues to enjoy that support, as we saw with the recent visit of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Micheal Noonan, to the Bon Secours facility in Limerick. The congregational indemnity agreement needs to be scrapped and the religious orders must be forced to pay up to compensate the abuse victims.  Finally, I will make a call which I believe Fianna Fáil has echoed. The BonSecours hospitals, St. Vincent's Hospital, the Mater Private Hospital and other private, for-profit health institutions run by religious orders should be taken from them forthwith and brought under public control. That might have the spin-off effect of alleviating some of the pressure in the public health system but, more importantly, it would be just in the context of what they have done, particularly as the State supported them in doing it. We need the separation of church and State, particularly in the area of health care where these religious orders were relied on and were responsible for such horrific abuse, neglect, imprisonment and exploitation of women and children. If we do not do all this then frankly, all the weasel words will mean nothing. We must also stop mistreating children in direct provision and in the emergency homeless services, where this sort of treatment continues to be meted out to single mothers and the children of the poor and the less well off.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Acting Chairman for that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Staff are being progressively eliminated from our DART stations. We have it on good authority there are plans to remove staff altogether from DART stations including those at Sandycove and Glasthule, Grand Canal Dock and Lansdowne Road and then move on to de-staff other stations afterwards. DART staff provide absolutely vital health and safety protection, line safety protection, access for people with disabilities and the elderly and passive surveillance against anti-social behaviour and are responsible for a range of measures that, if removed, would seriously compromise access and safety in our DART stations. I am looking for a commitment to the effect that the Minister will tell Iarnród Éireann to abandon plans to de-staff our DART stations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is very disappointing the Minister read - word for word - from the letter I received in response from David Franks, the CEO of CIE, and it typifies what is going on. I do not want to hear the propaganda of Iarnród Éireann as it axes staff and compromises health and safety. If there are no staff in certain DART stations, particularly at night, older and disabled people will not go to those stations. There will not be staff on site to help people with wheelchairs to get onto trains. There will not be people to prevent suicide attempts, and I will give the Minister an example. At Salthill and Monkstown DART station last year, somebody attempted suicide but because there were staff there the trains were stopped and the suicide was prevented. Later that night, at Killiney DART station, the life of somebody who threw themselves in front of a train was lost because staff had been removed. There have been a number of attacks around Shankill DART station because staff have been removed at night. To say it is not the Minister's responsibility to ensure safety and access for elderly people and people with disabilities, to ensure line safety and to ensure equality of access to DART stations is, frankly, disgraceful. I want a better response and I want an assurance we will continue to have staff to ensure safety and access.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will give it to the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is word for word-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----David Franks's letter to me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Word for word.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let me assure the Minister that de-staffing is taking place. Killiney has lost its staff.There is nobody there at night and it is seriously compromising access and safety. People in wheelchairs cannot get on the train if there is not somebody there to put out a ramp. They already have to give huge amounts of notice to get on the train. Pat in the Sandycove station told me this Saturday that he was only on at 6.30 p.m. because of the rugby match, and there were otherwise no staff on duty after 4 p.m. Somebody arrived in a wheelchair on spec at 6.30 p.m., needing to get back to Clontarf by 10.30 p.m. That person was only able to get on the train because Pat was there and able to arrange for staff at the other end in Clontarf to be there for that person in the wheelchair to get off. That person would have been stranded in the wheelchair with no access to the DART if Pat was not there, and he was there only because of the exceptional circumstance of the rugby match. That is the reality. There is no access if there are no staff. I met a member of our own staff here, a woman, who gets off at Seapoint, and she said that she would not go to Seapoint station at night if there was not a member of staff there, because there is a long, dark alleyway. Attacks have increased around Shankill since staff were removed at night. This is an imperative issue and I want the Minister to intervene to ensure we have the staff to ensure equality, access and a community service provided by our DART staff.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I listened to the speakers from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael talk about why they will not support the adoption of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the Constitution, for some reason the word "sophistry" sprang to mind. I looked up the definition of sophistry. It comes from the Greek sophist, and refers to the use of clever but false arguments especially with the intention of deceiving. That is what we got from Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, namely, very erudite and clever arguments as to why we should not sign up to basic rights like equal rights for men and women which might, for example, address gender inequality and the pay gap. The covenant refers to just and favourable conditions of work, equal pay for equal work, the right of trade unions to function freely, the right of protection and assistance for young persons and the right of everyone to housing and the continuous improvement of living standards and the right to education. Does any Government need the discretion not to deliver on those things? Is that some sort of defence of democracy? It is not; it is all about money. We heard the quote from Mr. McElligott from the Department of Finance, which removed references in the original Constitution to try to make the rights in it cognisable by law so that they were more than just pious aspirations and were instead rights that citizens could legally enforce from the State. The Departments of Finance and Justice and Equality said that they could not possibly give legally enforceable rights to people. In other words, they did not want to give them rights that mean anything at all on basic things like those I have mentioned. I want to say why we desperately need legally enforceable rights. I have received a call from a young student and journalist in DIT, one of our major national educational institutions. I have been told about a decision that will affect students on the access programme in DIT. The programme enables students from disadvantaged backgrounds to attend third level education. As of this year, DIT is insisting that all students on the access programme have to be Garda vetted before entering the institution. This has never happened in any other college. The rest of the student body in DIT who enter through the normal CAO system are not Garda vetted unless they are studying a specific course related to working with children, such as social work. Only a small number of the general student body will be Garda vetted for specific reasons related to their courses, but those from disadvantaged communities will, as a matter of course, be Garda vetted. It is a specific form of discrimination against people from disadvantaged communities, and suggests that they are somehow more prone to criminal behaviour, the possible abuse of children or other behaviours which mean that the Garda needs to look into their character, background and history. It is outrageous. Students who are victims of that policy should be able to take legal action against DIT because it is denying them a right under the covenant, which states that higher education should be made equally accessible to all on the basis of capacity. This DIT policy is outrageous and students should have legal recourse and rights that are enforceable against DIT. Young teachers are working beside people who are doing the same job. They should receive equal pay for the same work, but because they happen to have been recruited a couple of years later than those they are working with they can be paid less. It is a form of blatant discrimination which has no justification or basis. They should have legally enforceable rights to hold the State or their employer, which, in most cases, is the State, responsible for addressing that discrimination. Housing is a critical issue and has been referred to by many Deputies. I recently mentioned a young mother with a four year old daughter, a family which has suffered a terrible history of abuse. I will not go into details. They are currently homeless and were told by homeless services that despite the fact that the girl attends school in Monkstown Farm and the family comes from the greater Dún Laoghaire area, they will have to stay in a hostel above a pub in Francis Street. Many vulnerable young mothers and children are being sent to completely inappropriate so-called homeless accommodation which means that the welfare of children is at risk. The future, protection and welfare of those children is at risk, not to mind that of their mothers. It is completely unacceptable and is a result of the failure of the State to provide adequate and secure housing for them. We have a long history of an absolutely chronic, systematic and cruel failure of the State in respect of our vulnerable young people that goes back to the Tuam babies, the Magdalen laundries and the industrial schools. These people were from working class and poor backgrounds and in those institutions they were degraded, abused, tortured and killed. Should those people not have a legal right of recourse to protect them and a right of recourse against the State if it fails to vindicate those rights and, in particular, fails to protect children and to provide the basic right of putting a roof over one's head? How can the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael parties, or the Labour Party which it would seem is sitting on the fence, state that a Parliament needs discretion not to give those rights? That is what they are saying in a very sophisticated way, like the Sophists. There is no reason for any civilised society not to give those legal and enforceable rights to its citizens.
