RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for appearing before the joint committee.  Would they agree the reason the State is in the most severe economic crisis it has ever faced is due to a combination of the then ruling political party, the Fianna Fáil Party, the people leading the Department of Finance, the bankers and the developers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would that be a reasonable assessment of who is responsible for the current mess?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Chairman, is this my time?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who does Mr. Considine think is to blame for the current economic crisis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When a crisis like this occurs, does the party in power, the people at the top in the Department of Finance, the most important Department in terms of the economy, and the bankers not share a very considerable amount of responsibility for the mess?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That would be a "Yes" then.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the witnesses forgive people for finding it difficult to understand how people in Bank of Ireland representing the public interest who were at the helm of important parts of government when the crisis developed are still at the helm of one of the most important financial institutions in the State and being paid pretty handsomely for it?  Can Mr. Walsh understand people being pretty annoyed about that?  The insiders who were at the helm when the crisis blew are still on the inside, still at the helm, while the people are suffering the consequences of the crisis that has developed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given that, does Mr. Walsh understand people's rage about this?  They have put €4.8 billion into the Bank of Ireland.  The chief executive is still paying himself 20 times the average industrial wage, and more if one includes his allowances and expenses.  Since the crash the witnesses have got €0.5 million for being public interest directors on the board and yet the people who paid for the bailout of the banks, and effectively for the salaries of Mr. Boucher and the witnesses through that bailout, are still on their knees in mortgage distress and in small and medium businesses that have been crushed.  The witnesses tell us they have to preserve the best interests of the bank and that somehow that will be good for us all in the end.  Do they not understand how people view that and why they believe nothing has changed, that they are still being screwed and the same people who were in charge are still in charge and are well protected?  Do the witnesses understand how people feel?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is galling for people that the insiders are still on the inside.  Given that, does Mr. Walsh not think the very least that people could expect is that there would be a clear and transparent line of accountability between their public interest directors and the public and their public representatives?  The witnesses are there to champion the interests of distressed mortgage holders, the public and the taxpayers first and foremost before any priorities the bank as an entity might have.  Do the witnesses not think that is the very least people would expect from them and if that is not the case there is no point in them being there?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be slightly more specific.  Does Mr. Considine think it is in the public interest that the CEO of his bank earns 20 times the average industrial wage, more than €600,000 a year, and that that same person came before this finance committee and said there would be no debt forgiveness for the bank's distressed mortgage holders?  Does he think that is in the public interest?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I ask Mr. Walsh the same question?  Does Mr. Walsh think it is in the public interest that the CEO of the Bank of Ireland - that would not be standing if we had not bailed it out - is getting 20 times the average industrial wage at a time when he is saying there will be no debt forgiveness for distressed mortgage holders with the bank?  Does he consider that to be acceptable or in the public interest?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we ask Mr. Walsh the same question, Chair?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The figure was in respect of re-financing and new loans.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a few questions, as we all do, to ask of AIB.  There is a marked contrast between the attitude of Dr. Somers and Mr. Spring towards this committee, in their willingness to answer questions and their greater sensitivity to some of the issues we are raising, and that of the public interest directors from the Bank of Ireland.  Would the witnesses agree this contrast has something to do with the fact their bank is 100% owned by the State which shows the merits of nationalised banks over those in which we have only a minority share holding and people like Mr. Boucher think they can treat public representatives with contempt?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Spring is not going to say it but it needs to be said.  It speaks for itself.  I was nice in my first question but while this is not a matter of chasing individuals I have worked out from the witnesses' answers that Mr. Spring receives approximately €1,000 per meeting and Dr. Somers receives €3,000 per meeting.  Carers work just as hard as Mr. Spring and Dr. Somers and their function in our society is just as important.  The witnesses earn for one meeting what carers earn for five weeks and that payment is being cut.  Do the witnesses think that is fair?  Do they understand how angry people are that because of the behaviour of banks and the very wealthy the people are suffering cuts which will put them in a worse position?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Dr. Somers think he works harder than a carer and deserves to receive for one meeting, even allowing for preparatory work, five or six times what a carer earns in five weeks?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Carers will be doing their work for the rest of their lives.  I would like to put the same question to Mr. Spring.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not being rude but I have very little time and I was concerned about the contrast between what a carer does working long hours and what a banker does.  Does Mr. Spring really think that people like him and Dr. Somers or bank executives are worth multiples-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is too much.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely, and we advocate that, but I am asking Mr. Spring a question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Dr. Somers has ruled out what he calls "divine mercy" in respect of debt forgiveness on the basis that there are too many chancers, and Mr. Duffy has referred to moral hazard.  Will Dr. Somers please explain what would be hazardous in writing down to current market value the mortgages of owners of principal private residences who took out their mortgages between 2000 and 2008 when those mortgages were so high they were through the stratosphere, not through any fault of those who took out the mortgages but through the fault of the banks?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes it is for both.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the public's money.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is weak, Dr. Somers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One individual can invalidate the whole proposal?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not talking about apartment blocks.  My question was very specific.  Will Mr. Spring answer it? In the period 2000 to 2007, before the collapse of the property bubble, people borrowed to put a roof over their head.  What is the moral hazard of writing down their mortgages to current market values?  I can see nothing morally hazardous about doing that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do the witnesses know how much it would cost to do?  Perhaps the witnesses would be able to provide that information.  TSB said it would look into it and provide the joint committee with the information.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It will supervise their implementation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the officials for taking us through the emerging labyrinthine architecture of the new banking union.  I need an idiots guide to understand it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that it is quite complicated and there seems to be a problem in co-ordinating the different elements of the European Union's architecture between the ECB, the Parliament, the Commission and so on, and perhaps that explains its complexity.  In order to understand it, may I ask the following questions?  Is it basically the case that the Parliament writes the rule book, the supervisory mechanism is provided by a smaller group of states, are they the eurozone states?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The eurozone states look after the implementation of the rule book on a day-to-day basis.  Do they ensure the banks are operating to the rules?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will we have one representative on this board?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the supervisory board supposed to be very separate in its operations?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it correct that the supervisor will be accountable to us?  If we want to ask questions about what is going on, do we quiz our delegate or representative on the single supervisory mechanism, SSM; board?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. Carrigan for helping us get the structure clear in our heads.  To what extent is the rule book written?  Will it be possible for us to see the rule book which will then be applied by the supervisory mechanism?  Will the rule book be in a fairly clearly understandable form?  We are talking in terms of architecture and engineering of the supervisory structure, but then of course policy comes into play.  One could have concerns, especially given my perception of the attitude of the ECB.  I have made this point a number of times.  At the beginning of 2008 the ECB issued a guideline to States and to Central Banks in which it states that if states needed to rescue banks, if possible they should avoid nationalisation but even if they nationalise them they should avoid diverting the goals of the bank from profit maximisation to other social goals.  That is its directive because it believes that to be in the best interests of banking, but as some of the discussions we have had earlier today and much of the discussion between the Parliament and banks at present, we might have a very different view of that.  We might think it would be a good thing if the banks took social and macro-economic goals more into account when deciding their policies.  To put some of this into context, it would be useful for us to know what the rules are, how far-reaching they are.Some of them are about the level of capitalisation, possibly risk management and so on, but how far reaching are they and will more rules be developed and, if so, will we see them in a clearly understandable form in order that we know what rules are being applied to the banks and then we can decide whether they are a good idea? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So have we.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With respect, is there a rule book which we can look at?
