RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is this the definitions section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does it include the part that reads, "The purposes of this Act are..."?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with the spirit of Deputy Doherty's amendment and Deputy Broughan's points.  It must be spelled out explicitly in this section that the public interest is the key and central priority and purpose of the legislation.  I would go further, however, and be more specific because the public interest can be interpreted in all sorts of ways.On Report Stage, I will propose the section should be quite specific in stating it will protect the interests of the public, the State, the national economy and, to the greatest degree possible, uphold the twin social and economic priorities of maintaining full employment in the State and the right to a home for all citizens.  This would be in line with the priorities of the US Federal Reserve.  It has social and macro-economic priorities and objectives that are specified as key objectives of the state and the central bank or, in their case, the Federal Reserve, is mandated to uphold those priorities.  Those should be spelt out here.I would agree with Deputy Broughan that there is no harm either in stating explicitly, somewhere in section 4, the need to protect workers' rights.  While the Minister, Deputy Noonan, might say that is already implicit, I see no difficulty whatsoever in making it explicit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it in the Bill?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no harm.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Two of the biggest, and arguably the most important, consequences of the banking collapse have been the onset of mass unemployment and the threat to mortgage holders of losing their homes while all the concerns articulated here are somewhat open to interpretation as references to the public interest - depositors, financial stability, etc.  We should include in this section, and make explicit, social and macro-economic goals such as maintaining full employment and ensuring that people retain possession of their home, which is something that has been directly threatened as a result of the financial crash.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, Chairman, we have skipped on to amendment No. 13.  I want to be clear that we have not run past sections 5 to 7, inclusive, and agreed them without-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.  I see.  I want to comment on section 6.  Will I have an opportunity to do that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In line with some comments that were made earlier and in response to something the Minister said, I signal my intention to introduce an amendment on Report Stage because I fundamentally reject the idea that the Central Bank should be independent.  The freeing of the European Central Bank or central bank authorities generally from political and therefore public control and accountability is a significant part of the problem we are in.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Section 6 deals with the independence of the Central Bank, the Governor and so on and section 7 deals with the Minister and the bank, covering issues to do with its independence and having regard to European Union law.  I reject the proposals.  The priority that should be included is accountability to the public, the Houses of the Oireachtas and the social and economic priorities set out by public representatives.  They should trump-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just want to ensure-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It reaffirms it, though.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I flag my intention to table an amendment to this section.  I suggested previously that the provision referring to the laws of the European Union and its rules on state aid should be preceded by a one indicating that we should have regard to and be accountable to public interest and the Houses of the Oireachtas-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and should only have regard to European Union rules.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am flagging my intention to do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am seeking guidance on this.  I would like to insert something before we move to section 9.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what I am trying to clarify.  If we are discussing the Bill now and raise issues on Committee Stage, can we table amendments on Report Stage?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The issue I wish to raise would fit in logically between sections 8 and 9.  How do I raise that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is why I am asking.  I do not wish to proceed to section 9 before that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To use the phrase the Minister has used a number of times relating to closing stable doors after horses have bolted and so forth, the point I wish to make is that it appears that the thrust or substance of this Bill is about closing doors after horses have bolted.  It is assuming-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The provisions of the Bill and the credit institutions resolution fund, which is dealt with in the next section, are about dealing with the crisis after it happens, preparing for the possibility of another crisis and being able to deal with that situation.  I believe that before it does that the Bill should give powers to the Central Bank to pre-emptively act to prevent a crisis, not just to have a mechanism for dealing with it afterwards.  It should have powers and be generally disposed, as it were, to act before the crisis.  Some of the provisions in Part 2, section 8 and so forth imply that, but then they skip to the resolution fund.  My point is that there should be something in between.  That something should be provisions to allow for the pre-emptive nationalisation of financial institutions that appear to be in trouble and threatening the financial stability of the State or where a particular credit institution appears to be in danger of collapsing.  On Report Stage I would like to be able to insert a new section which gives effect to that argument.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd-Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that but I would like to flag that I want to table an amendment on Report Stage, although I will not delay the committee.
