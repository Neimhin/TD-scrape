RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also want to ask about the Government's priorities and its notion of reform when it comes to the health service and about a particular area of our health service. In the Visitors Gallery today are approximately from 50 to 60 home help assistants who provide vital services of care, support and backup to elderly and disabled citizens across the country, some of the most vulnerable sectors of society. These home help assistants have come together over recent weeks because the Government, as part of this raft of cuts, has cut 600,000 hours of home help. This comes on top of 500,000 hours of cuts that happened earlier in the year. More than 1 million hours of home help services have been cut as part of the so-called reform. The Government is also moving to privatise home help services. Most of the home help assistants here today work for voluntary not-for-profit organisations. The Government has moved to outsource these services to multinational companies like Comfort Keepers, owned by Sodexo, a French multinational.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That multinational, for example, had to pay fines in compensation to New York City for overcharging the city for food and facilities management services. This is the sort of company it is. The Government is outsourcing home help services to that company, degrading services here and cutting services to the most vulnerable sectors of society and attacking the pay and conditions of home help assistants who provide those services. I ask the Taoiseach to reverse the cuts in home help services that are affecting the most vulnerable sectors of our society, to end the privatisation of home help services, to guarantee proper contracts and security of earnings and end the attacks on the conditions of more than 13,000 home help workers in this country who look after our most vulnerable citizens.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Instead of attacking them, why does the Government not go after the consultants who are doing private work in public hospitals or why does it not go after the multinational companies that are overcharging the HSE for drugs?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How can the Taoiseach square the Government's commitment to provide home care services to people with its decision to cut more than 1 million hours of home help in a single year?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How can he square the respect he has expressed for home helps with the outsourcing of home care services to a multinational company that wants to pay home helps by the minute? Does he think somebody who is paid by the minute - who has to clock in according to the minute and has to leave after exactly 15 or 30 minutes - will give the sort of service that is required to the elderly or disabled citizen he or she is supposed to be looking after? The priority of private multinational companies in this sector is to make money out of the disabled and the elderly, rather than to provide them with services or to treat the workers who provide those services with the respect they need. I ask the Taoiseach to reverse the cuts in home help hours. He can get savings from the consultants who are doing private work in public hospitals and are paid obscenely high public salaries. Further moneys can be saved by cutting the prices that are paid to multinational companies. That should be done instead of attacking the elderly, the disabled, the most vulnerable people in our society and the workers who provide these services, who are already inadequately paid for the vital work they do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the point. All of that is going to change.
