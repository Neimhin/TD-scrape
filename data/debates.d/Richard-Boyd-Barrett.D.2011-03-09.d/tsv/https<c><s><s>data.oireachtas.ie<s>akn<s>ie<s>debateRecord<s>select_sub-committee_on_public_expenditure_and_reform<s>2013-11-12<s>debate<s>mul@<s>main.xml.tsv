RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 6:In page 15, to delete lines 9 to 14 and substitute the following:“(3) Every order or regulation under this Act shall be brought before each House of the Oireachtas for approval by both Houses and if a resolution approving such regulation or order is not passed by both Houses, the regulation or order shall be annulled accordingly.”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is handy for her.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One could argue the exact opposite. The fact that one of the richest women in Britain - the Queen - is not subject to freedom of information legislation is problematic. One could argue that including the Office of the President in the legislation would assist in maintaining the integrity and dignity of the office because it should be open, transparent and representative of all the people. It would be positive for the office to be seen as such and accessible to public scrutiny and inquiry. Obviously, the private lives of the President and his or her family are different matters. It would be entirely reasonable, however, to make information on how the office spends its money and so forth subject to freedom of information legislation. In the current climate public office does not have great standing generally. While the President is an exception to this, it would set a good example if the office were to be included in the legislation, stating all public offices would be subject to public scrutiny.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I raised an issue extensively with the Minister at the pre-legislative stage. He certainly cannot accuse me - perhaps he might - of being-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----anti-State or anti-public body.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed. We need to protect, expand and develop public enterprises, which is what I prefer to call them. To my mind, even the language "commercial semi-State" and the Minister's concept of what these bodies entail are deeply problematic. I am not quite sure about from where the term "commercial semi-State" came. They are bodies that are 100% owned by the public. They are public bodies that maintain vital public infrastructure and provide vital public services. Therefore, the public has the right to information on their functioning. I have two points to make on the idea that, since they are involved in a market, they would be disadvantaged in respect of their creditors. First, their competitors should be subject to FOI legislation also if these are important areas. That would level the playing field in a better direction, in that there would be full transparency for everyone, public and private.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed. I will cite an example of where the Minister's argument falls down, that being, housing. Local authorities provide a desperately inadequate amount of social housing, yet it is still significant. They do so in a commercial market, if one wanted to put it in these terms, in that there are private providers of housing. Using the Minister's logic, local authorities should not be subject to freedom of information legislation because they are engaged in the commercial housing market.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a public service obligation in the case of transport and one can walk through the forests which are vital parts of our heritage. Saying something is a commercial operation and, therefore, the catch-all term of "commercial sensitivities" should insulate it from public scrutiny is unacceptable, particularly when there are major question marks over what is happening in Coillte or, in an example close to me, Dún Laoghaire Harbour. The public believes it to be theirs and they are right. People want to know what the hell is going on there, why the CEO pays himself massive amounts of money and why hundreds of thousands of euro have been paid to consultants in developing elaborate plans for the harbour, none of which has ever materialised. That it belongs to the people is also true of every other harbour and airport in the country. I do not have time to go through every individual body, but the amendment I will formally move - I have tabled one or two, but I must go now - would require everything to be included. The onus should be on those bodies to make a case as to why particular FOI requests would prejudice their ability to function or disadvantage them. We start with the presumption that all public bodies must provide the information. If they have a problem with this, we can set up a mechanism to allow them to make a case in order that they would not be disadvantaged. That is the other option, but the Minister has never addressed it, despite this and previous discussions. Let us have the presumption that information should be freely available in all of these bodies unless there is a particular problem, at which point a body could make a case. Someone we trusted could adjudicate on the rights and wrongs of that request. That would be a reasonable approach. It is also the approach proposed by groups such as Transparency International and just about everyone else who gave expert testimony on this subject.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the first instance, there should be no exemptions; there should be a presumption that public bodies would provide information. If the Minister wants to bring forward as an argument for not doing so that private entities would then have an advantage over public bodies, my belief is that what is good for the goose is good for the gander in any given market.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to speak to amendment No. 15, which really deals with the same issue but elaborates further on it. It was put forward by the environmental pillar but goes beyond environmental issues in terms of freedom of information. It refers to public bodies, not excluding the semi-State bodies. The particular concern of the environmental pillar is that the semi-State bodies have an enormous impact on our natural environment, our amenities, on biodiversity and other important areas of public interest. To exclude organisations like Coillte, Bord na Móna and others is unacceptable in their view and I completely agree with them. We have debated at length at other committees, for example, the goings on inside Coillte, notwithstanding the fact that many of us campaigned against its privatisation. There are real issues involved here. I do not see a good reason for their exclusion. The Minister has argued that it is about commercial sensitivity and competing in a commercial environment and so forth but that is not a good enough reason to insulate these very important bodies, which have such a huge impact on our society and our environment, from the provisions of the freedom of information legislation. This amendment has been tabled in that context. I wish to make a philosophical point regarding our earlier discussion with the Minister. The inevitable logic of the Minister's argument is that if an entity or body is operating in a commercial environment, secrecy is justified. That means that the more we commercialise areas of endeavour in the economy, the more secrecy we have and the less access ordinary members of the public have to information. To put it in very simple terms, it means more privatisation, more secrecy, less accountability and less information. The Minister's argument is an admission of that. He is admitting that privatisation equals secrecy, lack of public oversight and an erosion and undermining of democracy. I believe that is actually the case but surely that is not something we should accommodate. Surely we should be doing the exact opposite of accommodating the proposition that commercial activity insulates commercial entities from any requirement to be properly accountable, transparent and open to scrutiny by members of the public.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have rehearsed this argument and will return to it again on Report Stage. Environmentalists have been at pains to tell me that very often the definition of "environmental sustainability" that is used in political parlance, in the Dáil and elsewhere, is so narrow as to reduce its meaning to nothing. When sustainability is defined by the EU in various environmental directives and at the conclusion of environmental summits, like the Rio summit in 2012, it is a very broad definition that takes into account the impact, at every level, on society and on communities because that is the environment. The environment is not just the fish in the sea or the level of pollution in the air. The environment is, literally, everything and that is how it is defined. It is not just me or Irish environmentalists who are saying this.That is how it was defined at the Earth Summit in Rio and is defined in EU directives. The point being made by environmentalists is that the companies the Minister is exempting have enormous impact on our society and the environment in the broadest sense and therefore to insulate them on the grounds that they are engaged in commercial activity would be a massive blow to the campaign for environmental sustainability in the official and proper meaning of that term.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The effect of this amendment is to extend the areas to be covered by the Bill to tribunals to which the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921 applies. The proposed amendment could hold for any tribunal that is set up. We know that a rake of tribunals have been the subject of considerable controversy and have generated extreme public anger and annoyance as a consequence of the amount of money expended. The specific groups that prompted me to ask Deputy Donnelly to table this amendment gave evidence to the committee at the pre-legislative stage. These included groups and organisations representing asylum seekers and refugees who are very concerned by what they see as the shroud of secrecy that exists around the asylum process and appeals. They want the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to be subject to requests under FOI so that they could get information. They have also proposed areas such as Refugee Applications Commissioner, the Garda National Immigration Bureau, the naturalisation and immigration-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay but will the Minister consider including the Refugee Appeals Tribunal and tribunals in general?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about tribunals in general?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So, the Minister is saying yes, but not during the deliberation phase.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will think about what the Minister has said.
