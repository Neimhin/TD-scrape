RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am opposed to this motion because it will put Shannon Airport under further pressure to maintain itself by facilitating the US military war machine. By removing the most profitable component of Shannon, Aer Rianta International, the airport will be forced to increase its dependence on military traffic from the United States in order to maintain its viability. The Government is aware of this fact. The motion is also another stepping stone on the way to privatisation and undermining the conditions of workers and employees. The absence of consultation with staff and unions is indicative of what is going on. I note that Michael O'Leary is opposed to the changes because he wants full privatisation of the airport.Sadly, Michael O'Leary's concerns are ill-founded because, like with many of these quangos or established semi-State operations, moving them a little further away from direct State control into some sort of quango is a stepping stone towards privatisation. All the commercial pressures that drive companies towards privatisation will now begin to operate on Shannon because its most profitable component has been removed and because the hopes for a major expansion in passenger numbers are absolute fantasy, particularly against a global background of falling passenger numbers and economic crisis in this country and in Europe.  The idea that Shannon Airport will be able to increase civilian passenger numbers significantly is pie in the sky. What will happen is that Shannon Airport will be pushed into further dependence on US military traffic. This process has been apparent for quite a while, but it will accelerate now. If one were a conspiracy theorist - I am not - one would wonder whether matters such as this were discussed by the Government with US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, during her visit last week. There is certainly no doubt about the key role Shannon Airport has played in facilitating the US war machine nor about how important the US Government considers Shannon to be in propping up its war machine. It was no coincidence, for example, that when President Obama was visiting Moneygall he made a point of saying how important Shannon Airport was and how grateful the US Government was for the facilitation of the US military there. With the economic viability of Shannon Airport seriously under question, undermined and under pressure as a result of the Government's proposal, the pressure to expand its facilitation of the US military machine will increase significantly. It is worth pointing out what the terrible cost of this has been for a country that is supposed to be militarily neutral and which has asserted in its Constitution that we should in no way play any part in facilitating military conflict on the international stage or participate in wars. For ten years now, since the horrors of the 9/11 obscenity that took place in New York and the war on terror that ensued, we have seen the barbaric war in Iraq claim 1 million lives or more, tens of thousands of lives claimed in Afghanistan and the abomination of the US rendition programme, where the most powerful and supposedly most democratic and civilised state in the world engaged in routine kidnap and torture of alleged terrorist suspects and maintained places like Guantanamo Bay, where people are left for years without trial. The fact that Shannon Airport is part of that architecture is appalling. Our current President has been very forceful on this over the years and has called for an end to it. The Labour Party, prior to the election, said it was utterly opposed to the use of Shannon Airport to facilitate the US war machine, yet here we are about to adopt a measure that will put further pressure on Shannon Airport to depend on this traffic in order to sustain itself as a viable entity. With the austerity, the economic crisis and all the other terrible things happening in society, this matter will pass under the radar for most people. In some ways this is understandable, but it is vital to register opposition and protest against this move and its implications in terms of deepening Ireland's involvement with the US military machine as it continues to engage in its brutal war mongering in Afghanistan. This comes at a terrible cost to the people there. We know economic crisis and military conflict go together historically. Sadly, given the deepening global economic crisis and the huge instability we see in areas like the Middle East, it is quite probable we will see further military ventures conducted by the United States over the coming years. Again, Ireland will be involved in those as it is becoming a kind of outlying military base for the United States war machine. This motion, to separate Shannon Airport from the Dublin Airport Authority will move it even further in that direction. I oppose this motion strongly and appeal to the Government to understand that what airports should be is part of our vital civilian infrastructure. They deserve to be subsidised - this goes for Knock and other small airports - because they are part of our vital infrastructure. They should not be dependent on the toings and froings of the global market and certainly should not be dependent on the war machine of the United States or anywhere else.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure the public looking on find this whole spectacle pretty depressing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not going to do that. The people of this country are not worried about political spats between parties-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The people of this country are not interested in political spats at the moment, they are interested in survival, a fact confirmed by the ESRI today, which shows that more than one in five households in this country suffers from joblessness and they are doubly and trebly hit by having to support large families and support disability and by being concentrated in low paid work. The report reveals the shameful fact that, contrary to the Taoiseach's repeated claims we are in a better position than Greece or Spain, Ireland is one of the most, if not the most, unequal societies in Europe. The Taoiseach's budget has chosen to attack precisely this group yet again. He has attacked children, he has attacked women, he has attacked the disabled and he has attacked low paid workers. In many cases, it will be the same households hit from the left, hit from the right, hit from the middle and stabbed in the back with these cuts to vital supports and to the income they desperately need to keep their heads above water, despite the solemn promises made by the Taoiseach to prioritise the disabled and made by the Labour Party three days before the general election that it would not touch child benefit. Can the Taoiseach seriously claim this budget is fair? Is he not ashamed to have betrayed the trust of the people who voted for him and the people who voted for the Labour Party in visiting these attacks on precisely the groups he promised he would protect?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People are protesting today and they will be protesting tomorrow, Thursday and Friday. These protestors understand that unlike the Clearing House Group, whose members sit down with officials of the Department of Finance and script the budget for the Government, their voices are not being listened to. Did the Taoiseach read what the ESRI said today? It said that people are trapped in unemployment because they have all the extra burdens of large families to support, because of a dysfunctional social welfare system which puts obstacles in the way of getting back to work, and because of the lack of child care facilities and public services. The Government has made all of those issues worse through, for example, cuts in the income disregard for lone parents, in the back to school allowance and in child benefit. All of those measures further trap these people in poverty. My question to the Taoiseach is very simple. Does he accept that his party has betrayed the solemn promises it made in the last election to protect the vulnerable, particularly the disabled, and that the Labour Party has betrayed its absolutely explicit and solemn promise not to cut child benefit? This Government is turning on the people to whom it made these promises. Does that not make him ashamed? Does he not agree that it discredits the entire political system?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Taoiseach about his prospects for engagement with outside parties in the context of framing the budget. Is it not the case that, when examining the balance struck in the past two budgets, he has been listening to some groups very seriously and not listening to others? We know from last year that the Clearing House Group, comprising banks and speculators, precisely the sorts of people who caused the crisis, has privileged and institutional access to the Government. The group is chaired by the Department of Finance and comprises Barclays, Bank of Ireland, Citigroup and a range of other financial interests. The budgetary submissions of these bodies are included in the Budget Statement almost word for word and the Taoiseach trenchantly defends their demands. He makes their demands to have no increase in corporation tax and no financial transaction tax red-line issues and fights for them trenchantly. When groups representing the less well-off, the disadvantaged, the disabled and the low-paid make representations to him asking for a different balance to be struck in the budget and taxes on wealth and profit as an alternative to attacking the poor, the less well-off, the disabled and the vulnerable, the voices that always win out with the Government are those of the financial services sector, multinationals and the super-wealthy. Why does he defend so trenchantly the demands the latter make in their budget submissions and ignore the pleas of those representing the least well-off who wish for a different type of budget that focuses on protecting the vulnerable, prioritising investment in job creation and having a tax system that shifts the burden of austerity onto those who can afford it rather than those on the breadline?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	State Street is a speculator.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise; it is even closer to the Taoiseach.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We all want to move on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I add my voice to the protest against the guillotine being imposed on this issue. In the programme for Government, the Taoiseach promised a democratic revolution, no less, a new type of politics and a new level of accountability. We are discussing a Bill that will touch deeply on the lives and quality of life of vast numbers of our most vulnerable citizens. I appeal to the Taoiseach at the least to be true to his word on allowing real debate, accountability and transparency on these most important and sensitive of matters and to allow a more open-ended discussion and certainly not to try to truncate the debate on these issues. The Taoiseach would be doing himself a favour if he did so and if he showed some willingness to listen to the views of the public and those affected on this issue. It would not be a climbdown. Rather, it would show a little courage from the Government if it allowed for a debate and, God knows, even better, it would allow time for the Government to reconsider some of these measures.
