RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For some time, I have been trying to ring the alarm bells about the dangerous and flawed approach of the Minister and the Government to the housing and property sector. In dealing with other Ministers, I pointed out that it is leading to an emergency in the area of homelessness and the social crisis, but I also believe that it represents a serious threat to the macroeconomic health of the economy. This is confirmed by Douglas Newman Good's survey last week which shows that, unbelievably, a property bubble is developing again, just as I told the Minister it would approximately six months ago.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister shows an unwillingness to acknowledge the seriousness of the issue. It is not just about absolute levels of property prices or rents; it is about the dramatic increase in property prices over the past few months. Property prices in Dublin have risen by 23% in the past 12 months, by 12.9% in the past three months and since 2012, when the market bottomed out, prices have increased by 36%. I do not have figures for rent but the homelessness crisis, where six people declare themselves homeless every day, is indicative of the dramatic rise in rent taking place in Dublin. Two years ago, the Government told us this would not happen and said that cuts in rental allowance could lead to a reduction in rent. The Government has been spectacularly wrong in its approach to this sector and, unbelievably, it has introduced property-based tax incentives such as real estate investment trusts, REITS, and changes in capital gains tax that encourage a massive speculative surge from big vulture funds that have accelerated their investment in this area. It is causing a dangerous property bubble.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Irish Times today ran a headline which asked whether it was time to take a punt on Irish property again. Does this not concern the Minister or for that matter the Taoiseach in going to New York and talking about how property investors should come to Dublin because they could make a killing in the Dublin property market? To start to treat and incentivise speculation in property after the economy was beggared precisely because of that activity seems crazy beyond belief. One of the consequences of this, as I am sick of pointing out, is an absolutely massive housing and homelessness crisis. Even the Irish mortgage brokers association has stated it cannot and will not provide social housing for people on low and middle incomes. It will not do it. That is why we say rent allowance is not accepted. On the one hand, we again have speculation in this area and, on the other, we have a homelessness and housing crisis. When will the Minister wake up?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is not building any.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the banks that are building them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Which the Minister would not give to the councils.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The plan now involves building only 2,000 houses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In recent months, representatives of workers and trade unions have stated they believe it is time to change wage policy to see wage increases for workers to alleviate the deprivation many working people suffer as a result of six years of cuts, to give an urgently needed boost to demand in the economy and to stimulate growth and employment. Will the Minister consider responding positively to the calls of workers and trade unions for wage increases?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A total of 27% of households in which one person is working are suffering deprivation. Moreover, 10% of those in which two people are working are suffering deprivation. Consequently, in addition to the hundreds of thousands who have no work and are suffering poverty and deprivation, there is the significant phenomenon of the working poor, that is, those who are working long and hard but still remain in poverty. On that level, there is a necessity to shift from wage cutting to wage increases to alleviate such deprivation. However, it is also extremely clear that taking money out of the pockets of working people, as has been done in the past five years, has absolutely destroyed domestic demand on the high street for small shops and businesses. Ghost towns are developing nationwide, which is hitting employment because people have no money in their pockets to spend. While the Minister might have a point about considering this issue on a sector by sector basis, does the Government intend to shift policy and begin to examine ways to push up the wages and disposable incomes of low and middle income workers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ireland is a low-wage economy. Employee compensation as a percentage of total operating costs in Ireland stands at 22%, one of the lowest anywhere in Europe. It is considerably less for workers than is the case in Britain, France, Germany and most other European countries. Workers in this country, frankly, are being screwed against a backdrop in which productivity is high and profits are rising. The collapse of the joint labour committees and the lack of legislation on collective bargaining, thereby giving workers trade union rights, mean employers are not disposed to give people wage increases, even where they are making profits. What proactive measures will the Government take to ensure workers get a share of the profits they are producing to deliver them from deprivation, as well as to give a boost to the economy which could lead to the creation of jobs? There is no trade-off involved as if workers are paid a little more, they will have more to spend and it could create more jobs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the logic of the race to the bottom.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The news that AIB was offering write-downs to distressed mortgage holders was somewhat positive, but the submissions we received from groups such as FLAC, the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation and others last week showed that there was incredible inconsistency across the banks in dealing with mortgage holders in distress. They have stated a crisis that was in abeyance for the past few years because of uncertainty is now ready to explode, particularly for the 33,000 families over two years in arrears. With rising property prices and so on, the banks will accelerate the move to repossess people's homes and the people concerned pointed to the Government as being the one that needed to do something about this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As has been said already today, as well as on many other occasions and reinforced by the groups before the finance committee last week, many of the so-called sustainable solutions are just demands for so-called voluntary surrender or, increasingly, an acceleration of repossession efforts. Lenders are not seriously implementing the mortgage-to-rent scheme, for example, which would be a way of dealing with people in real repayment difficulty. There is significant inconsistency across the banks because the Minister gave them the veto in the personal insolvency legislation. Banks are being banks. That is what we were told in the finance committee. Banks will always behave with their best interests at heart, not in the best interests of distressed mortgage holders. The Ministerâ€™s responsibility is to ensure consistency and fairness for the tens of thousands of people in mortgage distress.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point is that while some progress is being made, there is also a clear increase in the move to repossession proceedings. In the last two months of 2013, there were 3,331 proceedings for repossession, a significant increase the finance committee was told last week. As I already pointed out, there has been no serious effort to offer the mortgage-to-rent option for people on the lowest incomes. Instead, for much of the time, the so-called long-term solutions are just demands for voluntary surrender. There is radical inconsistency across the banks.Does the Minister intend to let the banks carry on doing what they want to do or does he propose to improve fairness and consistency in this area by intervening more in the process? That is what we called for last week at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not work for the bondholders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where are the mortgage-to-rent arrangements?
