RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a few questions.  Mr. Boucher will have to bear with me as I am not a financial expert but that puts me in the same position as most people in the country in term of trying to grapple with this debacle in which we find ourselves.  If I understood Mr. Boucher correctly, Bank of Ireland has €60 billion worth of mortgages.  Is that right?  Its provision against losses on that are €1.4 billion.  Will Mr. Boucher confirm that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is €28 billion and the provision against losses on that is €718 million.  Is that right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am really trying to figure that one out because we were told in the Central Bank report on mortgage arrears that of the approximately 777,000 mortgages, 95,158 are either in arrears or have had mortgages restructured.  I note from its figures that even this year, we have gone from a situation where in March, there were 49,600 mortgages in arrears and as of now, there are 55,763 in arrears.  There has been an acceleration in mortgage accounts going into arrears.If one looks at the total, 95,158 of the 777,000, approximately 12% or 13% of mortgages are in trouble and the situation is accelerating.  However, the proportion Bank of Ireland has set aside for losses is €718 million against €28 billion.  That is a hell of a lot less than 12%, although I do not know what the fraction is.  Perhaps somebody could help me with the arithmetic but I suspect-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is less than 3% when we are told approximately 12% of mortgages are in trouble and that situation is worsening.  Are we looking at a time bomb?  Are Bank of Ireland's stress tests even remotely close to being accurate, because they do not tally?  Unless Bank of Ireland is doing so much better or its mortgage book is in much better shape than everybody else's, it strikes me that there is something amiss.  Perhaps Mr. Boucher will clarify that because it does not really add up.I refer to the more general macro-economic picture.  What is Mr. Boucher's opinion on the likely impact of further austerity measures which will hit the incomes of ordinary people who hold mortgages with his bank or other banks?  Bank of Ireland used to produce reports on the economy and what we should do; perhaps it still produces such reports.  If the situation is already deteriorating in terms of people falling into arrears, being unable to service their mortgages and so on and there is the likelihood of further austerity measures which will further cut into the incomes of people who hold these mortgages, is the situation not destined to get worse?In that context, is it not time the banks or somebody said stop taking money out of the pockets of ordinary people because if we keep doing so, they will not be able to pay their mortgages and we will have more defaults on mortgages, more people will lose their homes and so on?  I am just trying to square that circle because it seems fairly obvious from the facts that is what we should be saying.I refer to an issue discussed earlier.  Unfortunately, I had to zip in and out to attend the Dáil.  What is the attitude of Bank of Ireland towards debt forgiveness for people in trouble?  Is it a priority for the bank to keep people in their homes?  Earlier, Mr. David Hodgkinson said it was AIB's priority, although he said that at this stage, it had not actually engaged in debt forgiveness or write-downs but that it was restructuring and so on.  He said it was considering it.  What is the attitude of Bank of Ireland to debt forgiveness and write-downs?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be very brief.  The country's future has been mortgaged on recapitalising the banks, which caused this mess.  Will there at least be some payback in terms of write-downs, forgiveness, forbearance and so on in terms of mortgage holders who are in trouble and guarantees that banks, which are effectively being financed by the public, will keep people in their homes?On the question of the banking culture and the delegates' role in it, does Mr. Boucher feel he has any responsibility for the fact that he was head of the retail division from January 2006, when the value of land and development loans grew by €7.1 billion, and, if reporting is correct, he specifically backed Mr. Seán Dunne's proposal for the Jury's site, the borrowings for which were €275 million?  That site is symbolic of everything that went wrong.  If Mr. Boucher supported that proposal - I understand he did support it - is that not an example of someone being directly responsible for the reckless lending on a massive scale that crashed the economy?  If that is the case, how can it be appropriate that he is heading up the key pillar bank being funded by the public?Let me ask about the salaries of workers in the banks.  The salary cap of €500,000, more than ten times the average industrial wage, has been breached by Mr. Boucher, with wages of €675,000.  Does he not agree with most people in the country who think it is obscene that bankers who were involved in causing the economic crash are earning up to 14 times what the average industrial worker earns while being slaughtered as a result of the policies pursued by the banks?  What will happen to bank workers?  Will these workers, as well as society generally, pay the price?  How many of them will lose their jobs as a result of the reckless lending by executives?  Is it right that ordinary bank workers who had no responsibility for bank policy will lose their jobs as a result of the mess made by the bankers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How does Mr. Boucher explain the massive disparity in the overall picture for mortgages?  Even if Bank of Ireland's mortgage book is in better shape than the rest, there is a massive gap between the overall picture and the situation in Bank of Ireland.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Which suppositions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Which ones?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked considerably more questions than those.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Therefore, Mr. Boucher cannot give us a figure for how many jobs may be lost?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Therefore, we cannot get a straight answer.On the Jury's site, Mr. Boucher says he cannot comment on individual accounts.  Would he consider the lending of money for a hypothetical site like the Jury's site an example of the absolutely reckless lending that took place and that anyone who thought lending for such a development at that point in the market was engaging in reckless lending?  Surely, there must be a definition of "reckless lending" and some examples of it.  It strikes me that that is one of the biggest possible examples.  It is inappropriate that people who would be enthusiastic about such lending for such a project should still be running the banks, given the impact it has had on the economy and the banking system.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not want to personalise this, but what about the salaries paid and the salary cap?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Boucher think it is appropriate that a €500,000 salary limit, more than ten times the average industrial wage and generous by any standards, should be breached in the case of the CEO of Bank of Ireland, given what the bank has done to the economy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is extraordinary.The Vice Chairman, Senator Liam Twomey, took the Chair.
