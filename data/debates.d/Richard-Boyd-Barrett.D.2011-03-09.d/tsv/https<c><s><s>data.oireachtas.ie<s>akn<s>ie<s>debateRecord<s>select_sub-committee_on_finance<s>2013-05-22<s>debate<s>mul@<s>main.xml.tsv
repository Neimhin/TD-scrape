RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister for his opening remarks. In terms of his assessment of the economy and where it is at, the Minister paints a relatively positive picture of the Government's success, as he would see it, in fixing the economy and preparing it for economic growth, improved employment rates and so forth. However, I would put it to the Minister that when we look at the question of jobs, which is the priority, the balance sheet does not really look that positive. The Government is claiming that it has delivered 92% of its commitments in the programme for Government related to the fostering employment. With 92% of what the Government promised already delivered, in terms of various initiatives, schemes and legislation, the net impact on the chronic level of unemployment is 1%. The unemployment rate has dropped from 15% to 14%. That is not a success story. Indeed, emigration probably accounts for most of that reduction. Whatever about the arguments concerning what we have done to date, from now on we must have a much more focused plan for dealing with unemployment, to offer some hope to the hundreds of thousands of people who are without jobs. I said in the Dáil recently that I do not see why we would not have targets that are as specific for reducing unemployment as the ones the Minister and the troika have for deficit and debt reduction. There are very specific targets set for the amount that will be taken out of the economy and how that will impact on our deficit. Why can we not have targets which chart a course towards reducing unemployment to reasonable levels or, indeed, to as close to 0% as possible? Should that not be a priority and a target for the Government?I do not see in anything that the Minister has presented the likelihood of that happening, especially because the European economy is in recession through the impact of austerity being imposed elsewhere, and that is to a considerable degree choking off our hopes of export-led growth. The Minister says service is growing. It has already been pointed out that the export of manufactured goods is declining and the Minister points to some improvement in the domestic economy but in reality it is very flat. Demand is very depressed. The Minister needs to be far more proactive in putting forward a plan to deal with mass unemployment. I do not see anything in what he has said that gives us any hope for a substantial reduction in unemployment in the foreseeable future. He needs to address that matter. It comes down to investment rather than continuing to suck money out of the economy as he is committed to doing by making cuts worth a further €5 billion to meet deficit targets. Given that the Minister is committed to continuing with these cuts, where does he hope to get this €5 billion? He has just about, perhaps, managed to convince the trade union leadership to accept another €250 million or €300 million worth of cuts but it is pretty clear, regardless of whether he succeeds in getting that deal over the line, that he has reached the bottom of that particular barrel. He cannot expect people to take any more. He cannot expect people who are unemployed or those on low or middle incomes or public services to take any further cuts. Where will that €5 billion come from? Is it not obvious that if he continues to take it from people who are already at the end of the their tether, it will do extreme damage to the economy and society? Given the events of recent days and the revelations about Apple and other companies paying negligible levels of corporation tax, should the Minister not consider this as an alternative source of revenue for the State to pay off deficits and, more importantly, to make the investment the economy so desperately needs? If the reports we hear are correct for just one company, albeit a very big one, making €22 billion in profit in one year and paying only €10 million in tax, 0.5%, one could say that if it paid only 10% tax on those profits, that would be €2.2 billion of revenue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is where the Minister should look if he is talking about raising extra taxes or wants to bridge deficit gaps or is trying to find revenue for the investment we so desperately need to create employment and kick-start economic growth. We should highlight the fact that we are now approaching the situation of having a primary budget surplus. Our primary deficit is much smaller than the very large deficit which is regularly mentioned, most of which consists of interest payments on a massive debt the State has incurred as a result of the crash, and the unloading of the bank debt on the State to a point where if the Minister's growth projections and hopes do not materialise, it may be unsustainable. This year we will pay out €8 billion in interest on a debt most of which is not our citizens' debt. Do we not have to deal with that because we are close to the point of taking in as much in tax revenue as we spend but we are still in this deficit position which requires further attacks on incomes and so on, with the likelihood of further damage to the economy because of a massive interest bill? I note, and the Minister noted in respect of the Estimates, that a significant sum is being paid out for consultancy advice to the Government on dealing with the banking crisis. The sum for 2013 is estimated at €6.5 million and the same for 2012. Will the Minister name the consultants who receive that money to advise him on the banking sector? It is a lot of money and some would say that they are not doing a very good job in dealing with some of the key concerns that citizens have about the banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a straight question for the Minister. A large amount of the overall programme expenditure which has increased is the area of financial services policy. It is one of the biggest items for 2012 at €10 million and it is to increase to €14.6 million in 2013. As that is a very large chunk of the overall Estimate, will the Minister tell the committee a little more about what this expenditure involves?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we dealing with the subhead on travel and subsistence?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a figure under this heading that I mentioned at the outset in my opening statement. Some €6.5 million in consultancy and other services represents a good deal of money. Who are we consulting with or hiring as consultants and for what purpose?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister repeat that, please?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is SEPA?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The figure of €165,000 for a PricewaterhouseCoopers salary was to do with financial security. Is that the case?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He was doing what exactly for €165,000?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One hundred and sixty five thousand euro is a good deal of money to pay someone, is it not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister stated the figure for SEPA was €850,000. Who exactly are we paying that to? How many people are involved in that? Will the Minister elaborate a little?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the cynical take.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a big jump there again.It has increased from an estimate of €75,000 in 2012 to €425,000 in 2013. This relates to consultancy again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am keeping my eyes on the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What proportion of the 1 million registrations claimed by the Minister is accounted for by declarations made by multiple property owners? What proportion is accounted for by declarations made by local authorities in respect of the liability of their housing stock for this tax?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are filing electronically.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When the Minister says 1 million people have filed, not all of them are paper returns.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is 300,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I believe the Minister is dodging the question slightly. Of the 1 million returns filed, 700,000 are paper-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some 300,000 paper returns and 700,000 electronic returns have been filed. The Minister said multiple property owners were likely to file electronically.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do they have to register?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One had to file electronically.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that; the date is 28 May. There is no reason to believe that many of the 700,000 people who filed electronically are not multiple property owners.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So was everybody else who wanted to file electronically.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Anybody who wants to file electronically has until 28 May.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A spokesperson for Apple testified to the US Senate that it paid 2% tax in Ireland and had negotiated that with the Irish Government. I find the explanation on ASI extraordinary. A company that made €22 billion in profit in one year and which is registered in this country only paid €10 million, or 0.5%, in tax. The Minister claimed it can do that because it is nothing to do with him, and it is paying tax on its business in Ireland and everything is fine and dandy. That is unacceptable and ludicrous.This is a company, which as a result of us facilitating it, is getting away with paying virtually no tax at all. As the Minister rightly says, it has big operations here. How, therefore, is it getting away with paying so little tax if it is registered here? The Minister says this is just an accountancy procedure and not alchemy. However, it is difficult to tell the difference between these two things because what the company is managing to do to avoid paying tax is bordering on magic. The Minister seems to be advising that we should not look into this because it might endanger jobs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This bears much more serious debate and scrutiny. The Minister has his position and it is slightly condescending to suggest that I do not understand. The problem is that this issue lacks transparency and there is a deep reluctance to have a serious debate. Instead we are warned by the Minister that jobs will be endangered if we dare to even look at this issue. I refer to statements from people around the world who are not of the radical left persuasion such as in the United States and Britain. For example, Chatham House is saying that Ireland is a tax haven and that we are facilitating a situation where multinational companies making extraordinary levels of profits are managing to avoid paying any serious amount of tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Which are registered in Ireland.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is semantics.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I understand it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand perfectly. It is registered in Ireland and our legal definition conveniently suits them. It was probably negotiated with them.
