RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is an order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The pathetic, meaningless and mealy-mouthed apologies from bankers over the tracker mortgage scandal are prompting nothing but fury and frustration among the victims of that scandal and the wider public. The Tánaiste has said that pending reports, the Minister for Finance will look into the possibility of legislation in this area if it is needed. What people out there want to know is whether as a matter of urgency, the Government is going to look into whether legislation is there to ensure that if a fraud or theft was committed by the bankers, they will go to prison. The reason people are asking that question and the reason the Minister needs to answer it is because to date, bankers guilty of fraud and theft have not gone to prison. I point out for his information that even though by any definition what the bankers have done in the tracker mortgage scandal accords with the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act's definition of fraud, it is then neutralised by provisions in the Central Bank Act that essentially allow the regulator to impose administrative sanctions and for no criminal prosecution to take place.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In other words, in Irish law, there is one law for bankers and one law for everybody else. The Government needs to address that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am a great fan of science fiction. I have to say that when I hear about visions for 2040 and for national planning frameworks, and the beautiful visions that are set out in such documents, I immediately think of science fiction.The vision is beautiful but the reality often turns out to bear no relation whatsoever to the vision that has been set out. It is a bit like in science fiction where one has two genres - the one where there is a plan for the future that everybody can subscribe to and which has everything one would want in it. It is balanced, harmonious and integrated. It could happen if we planned rationally and democratically. The other genre is the dystopian nightmare. I put it to the Minister of State, Deputy English, that the utopian vision that is often presented in these plans rarely comes to pass. Much more often than not we end up with the dystopian nightmare because regardless of how beautiful the plan is and how well thought out it is, the people who make the plan actually have no real power to implement it because they have ceded the power to make the important decisions to other people who have no interest whatsoever in the plan. It will not surprise the Minister of State to know that I am talking about the market and the dynamics of the market. We, as the democratically elected representatives of the people, set out a plan and consult with the people. There is, however, a question about the extent to which we have actually consulted or consult with the people who are the real stakeholders on this or any other plan. Even if we do this and we develop a well-integrated and harmonious vision for the future, that plan is undermined, subverted, ruined and neutralised - whatever one wants to call it - by the fact that those people with large amounts of money, investors, people with capital, the banks, the developers and the private owners of the land are the ones who make the decisions. With regard to previous spatial frameworks I have heard many of our rural colleagues in the House speaking on the destruction of rural Ireland. They know, far better than I do, about the realities of the destruction of rural Ireland. As an urban Deputy I absolutely agree with them. We periodically produce plans - this plan will do it again - which are aspirations to do something to ensure we have proper regionally balanced development and to maintain sustainable town and village life in rural Ireland. That is a beautiful plan, but does it happen? To date it certainly has not happened. We have had increasing centralisation in a few hubs such as Dublin, Cork and one or two others. This is regardless of spatial plans and the aspirations for regional development. Why does this happen? It is because the decisions about where investment happens are taken by big business and big capital. They dictate it. We have a Government, and I would say the two major parties in the State, that actively facilitate the ceding of their own power to these voracious entities and capitalists - to use old-fashioned left-wing language. We end up simply trailing and facilitating them. They decide where the investment is going to and the Government facilitates them, which renders all the plans nonsense. I shall give a few examples in different areas. Ireland wants to sustain its small towns and villages but that cannot be done if the Government cuts the bus services while telling us that commercial viability has to be the main criteria by which we judge the viability of bus services. This is what is done and we hear it week in and week out, especially from Fine Gael. When Fianna Fáil was in government, however, it was not much different. We hear that the service must be commercially viable, but if we want to protect our small towns and villages then sorry, we need a bus service and public transport services whose future is not determined by whether or not they are commercially viable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What does the Deputy mean "like Dublin"?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, Deputy Ó Cuív wants to play Dublin off against the country. As an urban Deputy I want to see rural Ireland protected and I make the point that in order to do that we do not privatise or bring to bear commercial priorities to services such as public transport. If we do that - we are doing it - bus services and transport infrastructure will be cut to those areas. Post offices will be closed - this has been done. Small schools will close because it is all about the viability, in the narrowest possible terms, of these particular services. The market does not consider it a good idea to subsidise bus services or transport infrastructure or to have post offices that achieve social goals, if they cannot at the same time make money. No matter how good it was, the reality is the plan goes out the window. Housing is another obvious example of this. The market completely undermines any of the spatial plans. Ireland's recent experience is an obvious example of that. I remember the regional planning guidelines that dictated certain big developments in the Dún Laoghaire area. This included building houses on green spaces because certain population projections for building houses had to be met. Planning permission was given for certain developments but the joke was that these houses were built by the market that had no interest in actually connecting the homes they built to the people who needed the houses. The houses were built and the people could not afford the houses. The value of those units collapsed, the banks collapsed and we still had people who were homeless with nowhere to live. The market stopped building, the banks stopped lending and the people who needed the houses have left the State because there is no work for them as the economy has collapsed. In any event they could not afford the houses that were built. For six or seven years no houses were built, even though we had these beautiful plans and projections about population growth. It was all rendered meaningless because the housing market was completely privatised. The investment decisions and the infrastructure investment that would go with it was, in the end, actually decided by private banks and private developers. The Government continues to put the decision making into their hands, even as we face a housing and homelessness emergency. I do not really see the point in these national framework plans if the Government continues to cede control over land, property and capital more generally into the hands of these entities. I shall give another example of forestry and Coillte. If Ireland is to tackle the environmental issues facing us - it is one of the big imperatives for the future - then we must do something serious about carbon emissions. Again, commercial imperatives prevent the Government from doing this because it does not want to give over land to forestry, which would be a carbon sink and so on. Ireland pleads to the EU that we do not want to have to meet the targets and that we want special treatment and so on and so forth. Coillte is the body that is supposed to plant forests. In the business pages of The Irish Times this week one will read that Coillte now wants to engage in public private partnerships to use its land to build giant wind farms. The article also says that Coillte then plans to sell them off. This has not been mentioned in the Dáil this week. Coillte is explicit about this. It is going to sell off Coillte estate. We need to control whether we are going to be the ones to decide what happens to land use and what we will do around environmental protection and climate mitigation.How can we do that if the body in charge of 7% of the land mass of the State and which is charged with the afforestation of the country plans to sell off massive tracts of land to its public private partners? How can we control or have any influence on the future if that is what we are doing? Those examples can be multiplied across almost every sector of the economy. I believe in planning and in consultation and input but what is the point when all the other plans have come to nothing while the market has dictated our circumstances until now? What is the point if we continue to allow big business and corporations to gain control of more land, infrastructure, services and capital because the Government will not tax them? Wealth is concentrated ever more in their hands while the population is left as a passive bystander to watch what the multinational corporations do to us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not in the community.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is envisaged that there will be 17,000 HAP tenancies next year. How on earth is the Government going to achieve that given the extent of rents, in particular in parts of Dublin? They are far in excess of HAP limits. I do not see how the Government can possibly deliver in the areas where they are needed most the HAP tenancies the Minister imagines will be delivered next year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is all very well setting out the theory and the plan. We know we have not met almost any target set by this Government over recent years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are not being met in my area.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want the Minister to answer me, not just give me the script. While I am sure other Members will say the same about other parts of Dublin, in south Dublin in particular, there is no chance of securing significant numbers of HAP tenancies. There are 14 properties available to rent in total for everybody in the Dún Laoghaire area, the cheapest of which, a one-bed, is €1,400. The HAP limit for that is €900. The cheapest two-bed is €1,600, while the HAP limit is €1,275. The cheapest three-bed is €2,200, while the HAP limit is €1,300. The cheapest four-bed is €2,400, while the HAP limit is just €1,375. That is the reason people in our area are now in homeless accommodation or sleeping in cars. HAP is simply not viable. What are we supposed to do where HAP is just not going to happen in certain areas? Side by side with the above, private development is taking place of houses which are completely unaffordable to people on the list. If we could get them for social and affordable housing, we might solve the problem. However, there is no effort being made to get a higher proportion of Part V provision or of social and affordable housing in the construction that is taking place. We just get the fantasy of HAP.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If HAP works in certain areas, happy days. I am delighted with anything that keeps people out of homeless accommodation. However, in south Dublin, accommodation is not available under HAP and I would like the Minister to address this. I would like Government Members to get this into their heads. There is quite a lot of expensive accommodation. Ten times more rental accommodation is available for in excess of €3,000 a month than for under €1,500 a month. There is lots of accommodation that nobody can afford but no accommodation that people on HAP can afford. That problem will be exacerbated because of the proportion of private housing being built for the market currently. Even when the houses come on stream, they will still be unaffordable because they will be priced above the HAP limits and, therefore, even the medium-term and long-term plan will not address the problem in south Dublin. Will the Minister get that into his head and then we can start to move towards solutions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister kidding me? People are fighting each other.
