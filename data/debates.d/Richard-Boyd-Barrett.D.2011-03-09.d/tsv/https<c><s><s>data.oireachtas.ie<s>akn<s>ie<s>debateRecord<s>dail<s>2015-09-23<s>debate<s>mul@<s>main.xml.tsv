RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have asked approximately 100 questions about Dún Laoghaire Harbour over the past four years and the fear that I and many people in Dún Laoghaire have about the creeping privatisation of Dún Laoghaire Harbour. This question relates to the decision of the harbour company to put up for sale 0.47 ha in an area called "the Gut", just off the west pier in recent weeks. Is this not proof of the creeping privatisation of Dún Laoghaire Harbour? Was the Minister made aware of the plan to sell this land, which in the Dún Laoghaire Harbour plan also was earmarked for residential development, which is strongly opposed by local people? Does the Minister think it appropriate that the company should put up for sale this land when the governance of Dún Laoghaire Harbour is going to change - it has not yet been decided fully - and when a due diligence exercise is under way to establish what the hell is going on financially within the harbour company?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First, in terms of the legislation, the ultimate decision on what will happen in Dún Laoghaire Harbour is the Minister's. I had that confirmed in a rather bad-tempered letter I received from the chairwoman of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----squealing, frankly, about some of the stuff I had been saying about the harbour company. I do not have time to deal with all of that now but the contentious issue is the question of privatisation of the harbour and the extent to which privatisation of the harbour is linked and contingent to this cruise berth plan.Similarly, in the harbour master plan, other land at St. Michael's Wharf in the old harbour, as in the case of this site which the company has put up for sale, is earmarked for exclusive private residential development. First, the people do not want this and, second, the sale of land is clearly privatisation of the harbour. As the main shareholder in this company should the Minister be allowing this to go ahead against the background of huge controversy about it and given the future governance and plans for the harbour have not yet been decided and are ultimately in his hands?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First, the sale of public land is privatisation. That is what it is. Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company has now put up for sale part of Dún Laoghaire harbour. This is linked to a master plan which the Minister has acknowledged also proposes private residential development in the form of hundreds of private apartments on the site at St. Michael's Wharf and in the old harbour. That is privatisation. This is going on now. The company is pushing this stuff through. As I said, the people do not want this. The Minister is the person in charge, although I agree with him that this matter should come under the ambit of the council. This group of people appear to be a law unto themselves. The Minister said he cannot do anything about this because those involved are independent directors, even though he is the main shareholder. We cannot get proper answers from the council and these directors continue to sell off parts of the harbour, which are earmarked for private exclusive residential development. That is privatisation and the Minister is letting it happen. There was supposed to be a due diligence of the financial situation in the harbour.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Building apartments is a big change.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Building apartments is not a core activity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Halligan has now arrived.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Obviously, we all welcome anything that will facilitate the further expansion, improvement or development of the public transport infrastructure, or anything that will facilitate greater investment in that infrastructure. There are a few different aspects to this Bill, the first of which is the bus rapid transit, BRT, system. For anybody who is watching this, we should not use jargon too much. As I understand it, the legislation is designed to facilitate the NTA in making decisions on the development of the BRT system. The system, which involves super bus corridors, is a good development. There are three routes being proposed: Swords to the airport, Blanchardstown to UCD, and Clongriffin to Tallaght, all of which are important routes which are certainly about facilitating consumers - sorry, what is the word - not "consumers"-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Commuters. Not consumers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed, it is not. The Minister is so right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is about citizens. The Minister is absolutely right. These corridors seem like a good idea and I would be in favour of them. My fear, which was touched on by Deputy Ellis, is that against a background of consistent reductions in subsidies in the form of the public service payments to Dublin Bus, which have dropped every year, including every year under this Government - from €85 million in 2008 to €60 million now, which amounts to a €25 million loss in Exchequer funding for Dublin Bus - there will end up being a trade-off between these super bus routes, which we need and which are a good development, and the public service obligation to provide commercially unviable routes to citizens. Here, indeed, the distinction between consumers and citizens is quite an important one, because with the reduction in subsidies from the Exchequer to Dublin Bus, the temptation - indeed, I would say, the pressure - tangibly evident within Dublin Bus to see passengers as purely consumers from whom it can get money will result in the cutting of routes that it considers not to be profitable or financially viable. There should not be a trade-off, but it is becoming a trade-off. Sadly, my constituency is one in which it is being felt particularly acutely. I engaged with the Minister, or one of the Ministers of State from the Department, before the summer recess about what can only be described as the savaging of whole public service routes, or the public service element of routes which, although they might be busy routes, contain parts that are not considered to be particularly profitable. There are plans to either change or cut altogether the Dublin Bus routes 7, 111, 8, 59, 45A and 63. All of those changes, or out-and-out cuts, will hit working-class communities, where there are particularly large numbers of users who are elderly or very young on routes which are not the big commuter routes. In the case of the 7, which is a big commuter route, the part of that route which I suspect Dublin Bus feels is not very financially useful to it - the part that goes through Sallynoggin, and has gone through it for as long as I can remember - will be cut, dealing a significant blow to Sallynoggin. Similarly, Killiney village is losing its bus altogether. The frequency of buses going into Loughlinstown Park, a very disadvantaged working-class area, will be cut in order to facilitate the super commuter route from Cherrywood, which is considered to be a large transport hub. I will not go through the full list, but this is happening. Indeed, it is no coincidence that many of those routes I have just mentioned are also routes that are part of the outsourcing or privatisation that the Government is pushing through the plan to privatise 10% of orbital routes. It is not a coincidence that these routes are being slashed; they are also the ones earmarked for privatisation, and they are being replaced with the super commuter routes. The Minister should not get me wrong; I want the super commuter routes, but they should be additional to the routes that serve communities, villages, and areas where there is a high proportion of elderly people and so on.However, that is not happening because the Minister has slashed the subsidy to Dublin Bus, which was already one of the lowest anywhere in Europe. The Minister is engaging in the classic mechanism for privatisation of a service. Although he will deny it and say it is only a bit of privatisation, it is clear what is happening. Bus routes on which communities have depended for decades will be lost in order to facilitate the privatisation agenda and push Dublin Bus away from the public service model into a commercial, for-profit model. For this reason, I am very worried about it. The BRT will accelerate the pressure, although it is a good thing in itself. In my remaining two minutes, I will discuss taxis. While some of the regulations and changes seem to be reasonably positive, taxi drivers will have concerns about others. Section 2(a), which will bring dispatch operators who are working off apps such as Hailo under the regulation of the NTA, seems like a good thing. Some of these operators could undermine, and are undermining, existing taxi drivers. To bring them under some regulatory framework is a positive move. However, there are other aspects that are more worrying. Section 2(h) specifies that where the licensing authority decides not to grant a licence or to revoke or suspend a licence, there can be no appeal. No process in which a decision could be made that could affect the livelihood of a taxi driver should be without an appeals process. There should always be an appeals process. This must be examined. I have previously raised with the Minister on behalf of taxi drivers a serious problem which arose most recently around the decision to change the fare structure. This required the recalibration of meters, which was a cost for taxi drivers. The representatives of the taxi drivers said the taxi advisory committee did not properly consult with them and that the NTA imposed decisions without a proper consultation process. The Bill should address such matters and provide that there be real consultation rather than high-handed imposition of decisions from above in a way that can potentially be detrimental to the livelihoods of those workers. I do not have time to make my final point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While the proposed declaration is not highly objectionable in itself, it seems tokenistic. The taxi drivers are saying that the problem with proper regulation of the industry is enforcement - that not enough NTA staff are going around and doing checks to catch rogue drivers who are not compliant in a whole series of ways. This is of deep concern to bona fide taxi drivers. The declaration looks tokenistic and decorative, given that it is an undertaking to do things that drivers have to do legally anyway. Instead, we should put resources into enforcement. Some taxi drivers made a simple proposal to me that there should be an emergency number for taxi drivers so that they can call the enforcement people if they suspect somebody is not compliant in some way. Such simple, practical measures, which involve a little more resources, would be better than decorative measures that will make no difference.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Over the four and a half years of its term, the Government has stumbled from crisis to crisis in terms of the fairly disastrous situation in the health service. It is a little like the story of Peter and the dyke, where one crisis appears and the Government moves under pressure to stick its finger in one hole and then, quickly, a crisis develops elsewhere. There have been multiple crises over the four years in accident and emergency departments, chronic rises in the waiting lists, the mess in child mental health services and cuts to all sorts of other services causing problems, whether it is home help or cuts to personal assistants for those with a disability. Whatever it is, the fundamental problem is that the Government has not reversed the disastrous series of austerity cuts which have taken place since 2008 and have seen €4 billion taken out of the budget, 14,000 staff taken from the health system and 1,600 beds taken out of the system. The slogan of the Government was that it would get more for less. What we see now is one does not get more for less. When one slashes budgets, staffing and beds to that extent, one gets disaster. Of course, the flip side of that coin is the Minister going on and, essentially, trying to scare people into taking out private health insurance in order to go over to the private system because of the disaster in the public system which, ultimately, is the real agenda of the Government. The Government's real agenda is to run down the public health system and cause a crisis in it through under-funding, under-staffing and under-resourcing in order to terrify people to move into private health. That is what has happened and it is really quite astonishing to have a Minister in charge of the public health system only a few months ago touting, essentially, for the private health insurance sector.
