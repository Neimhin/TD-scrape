RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When I spoke to the Taoiseach about his failure to pay student nurses and the use of temporary agency contracts for contract tracers and medical scientists carrying out testing, he baulked when I suggested that the Government is trying to fight Covid on the cheap. I should rephrase it and state that the Government is trying to fight Covid on the basis of cheap labour and utter gross exploitation. The latest example of this is just absolutely scandalous. Some 15 contract tracers employed four weeks ago on these crappy CPL contracts that I exposed a number of weeks ago have not been paid a cent for the past four weeks despite working on the front line in Covid. They have not been paid at all despite being signed off the pandemic unemployment payment, having no income to pay their bills and being absolutely critical to the contact tracing we need to keep ahead of this virus. They have not been paid by CPL
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This, by the way, reflects the experience of another group of similar contact tracers I mentioned a while ago who were on those zero-hour contacts-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----for whom it took eight weeks before they got paid a cent by CPL. This is an outrage. What is the Taoiseach going to do about it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There has.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The conditions for Palestinians under Israeli occupation are horrendous at any time but the fact that last Tuesday week Israel carried out, in the midst of a pandemic, the biggest demolition of homes of Palestinian families, 11 in number, making 80 people homeless including 41 children, is truly shocking. The pictures show the demolitions destroying water containers, farm equipment, solar panels and so forth. Much of this equipment was funded by Irish Aid and European Union money. This is happening, incidentally, in a year when the number of Palestinian home demolitions is the highest since 2016, which was the highest record year of demolitions by Israel of Palestinian homes. I remind the Taoiseach that the forcible transfer of populations in this manner is a war crime under international law. I note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, condemned this but beyond words, is anybody going to do anything about this? This is EU-funded equipment in many cases being destroyed by Israel. I note that on 15 October Deputy Coveney said that Ireland and the EU states were looking to get back from Israel €625,000 which has been lost as a result of the destruction that Israel is wreaking on projects, equipment and so forth that was Irish and EU fund-aided. Have we got the money back from Israel and what are we going to do to stop the shocking ethnic cleansing and destruction of homes by Israel which is beyond words?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need to get the money back.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On 20 October, I raised with the Taoiseach the issue of student nurses and the fact that they are working during a pandemic where they cannot do other jobs for the most part, certainly in other healthcare settings, and are working long hours on the front line of the Covid-19 effort and not being paid. That is scandalous. In that engagement the Taoiseach, who obviously was not scripted on it, said that it was wrong that they were not being paid in the same way as they were in March and April and that he would follow up on it. Since then it is clear that the follow-up is that he is not going to pay them. I want to tell him that there is fury about that. A total of 250,000 people watched the video of that exchange between the Taoiseach and myself, while 120,000 have watched the exchange on the same issue between myself and the Minister for Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly. I want to apologise to the student nurses. I got so many messages from them I cannot reply individually but I will give the Taoiseach a flavour of the sort of messages I am getting. One second year nurse worked six weeks on placement. She worked four days a week in the Rotunda Hospital from 7.30 a.m. to 4 p.m. She also had a job in retail at the weekend where she was being paid absolutely nothing. She worked two weeks in a gynaecology ward from 7.30 a.m. to 8.30 p.m. and was not paid a penny.She points out that for the privilege of working on the Covid front line for nothing, she must pay €3,000 per semester. Therefore, not only does she not get paid for being at the front line in a pandemic, but she must also pay for the privilege, as must all the other student nurses. What is happening is an absolute scandal. Is the Taoiseach going to pay these student nurses, who are holding the front line when, according to Mr. Paul Reid, 2,000 healthcare workers, mostly nurses and midwives, are out sick because of Covid? We are relying on them more than ever in the battle against this pandemic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should do it again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should read the accounts of student nurses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The sacking of Mr. Donald Trump by the American people and the rejection by the majority of Americans of his hate-filled, toxic, racist and divisive agenda is a cause for celebration for people across the world. It is a major blow against the forces of the political far right who were emboldened by his toxic agenda, including small but growing forces of the far right in this country. Although Mr. Trump and the far right are down, they will not be out unless we challenge the conditions that gave rise to Trumpism and the growth of the far right. In Ireland, I am involved in a new group that will be launched in December with support from Sinn Féin, the Social Democrats, trade unions, artists and so on. It is called Le Chéile - Diversity Not Division and, as the name suggests, is an attempt to promote a movement of social diversity, pluralism and unity against the hate-filled agenda of the far right. A key point that Le Chéile - Diversity Not Division wants to make, and one that we need to be aware of in terms of what has happened in America, is that, unless we address issues like poverty and inequality in society, the housing crisis and the fact that large numbers of people across the world are disenfranchised by a grossly unfair system, the politics of the far right will have soil to grow in and come back. That must be the lesson. While what has happened is a cause for celebration, unless governments like the Taoiseach's recognise the gross inequalities in society, the gap between the rich and poor and the failure to provide basic elements such as secure and affordable roofs over our citizens' heads, we will still have the conditions in which the far right can grow. That is the challenge if we are to ensure that Mr. Trump and his like stay on the political margins.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Democratic socialism.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what the Taoiseach said about-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Boris Johnson is a wrecker. That is clear from his Internal Market Bill and his talk of breaching international agreements, resurrecting the threat of a hard Brexit and resurrecting fears, which must be resisted every inch of the way, of a hard border and so on. More generally, there is the economic damage that would be done as a result of a no-deal Brexit and the advent of tariffs, customs and so on, on an east-west basis, all of which will do very severe economic damage to particular sectors of our economy. Most important, as Deputy Barry said, they will have a severe impact on working people, in the North, in the South and in Britain. It is par for the course for Boris Johnson to behave in this sort of reckless way. In that context, we support the broad thrust of this Bill, which is about trying to maintain, as much as possible, the status quo in terms of the common travel area arrangements and co-operation on a North-South basis in respect of health services provision, social welfare arrangements, immigration arrangements and so on. The intention is to minimise disruption and ensure people's rights are maintained as much as is possible. In broad terms, therefore, we support the provisions in the Bill. However, I find some aspects of it interesting and noteworthy. It is a lengthy Bill and there is a lot in it. As I said, the broad ambition to maintain the status quo is absolutely correct, but it is interesting that the Bill, because it has to cover so many different areas, highlights certain aspects of the status quo, particularly in terms of the tax system and corporate tax reliefs, which are not so wonderful. The Minister might address this issue in his response. For example, section 51 relates to an anti-corporate tax avoidance measure set out in section 130 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 which seeks to re-characterise interest paid as a distribution of profits in certain circumstances. It is a good measure in that interest being paid by a company to one of its subsidiaries is one of the main mechanisms by which companies, many of which are based here but have operations elsewhere in the EU, avoid paying tax. If a company is paying interest, that is considered a cost and, therefore, eligible for tax relief. As this section rightly identifies, these so-called interest payments are often, in reality, distributions of profits. However, the correct re-characterisation of interest payments as being, in fact, distributions only applies to countries outside the EU. Within the EU, companies can fiddle their taxes by calling their profits interest payments, but companies outside the EU are restricted from doing so. Whether they are inside or outside the EU, companies should not be able to fiddle their taxes by characterising profits as interest repayments and, therefore, costs. This is a very significant mechanism through which bigger companies with subsidiaries in multiple jurisdictions can evade tax. As I recall, it was used by one of the companies owned by Mr. Goodman, which had operations in Luxembourg, to reduce its tax bill. Many companies do the same. It is interesting that, notwithstanding the wrecking ball being thrown by Boris Johnson and the possibility of a hard border, this Bill makes provision to ensure that Britain will still be treated, in effect, as a member of the EU for the purposes of facilitating companies there to continue availing of this particular form of tax avoidance. Whatever about Brexit, the section on corporation tax is revealing in that in the case of all of these myriad tax loopholes that benefit large corporations by facilitating them to reduce their tax bill, Britain is still going to be included in the loop. In case anybody gets me wrong, I do not think that we should single Britain out in this regard. As I said, I accept that the purpose of the Bill is broadly to maintain the status quo post Brexit. However, it is interesting that the status quo includes myriad tax loopholes which, it seems, are absolutely essential to maintain. Those loopholes allow corporations that should be paying a much bigger contribution in tax to avoid making that contribution. That is noteworthy. On the broader thrust of the Bill, we have to do everything possible to ensure that the Boris Johnson wrecking ball does not succeed. Under no circumstances, whatever may happen, must we allow any of his actions or pressure from the European Union to protect the Single Market from Boris Johnson's race to the bottom to result in any talk of re-establishing a hard border. While I welcome President-elect Joe Biden's comments on not doing trade deals with Britain if it does anything to endanger the peace agreement in the North, to break international agreements or to cause the reinstallation of the border, I echo some of the comments made by Deputy Barry. We should not put too much trust in Joe Biden. We are all relieved to get rid of Donald Trump and the toxic politics and agenda of hate and division that he represents - he was, of course, an ally of Boris Johnson - but we should not be under any illusion that Joe Biden and the Democrats will necessarily be stalwarts when it comes to preventing the sort of neoliberal agenda that Boris Johnson represents. Joe Biden and the mainstream of the Democratic Party have facilitated and encouraged neoliberalism and the race to the bottom at the expense of working people. It was, to a significant extent, their failure to protect working people in the United States and their facilitation of a corporate agenda that created the conditions for the rise of the rotten and toxic politics of Trump in the first place. I would be cautious about placing much hope in or dependence on Joe Biden. I hear Sinn Féin also saying that such illusions in Joe Biden would be somewhat misguided. Johnson is a wrecker and has been exposed as such. He has similarly been exposed for his incompetence and failure on Covid-19. One can see that playing out with the mess - the Northern Executive has to share some culpability in this - arising from the failure to recognise the need to be co-ordinated with the South in an all-island strategy and to maintain the current restrictions rather than talking of lifting them on Friday. For these reasons, the time has never been better to make the case for a united Ireland. When we look at what Johnson represents, the mess he has made in Britain at every level and, indeed, how the politics of the DUP, Johnson and others are threatening public health on this island and the ability of people to deal with the existential health threat presented by Covid-19, now is the time to make the case for a united Ireland. However, it has to be a different type of united Ireland, one which genuinely offers a better future and real equality for working people and an end to the politics of sectarianism and division.
