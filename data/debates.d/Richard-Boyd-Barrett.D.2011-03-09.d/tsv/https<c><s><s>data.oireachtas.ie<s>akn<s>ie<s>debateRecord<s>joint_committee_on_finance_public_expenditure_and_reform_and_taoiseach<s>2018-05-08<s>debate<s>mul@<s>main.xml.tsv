RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. Breen and Ms Foley for being here today. Do all of the cases of women who had false negative results and who subsequently developed cancer - the nine cases pending and the one which the agency understands has yet to be filed - involve CPL?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The American laboratory. The people who demanded a gagging order for Vicky Phelan-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are both of those laboratories American?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All the cases of misreading that have resulted in women learning that abnormalities should have been discovered and who subsequently developed cancer, of which the State Claims Agency has knowledge, involve American laboratories. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There were no other cases settled by the agency other than those nine and Vicky Phelan's case. Is that right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a very damning fact which should have come out before now and it says it all. There are no cases involving the Coombe Hospital.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Coombe hospital. We have been informed by the Government-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there another group?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am trying to get clarification on something. This is not the agency's direct concern but one of the big issues at stake here is whether there were differences in the detection rates of the outsourced American laboratories and the Irish laboratories that were testing the samples, as warned about by Sam Coulter Smith and the quality assurance people in the HSE who resigned in 2008. What Mr. Breen has just told us is very informative in that context. He has told us that all of the cases of misreading and failure to detect abnormal or cancerous cells in women who subsequently went on to develop cancer, and who took cases against the State, came from the American outsourced laboratories.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	None of them is from the Coombe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the big news here and it says it all, frankly. The warnings issued in 2008 have proven to be correct. That is quite stunning but it has taken us until now to get to that truth. We could not get that information last week or in the DÃ¡il today. We have to have scoping exercises and all sorts of hullabaloo but actually, we just needed to know whether the issue was with the American outsourced laboratories. We have just discovered that it was and in that context, there is almost nothing more to say. I cannot understand how those laboratories are still doing our smears. Mr. Breen is saying that all of the cases involve American companies. He has also said - and I believe him - that the State Claims Agency would never have sought a gagging order and that it was CPL and presumably the other laboratory that were seeking gagging orders. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Breen know of any other cases where gagging orders have been sought?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, it was just CPL that was looking for a gagging order. Mr. Breen is asserting that under no circumstances would the State Claims Agency seek a gagging order in a case like this involving medical malpractice or clinical error. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Coombe had made a mistake - which very tellingly it has not - and was being sued, would that change the likelihood of a gagging order being sought? Would the situation be different if a case involved the Coombe and a domestic laboratory that is part of the health service here?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us say, hypothetically, that a case had been taken over a false reading carried out in the laboratory at the Coombe. In those circumstances, Mr. Breen is saying that neither the HSE nor the State Claims Agency would have sought a gagging order. Is that right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Whatever about screening quality, there is a difference in how the State treats a victim of a false reading if it involves the Irish health service as against a privatised, outsourced company. One puts the patient through the wringer and the other, that is, the public agency, does not do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of clarification, the indemnity kicks in or might be sought where the misreading is beyond normal error. Will Mr. Breen clarify whether it is only in those circumstances? A certain number of false negatives are expected. I just want clarification on that. Can anybody who gets a misreading under any circumstances take a case, and would the State Claims Agency seek indemnification, or is it only where it is beyond normal error?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In all those cases, beyond normal, was the-----
