RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister really expect the parents of the most vulnerable children in the country to accept that answer, given that both the Labour Party and Fine Gael were extremely vociferous in demanding full implementation of this legislation just one year ago?  Does he really expect them to accept that money cannot be found when the value of the most recent bond paid for Anglo Irish Bank far exceeded the â‚¬230 million he says is necessary to implement the legislation?  We can find the money to pay off the bondholders of a zombie bank such as Anglo Irish Bank, but we are unable to find the money to meet the needs of the most vulnerable children in the country.  In the discussions with the EU-IMF delegation do we tell them we have no chance of economic recovery if implementation of the Government's austerity programme means substantial and consequential long-term adverse effects in terms of the quality of education provided for young people who are the key to our economic recovery?  Is it not asking us to apply cannibal logic to our society and children?  How can we accept this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I echo the sentiments of Deputy Keating.  I am aware of a school in my constituency which I will not name.  There have been consistent complaints about serious pressure being put on less well-off students to come up with extra money for things that are part of the core curriculum, such as art and other subjects.  Parents have had stand-up rows with a headmaster, during which they have told him that they do not have the money and that a daughter is being excluded and put under extreme pressure and anxiety.Could a circular be sent to schools setting out in strident terms that it is unacceptable to put any pressure on students to come up with money for core curriculum subjects?  Could we have a unit in the Minister's Department which people could contact if they have a problem?  If schools are not obeying the rules, what can be done about it?  What recourse do parents have to bring such matters to the Department's attention so that action can be taken?
