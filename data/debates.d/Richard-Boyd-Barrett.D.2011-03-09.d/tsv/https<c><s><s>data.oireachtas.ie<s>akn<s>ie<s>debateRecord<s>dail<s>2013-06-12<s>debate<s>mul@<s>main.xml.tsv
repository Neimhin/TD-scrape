RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 3, to delete lines 10 to 16 and substitute the following:“(a) in subsection (3) by deleting paragraphs (a) and (b) and substituting:“(a) charges such as rent as is set down in a national rent scheme established by the Minister.”,(b) by deleting subsection (4),(c) in subsection (5) by substituting the following paragraphs for paragraphs (a) and(b):“(a) A housing authority shall, in accordance with regulations made for the purposes of this section, not later than the date prescribed by the Minister for the purposes of this subsection make a scheme (in this Act referred to as a ‘rent scheme’) in line with the national rent scheme as referred to in subsection (3).(b) A housing authority may, from time to time, as the Minister directs, revoke the rent scheme and make a new rent scheme.”.”.I have tabled these amendments because I believe that rents should be set according to people's means and ability to pay. If one is on a social welfare payment in Donegal, Dún Laoghaire or west Cork, one's payment is the same. If one is earning the minimum wage in Kerry, Kilkenny or Westmeath, one's wage is the same. Social housing rents should be set on that basis, namely on what people are able to pay, given their income and no other factors should be taken into consideration.  At one level, this Bill suggests that the Government is moving in that direction because it refers to removing certain considerations that should not be included in the setting of rents. That is welcome because it is wrong, for example, for property prices to be in any way influential in the setting of rents for social housing. In my area of Dún Laoghaire, and I suspect it is true of Dublin generally and other major urban centres, social housing rents have been heavily influenced by local property prices, which is completely unfair. Property prices should have no bearing whatsoever on social housing rents. I have compared the differential rent scheme in Dún Laoghaire with schemes elsewhere and found that - for no apparent reason other than the fact that private rental rates in the area are high in general - social rent rates for the area are higher than the average, even though the income of people who depend on social housing is no higher in Dún Laoghaire than elsewhere. This situation is grossly unfair and the Minister of State seems to be trying to address it with this legislation, at one level at least. However, while it is fair enough to take market prices out of the equation, the Minister of State is still giving the power to local authorities to vary rents. The Bill refers to issues such as the cost of maintenance of the social housing stock, for example, as something which can influence the rents local authorities can charge. I do not believe that is right, particularly against the background where budgets for local authorities and the money being made available for the provision of social housing are being cut, year on year, because there will be major, if not irresistible, pressure on local authorities to increase rents in order to maintain their housing stock. Therefore, significant variations in rent levels between one location and another will continue, based on the financial health or otherwise of the relevant local authority.  We need social housing because there are 100,000 families on the social housing list. We must provide for such families right across the country in a major way, which has not been done for the past ten to 15 years. I hope this Government will address the urgent social housing need that exists. That must be done and the rents for that social housing must be based solely on people's ability to pay, now more than ever, as so many in our society are struggling financially. There should be no question of rents for social housing being increased because of financial pressures on the local authorities. While there are elements of this Bill that are progressive, there are other aspects that are very retrograde. The way to address that is to have a national differential rent scheme, to be applied right across the board, rather than giving local authorities the power to vary rents, depending on what pressures they are under. That is the logic behind my amendments and I hope the Government will seriously consider accepting them. I believe they are fair. The Department seems to be acknowledging, in this Bill, that there is an unjustified variation in rents across the country. If the Department accepts that, then the best way to address it is to devise a national differential rent scheme, based purely on people's ability to pay. I look forward to the Minister of State's response.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Power, particularly now, is money. Everything else is just decoration. If the Government is cutting budgets for local authorities to provide and maintain social housing while at the same time saying it is empowering local councillors that is frankly a bit disingenuous, to put it very mildly. It has power over an ever-diminishing cake. In that situation only one pressure will come on those councillors.  There will be no pressure on them to reduce rents; let us be clear about that. The only pressure will be to increase rents. That is what will happen. The logic is very similar to what is being done with regard to the property tax. Many others think it is unfair and unjust, and a burden imposed on people who own their own homes. Then, in an act of empowerment, supposedly, the Government is giving local authorities the right to vary that property tax by 15%. The Minister of State and I know which way it will go. It will go up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It will. There is no question but that it will go up. The pressure on local authorities who are having their central funding reduced will increase. That will also happen with rents. Talk of Stalinism and centralisation is a bit ironic. Without getting into history, more people on the other side of the House had previous associations with Stalinism than those on this side.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Minister of State is concerned about having the input of local authorities on the setting of rents it could be done at a national level. We could have inputs from all local authorities on a national differential rent scheme. The end result would be a national scheme where there would be input from all stakeholders, including anti-poverty groups, housing NGOs and so on as to what rents would be fair and reasonable to charge people in a harmonised national differential rent scheme.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Without that rents will increase, which is unacceptable. I will press the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The main arguments have been made. I am glad that the Minister of State accepts the general thrust of the argument, if not the actual amendments, in stating her own commitment to a harmonised and fair scheme. I seriously worry that she is leaving the door open for things to move in the opposite direction. The logic behind the amendment is to have harmonisation and I do not really think it is that difficult to achieve. To back up the logic of my proposal, there is a serious rent arrears crisis in many local authorities, certainly in my area which I suspect is replicated around the country. Many people are not able to pay their rent.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Therefore, it has been confirmed in Galway and Kildare. Deputies are nodding in agreement. This is evidence that we need to move urgently to a harmonised and fair system. If the Minister of State said the level of flexibility would be specified and limited to a 1% or 2% variation, I could accept her argument that the transition is acceptable. This, however, is open-ended. She is proposing that there be wide scope for local authorities to increase rents significantly, depending on the financial pressures they are under. If that is the choice available to us, I suggest my proposal is the better solution. Deputy Catherine Murphy has pointed out that in her consultations the Minister of State mentions the Department of Social Protection, her own Department and county managers. Where are the public representatives? Where are the representatives of NGOs dealing with housing issues on the front line? Where are the representatives of anti-poverty groups to consider these matters? They need to be involved in consultations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There should also be consultation with public representatives on local authorities, as well as managers. I will press the amendment on the grounds that the Minister of State is not limiting the discretion of local authorities to increase rents upwards significantly from the model rent she suggests. We need harmonisation. It has to be fair, but the Minister of State's provision leaves too much flexibility for injustice and to increase rents.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a minor point of order before I make my substantial comments on the amendment, why are amendments Nos. 11 and 12 grouped with amendments Nos. 13 and 14? They are separate issues, are they not? It does not matter much but I wonder why they are grouped.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They seem to be distinct issues.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am curious about that. I welcome the Minister of State's acknowledgement of the issue that is the subject of my amendment No. 14. Like his amendment probably is, my amendment is a result of lobbying by people active in the area of adult literacy. They were keen that a specific commitment be included in the Bill on the need for a strategy on literacy and numeracy, given it is such an important issue. One in four people in the country - a very high figure - has literacy or numeracy problems of some degree. It is welcome that the Minister of State has included this and well done to the organisations that have pushed and lobbied for this inclusion. I hope this commitment in the legislation will also be backed up with resources and with the implementation of such a strategy. It is an important issue. In passing, I note that the cuts or changes to the pupil-teacher ratio in further education colleges will potentially have an impact on this area and on the ability of the State and the Department of Education and Skills to have a strategy that really works and develops our literacy and numeracy campaign. The organisations that are campaigning on these issues and that advocate on behalf of those who have literacy issues have said a lot more needs to be done than is being done currently. We need outreach strategies and we need to have more hours of tuition for those, given the average is currently two to three hours and these organisations suggest it should be up to six hours. They also suggest more one-to-one tuition is needed for people with literacy and numeracy problems. All of those issues require resources. While it is a welcome step that this is included in the Bill, I hope the Government and the Minister of State can assure us it will be backed up with resources. As we discussed in other contexts, we need some sort of assurance that this area will not be adversely affected by the cuts and changes in the pupil-teacher ratio in the further education colleges, which I and people in that sector fear it may be.
