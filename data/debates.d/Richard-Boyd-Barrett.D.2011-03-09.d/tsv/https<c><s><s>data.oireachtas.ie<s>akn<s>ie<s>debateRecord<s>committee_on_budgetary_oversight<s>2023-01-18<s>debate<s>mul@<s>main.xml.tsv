RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will say one thing on these figures that have been alluded to. We are talking about 3,265 whole time equivalents and that includes extras and that over a two-year period that is 34,000. As we know, extras are not people who are really employees of the industry. They are people who may come in and out so they can be discounted as being part of a permanent creative pool that is supposed to be supported by State aid. I do not know what that figure comes down to if they are taken out, but it comes down considerably. We are down to quite a low figure of people, probably around 2,500, which interestingly enough is not much different from what it was in 2018 when we first started to look into all of this. Let us remember that at the time the representatives of the industry, including representatives of Departments, said there were 17,000 people. We then got to the truth and it was a lot less. First, I ask people to bear that in mind. It is a very low number of people. One of the groups that claims to "represent" the people in the industry, which is a private company that gets money from Screen Ireland, claims it "represents" 2,500 people in the industry. That means it represents everybody in the industry. Who does SIPTU represent? Who does Irish Film and Television Academy, IFTA, represent? Who do the craft unions represent? The numbers do not add up. Everybody is claiming to be representative. I would ask serious questions about all of this. Ms Donaghy said that she would prefer to have a job where she knows she has her desk and some sort of security. Why on earth would one imagine that of anybody, unless they are doing very well? There are a few people in this world who can say that they worked for eight weeks and made so much money that they can take a couple of months off and know that they will then get another job. There are a few people like that but very few and that is not viable for the vast majority of ordinary people. Let us not pretend that is the case for artists and performers, because it is a unique characteristic of the industry that that is a viable reality for the vast majority of them. We had testimony from artists' representative groups that most of them live in poverty. It is ridiculous for people to come in here as they have and say that is a viable employment situation when they have no clue. Even though they may have worked in the industry for 20, 25 or 30 years, they have no clue and no right to expect that they will get another employment from one employment to another. None. We have had clear testimony to that effect from the producer companies who get the money. They have told us that they cannot be the employers and that they have no employment relationship with people. Unless the witnesses know different, they told us that there is not a single worker on film production who has a contract of indefinite duration, not one. We had a fairly high-profile case about RTÉ about the same issue that was brought in here by film crew working on "Fair City" in the news recently. That will be adjudicated and so on but this is a serious issue because it is coming up and up again.  I am referring to people who have worked on an RTÉ production on a series of successive fixed-term contracts but who were told they had no right to a contract of indefinite duration. We have had testimony at this committee from the producers acknowledging what the crew told us, which is that not a single worker has benefitted from the provisions of the fixed-term workers Act even though those same producer companies have to sign a declaration saying that they have to comply with this Act. If one parses what they have said it is clear that what they are saying is that under no circumstances could the fixed-term workers Act ever apply and yet they signed a declaration saying it would. I just do not see-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----how that is tenable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was in the news. It was on RTÉ.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Well look-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry, Ms Nash.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The difficulty I have with all of that is, first, that they often refer to collective agreements. A collective agreement in an industry has to be between an employer and an employee.However, the people who get the relief have told us they do not employ anybody and the designated activity company, DAC, employs people. How can somebody who has no employees sign up to a collective agreement? In the case of the guilds, the people who come before the committee representing them tell us they are freelance, although, interestingly, they seem to be the ones who hire and fire people and decide if people work or do not work and are contractors. A person looking for a job on a project has no protection against somebody stating that person might have worked on the previous project they did but they are not employing that person this time. There is nothing to stop that. We have had testimony at the committee that people are being blacklisted. The individual cases can either be believed or not believed, although they could be checked. It could checked that the people in question have a long record of working in the industry. The testimony they gave to the committee could be checked, as could the fact they have not been back on a film set since they came before the committee in January. That is something that could be verified. Does the Department look at these things, try to verify them and try to establish whether it is true somebody who worked in the industry for 20 or 30 years, or 40 years in the case of a painter who gave testimony previously, has not worked since the body representing him or her came before the committee and said it was questioning employment practices in the industry? The Department could independently verify whether that is true and I do not understand why it does not do that. The Department could also independently establish whether it is true that film producer companies are going to the Labour Court and the Workplace Relations Commission stating they have no employment relationship with the people in question. In many cases, they refuse to turn up because they have no employment relationship, even though they received money from the State to do film productions on which those people were employed. Would it not be something to check who is telling the truth here? I favour such independent verification rather than saying that is what they told us and we believe them. Equity states it is being forced to sign contracts that are grossly inferior to the UK Producers Alliance for Cinema and Television, PACT, Equity agreement. They are being asked to sign away their intellectual property rights, which, as they put it, are the most valuable asset of a performer, writer or actor. If they do not agree to do that, they do not get a job. It is as simple as that. They told us they do not get a job. This is in breach of the directive which states that buyout contracts should be the exception, not the rule. Given the level of State investment in this, if the international companies get to benefit from the royalties accruing to that intellectual property, why does the State, which is financing one third of the film, not benefit? Did the State ever even ask where is its return on its investment? If Netflix or Disney is getting a return, has anybody checked where are our royalties? Has anybody checked, for example, if any of the producer companies have offshore subsidiary companies? Could it be they might? Do we know where those royalties are accruing to? I only want to see a proactive approach to trying to get an independent assessment of some of our worrying concerns, questions and allegations that have been brought in, particularly by Equity and by the Irish Film Workers Association, IFWA, but I also have received testimony in letters, emails etc., to try to establish independently whether they are true. If they are true, it is very worrying.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The ones who come in here representing the guilds are the hirers and firers. That is who is coming in here. Ms Nash knows it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a job.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Missed a trick there.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the points performers, writers and artists made to me in my recent discussions with them, was that in referring to intellectual property in 1988, Deputy Tom Kitt made the point that it is a complicated area, but intellectual property is protected in Bunreacht na hÉireann in the same way that private property is. It is people's property. It belongs to them. There is a problem in requiring people to sign away their rights to that property. The Copyright and Related Rights Act 2000 states the right shall not be waived. The EU directive makes it clear that the EU wants to eliminate that practice and assert it cannot be overridden. Rights to property cannot be overridden. I ask the Department to bear that in mind when the representatives of actors and performers are telling us that if they do not sign those contracts, they do not get a job. Does the Department accept that actors, performers and so on are in a much weaker position than producers? Does the Department recognise that imbalance of power? Someone might be looking for a job and the producer says, "if you want to work on this film, you must sign the contract" which was drawn up by a legal firm and states the person must sign away those things. I ask the Department to seriously look into that and I hope it will recognise that the actor and performer is in a much weaker position in that situation. It is happy days for the people in the powerful position. Of course they are happy with the situation. It is natural they would be. However, the people who might question it are in a vulnerable position. I ask the Department to acknowledge and consider that point. We have been around the houses many times on the employment matter. I will make one more analogy. In the days when there were many dockers in Dublin docks, when a ship came in - think of it like a film project - someone would stand there and say who could have a job unloading that ship. Those people got their pay at the end of the day if they were picked but they had to come back the next day and there was no guarantee they would be picked to unload the next ship that came in. It was project to project. The reason we have a trade union movement is that people such as James Connolly and James Larkin said that was not acceptable. It is not acceptable that workers do not know from one day to another or to when the project comes in, whether they have a job. What protection do film crew have against that situation in the project-to-project industry? I put it to the Department that they have absolutely none. They were asked how it works. The head of a department chooses the crew. He might have chosen someone the last time but has no obligation. They stated before the committee that on creative grounds it is different. Each production is different. There is no protection for the person. Would the witnesses think it was odd, if the person who hired and fired them was also their union representative? Would people not have to join that union if they wanted to get a job in a situation where they had no right to work and depended on the say of the head of the department? That is the current situation. I do not see how that can be tallied with quality employment? If that is the situation people face, does the Department not think it needs to be addressed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How can it be defined as quality employment when the head of department decides each time whether or not a person will be employed and the worker has no right to be re-employed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a brief supplementary point. What Ms Donaghy is really saying is that the people who are funding the film producers have no obligation whatsoever to guarantee their rights. Ms Donaghy is saying people must go out to fight for their rights-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ms Donaghy is saying the Department has no responsibility.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	However, there is no protection against blacklisting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked beforehand about a response in the context of whether I got one. I am sure that is an email issue.
