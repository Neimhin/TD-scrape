RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Following on from some of the Minister's earlier comments and the discussions we had during our previous session in this House, and given the concern about the focus on big industrial wind turbine projects, the Minister stated that we needed to explore alternatives and that the Government was keen to do this. What sort of focus is the Government intending to put on smaller-scale district energy projects and co-operatives in terms of trying to develop our renewable energy mix in a more sustainable way and in a way which is more acceptable to the public and to local communities?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the Minister be more specific about when be believes this will happen? I was looking over the programme for Government, which was written in 2011. It states: "We will double funding for home energy efficiency and renewable energy programmes..." I have tabled a question on the rolling out of the pay-as-you-save retrofitting scheme. Again, the programme states: "We will work to promote a greater appreciation of the co-operative model as a distinct form of organisation...including in areas such as...energy retrofitting, environmental protection..." and so on. The Minister mentioned two or three examples, but that does not seem like a great delivery on those commitments. On the other hand, as we have discussed at length in the House, we have had big industrial wind turbine projects that have faced substantial opposition, some of which are floundering now. There was a commitment in the programme for Government to put a focus on the smaller local renewable energy projects based on co-operatives and so on, but, save for the two or three examples the Minister has cited, there does not seem to be much delivery. It seems to me that we need to move faster and far more extensively on the matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A total of €335 million per year comes from the public service obligation levy, which is supposed to be focused on developing renewable energy. It would be interesting to see a breakdown and to discover exactly where it is going and the extent to which it is going to local projects or smaller-scale community-based projects, co-operatives and so on. I welcome the fact that the Minister has referred to September. At least we have a date. Regardless, I believe the roll-out of these projects is rather slow. Money is available through the strategic investment fund amounting to billions of euro. Sources of funding are available. Many schemes could be self-funding if we put in some of the money up front. They would actually pay for themselves in the medium to long term. Anyway, I do not believe the roll-out, investment or focus on these things has been extensive enough. As part of the energy review I hope the Minister will discuss an option that I have suggested to him, which was suggested to me, in turn, by the Woodland League. This is the issue of 500,000 acres of Coillte lands that are not being used by Coillte but that could be used by local communities and co-operatives to develop these kinds of project.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There was quite an extensive debate about the climate action and low carbon energy Bill in the House this week. The response to that Bill from environmental organisations has been very critical, for two primary reasons. One is that it fails to bring in binding targets and the other relates to concerns about the independence of the advisory council that would advise the Government on developing plans in the area of mitigation, CO2 reductions, adaptation and so on. I just want the Minister's response to this. I believe the Labour Party was pushing for the independence of the advisory committee, but there is great concern that the structure of that committee will not be independent in the way that it should be and that, taken with the lack of binding targets-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The fact that it is under one Department is almost by the by. In this area, more than most, we need joined-up thinking between a number of Departments. Underlying some of the concerns about the failure of the Bill to establish binding targets and concerns about the lack of independence of the advisory body is a belief that there may be a tension between certain interests, possibly within agriculture or industry, and others, who see a significant urgency in meeting CO2 targets and coming up with strategies that can help achieve that. That is what was lacking. The worry is that the lack of independence of this body and the lack of targets indicate a lack of seriousness about meeting these targets, or a lack of detailed sectoral plans, projects, focus and investment in reducing CO2 emissions in a serious way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is concern that the permanent members of this advisory body are all from State agencies - there are no permanent positions for particular environmental interests - but, to cut a long story short, and it has been a theme in many of the questions I have put to the Minister recently, there is also concern that there has been a sort of single focus in terms of producing renewable energy. The focus has been on big, industrialised wind projects. There is another big interest - an important one, do not get me wrong - in the area of agriculture, dairy farming and so on. There is concern that these things dominate the perspective when it comes to dealing with issues, rather than exploring other possibilities, hearing other voices and having other projects and more diversity in developing renewable energy resources and meet CO2 reduction targets. The fear is that the Bill reflects that and that there must be a much greater diversification and focus on alternative energy resources and methods of reducing CO2 emissions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the 10,000 or so women who went through the Magdalen laundries, nothing we can do can undo the trauma and suffering they were put through or can undo the abuse, abandonment, exploitation and cruelty that was visited on them. Many of them are dead and will never see justice, their lives robbed almost entirely from them. The vast majority of those who still survive, most of whom are over 70 and many of whom are over 80, are nearing the end of their lives.We should leave no stone unturned in ensuring that we do anything and everything possible to give them what redress, restitution and acknowledgement and justice we can, even though nothing we can do can fully undo the crimes that have been committed against them. At this late stage, when we have finally acknowledged the great injustice that has been done to them, we must make every effort and put no obstacle in the way of giving them everything they need to try in some small way to compensate for the suffering and cruelty that was inflicted on them. All of us in this House and, most important, the surviving women themselves, their supporters and family members and advocates believed that when the Taoiseach made the speech in which he apologised to the women and they applauded from the Gallery that the State finally was going to do everything it could to make up for its shameful betrayal and abandonment of those women. As soon as the issue dropped from the headlines, however, and other issues began to preoccupy the wider body politic, the media and public interest, at least from the point of view of the women themselves, and I take their judgment as definitive, the Government started to row back on the great promises it made to those women following what was deemed an historic day in this Chamber. That is shameful. It is miserable, mean-spirited, petty and frankly quite extraordinary that the Government would do that. In some of the correspondence from the Department it was claimed that certain things that were promised, arising from the Quirke report, were not promised at all. It said there was no promise to provide a similar card to the HAA card which would give access to a full range of health services, as was given to women infected with hepatitis C by the State. The Justice for Magdalenes group had to point out that it was exactly what the Quirke report said. According to the first recommendation of Mr. Justice Quirke: “As an integral part of the ex gratia Scheme a card entitling its holder to health services equivalent to those provided to the holder of a HAA card should be given to each of the women who were admitted to and worked in a designated Magdalen laundry.” That had to be pointed out because Department officials said that was not exactly what was said, when it is exactly what was said. In a miserable, mean-spirited way the Government is rolling back on the commitments and promises made to those women. I appeal to the Government to stop being miserable, disingenuous and hypocritical, given the noble promises, acknowledgements and apologies that were given by it, and just give the women what was promised to them and what they deserve in terms of some sort of restitution and compensation for the suffering that has been inflicted on them. Another point relates to the provision of advocates and representatives for those who cannot advocate and represent themselves for whatever reason – age, infirmity, disability or other reason - and that the Government would give those supports and services to those women and not try to deny those rights and supports to them in the small print, as it were. We can add to that the issue that was raised yesterday in terms of the motion we debated on the investigation into mother and baby homes. We must accede to the demands of the Justice for Magdalenes group that it would be included in the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes, given that its members are clear and categoric in their view that they do not believe the McAleese report was an adequate or sufficiently comprehensive investigation into the experience of the Magdalen women. I do not really see how, given the statements made by the Taoiseach and other Government representatives in recent times on this matter, the Government can do anything less. It would be easy, and it would be the honourable and fair thing to do, to live up to those promises and give the commitments to the Magdalen women now rather than the miserable, penny-pinching and disingenuous rolling back in which the Government seems to be engaging. I have one final point to make, as all the points have been clearly made by the women’s advocacy groups, the women themselves, other supporting groups and by a number of Deputies. The demands are clear and I hope the Minister will accede to them. It is appropriate that the Minister of State with responsibility for equality is present, because the other important point I wish to make in this House is that when all the apologies were made about the shameful treatment of women and children and some of the most vulnerable sectors of society, their abuse, exploitation and incarceration, and the destruction of childhood involved, one of the points made repeatedly is that we must never ever let this happen again. It is important to say that it is happening, as we speak, to another group of people. I refer to people in the direct provision centres. What they share in common is that, again, it is women and children, this time from immigrant minorities coming into this country, often fleeing persecution, cruelty and abuse in other countries, who are now incarcerated and in many cases have been for years. They have been robbed of their lives. We are again failing to provide equality of treatment and human rights that should be extended to all citizens, especially to women and children. That is after all the apologies and acknowledgements are given. That gives the lie to the pious speeches and noble aspirations that were espoused about the Magdalen laundries in this Chamber being genuine when we still allow the situation to persist for another group of people. The question is whether we will be back here in a few years time saying we did it again to another group of people, and having to discuss compensation, redress, justice and restitution for another group of people. It is utterly disgusting that women and children are being locked up in these centres in the same way, with the same cruelty, as was done to 10,000 women in the Magdalen laundries, as was done to people in the mother and baby homes, the Bethany homes and industrial schools as part of the shocking and shameful architecture of oppression and abuse that dominated this State for most of its history. The time has come to draw a line under that and to give full justice, in so far as we can, to those who have been the victims of this shameful history, and to ensure that those who are currently victims of a similar type of regime are immediately released from their incarceration and abuse.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the face of it, this Bill is straightforward and it should be supported. I thank the Department of Finance officials for briefing myself and Deputy Donnelly the other day. The Bill appears to be uncontroversial. As I understand it, it is a Bill to ensure that the banking inquiry can gain access to all the information it might wish to access in the context of that inquiry from Central Bank officials who might otherwise be prohibited from giving it out. In the normal course of events, if those officials gave out information to people they should not give it to, they could be subject to criminal sanction but if Deputies disclosed that information and breached the secrecy and confidentiality clause, they would not be subject to certain penalties because of the privilege they enjoy. There should be some penalty regime, therefore, or we should be subject to the Standing Orders of this Dáil regarding sanction. I have not seen the details of those Standing Orders but I understand that, for example, a Deputy could be put out of the Dáil for eight days, which is not the most punitive sanction I could imagine. There are times when I wish I was put out for eight days.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That will probably not act as a great inhibitor for disclosing information that might otherwise be protected by a confidentiality clause but, critically, it is legally necessary for the banking inquiry to be able to access all the information it might want to access to get to the bottom of the banking crisis in terms of why it happened, who was at fault, the systems failures and so on. For those reasons, one would support it. The only issues worth discussing in the context of this Bill are those that arise from it, which I find interesting, and that occurred to me in the context of the departmental briefing, that is, why are some categories of information within the Central Bank subject to a confidentiality clause and, in some cases, criminal sanction if that information gets out? That is an interesting question against the background of a banking crisis which was caused by a nexus of relationships involving developers, banks, politicians, the Central Bank and regulators both at a national and a European level. All those people had some involvement in the nexus of relationships, or what some of us might call the golden circle or the elite. They decided what happened and they oversaw the banking and policy regimes that produced this catastrophic economic crisis that has had such devastating consequences for millions of our citizens, who are still paying for the mistakes, and possibly the wrongdoing, that produced that crisis. That begs the interesting question about transparency and why we need confidentiality when it comes to information that can have such devastating consequences for citizens who will never be able to access that information but who are the victims of decisions that were made behind those confidential barriers. One manifestation of all of that is the refusal of representatives of the European Central Bank to come before the banking inquiry. They say they are not allowed to do that and that they are only accountable to certain people. It is because of the European Central Bank that we are subject to certain confidentiality clauses in the first place in terms of information we can access from our own Central Bank.Why is any of this information confidential at all? I appreciate that there might be categories of information held by the Central Bank that should be confidential. For example, I do not see any particular reason the deposits of ordinary deposit holders should be public information that can just be thrown out willy-nilly. I agree that private and personal information on loans that are given to ordinary bank customers of banks for house extensions, cars or holidays should be subject to confidentiality. The customers of the banks should expect such confidentiality. However, the banking inquiry will be looking at some very different categories of loans, including the reckless commercial loans that were given to a relatively small number of big developers. The activities of such people, who were driven by the profit motive, commercial interests and the desire to accumulate personal wealth, bankrupted the country and cost us so dearly. I suggest not only that the banking inquiry should have access to such information, but also that everybody should be able to access it. I would like to know a little bit more in this regard. I do not know the extent to which the Minister of State can illuminate these areas for us. What categories of information will be covered by this measure? When I was discussing with the departmental officials the sorts of categories with which there might be problems, they gave a good example. It might be interesting to know the top ten, top 50 or top 100 big commercial property exposures of the big banks that wrecked the economy and went bad. Frankly, I think we are entitled to know that information. I am not sure whether we are being given such an entitlement, however. Could people be subject to a penalty if they disclose this sort of information in the Dáil? I would like to know about the hundreds of millions in loans that were given out to a golden circle. It is clear that normal prudential lending practices, such as proper risk assessment, were not adhered to. On what basis were these loans given out? Who was giving them out? Did people give loans to massive developers over and over again on a nod and a wink basis because they were mates, were part of the same golf clubs or had the same political connections? The public is entitled to ask for such information. I wonder about the confidentiality and secrecy rules that might prevent information we have every right to know from getting into the public domain.
