RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to seek some direction from the Chair.  There are issues which run across the different programmes and I would like to comment on these.  May I do so now or should I wait until later?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would have the same concerns about the consultancy issue under subhead A but I note from the interesting pie charts that there is a pattern with regard to consultants across all of them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister said that there is insufficient in-house expertise in particular areas because of policy issues or priorities that arise and that there is a need to obtain external expertise.  From these pie charts it seems that the proportion is very significant.  Under the subhead with which we are dealing, the figure is 19%; under subhead B the figure is an incredible 59% for consultancy and other services; under subhead C the figure is 13%; under subhead D the figure is 25%; and under subhead E the figure is smaller at 4%.  Those figures are very significant.  Given the discussion that has positively taken place on the value-for-money issue in terms of consultants with respect to Irish Water, surely we have to ask the same questions here because we are talking about significant amounts of money.  Under one of the subheads, the figure is €6 million.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In instancing those figures, they involve a good deal of money.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think he probably will.  Will he?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of course, I want to hear the Minister's answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Whether the amount involved is hundreds of thousands or millions or euro, that is significant.  The obvious question that begs an answer is whether it would be cheaper to employ people with that expertise directly.  When we are talking of figures of hundreds of thousands  of euro or, in one case, millions of euro, it must be asked if it would not be cheaper to employ somebody full-time in those instances.  When the Minister seeks such expert advice, we do not know what lies behind the subheading.  Who are these consultants and how much are they getting paid?  The figures seem to indicate they get paid a great deal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to ask the Minister about subhead B4, consultancy and other services.  The outturn for 2013 was €3.5 million, yet the Estimate allowed for this year is €6.5 million.  That seems like a huge amount of money for consultancy and seems even larger and more significant against a background in which the Minister required only half of that in the previous year.  I accept that the Minister allowed for approximately €6.5 million last year and did not spend it, but he is allowing for €6.5 million this year for consultants.  Could he explain that?  Who, precisely, are the consultants?  What are they doing for us and why do we need them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I hear the Minister's explanation and I look at this sub-head I am not happy with his explanation.  It is not satisfactory and it does not satisfactorily explain the allocation of €6.5 million for consultants.  To put it in context, if he were to employ full-time economists at €100,000 a year he could get 65 of them.  He would not need 65; the expertise of many of them would cross over a number of these sub-heads.  When the Minister used the analogy that he would not employ a full-time painter to paint his house he was right but we are not talking about a house.  We are talking about an economy and given the amount of money he finds he now has to allocate for outside expertise to be brought in, the cost of that is so high it is self-evident from the amounts involved that the Minister needs full-time economists employed in the Department, which would be better value for money than what is before us.  I do not see how the Minister could argue anything else.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In respect of the programmes to which the Chairman has referred, head E is not so bad but there is very significant expenditure under heads C and D on what would appear to be consultant economists, that is, economic experts.  While I made this point under a previous head, it repeats itself again here and in his response, the Minister did not really address it.  I accept these are important areas and in this case it pertains to corporate tax and agricultural taxes, while the previous examples pertained to small and medium-size enterprises, banking and so on.  Under head D, provision is made for the medium-term economic strategy and the common element here is that economic expertise is being bought in at a significant cost.  The question the Minister has not answered is, how would it not be cheaper - from his perspective and that of the public - to employ a few economists?  I do not see the logic in this regard, because big money is being forked out, including €350,000 with regard the medium-term economic strategy.  One would employ an economist to oversee it for a lot less than that.  Surely activities such as looking into corporate tax or agricultural taxes are not once-off events?  A number of these heads pertain to important areas of policy that should be kept under constant review and should be constantly researched, analysed and looked at.  Would it not be cheaper and better value to employ directly a few people who are expert in these areas to advise the Government, rather than incurring large expenditure on consultants?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am dealing with this head.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not got an answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On that issue, we will agree to disagree.  I strongly disagree with the Minister.  I merely wanted to say that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am merely stating for the record I disagree with the Minister.  I do not accept his explanation.  On the corporate tax advice the Minister is seeking, from whom is he seeking it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Minister identified some of it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is why we should employ somebody.
