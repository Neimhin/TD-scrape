RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for their contributions to the committee.  It was reported recently that in 2012 Google had revenues of €15.5 billion from its Irish operation, but it paid only €17 million in tax.  That is an infinitesimal amount of tax.  The reason it succeeded in paying so little tax is that it charged €11 billion of the €15 billion in administrative expenses to another one of its subsidiaries that was not tax liable here.  That is quite extraordinary.  It tallies with something somebody whom one might call a whistleblower who previously worked for one of these companies told me, that the amount these companies charged to administrative expenses, royalties, patents or whatever happened to be close to what they made in profits.  It was blatant abuse of transfer pricing.  The point is that it appears to be self evident that Ireland is facilitating this practice to a far greater degree than anywhere else, which is why there is such an uproar about Ireland's position.  One can compare the effective tax rate that the example I mentioned would give, which is approximately 2%, with the rates of other countries in Europe.  In the UK the rate is 18.5% - these are not nominal rates, but effective rates - in Germany it is 20% and in France it is 35%.  Some of these figures are disputed, but they are all considerably higher than the effective rate that the example I have given implies.  Is it not self evident and obvious that whatever way we are applying the rules or directives on transfer pricing we are facilitating this tax avoidance to a far greater extent?  In fact, it is not just tax avoidance but tax evasion.  If one is abusing transfer pricing to this extent, it is tax evasion.  We are facilitating that to a far greater extent than any other European state.  Is that not the self evident conclusion one would draw from such examples?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not mean to cut across the witness but I must stop him there.  That is not the point I am making.  We can debate that and there is much dispute about it.  We have many figures about what the effective rate might or might not be.In the example that is in the public domain - I shall not mention the company again - the effective rate implied, and from the company's records, is about 2%. Whatever about the wider question of Ireland's effective rate, somehow the company is managing a 2% tax rate because it charges a huge amount of its revenues to administrative expenses in another subsidiary that is not tax liable here. One can argue that is acceptable and legitimate, within the law or whatever but it is 2% and not anything else. That same situation does not seem to happen elsewhere in Europe. Why does it happen here more than anywhere else? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask Mr. Kermode to comment on the same thing.  There is an investigation happening into the situation and particular transactions in Ireland, and also in Luxembourg and Holland.  Does the investigation centre around the question of how that happened and whether the tax ruling that allows for it to happen is legitimate or predatory tax competition?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept all that.  I accept that we are dealing with a new economy, particularly in digital.  There is also the issue of intellectual property rights, big global companies and where exactly value is being generated.  These are, I accept, complex questions.  Ireland, the Netherlands and Luxembourg - although I know less about the latter two - still seem to be complete outliers in terms of dealing with this phenomena.  It is a global, new and complex phenomena but we still seem to be complete outliers.  Nobody has accused the French of having a 2% rate.  There have been debates questioning its effective rate but nobody has accused France of having a 2% rate.  Nobody has accused Germany of having a 2% rate.  There seems to be a specific problem here and in the Netherlands and possibly in Luxembourg.  For a long time Luxembourg has had a reputation as a place where one could avoid tax.  Now Ireland has entered that category.  Is that self-evident?  Why have accusations been levelled against Ireland and not against Germany, France or Italy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have made my point.  It seems obvious to me that all of those things are true but it still seems to be heavily concentrated in Ireland and other places.  Fair tax competition was mentioned as against unfair tax competition but I find it difficult to accept the distinction between the two.  Let me spell it out.  Competition in the area of tax is not competition on making things that are useful.  It is not useful competition in real economic activity and it is not competition in producing real wealth or value but it is competition in poaching profits or investment.  I do not see how one can talk about a fair regime in what is a predatory practice by definition.  Surely once there is competition in this area inevitably people will try to get around the rules, bend them which is followed by a race to the bottom in terms of the contribution that corporations are likely to pay.  Historically, the pattern has spanned the period from the 1970s to now.  Is it not self-evident that the tax contribution by corporations and companies has fallen steadily since the 1970s leading to the sort of incredible situations that we have now with huge profits being avoided or evaded?  Is that not the result of bringing competition to bear in the area of taxation?  Is it not futile to regulate tax competition rather than stamp it out?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I ask a one-line question of Mr. Lynch concerning his presentation?  He expressed a little scepticism about whether anything coming out of the BEPS process might be applicable in reality.  Did I pick that up correctly?
