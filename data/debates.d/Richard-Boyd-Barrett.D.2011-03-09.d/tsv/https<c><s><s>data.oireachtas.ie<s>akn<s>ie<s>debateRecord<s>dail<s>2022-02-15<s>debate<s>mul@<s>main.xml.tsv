RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the Taoiseach honestly say to workers, pensioners and people on low and average incomes, with a straight face, that the paltry set of measures he announced last Thursday to deal with the catastrophic rise in the cost of living is adequate? Can he seriously suggest that is the case? Average heating and energy costs are due to go up by about €800 a year. The Government is giving people back €200 a year and a little bit extra on the fuel allowance. Who is supposed to pay the rest for workers whose wages are increasing at maybe 1%, for public sector workers, or for pensioners and social welfare recipients who got an extra fiver in the budget? Who is supposed to pay the rest? What about rents? There is absolutely nothing on that in the measures. Rents are up 10% year-on-year according to daft.ie. Average rents in Dublin for a one-bedroom property are now €1,500, with the average for a two-bedroom property at €2,000. People would need between €17,000 and €24,000 in income just to pay the rent. There is nothing to deal with the unaffordable situation in rents. Then we have the wider cost of living, including food etc which is up by at least 5.7% and probably more. Where are workers supposed to make up the difference? Can the Taoiseach honestly say it is enough? It is an absolute insult. Yesterday, in an interview, the Taoiseach ruled out another possibility. We proposed last week that there be rent controls, caps on energy prices and the bringing up of wages. He is not willing to do any of those things to control the spiralling cost of living. He said yesterday that we cannot get rid of the universal social charge, USC, because it would be too expensive to do so. Of course, that is not what Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil were saying before the election in 2016, when the now Minister, Deputy Michael McGrath, said, as part of pre-election promises, the USC would be gone for everybody earning less than €80,000 within five years.Paudie Coffey, who was Minister of State at the time, said in a press release and a Fine Gael manifesto that his party would get rid of the USC altogether. All of that is gone now; too expensive, apparently. As a result, we cannot give workers a break by getting rid of the USC. My question to the Taoiseach is if he honestly believes this is adequate? How are people supposed to pay their unaffordable rents or come up with the hundreds of euros extra in heating and energy costs if the Government rules out all of these things? Why is it that it is always alright for the workers to pay? They can afford it, but the Taoiseach says that we cannot afford to give them a break on the USC, that we cannot afford rent controls or that we cannot afford the energy price hikes, even though landlords-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	----energy companies and corporations are making an absolute fortune at the same time that workers are being hammered as a result of the cost of living.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tax the corporations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It certainly will not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It seems that the bank of the last resort is always the workers’ pocket. That is the truth. What the Taoiseach is really saying is that the workers can take it in the neck. The elephant in the room in the context of his argument is the incredible increase in the wealth and profits of the richest in our society----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	----while workers are having their pockets looted as a result of increased energy prices and rents that are utterly stratospheric and totally unaffordable. The Taoiseach did not answer my question about how workers are supposed to pay for these things.He also did not mention the fact that profits in the last decade have gone up by 172%. He did not mention that we now have nine billionaires in this country, according to an Oxfam report, who have €42 billion between them. That sum has increased dramatically during the pandemic. That is the elephant in the room that the Government never wants to talk about. Some people are doing very well from price inflation, including the profiteering energy companies and the landlords whose income from rents has gone through the roof. The Government never talks about them. It is okay for the workers to take it in the neck. It is okay for their pockets to be rifled to pay unaffordable bills, unaffordable rents and unaffordable food prices. They can manage it. It is always possible to loot their pockets but it is never possible to put a bit of extra tax on those who can well afford it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the reality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are for getting rid of the USC.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who pays the other €600?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is working so well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not working very well at the moment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just get them to pay their taxes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not see how that recruits nurses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I note the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is sitting beside the Taoiseach. The Killian Woods report from last weekend on the shared equity affordable housing scheme would seem to suggest that the Government's affordable housing plan is looking increasingly like it is going to be completely defunct. I do not agree with that scheme because I think it is chasing already unaffordable house prices. It now appears that the house prices for all the new builds that are coming, particularly in Dublin, for the most part are going to be way in excess of the caps for the scheme. In other words, they are going to be next to useless. What does the Minister have to say?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At a time when workers are rightly calling for pay increases to deal with the issue of inflation, I want to draw the Taoiseach's attention to the fact that Aer Lingus, a company that got a hell of a lot of public money during Covid-19, is forcing its ground operation workers to vote on a pay freeze until 2025 and, in some cases, take a 10% permanent pay cut on their restored duty allowances. This is a deal that 84% of the workers rejected before Christmas. The company is making them vote again and said it will outsource 100% of the operations if the workers do not accept this. That is outrageous. Aer Lingus is a company that went into Covid-19 with cash reserves of €900 million. Its cargo operations saw a significant increase in profitability even during the pandemic. Now, it is trying to impose pay cuts and tear up contracts and agreements with workers and drive their pay down. Does the Taoiseach think it is acceptable that a company which got so much public money during Covid-19 should be doing this to its ground operations workforce?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think we are all glad to see some signs of de-escalation over the Ukraine, with Russia withdrawing some troops from the Ukrainian border. Our Government and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Coveney, are very quick to be critical of a possible attack by the Russians on Ukraine, or the massing of troops on the Ukrainian border, both of which are totally unacceptable. Yet there is not a single word of criticism of NATO and of the United States for its role in cranking up and in escalating this situation, particularly through its eastward expansion of NATO. It was promised after the Cold War that this would not happen. Indeed, they never criticise the United States for its other support for authoritarian or brutal regimes. Yes, if the Government wants to criticise Putin for sideling up to Ukraine, that is good. However, will it criticise the United States for arming Saudi Arabia to the teeth, so that it can bomb the hell out of Yemen? There is no criticism. The Government criticises the Russians for planning to do military exercises in our exclusive economic zone. Will it now say it is unacceptable for the Americans or the British to do the same thing in our exclusive economic zone? Indeed, would it go even further and say United States military is not welcome in Shannon Airport when it is en route to conduct military operations elsewhere in the world?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is self-evident.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Call it out for Saudi Arabia and Yemen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach has nothing to say about Saudi Arabia then.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On economic recovery, the Taoiseach is often fond of saying, rightly, that we should support people who are working. I have asked the Taoiseach repeatedly about the plight of people who are working but who are punished because their income goes over the social income threshold. I have mentioned multiple cases to the Taoiseach over recent weeks. I had another case this week of a young man who works in retail and who worked all during the pandemic in a supermarket. His partner is also working. Due to working overtime during the pandemic, his income has gone over the threshold and he has been taken off the housing list. I asked the Taoiseach last week - he did not answer this - to tell us when the review of the income thresholds will happen so that this stops happening. The review has been promised for five years now. If the Taoiseach wants to support people in work, will he raise that threshold? When will this review be completed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The review.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The longest consideration ever.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The utterly hopeless and disastrous situation in which many working people find themselves when it comes to trying to do the basic thing of putting a roof over their heads was summed up this week for me by a young man who came into my clinic. He works in retail and he is a low-paid worker. He works in retail and he worked all during the pandemic. His partner is also in low-pay, part-time employment. Both of them are working. They are both trying to get on in life. They came into my clinic to tell me that both of them were being removed from the housing list, because they have gone over the income threshold. Their combined income now goes very slightly over €35,000 net. They are now off the housing list, having been waiting on it for 11 years. I want the Minister for Finance to think about this. First, had the State discharged its obligation to them, as well as to the 5,000 other families in our area and we can also mention the approximately 100,000 across the country, they would now be in a council house. Regardless of what happened to their income, their rent would increase related to their income. They would not be thrown out of the council house because their income increased. Ironically, however, because they do not have a home, and because the State failed in its duty for 11 years to provide them with the home to which they were entitled, now that their income has risen, they have been flung off the list. Does the Minister get the injustice of that? In addition, I received another text this week about a case that I have raised three times in this House, of a young woman who has also been thrown off the list. She is working for CPL and is placed in the Government agency Tusla, where she works with very vulnerable children. She worked all the way during the pandemic. She is in homeless accommodation with her daughter but has been thrown off the housing list. By the way, when one is thrown off the housing list, one does not get the housing assistance payment, HAP, any more. In my area, when that happens, one is told to go out and find private rented accommodation. The average rents that are being charged in my area are now €2,200. The Minister can go on daft.ie and look for an apartment in my area. It will be €2,200. Even if they were entitled to HAP, which now they are not, the maximum HAP rate is €1,950, if one is homeless. However, they do not even get that now because their income, apparently, is too high. That is the cost at which the Minister’s friends, the build-to-rent property investors, are delivering housing in my area. By the way, there is a lot of building going on in Dún Laoghaire at the moment. Are the prices going down? No, they are going up.  The entire response of the Minister is based on a fantasy. I remember Michael Noonan always used to accuse us on the left of fantasy economics. Yet, who is peddling the fantasy? Seriously? When the private sector was delivering 70,000 to 90,000 houses a year in this country, treble the figure of what it is delivering now, did rents go down? No, they went up. Did property prices go down? No, they went up. These strategic housing developments, SHDs, are unfolding all over the city. They are built for profit, not built for need. They are not built for that couple who came into my clinic. They are built to make money for property investors who are charging €2,200 per month. Alternatively, if one wanted to purchase a house in my area, which is obviously a hopeless aspiration for a couple earning just over €35,000, the average house price being delivered by the Minister’s friends in the private sector is €560,000. Maybe the Government's affordable housing scheme could help them, but it is capped at €450,000. When that was initially brought in, I thought it was a joke that €450,000 was considered an affordable home. A loan for 80% of that, which is what the shared equity scheme involves, would be €360,000. To get a loan from a bank for that amount, people would need to be earning between €100,000 and €120,000. Clearly, the couple who came into my home, or the vast majority of ordinary workers, would not have a chance. Now, however, it has gotten even worse because there are no houses for €450,000, which was already unaffordable. Killian Woods and the Business Post did a report on how this scheme might apply in Dublin. Of the 50 developments they surveyed, only four had any homes that were on sale at below €450,000. In my area, there were zero. What is the Government going to do about that fact? These people are building for profit. I missed the debate on "Claire Byrne Live" last night but I am glad we are finally debating socialism, even if it involves a load of people attacking socialists. At least we are debating it. Does the Minister of State know what socialism means? Socialism means housing for need. Capitalism means housing for greed. Housing for greed delivers rents of €2,000 or €2,200 and affordable property prices of €450,000 but in actuality, properties of €560,000. That is what housing for greed does. That is what capitalism does. Yet, the Government peddles the fantasy that eventually the rents and prices are going to fall. They are not going to fall. That is a total fantasy. What do we need to do? The Government says we could not possibly do anything without these investment funds. I am scratching my head thinking about this because we managed to build houses in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s without investment funds, cuckoo funds and vulture funds. How did we manage it then? We did it, but the Government is telling us we cannot possibly do it now without those funds, and that we cannot introduce rent controls because to do so would terrify them. They will all run away if we introduce real rent controls to make rent affordable. Strangely enough, that has just been done in France. A transition year student who was doing her placement in my office this week found that out for me. Maybe the Government should look into that. They have introduced rent controls and set maximum levels on a district-by-district basis, so people can only charge a certain amount for a property of a certain size. Why can we not do that? The property investors have not all run away from France. The Government's arguments are threadbare and its policy is failing disastrously.
