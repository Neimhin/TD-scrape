RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a local issue to Dún Laoghaire but it is very important. The playground on Library Road, formerly Johnny Carr's Park, has been a supervised playground since the Dominican nuns supervised it. Generations of local people from Dún Laoghaire have effectively been brought up in this playground. For the past ten years, Crosscare has employed two part-time supervisors of that playground, Pauline and Jill, but that supervision is being removed. Will the Minister's Department entertain discussions with stakeholders, including the council, Crosscare and Barnardos, to try to maintain the supervision of this playground?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The funding has been provided by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. Disgracefully, the executive has made a decision to pull the funding because Crosscare has pulled out, which I believe is a retrograde decision. The cost of it is buttons, at approximately €40,000 a year for two part-time staff who are members of the local community, but the value they give to the community is extraordinary. Children from the youngest up to the ages of 13 and 14 are supervised in the playground. Many of them are children with special needs. The playground is in an area where there is a DEIS school, so it is a pocket of disadvantage in Dún Laoghaire. If it is lost, many of these children will not go to other playgrounds. In areas of disadvantage, this is a very cheap example, in terms of the cost to the public, of providing early intervention and monitoring of vulnerable young people in many cases.I am appealing to the Minister to play some role in maintaining what is a vital community facility.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that and I will look into it. It is maybe an area of hope. I wish the council executive in Dún Laoghaire showed as much energy and interest in maintaining this playground as the Minister has demonstrated in the past five minutes. I appreciate the thought. I thank Deputy Calleary for passing me a note. I appeal to Fianna Fáil on this matter as well. Fianna Fáil is now in control of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. Disappointingly, both of the party's prospective general election candidates, having initially said they supported the supervision at the playground, have now done a U-turn. I believe this was done under pressure from the executive of the council, which does not want to keep the supervision. I call on Deputy Calleary to appeal to his party members who will suffer a political price in Dún Laoghaire if they do not secure supervision of this playground. I appreciate the Minister's response and I will look into the matter. I accept that it is a matter for local government as well but there should be joined-up thinking on these issues. When something is good and working, serves a community and helps to glue a community together for generations, why on earth would we let it go?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do not say that to the archbishop.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not exaggerating when I say that the Government is betraying dementia sufferers and their families, both present and future, as a result of its failure to honour its promises to keep the doors of St. Joseph's dementia care facility in Shankill open. The Minister told me and others that the doors to St. Joseph's would not close. However, they have been closed-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----in the context of future admissions. This is a personal matter for me and many others in the area. Some of my loved ones ended their days in St. Joseph's and a personal friend of mine is there now. I and others have people close to us who will be looking to go there in the near future. They will not be able to do so because this Government is refusing to acknowledge the high-dependency special care requirements of many dementia patients. The Taoiseach promised that a review of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and its dealings with this precise matter would be completed in 2017, but it never appeared. The Government is not acknowledging the high-dependency care needs of dementia sufferers. It is nonsense to say that the Government has nothing to do with the NTPF, because this is public money, allocated by the Government, and it has every right - indeed obligation - to tell the NTPF to treat dementia sufferers and their families with respect.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I heard it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am talking about future residents.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about future residential care?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need more.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be sharing time with Deputies Paul Murphy and Coppinger. I have just come from the protest to which Deputy O'Sullivan referred. My apologies for being late. It was organised by the people who voluntarily have been out on the streets helping the homeless night in, night out in recent years because they are so appalled by the escalating housing and homelessness crisis. They have presented proposals to which I hope the Government will listen. The scandalous housing and homelessness crisis results from one central factor in Government policy, namely, that it has facilitated the greed of vulture funds, landlords, property speculators and property hoarders. That is at the core of this crisis. The Government claims that the Opposition criticises but does not have alternatives. It is a dishonest claim and we wish to set the record straight. It is worth noting that before any motions of no confidence were tabled, People Before Profit and Solidarity, on behalf of the protestors, called for this debate on housing solutions. We have presented our solutions many times. I will reiterate them for the Minister of State. The councils need to provide 20,000 public and affordable housing units on public land each year for the next five years. The Government must immediately stop the sale of public land through public private partnerships, the Land Development Agency or any other privatisation mechanism where such land should be used for public and affordable housing. The National Asset Management Agency's, NAMA's, remaining land assets and cash should be deployed to the provision of affordable housing, which should be genuinely affordable for those on average incomes. In addition, we should give more resources to co-operatives and approved housing bodies as well as increasing the Part V requirement for private developments to at least 20%, which should be taken upfront in land to be built on by the State rather than waiting for developers to decide when they will build. There should be an immediate rent freeze and an end to evictions on the grounds of sale, which is the main reason people are going into homelessness. There should be genuine rent controls, as is the case in the rest of Europe, to pin rents to affordable levels. There should be punitive and escalating vacant site and property taxes to prevent speculation and hoarding by property developers and to bring empty properties back into use. Local authorities should have and use aggressive compulsory purchase powers to take over land and property that is lying vacant. There should be a constitutional right to housing for all.A minimum of an extra €2 billion a year should be put into the provision of social and affordable housing. That money should be raised by a levy on the profits of landholders and speculators, closing down the loopholes the Minister has given those speculators, using NAMA's cash and using the money in the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund. If this council housing was built, it would generate income for the State rather than the State paying out €700 million on RAS, HAP and other leasing arrangement payments. In addition, as an essential measure the Minister should raise the income thresholds for social housing to the income levels of ordinary working people who are currently being lopped off the list. That will give the social mix required. Real supports should be given to people who are in homeless accommodation, particularly children so they will not suffer the child abuse and neglect they are currently suffering.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Very few.
