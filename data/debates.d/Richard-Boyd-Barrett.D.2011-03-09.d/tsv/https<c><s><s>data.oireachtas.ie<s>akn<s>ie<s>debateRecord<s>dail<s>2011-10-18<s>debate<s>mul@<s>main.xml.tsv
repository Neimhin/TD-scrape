RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the deteriorating situation in the eurozone, did any of the leaders of the eastern European states and other EU member states have any questions for the Taoiseach on the policy of continued austerity and bailing out banks, the detrimental effect this was having on growth in the European economy and how it might affect them?  Did the Taoiseach have any discussions with the leaders of the eastern European states about the impact of the sale of State assets?  These countries would be very familiar with the process of rapid disposal of state assets.  The Taoiseach may be aware that this is something which led to the massive enrichment of a tiny minority of oligarchs in eastern Europe who gained control of these assets but which has led to major job losses for working people in these eastern European states.   Did their leaders have anything useful to say about the experience of the wholesale privatisation of state assets and the effect this had had on society and the economies of these states?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In discussing Ireland's economic and financial situation, the Taoiseach made much of Ireland's improved reputation but that was not really the question I asked.  One cannot eat reputation and it does not provide jobs or services.  I asked whether various leaders at the conference recognised that there is a major problem in terms of the impact of austerity strangling economic growth in the eurozone.  That will have an impact on human beings who hope to get jobs and hope that they will not lose their homes.  They also hope for some way out of the current economic crisis.Although the Taoiseach did not respond, I further asked whether he learned anything useful about the rapid process of the disposal of State assets and the sale of natural resources in eastern European states.  As I understand it, the result of that process was the creation of a tiny coterie of multi-billionaire oligarchs who now preside over those formerly State-owned assets.  Meanwhile, the people who worked for those State enterprises now face high levels of unemployment and social misery as a result of the privatisation process in those states.  Did the Taoiseach learn anything useful that might be beneficial to us, given the demands of the Troika to sell State assets here in a similar way?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We did it with Denis O'Brien and Eircom, did we not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was done before.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Taoiseach not going to tell our European partners that their strategy for dealing with the financial and economic crisis is in absolute tatters and that it is a disaster which is strangling economic growth as well as causing great suffering for people throughout Europe?  Even on its own terms it is strangling economic growth and threatens to tip the European economy into recession.  No matter how much they inflict the poison of austerity the situation gets worse, becomes deeper and spreads the contagion.  Will the Taoiseach not tell them this?  Will he not pose serious questions about what a disastrous failure the policy of bailing out the banks and imposing austerity has been for Greece and threatens to be for the rest of Europe?  This has happened in a situation where Greek bondholders will be burnt to the tune of 50% now and, despite not imposing all the austerity demanded by the troika, the Greeks still got their â‚¬8 billion.  Will the Taoiseach not question President Van Rompuy and the European authorities about their insistence that there should be no burning of Irish bondholders and that we should benefit in no way from the plans to burn bondholders in Greece?  As a consequence, the Taoiseach's strategy of being the best boy in the class in Europe has failed disastrously.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should have done what the Greeks did and resisted austerity because that way we might have got to burn the bondholders and we might have got the money without inflicting the brutal austerity the Taoiseach has been so enthusiastic to inflict.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The facts are coming in.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our debt is larger in proportionate terms.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They get to burn the bondholders; we do not.  They stood up for themselves.
