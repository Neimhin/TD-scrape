RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There seems to be general agreement that we need more expenditure on housing, including affordable housing and public housing, and infrastructure. While I agree with that - I do not see how anyone could disagree - I do not understand, based on the submissions made by ISME and the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, where we will get the money for this expenditure. The witnesses argue for reductions in taxes to incentivise small and medium enterprises. If we provide further research and development tax credits to SMEs, open up the knowledge development box to SMEs and reduce VAT and capital gains tax, as the witnesses propose, where will we get the money for all the infrastructure and housing we need? Something does not add up. My answer to all of this is straightforward. In my view, tax expenditures are not the best way to help the domestic economy. I ask the witnesses to comment on that. We are losing large amounts of money through tax reliefs. Surely we are foregoing far too much revenue through tax reliefs. Even the European Commission has made that point. The major beneficiaries of tax reliefs are the big multinational corporations. Property speculators are also doing very well and making enormous profits. Why would we give away more in tax reliefs when common sense suggests we should reduce them? I was also slightly confused by the statement in the ISME submission that a "collective amnesia of how the fiscal and property crashes of 2008 occurred in Ireland has infected the trade unions, the public services, and a plurality of Oireachtas members." While I fully agree that there is amnesia about the fiscal and property crash, I do not see how it is largely manifested in the trade unions or public service. I am not sure what the expression, "a plurality of Oireachtas members" means. The amnesia appears to be largely in the Government and relates to what happens when property speculators are allowed to control the housing market and given tax incentives to do it all over again. They are evidently engaging in rampant speculation and profiteering, while delivering little affordable housing. I ask the witnesses from ISME to comment. What are the witnesses' views on labour shortages? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to ask all the witnesses what they think. It seems we have a problem or we could be reaching the point at which we have a serious problem with labour shortages in a number of key areas. I would like to hear what the witnesses think about this. I would have thought that one thing we absolutely must support - they probably agree with this - is the provision of affordable housing. Many of our young people will leave or are already leaving. I will make one last point on the social housing side of things. Do the witnesses agree that expenditure on the housing assistance payment, HAP, rent allowance payments and so on rather than the direct provision of public housing is very badly misplaced? Although the Government talks a great deal about-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses from TASC and Social Justice Ireland for their contributions and their good work. I agree completely on the revenue-raising exercises they are talking about. It might be worth elaborating on the logic of how they came to their proposals. It is not talked about much by the Government or the main Opposition party or even some of the think tanks. They talk about prudence, sticking to the rules and not overheating the economy. What is completely left out of the debate most of the time is the need for and viability of increasing the fiscal space through raising extra taxes on sectors that could actually afford it. That could involve the tax reliefs and expenditures currently going to big business and the very wealthy or the fact that higher incomes could be taxed more without taxing those people out of existence. It is great that the witnesses raised those points. Do they not think that we could be a bit more ambitious in that regard? We need a lot of money to go into public housing. Dr. Healy is right to say that. The list is 144,000 if we include people on housing assistance payment, HAP, and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, transfer lists. If we do not have a housing programme that aims to get close to building that amount of housing, we are not going to solve the problem. Should we not be more ambitious in our revenue-raising efforts? Why stick at 6% for the minimum effective corporate tax rate? Our current rate of 12.5% is low by international standards and, as we all know, nowhere near what is actually paid. It is currently more like 2% or 4%, so why only go to 6%? Why not set a minimum effective rate at 12.5%? Fianna Fáil will definitely scoff at that. On the higher incomes, we should have one band over €120,000 according to TASC's proposal. Why not more? I honestly ask if anybody really needs an income of €200,000 to €500,000. To my mind, we should have a much more steeply progressive tax system. There was a time, going back to the 1950s and 1960s, when very high incomes had punitive tax. I think a Labour politician once said he would tax them until the pips squeak. Why not be more ambitious in that regard? Have the witnesses any comment on financial transaction taxes? It is a big area in which I think we could raise extra revenue.  On housing, there is quite a bit of debate on what the hold-up is at the moment. I would say it is that on public land, the Government is in insisting on a mixture of social and affordable housing yet it refuses to define affordable housing, which means no schemes can get going because nobody knows the official position on affordability. That thinking is based on the idea that we have got to have mixed tenures but now it is becoming a reason for nothing happening. I believe there is a stigma attached to building public, social housing. That has been the excuse for the various public private partnerships, PPPs, selling off bits of public land, mixed tenure and all that.
