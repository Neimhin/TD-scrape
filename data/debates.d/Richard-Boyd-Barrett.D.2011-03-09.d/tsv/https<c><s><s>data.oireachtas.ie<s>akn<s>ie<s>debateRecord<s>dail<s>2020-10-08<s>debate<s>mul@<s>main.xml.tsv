RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On "Claire Byrne Live", in justifying the Government's decision to dismiss the public health advice and trash the rationale of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, in calling for further restrictions, the Tánaiste cited his concern for workers and people who either have lost their jobs or might lose their jobs as a result of restrictions. Aside from the irony that the Government is cutting the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, lifting the eviction ban and facilitating the removal of the mortgage repayments moratorium, a group of workers, who have felt an impact, is outside the Leinster House gates now. I refer to the 22,000 taxi drivers and their families for whom, despite promises from numerous Ministers, the Taoiseach and so on that they would meet taxi drivers again and listen to their requests for assistance, nothing has been forthcoming. Their PUP is being cut, although there is no work out there for them and the grants they need to cover costs and sustain themselves have not been provided. Will the Tánaiste listen to and act on the requests of the taxi drivers, who are currently in a dire state?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We wrote to the Business Committee on Tuesday asking for a proper debate on Covid strategy. There has been much discussion and kerfuffle about the spat between the Tánaiste and the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET. Certainly, questions have to be asked and answered about all of that but there is a much more important issue, which is, how are we going to respond to what is an escalating crisis with Covid infections rising? We need a very serious discussion about strategy. We need to hear the options laid out. We need to hear what data are available and how we can make a mature decision where political game-playing is left aside. We have set out our stall. We believe the public health advice should be followed because the situation is dire. Others disagree, but there has not been a proper debate. To have a debate on the graveyard shift tonight and not have the promised discussion tomorrow is wrong. There simply is not enough time tonight to consider, question and discuss the very serious situation we have facing us and the need for a mature, serious and urgent response that the public can buy into. I have a different view from Deputy Naughten about what we need to do but I absolutely agree we need a serious, rounded, full and extensive debate, and that should include sitting tomorrow.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We would like to hear from the Government whether it will honour the commitment made by the Taoiseach that he would participate in a discussion on Friday?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a serious discussion. Things have changed; everyone knows that. It is not just questions that need to be put to the Minister of Health, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, late at night. We need to hear from the Head of Government what will be the strategy from here and what are the impacts of taking particular strategic options. That cannot be squashed into the graveyard shift alone. We should have the debate tonight, but we have to have the Friday sitting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We raised the issue. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do we have a choice?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we put the proposal for the Friday sitting? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I raised at the Business Committee earlier today the approval of the Revised Estimate by the arts and culture committee - I will not give it its new name as it is so long I cannot remember it. We are discussing public money and a very serious matter. The committee only signed off on the Estimates yesterday and they have come to the House today. As of this morning at least, none of us, apart from the members of the committee, has seen the Estimates and we do not know what the considerations are, yet we are being asked to push a Revised Estimate through on the nod. I take the point that these are additional expenditures for the arts and no one wants to stop additional expenditure. Some might want to see much more expenditure. However, there is a problem with the Dáil pushing through significant additional expenditures of public money on the nod without proper discussion and a report on the considerations from the committee. I do not want to hold up the business of the Dáil but I see that as a problem. It is important to underline, as was pointed out at the Business Committee today, that the option that Deputies had to attend meetings of committees of which they are not members has now effectively ceased. In the past, a Member who was not a member of a committee could still attend, listen and speak. That is no longer an option. Therefore, when it comes to Estimates and other matters arising out of committee proceedings, a whole layer of Deputies is simply excluded from the process. That is not great legislative or financial oversight.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point needed to be registered. It was a fair point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Before this debacle emerged at the weekend, People Before Profit and RISE had already come to the conclusion we needed to move to a higher level of restrictions and that we should pursue a zero Covid-19 strategy. We held that view because after fairly intense discussions with public health and infectious disease experts, they predicted where we are now, with rising infection rates all over the country. They indicated that regardless of what the Government said, we would need to increase restrictions. I want to get to what annoys me about what unfolded at the weekend. It is the manner in which the Tánaiste and the Government in general tried to trash the Chief Medical Officer and undermine his credibility in a very cynical way when it was clear he was simply offering a view about the need for greater restrictions based on his fears that if those restrictions were not introduced quickly, the health position would deteriorate but so would the social and economic position. Both employment and the wider economic position would become a bigger problem in three weeks if we did not act at that stage. I point this out because the Tánaiste, in the most cynical way, suggested that the Chief Medical Officer did not give a damn about economic impacts, loss of employment and loss of income. It was the really dastardly part of the attack. The suggestion was that the Chief Medical Officer had no right to say what he did because he would not have to suffer on the pandemic unemployment payment. That is quite ironic from a Tánaiste who is part of the Government, which is cutting the payment. He was pretending it was his concern. This was fundamentally dishonest because the Tánaiste and the Government knew that the view of NPHET and the Chief Medical Officer, whatever one thinks of it, sought to minimise economic, social and health damage. The Government might not have agreed with that view, and we could have an honest argument about that. Was it not deeply cynical, devious and wrong to try to undermine the Chief Medical Officer in that way or to say he did not have a rationale?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You are becoming involved. You might stop the clock.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My point-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government politicised this in a dishonest way instead of addressing the substance of the argument. There was an attempt to trash the person and the rationale behind his suggestions. That is what is wrong here. I ask the Minister to apologise for that treatment of the Chief Medical Officer on behalf of the Government and move on to a serious discussion about strategy, which cannot be had in the limited time we have here. We have been asking for this for several weeks. We have a particular view. We want to hear the Minister's view and we want to hear what the public health experts have to say. I would appreciate if Deputy Donnelly would respond to that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister agree that the Government's response to Dr. Tony Holohan's letter and recommendation was not the best? Should the Government not apologise for the treatment of the Chief Medical Officer?
