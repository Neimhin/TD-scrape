RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome any acceleration of pay restoration for workers, either in the public or private sector. It is positive and is a fantastic vindication of the decision of gardaí and teachers to resist. They deserve the credit for this change in policy by the Government. Now people inside the Lansdowne Road agreement have been the beneficiaries of the justified militancy of gardaí and teachers. While I welcome it, I would much prefer if it were financed by increased taxes on those who could afford to pay, rather than from €120 million which the Minister cannot fully explain from where he is getting it. Is it not the case that it will inevitably come from cuts or, at least, by removing flexibility in other areas of public services which could do with it? Given how underfunded many areas are, such as health, they could do with a bit of upward flexibility and discretion but now they will not have it. Extra revenues should have been raised through larger contributions in corporate tax, financial transaction tax, taxes on those with higher incomes and a landlord tax, as we proposed in our alternative budget submissions, to ensure some pay restoration. While I welcome the pay restoration, is it not the case that the Minister is potentially robbing Peter to pay Paul?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just for clarification, my point was that those inside the Lansdowne Road agreement have now benefited from the militancy, people power, determination to campaign or whatever one wants to call it, of the teachers and the gardaí. To my mind, it is a vindication of the decision of those workers to fight for proper pay restoration. There is a belated acknowledgment on the Minister's part, forced on him by the teachers and the gardaí, that accelerated pay restoration was necessary. Frankly, more is necessary and sooner because even with this accelerated pay restoration, all these public service workers affected will still be earning less than they were before the austerity started. Eight years after austerity started, public sector workers are still earning less than they were before all this. I believe in the right to pursue immediate pay restoration. My point is that it has taken action by the teachers and the gardaí to do that because the Minister resisted it all the way along the line. It should not be financed by shaving corners off other stretched budgets.
