RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The figure is €60 million.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The local authorities are restricted from borrowing that money because of the fiscal compact and the rules on debt deficit targets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given that the local authorities are prohibited from borrowing money, we are trying to get the AHB and voluntary sector to pick up the slack.That is the thinking, hence the need to regulate and so forth. Am I correct that up until 2011 all of the money that went to the AHBs was direct Exchequer funding and that it was only after 2011, when this Government took office, that the funding dropped significantly and we started to focus on trying to get money elsewhere, other than from the State? The scheme changed then. Am I right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the private markets?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to be clear about the facts. Direct State funding to the AHBs dropped from a high in 2008 of €1.7 billion to the current situation of less than €400 million.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a graph from the document we received from the Oireachtas Library and Research Service. It shows housing expenditure capital from 2007 to 2014. In 2008, it shows there was €1.7 billion in State funding available while in 2014 it was-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am trying to clarify if all of that money went to the AHBs. Do those figures make sense to the witness?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If possible, I wish to get the figures for the funding to the AHB sector from 2011 up to now, and the projected figures up to the end of the housing 2020 strategy. It would also be useful if we could compare that with the output from the sector for each of those years. On the output from the sector, has it increased this year, how does it compare to last year and what is expected next year and the year after?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the witness know how that translates into units in comparison?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the witness have a rough figure of what it was for 2013 and 2014?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Two hundred and fifty?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of the 35,000 units that are identified between now and the end of 2020, do the witnesses know, roughly, how many of those are due to be delivered by the AHB sector?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do not know at present.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are looking at doubling the stock size over the next three years?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the availability of private finance, it is basically like matching funding. A certain amount comes from the bodies represented by the witnesses. Do the witnesses get their money based on approval from the Government?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do the approved housing bodies go to private commercial banks in addition to borrowing money from the agency?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In other words, there is not much reliance on private commercial banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One thing concerns me. I have heard some criticism in England, where this sector is much bigger, that profit motives can potentially start to creep in. I have not read through the heads of the Bill yet, but is profit seeking excluded in this sector under the legislation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What type of risky venture?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In other words, these approved housing bodies could be set up on the basis of making money for shareholders in dividends.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They have to be not-for-profit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the things that even the approved housing bodies have said themselves is in the shift to source more social housing from that sector than has traditionally been the case, they are just not resourced to manage the problems that can come with a much bigger social housing stock, in terms of dealing with tenants' concerns, maintenance issues, anti-social issues and complaints, which are all things local authorities would be better resourced to do. Can regulation deal with this problem when, to some extent, it is a resourcing and staffing problem?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a very close connection between the housing list that local authorities have and people being housed from that list in approved housing bodies and a rent scheme which is similar. Will this relationship be fully maintained?
