RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to press the Taoiseach on the matter of a debate on the staggering announcement by AIB in regard to 2,000 job losses and the anticipated announcement regarding further job losses elsewhere in the banking system.  When is it proposed to hold that debate on, as acknowledged by the Taoiseach, this serious matter?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not time, given this announcement of horrendous job losses, to re-examine legislation dealing with excessive remuneration for executives——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——-in banks which are effectively State owned?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Apart from the injustice of visiting pay cuts on low and middle income public sector workers, what about the economic irrationality of it?  If the Government takes money out of the pockets of ordinary workers who spend in the economy, it has a detrimental effect because demand is reduced and the economy contracts.  The only public sector reform we should examine is one that deals with excessively high salaries of those paid with public money, whether it is in the top end of the Civil Service, semi-State bodies, politicians or bankers.  These are the people who should take the hit, rather than ordinary low and middle income workers who have already been slaughtered with pay cuts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am trying to avail of the wisdom and experience of the people who have been here much longer than I have been on the issue of——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——the relationship between the Taoiseach's Department and State boards, semi-States and so on.  I submitted a question on the accountability for semi-States and State boards, which was passed to the Minister for Finance by which I was little surprised.  Is it not to the Taoiseach the people on State boards and semi-State boards should be responsible and should we not be allowed ask the Taoiseach questions about that in order that there is accountability in that respect to the Dáil?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked a general question about semi-State companies and State boards.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing my time with Deputies Mattie McGrath, Healy and Ross.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Many of the arguments about the debate that happened at the European Council have been gone through and I have a short time to make my points.  As Deputy Doherty stated, no doubt all of us want to sort out the mess we are in, but what seems to me extraordinary is that there is no willingness on the part of the Government to recognise that the path we are being asked to go down by the IMF and the EU is a path that makes matters worse, not better.  It is essentially the path that led us to this crisis in the first place.  I do not understand why the Government does not acknowledge that.In simple terms, this crisis happened because banks in Europe — French, German, British banks — lent money to Irish banks to speculate on the property bubble and they were happy with the unregulated financial and banking sector.  The philosophy was "no regulation" or "light regulation", let the market rip and remove anything that gets in the way of making profits.  We know where that got us.The bankers here, in blind competition with one another to get a piece of the action, cheered on by the Fianna Fáil Government, stoked up a property bubble and the bankers in Europe knew what it was all about — if they did not, they were grossly incompetent.  They knew, but they were happy to stoke up that sort of bubble and to make profits in the sort of unregulated Celtic tiger environment which they might not even have got away with in their own countries, and the inevitable crash came.  Europe, having been very significantly responsible for it, then told the State that it must unload the cost of this mess on to the backs of working people in the form of cutbacks and austerity, that the State must bail out the Irish banks because if it does not, the Irish banks will bring Europe's banks down and it might affect the euro, and that Europe is not having that.The immorality and injustice of that is obvious to all.  Given this crisis, which did not happen under the Taoiseach's watch but under the watch of the previous Government, Europe is now telling us that we must continue along the same road.  It is a joke to talk about a bailout because they are burying this economy and society to protect the bankers who bankrolled this property bubble in the first place.  In so far as they will bail us out and in so far as they are saying that they will give us money to pay off the bankers — to pay them back, essentially — they, the European banks demand more deregulation, more austerity and more cutbacks that are contracting the economy as well as causing massive injustice, hardship and suffering for ordinary people.  The effects are clear.  Growth in the economy is contracting continuously.The more the Government imposes austerity, the more the economy contracts.  The IMF revised downward growth forecasts prove that.  When will the Government state that this is not working?  When will the Government stand up and state that it is not fair and it is not working, and insist that we go down another path and stand up to them?  In doing that, we will be siding with other people in Iceland who have rejected similar policies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will be siding with people in Portugal who are standing up to it, and people on the streets in Greece and Spain who are saying that neither do they want to pay for the crimes of politicians, bankers and the corporate elite.  Should we not stand up with those people and stop the insanity?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Tánaiste is correct to ask for constructive questions and contributions to this debate.  Perhaps the Tánaiste agrees that it is very difficult to take seriously the castigation and criticism by Fianna Fáil when it has not got down on bended knee and asked for forgiveness from the people of this country for what it has done to them.  I refer to Fianna Fáil's major culpability in dragging this country to the edge of the abyss.  Members and the rest of the country can start to take them seriously when they admit to their crimes.  We will pass on from political point scoring but it makes me retch to hear them criticise anyone, given what they have done.In an effort to be constructive, it is not doom and gloom to question the continuing policy of bailing out the banks.  It is continuing to bail out the banks and asking ordinary people to pay for this in the form of cutbacks and austerity that is closing off the road to economic recovery.  Is that not obviously a fact?  Austerity started with the last Government and was imposed for two years but it did not work.  When Deputy Gilmore was in opposition, he made that point.  These measures contracted the economy, as the latest IMF figures confirm.  At the weekend, Dr. Joseph Stiglitz confirmed that the more we go down this road, the more the economy contracts and reduces the possibility of future economic growth, which is the only thing that can get us out of this mess.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the case that the prescriptions of the EU and the IMF, irrespective of how we got here, are moving us in the opposite direction to that which allows for job growth and economic growth?  The EU and IMF require austerity, which is sucking money out of the economy.  For Greece to get a miserable 1% reduction on its interest rate, it had to agree to €50 billion worth of privatisation.  Is that the road we go down as the growth forecasts go down, as the EU and the IMF come back and say we will not be able to pay it back on this basis and that they want more?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we to accept that?  We are moving in the opposite direction, instead of stimulating the economy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fianna Fáil has some nerve in talking about safeguarding education spending or commending its own record.  It is quite extraordinary.  Its record includes cutting Traveller education resources, putting a cap on special needs assistance and cutting the co-ordination of rural services for the disadvantaged, in other words, hitting the most vulnerable and disadvantaged sections of society.  There are fewer people working in the education system than in 2008, with a drop of more than 1,000 staff.  Fianna Fáil can spin all the figures it likes, but the truth is it cut the numbers working in the education system.Let us not forget the commitment to reduce class sizes to 20, a commitment which was reneged upon.  We are now talking about an average class size of 28, but, of course, we know that in many areas the figures are much higher, with 30 to 35 in classes.  Other cuts, too, are being targeted such as in the teacher allocations for gaelscoileanna.  It is expected that in some schools there could be class sizes of up to 40 in the short term.The truth is that Fianna Fáil presided over a serious deterioration in the quality of the education system, hitting the most disadvantaged in particular.  Significantly, while the figures for teachers have increased in some areas, this is against a backdrop of 10,000 extra children feeding into the system every year.  Therefore, the extra resources provided are not keeping pace with the demographic tsunami sweeping through the system.  A massive increase in resources is necessary.Neither the Government nor the Opposition can seriously claim education is important and should be the fuel to help economic growth and recovery unless they are willing to raise the proportion of moneys being spent on education to average European and OECD levels.  We spend a much smaller proportion of our national wealth on education compared to most of our European and OECD counterparts, despite the fact that this country has become significantly richer in recent years.  That is the real test of how much we put into education as a proportion of national wealth.  The figure has been falling.  Sadly, the Government has signalled its intention not to reverse the cuts made and has made no concrete pledges to increase the proportion of education spending.  That is what we need.  All the rest are just weasel words.
