RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The people who work in live entertainment including music, the arts, the performers, the sound people, promoters and the crew have been crucified as a result of the pandemic and the restrictions which, with the current trajectory of infections, are set to remain so for some time. I have asked repeatedly for months, as have the people involved, and the Minister will know they have been campaigning, for real supports in terms of retaining the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, and other financial supports for reduced capacities in venues or no capacity because of the pandemic, and other supports. Will the Minister respond to their desperate pleas?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I genuinely welcome the fact that the Minister responded to that informal approach, which I made on behalf of the Events Industry Alliance, to get more representation on the task force. Even since then, however, the situation has deteriorated. With more severe restrictions being imposed in Dublin, and possibly elsewhere, it is a very grim picture that is facing the events, music and arts industry. Frankly, if we compare the additional supports that have been provided with the position in New Zealand, it has given massive support to sustain these people compared to what we are giving them. We will need those music and arts people and so on in the grim period ahead we are facing, and we will need them to be around when we finally get out of this dire situation. They have made clear their demands. Critically, it is the maintenance of the PUP but for people to be allowed to take bits of work on top of that without losing their income, additional supports to cover their ongoing costs such as grants and so on and, where events can happen but on reduced capacity, that subsidies would be provided to ensure those things can happen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us be clear. With the cuts in the PUP, the retrograde decision to allow the banks end the waiver on mortgage repayments and so on, the financial pressure on the 35,000 people working in this sector will become unbearable. They then have the ongoing costs of repayments, insurance and warehousing; we can go through the list of costs. There will not be a sector unless there is a dramatic improvement in supports. Many of these people will not be able to pay their bills so the PUP issue is critical.That has to be addressed. Equally, the ongoing costs must be covered and grants must be made available to sustain this industry through what is a very uncertain and indefinite period of shutdown, or near shutdown. It is a life-and-death matter for the 35,000 people affected and many more who are affected indirectly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We covered some of this ground in a previous question. The €5 million announced in the July stimulus for 35,000 people is a pittance. The Minister says this is just a pilot, but a pilot is not good enough for the dire situation that faces those 35,000 people. The Minister will know that the EPIC working group, The Events Industry Alliance, the National Campaign for the Arts and the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland, MEAI, representing musicians and so on, are looking for a hell of a lot more. What they want to know is what the Minister is recommending to the Government in advance of the budget to ensure that happens and that they can survive?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us make a comparison. The Minister might not give me the exact figures that she is recommending in the negotiations but in New Zealand, the package for arts, music and live entertainment is €175 million. This dwarfs what is being given to, let us remember, a live music and events sector that has never received a cent from Government, and never asked for it, and an arts sector which is one of the most poorly funded in western Europe. We have taken our arts workers, musicians, crew and live entertainment people for granted. We now realise, or should realise, how badly we need these people and how much they contribute to our mental well-being, our welfare and our future in these grim times. The additional money that has been put forward is really a pittance when divided among the 35,000 people who work in music, live entertainment, the arts and so on. It is not enough. We need much more.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us be clear. At the best of times many people who worked in the arts were in borderline poverty situations. Cuts to the pandemic unemployment payment and the employment wage subsidy scheme will, potentially, drive thousands of people into poverty. Without sufficient grants to cover insurance costs, warehouse costs, debt repayments and other ongoing payments, people are going to go under and they are going to go under soon. Historically, we have undervalued, in terms of the support provided by Government, the arts, music and live entertainment sectors, although we trade internationally on their reputation and they contribute so much to our society. They are the glue that makes us a culture and a society.There must be a seismic shift in the mentality of the Government regarding the importance of this sector to us as a people and a society, particularly in these difficult times.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The programme for Government commits to addressing the ongoing and shameful homelessness crisis.The Green Party and Fianna Fáil when in opposition supported our Bill to halt evictions. In the context of Covid-19 the Government was forced, rightly, to bring in an eviction ban because making people homeless is totally incompatible with public health, yet the Government has now allowed that ban to lapse. We sought to bring forward a Bill in our Private Members' slot next week which is essentially the eviction ban, but we have been told that staff in the Dáil, through no fault of their own I want to stress, cannot process it because they have been overrun with things such as the Forestry (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which the Government rammed through with a guillotine, collapsing the normal sequence of legislative scrutiny. The Government has done this on multiple occasions, and as a result the staff are not able to process our Bill for Private Members' time. The Bill would seek to reinstate the eviction ban to prevent people going into homelessness during Covid-19.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the same way as it facilitated its own Bills, which it has rammed through, will the Government facilitate us on this critical issue to address the problem of homelessness?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Monday.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They do not have Private Members' time next week.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Which is run by the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The people are losing faith in the ability of the Government to deal with the Covid-19 crisis. They have endured incredible hardship and they are facing a grim outlook for the foreseeable future. Despite all of the suffering and hardship they have endured, the situation, once again, is deteriorating. The message that we are all in this together, which underpinned the huge efforts that people made in the early stage of the pandemic, has been blown out the window by the Government. Day in and day out young people are being lectured about their behaviour or supposedly endangering public health because of family gatherings or other gatherings in their homes. They are being berated yet it is deemed disproportionate to ask a judge of the Supreme Court who attended a party to resign. It is one law for society and another law for those who are supposed to uphold the law. The Government is allowing the banks once again to crawl over the backs of people who have lost their jobs and income as a result of Covid. The pandemic unemployment payment is being cut as these people face into further restrictions and the likelihood for many of their jobs and income being severely reduced for the foreseeable. At the same time, Ministers of State are given shocking pay increases on already excessive salaries and politicians are to receive pay increases. All of this does nothing to underpin the solidarity that we need to face the threat of Covid-19. The Government manages, in a PR, self-protecting way, the information about what is actually happening with Covid-19 rather than being honest with people and trusting their intelligence by giving them the information they need and a part in the debate on what type of strategy is necessary when it is very obvious that the strategy is failing. I held a briefing last night with the zero-Covid island group which believes we are heading back towards lockdown because of the failing Government strategy, yet the Government does not want to entertain an open and honest debate about that strategy. The Government needs to change or it is going to lose the faith of the people. In fact, I think it is already losing the faith of the people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend Deputy Gino Kenny on introducing the Dying with Dignity Bill 2020. He has put a great effort into it, as have all who have worked with him, some of whom have campaigned for many years to get to this point and ensure people have the right to make a decision on the end of their life and to have their life end with dignity in the way they choose. It is very disappointing that the Government has tabled an amendment. It is wholly unnecessary. It is very unfortunate that it has used the phrase "assisted suicide" because I do not believe it captures at all what we are talking about. It conjures up very different notions. What we are talking about is people who, like pretty much all of us, have wanted to live but whose choice about living is taken from them at the end, often in really awful circumstances. It is a question of whether life should end on their terms and whether they should have a choice about how their life should end so they can die with the utmost dignity and with as little pain and suffering as possible.I do not understand why anybody would want to deny people whose choice to live is taken away from them by illness, which illness is certain to end their life, the right to choose the terms on which that should happen in order to minimise the pain and suffering, physical and spiritual, that they undergo in those circumstances. I do not see why anyone would do that. In some cases - it is not an exaggeration to say this - to deny them that right is to torture them. It is literally putting them through excruciating, unbearable suffering and hardship against their will. That is a form of torture in an already difficult situation. Why would we want to do that to somebody? What right has anybody to deny a person the right to decide the terms on which his or her life should end when his or her life is certain to end?  Society has moved on from the days when people in the State or the church or from some moral code they held thought they could dictate to other people how they should live their lives. I thought we had moved past that. It seems, however, that with the delaying tactics, we are bending to the will of people who want to hold back that progress in Irish society. There is no justification for it. There are, for example, no constitutional issues arising. As the Supreme Court stated in 2012 that there were no constitutional issues, what do we need to consider? The matter has been discussed before in committee. If this Bill passes Second Stage, it will be discussed again in an all-party committee. All the Government needs to do is allow this Bill go to the next Stage where it will get all-party consideration. If the Government wants to set up other parallel processes that can be done as well but there is no reason to delay the Bill. Every moment of delay means that a small number of people - this is about only a small number of people - may suffer unnecessarily. Why would we do anything that would allow that to happen? I appeal to the Government to withdraw its amendment and to allow this Bill to proceed in order that we can have a mature discussion about the legislation and, hopefully, get it enacted soon, to make a difficult and tragic situation for many people a little less unbearable and cruel.
