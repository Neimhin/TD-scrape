RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the witnesses from the OECD. I certainly am in favour of wealth taxes. Ms Perret said any country looking to introduce a new wealth tax should avoid the pitfalls of previous such taxes. Will she give examples of wealth taxes she considers were poorly designed? Has she any examples of wealth taxes elsewhere in the world that were better designed and that have, in her opinion, worked?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Was a wealth tax introduced recently in Chile or elsewhere in South America?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. In the OECD statement, property taxes were referred to as having various pitfalls and as “under-used and poorly designed”. Could the witnesses elaborate a little bit more on good and not so good examples?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, absolutely.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is my view now, rather than the report’s view. The difficulty is that in recent times – this is the second time in the past 20 years – we have seen property values and house prices, whichever way one wants to look at it, shoot up to astronomical levels. We saw it pre-2008 and we are just about to see us reach the same levels of property prices that we had before the crash in 2008. The difficulty that many people feel here about taxes on their family home is that they have no control whatsoever over that rise in prices. Do the witnesses know what I mean? It bears absolutely no relationship to their income. In fact, I think most people looking at the Irish housing market at the moment would say it is completely dysfunctional. One aspect of that dysfunctionality is the value of people’s homes have just gone through the roof - in particular areas as well. There are huge anomalies there. If a person happens to live in a certain part of an urban centre, a very modest home could be massively over-valued in real terms. That person then gets hit for a tax based on that value. I do not know whether our witnesses have any comment on that and whether that is an issue that arises elsewhere with property taxes. I am just curious as to whether it exists anywhere else. Certainly, I would favour distinguishing between a property that is somebody’s home and property that is wealth beyond their own principal private residence - in other words, where people have multiple properties.There is quite an important distinction between those two things, namely, a place that is just a home and a place that is an asset but is not necessarily a home or is even an asset from which revenue is generated by renting it out, speculating on it or whatever. Are there any comments on those points?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	According to the institute's opening statement, we should reduce the CGT because it "is having a dampening effect on economic activity", and that reducing it could "improve the environment for start-ups and mature businesses, leading to an increase in transactions". I ask the witnesses to elaborate on that point. I do not really understand it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not know much about this particular tax, so I am not trying to catch the witnesses out. Could the witnesses give me examples so that I could understand it? I just do not quite get the dampening effect and why it is problematic. To me, CGT is a tax on the appreciation of assets. I think that is fair enough. I would be inclined towards increasing it, not reducing it. I would like to hear the argument as to why that would be problematic. I just do not understand what Ms Gunnell has said. I am trying to visualise who this is impacting and what sort of activity it is dampening that is good activity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am still struggling a bit, but I appreciate the witnesses' answer. Mr. Brennan referred to the LPT as "a key stabilising component of our tax system". In what sense is it stabilising? I do not understand that either. What is it stabilising?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What does the institute say to the arguments that the likes of us would put forward that it does not take into account the income of the people who own their family home, in that sense it can be very unfair on people and they have very little control over the price and the value of their property, particularly in a market which most people would agree is pretty dysfunctional at the moment? There are very high property prices and values that are another symptom of a housing crisis and a dysfunctional market, but yet people get penalised with a property tax even though the value of their property may bear no relationship whatsoever to their ability to pay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, but when we are trying to work out what is fair and so on when choosing between taxes, does it not seem more reasonable to direct taxes on wealth or property more towards those who have excess wealth or excess property, rather than those who only have a family home?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We were discussing a figure for the breakdown of household wealth here the other day, though maybe it was in the finance committee. Net household wealth is in excess of €1 trillion. How many family homes are there roughly? Perhaps 1.5 million. We could multiply that by the average house price of €300,000. I do not know what the exact maths are but it probably ends up being 40% or 50% of that €1 trillion. Is that, therefore, the majority of our wealth?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is 52.4%.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, so it is about half.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is my view the other 50% is real wealth. What does Ms Gunnell think?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure the farmers would say that, and rightly so maybe. Does Ms Gunnell not see any merit in distinguishing between people's family home or even a small family business and excess wealth, for want of a better phrase? I mean surplus wealth beyond what a person needs to keep a roof over their head. They are two different types of wealth.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I hear our guests' opinion. I have a slightly different opinion in that if you have enough wealth to have a second property you can rent out and generate revenue from, it is quite a different thing than if you do not. In fact, what if we got rid of the tax on the family home and paid for it by significantly increasing the amount we charge for second and third properties and maybe have it escalate for multiples above that? As a person's assets increase, and they are clearly not assets a person needs to live but assets in the real sense, and often wealth-generating, it would be fairer to have an escalating tax on them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What would they do with them then?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It depends who buys the properties, does it not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the institute's contribution.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise for having to leave, but I would like to catch the end of the Committee Stage debate on the Finance Bill.
