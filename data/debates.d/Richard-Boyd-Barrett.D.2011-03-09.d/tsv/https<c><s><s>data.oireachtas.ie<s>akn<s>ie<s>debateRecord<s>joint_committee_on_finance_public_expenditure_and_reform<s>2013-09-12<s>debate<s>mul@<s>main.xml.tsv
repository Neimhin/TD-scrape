RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the representatives for attending. I very much welcome the emphasis they all placed on the need to break from the policies of austerity that have been pursued, to my mind and, I suspect, theirs, pretty disastrously over the past five years. Their comments echo the points made by quite a few of the organisations, such as Barnardos, Focus Ireland, Threshold and Social Justice Ireland. I refer to the need to break from austerity, focus on protecting the vulnerable, shift the tax burden to the wealthy, invest to create jobs and get people back to work, which is absolutely right. As a relevant aside, I must state every day presents a new case that sums up what is happening in this country. I had to leave this meeting earlier because I received a call from a disabled man in Tallaght who has been told that if he, his wife and daughter do not pay their television licence fee, which they cannot afford, they will go to jail for four to six days. They will be in court tomorrow. The man told me his daughter is a lone parent, that he is disabled and that his wife is a Magdalen survivor. He also told me that, in the past two weeks at Tallaght Garda station, 24 people who cannot afford to pay a licence fee have been told to pay or go to jail. This is where we have come to. The message that the representatives are bringing in here is so important. In framing a budget, the Government should start with effects on people, just as the delegates do, rather than starting with deficits and macroeconomic imperatives and trying to squash people in order to address them. Given that this is the position, do the representatives believe that, after five years, anybody is listening to what they are saying? My feeling is that the authorities are utterly deaf. From what I can see, the IMF is just keen to push for more repossessions of people's homes. The emphasis of Fine Gael, the major party in Government, seems to be entirely on tax reductions to incentivise the private sector, the wealthy, etc. This has not worked for 20 years, yet the party believes it will help us chart a way out of the crisis. Given that is the case, what hopes have the delegates that we can break through the official consensus?I do not think it is the public consensus by any means. I think the delegation is expressing the public view, but the official consensus seems to be that we must pursue this austerity agenda in an utterly blinkered way even if it takes our society over a desperate cliff. What does the delegation propose we do to put forward and popularise the progressive alternative to austerity in a way that can begin to mobilise people and really put pressure on the powers that be to listen to the eminently sensible points the delegation is making this year, as it did last year and prior to that? I understand the logic of saying "Let us work within the confines of the troika programme," because the delegation probably thinks that is all the Government will listen to and there is no point in saying anything else. One thing that strikes me very forcibly is the fact that by the autumn of this year - I would particularly like to hear what Dr. Healy and the others have to say about this - we will enter a situation in which the State will have a primary budget surplus. The narrative that we are spending more than we are taking in will not be true this year. The main reason we continue to have a substantial deficit is that this year we will pay out approximately €8 billion in interest on loans that are largely not ours. Does the delegation not think it is time for us to say that this is not on and that we should not have to beggar our economy yet again to pay interest on loans that were taken out to bail out banks? Should we begin to make the call to say we are not doing it and are freezing or putting a moratorium on it?  I am delighted that corporate tax and wealth tax were raised. ICTU is being quite cautious in talking about €250 million as a possible take from reducing some of the write-offs that the big corporates are getting. Given that the figures suggest that the big multinationals in particular made in the region of €70 billion in profits last year and paid only €4 billion in tax, which works out at about 6%, should we be a bit more radical and say they should pay a minimum effective rate of 12.5%? Everybody else is paying far more than that. Should they not be paying 12.5% when the rest of the country is being beggared? Similarly, should we not be a bit more adventurous in what we are looking for from a wealth tax in percentage terms and play that off against the urgent need to reduce or remove the universal social charge for low and middle-income earners?  Could the National Women's Council talk about women's refuges? Domestic violence is rising quite scarily. It seems there is an urgent need for a major programme of investment in providing women's refuges. I had a question about youth issues, but I will leave it at that.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let me say to FLAC and the DFI that I have a sympathetic ear for their critique of the austerity agenda and how it impacts on the most vulnerable in society. I could not agree with them more about the need to say enough is enough and to reverse some of the damage that has been done, which was catalogued extremely well by them, particularly in the DFI's submission, which shows the extent of the assault. I know that one of the group said he did not want to use the word "assault", but I shall. It is an assault on one of the most vulnerable sectors in our society. The submission shows that the cuts are part of a general assault but it is the most vulnerable who feel them the most. Many of the cuts affect the wider layers of society but they are felt deeply and doubly, trebly or quadruply by some of the most vulnerable. I wish to ask DFI two things. First, I ask them to elaborate on the important point about not cutting pay and numbers in disability services. There is a narrative that was echoed in an earlier contribution which says that 90% of the cost of public services is spent on salaries. Its subtext is that we need to cut workers' pay to leave more room to manoeuvre when providing services. I think, and Mr. Dolan seemed to hint at the same, that we need to reject such logic. It seems to me nowhere is it more obvious than in the area of disability that providing services means providing human beings who, in turn, provide services. The service is providing a human being who will care for somebody, look after him or her and provide the necessary health care, support and so on. I would like to hear Mr. Dolan's view on this and I ask him to elaborate because the issue is important. Second, has Mr. Dolan anything to say about the creeping privatisation of some of these areas? As public service numbers and public services are rolled back in a range of areas the private sector moves in, but it views it as a chance to make money. It is deeply worrying to see that development, particularly in areas such as disability and care of the elderly. Perhaps Mr. Dolan will comment. I am delighted that FLAC raised the issue of social welfare appeals because the situation is alarming. Does FLAC agree that entitlements have been culled as part of budget cuts? People who previously had certain entitlements are now being refused, reviewed and so on and must endure the long process of appeal. I wish to outline one of the extraordinary features of this scenario and ask FLAC to confirm whether it has experienced the same. A consultant, counsellor or GP testifies to the Department of Social Protection that a person is entitled, or should be entitled, to a disability or invalidity benefit, but the person's claim is still refused by a person who, I can only assume, is in most cases not a doctor, a consultant or a counsellor. As a result, the person must go through the humiliation, ignominy and cruelty of appealing his or her case, and the process takes a long time. The appeal may not succeed despite strong medical evidence to back up the person's entitlement.  I agree with FLAC's comments on rights. The problem is how one translates human rights budgeting into practical policy. Let us take housing as an example. I am sick to my back teeth of the appalling housing crisis. How can one make a right to housing in law specific enough to make it truly binding and force action to resolve the housing crisis? We should put it in law that the State is obliged to provide permanent, secure and adequate housing within two years - I mean an absolute legal requirement, whereby the State would be open to legal action if it did not provide social housing for people who need and cannot afford housing. My last question is for the ICMSA. It has a slightly different set of issues that I do not know as much about. However, I shall outline my perspective.The impact of the current crisis is felt disproportionately by those on low and middle incomes, whereas those who are pretty wealthy are largely insulated from it. That is my view, with which the witnesses may or may not agree. I am slightly worried about the fact that the witnesses have spoken about no increases in capital gains or capital acquisitions taxes and no decrease in subsidies and other measures designed to assist farmers and to allow them to survive and invest in their businesses. I am not sure that business is always the best word to use because farming is a way of life which needs to be protected. It deserves special treatment for that reason, but I would draw the line at big, wealthy farmers, who should actually be taxed more, frankly. What do the witnesses think about having a differential approach? Would they be in favour of maintaining some of the protections and reliefs for the low and middle-income farmers who might be threatened by various tax changes but not for those farmers at the top who are making a lot of money? How would the witnesses feel about such a progressive or differential approach?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a brief supplementary question for the ICMSA. Does it recognise the difficulty we have in distinguishing between the strong case for defending a heritage and way of life and protecting the right of families to carry on their farming tradition, and the case for capital acquisitions tax or capital gains tax? I see the logic from the association's point of view. However, from the point of view of those of us in urban areas, there is a real problem about large numbers of very wealthy people getting away with not paying that much tax at a time when we want to shift the tax burden away from those on low and middle incomes towards those who can afford to pay. Does Mr. Dolan get my point? Is there a case for distinguishing between small and larger farmers in a way that can bridge that gap? Otherwise, we end up in a position where the city is played off against the countryside and resentment builds up between farmers and city dwellers. This does not help anybody. This is something to think about, but perhaps there is no response to it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not saying tax them, but those who can afford it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to add my thanks to that. Those in the secretariat deserve great credit for their tremendous work. I hope they get a bit of rest this evening. I thank all the groups for coming in as well.
