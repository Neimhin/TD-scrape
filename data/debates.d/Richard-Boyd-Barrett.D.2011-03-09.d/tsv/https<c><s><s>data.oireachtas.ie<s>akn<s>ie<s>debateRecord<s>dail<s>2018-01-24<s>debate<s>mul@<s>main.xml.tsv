RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is definitely true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The collapse of Carillion calls into question not just the wisdom of public private partnerships, PPPs, in terms of the five schools affected and the Carlow Institute of Further Education. It also gives rise to questions regarding a range of commitments in the area of school-building, house-building, social housing in particular and capital infrastructure projects as to whether the PPP model is an accident waiting to happen rather than an efficient way to deliver these vital projects. I endorse the call by Fianna Fáil and others for a vote on this, although it is worth noting that as recently as last May, Fianna Fáil was saying that the Government was not being ambitious enough in taking up PPPs. The Labour Party also supported this in terms of the school programme-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is right. The Labour Party, when in government, signed off on the contracts for these schools.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need a serious debate about the wisdom of using PPPs to deliver housing, schools and vital infrastructure-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----because, as we have seen with McNamara Construction and with the schools in question, PPPs are an accident waiting to happen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who is going to manage the schools? This is not just about construction.
