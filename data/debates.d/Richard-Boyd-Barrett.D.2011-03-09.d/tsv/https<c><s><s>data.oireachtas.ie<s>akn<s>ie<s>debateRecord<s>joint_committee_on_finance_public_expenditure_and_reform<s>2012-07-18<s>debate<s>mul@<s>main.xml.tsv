RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like Mr. Masding to comment on one thing that baffles me, not just in his bank but with all of the banks we have recapitalised.  What precisely is the relationship between his bank's policies and the Government, which represents the people, which has rapidly recapitalised Permanent TSB?  Frankly, I find it frustrating at this stage that we have recapitalised Permanent TSB and kept it in business, when those of us on the left argued that we should have nationalised the banks immediately as a response to this crisis.  We often get the response from the Government: "Oh, but the banks are nationalised".  The very same Government then gives out about the behaviour of banks and essentially says it has no control over the banks' policies even though it has effectively refinanced them.What is Mr. Masding's relationship to the Government, which represents the people, and to the troika?  To what extent does the Government or the troika tell him what to do?  I am thinking in particular about the European Central Bank.  On a number of occasions in the DÃ¡il I have tried to highlight guidelines issued by the ECB at the outset of the crisis, which I frankly believe are key to a lot of what is going on.  At that time, the ECB warned governments that they should avoid nationalisation if possible, but if it were necessary to nationalise, no bank must divert from the central orientation on profit maximisation and a commercial approach to banking.  It should not be deflected on to social goals or wider macro-economic goals.  To my mind, that is the heart of the problem because I think Permanent TSB should be diverted on to those issues, particularly because the bank is only in existence because of public money.  In my opinion, the bank is there to represent the public interest and not just shareholder interest.So can Mr. Masding comment on what his relationship is with the public authorities and the troika?  To what extent do they have any say or influence over his bank's policies, including the sort of policies we are debating and discussing here?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could Mr. Masding elaborate on that a little?  This is the crux of it to my mind, although I have a few other questions about the specifics.  It seems to me as if people can pass the buck around forever on many of these issues, but we need to clarify who is making the decisions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Masding makes the decisions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us say, for argument's sake, that the Government represented by the Minister for Finance, says:We're not happy with Mr. Masding's decisions.  We think that people on standard variable mortgages, for example, are getting excessively and unfairly penalised.  We're not happy with it.  We're not happy with the way you're dealing with people in mortgage distress.  We don't think it's transparent enough.  We don't think it's fair.  We don't think you're properly taking into account their individual circumstances.  We don't think you're properly taking into account the culpability of the bank in recklessly giving out the loans in the first place.  We want you to change your approach and your policy on these things.How would that stand, if the Minister were to say that?  Are there guidelines around Mr. Masding's relationship with the Minister?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is very helpful.  I am not trying to get at Mr. Masding because I think he is working within confines that are set up around him.  It is quite useful to clarify this, however, so perhaps he could amplify what he has just said.  Am I correct in saying that if the sole shareholder, which is the State, decides that it is not happy with the particular manner in which Mr. Masding is dealing with some of these key issues - like standard variable mortgages or distressed mortgage holders - the Minister could relay that to Mr. Masding who would respond with a change in policy?  Is that the nature of the relationship?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.  I am not talking about removal from office, I am talking about policy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, I think I am getting a little bit closer to an answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could Mr. Masding send a copy of that on to the committee?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If Mr. Masding could pass on the request to the shareholder,-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----the shareholder being the Minister for Finance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it Mr. Masding's understanding-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it the policy of the European Central Bank that banks, whether nationalised or not, must not divert from the central objective of profit maximisation to other social or macroeconomic goals?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think Mr. Masding has answered reasonably.  To my mind, ECB policy is the crux of the problem but it is not one Mr. Masding can solve individually.Mr. Masding said the bank has no policy of debt forgiveness.  As a consequence, its approach is to deal with cases of mortgage distress case by case and there may be some write-off further down the road if the bank feels it cannot get any more back from a customer.Does a case-by-case approach for customers also extend to lenders?  In other words, given that Mr. Masding has acknowledged the bank has culpability for the reckless lending that went on during the bubble, does the bank take on board its culpability when examining an individual's case?  This is important to me.  The other day, I was in PermanentTSB with a borrower who was given a leave of execution-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, the bank officials were very friendly.  However, it is not at all clear what will happen to the borrower who is in an unsustainable situation.  The bank did not pull the trigger that day but it is not all clear how the bank will deal with it.  One recurring element in such cases is the borrower claiming the bank was flinging the money at him or her.  Is the bank looking at this when it makes a decision on how to deal with individual customers?  It seems to me that it is morally bound to do so.The banks, the politicians and the developers were the ones responsible, not the people who were just trying to put a roof over their heads.  It is different for people who were borrowing for big commercial deals or engaging in speculative borrowing to profit.  When it comes to people trying to put a roof over their heads, however, the bank bears the primary responsibility for a grossly overinflated market.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the total amount in euro that the bank has surrendered all legal call on?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There has been no debt forgiveness at all.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Every other member got-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	By how much was the bank recapitalised?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	By how much was the bank recapitalised and how much in losses was predicted in the prudential capital assessment review, PCAR, exercise?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the basis that the projected losses do not exceed the amount given to the bank, what is the problem with debt forgiveness for domestic mortgage holders when it has the money?
