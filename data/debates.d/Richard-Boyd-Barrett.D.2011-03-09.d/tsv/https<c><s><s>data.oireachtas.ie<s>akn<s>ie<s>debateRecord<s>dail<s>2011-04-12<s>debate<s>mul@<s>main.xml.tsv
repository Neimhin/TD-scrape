RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a question on legislative priorities.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The worse growth prospects put forward by the IMF and the outcome of Iceland's referendum——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Cheann Comhairle, this is about legislative priorities.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If you let me finish the question, I will explain.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The result of the Iceland referendum, where the people in that country voted "No" to the bank bailout——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would the Taoiseach consider it——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——a legislative priority——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——to bring forward legislation for a similar referendum to the one in Iceland?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not want to go over all of the ground.  Obviously, it has been well covered.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In fairness, the Ceann Comhairle should not cut across me all of the time.  I am entitled to ask a question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am on the list for this one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are matters arising from the Moriarty tribunal debate that were not satisfactorily answered which are to do with the here and now.  The Taoiseach stated there was no arrangement.  Did the Taoiseach meet Deputy Lowry or did any member of the Government, formally or informally, meet Deputy Lowry in the context of him making a decision to support Deputy Enda Kenny's nomination for Taoiseach and support for the Government?  Were there any meetings of any description and were any undertakings given or agreements or tacit agreements made between the Government and Deputy Lowry which led to him supporting Deputy Enda Kenny for Taoiseach and supporting the Government?Other issues arose out of that, such as the issue of the problem of corporate donations to political parties.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It arises out of the Moriarty tribunal and the issues related to it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is in the question, if the Ceann Comhairle looks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it in line with satisfying public concern about the issue of corporate donations to political parties, given all of the findings of the Moriarty tribunal, that the Government should tell us what corporate donors——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——gave to Fine Gael Party funds over the past year?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have my six minutes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Were there any meetings?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Should the Taoiseach not say to his European counterparts when he next meets them that, in light of the downward revised growth projections for the Irish economy, the cuts and austerity they require to be imposed on this economy and the people in it are counter-productive and are not working?  He should tell them the reduced growth that is projected is the result of the austerity and cuts and we should perhaps acquaint them with the common wisdom here, namely, that if one is in a hole, one should stop digging.  That is what the lower growth rates indicate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the grouping?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does it include Question No. 38?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the devastating announcement that 2,000 jobs are to be lost in Allied Irish Banks, an institution which is 92.8% owned by the Government and which we have bailed out ——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	—— to the tune of €20.5 billion, are we not going to have an emergency debate on those job losses and the fact that they are being visited on ordinary workers while, for example, the CEO of that bank is reported as earning €500,000 per year?  Are we going to discuss the devastating consequences for the workers concerned?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When it comes to postal services, we should apply the wise adage that if it is not broken, do not fix it.  Probably nowhere does that wisdom apply more than to the postal service.  It is not an exaggeration to say that the postal service is a modern wonder.  Everybody gets the same service for next to nothing — it costs 55 cent to post a letter from anywhere to any other place in the country and people receive it within a day or two regardless of how isolated is the place they live.As many speakers have said, it is not just an efficient and cheap service but it is also a social service.  It is a lifeline for people in isolated areas, the elderly, those in rural communities and so on.  It also provides good, decent, stable and secure jobs.  While we might say that nothing is perfect in this world, the postal service is one of the better things in our society.  Given that it works well, is reliable and is loved by people, why should we change it?  Why does Europe want to change it and why would we accept its diktats in demanding that it be changed?It is euphemistically called liberalising the service, but bringing for-profit considerations to bear on this social service would be a better way to describe it.  Letting those with greed for money get their teeth into a social service which is so important to the people would be a better term than liberalisation.  Is it not absolutely inevitable that if we bring market forces to bear on this service, cherry-picking will take place?  Private for-profit companies will be interested in the profitable postal routes where there is high volume of letters and parcels, and will not be interested in those areas with low volumes, namely those isolated rural areas that need the service so much.  Once they take the profitable routes from An Post, it will be left with the unprofitable routes and the ability of An Post to provide the service to those unprofitable routes is dependent on it also having those profitable areas.  That cross-subsidy is the underpinning of the wonder of the postal service.  If that is undermined, as liberalising will do, it will inevitably undermine the basis of what makes our postal service great.All the good things that Deputy after Deputy has described about the postal service will inevitably be threatened by liberalisation.  It will threaten the universal service, the daily service in rural areas and the social service value because for-profit companies are not interested in social services.  It will threaten the low cost, which is spread evenly across the entire service, and will threaten jobs as it has done everywhere else liberalisation has been introduced with thousands of jobs lost in the service.  In addition it will cause a problem of needless replication of services with several postal providers unnecessarily replicating themselves in particular areas while we will have virtually no service in other areas.Is this not an example of the addiction of Europe to neoliberal economic dogma through privatisation?  This addiction does nothing more than promote the interests of big private corporations which in the absence of being able to make profits anywhere else in the current difficult economic climate see vital public services as an area to prise open and sink their teeth into in order to make profit for themselves without any consideration of the vital nature of those services to the people who avail of them and the workers who work in them.Did we learn nothing from the disaster of deregulating financial services?  The deregulation of the financial and banking sector has led to disaster and underpinned the economic crisis.  The deregulation allowing market forces to rip in the housing sector here caused absolute disaster for which we are now paying in spades.  The deregulation and privatisation of water services in countries across the world, including Britain, have been disastrous and have been resisted hotly in many places and successfully, I am glad to say, in places such as Latin America.  We need to stand up to this insane addiction of Europe representing the interests of corporate vultures by saying we will not allow the ripping up of this vital service, which works, is loved and has no reason to be changed.I welcome the comments by the previous two Labour Party speakers, Deputies Tuffy and Nolan.  It is great that they are saying those things and I could not agree more with them.  I hope that when it comes to making a decision on whether we will accept or reject this legislation that threatens to destroy our postal service, they will not cave in, will stand up for the postal service and not capitulate to the insane addiction of Europe and the political establishments across Europe to the failed ideology of privatisation when it comes to the damage it could do to our postal service which is so loved and needed by the people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy should look at his addiction to neoliberalism.
