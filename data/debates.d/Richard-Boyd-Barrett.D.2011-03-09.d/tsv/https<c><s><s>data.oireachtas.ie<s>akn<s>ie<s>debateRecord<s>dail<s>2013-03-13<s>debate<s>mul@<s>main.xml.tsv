RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach realise how frustrated people have become from watching the endless merry-go-round of EU summits? They are littered with fine phrases about jobs, economic growth and returning to normal lending, but the reality experienced by people is one of deepening stagnation in the European and Irish economies and the persistence of the scourge of mass unemployment. The fact that 26 million people are unemployed across Europe, of whom 7 million are young people, is a stinging indictment of the failure of EU governments. It is a tragic waste of human resources and potential. The European Union has failed to make even the slightest dent on this most important of issues. The policy of debt and deficit reduction through slashing incomes and public expenditure has failed. The policy of bailing out private banks at all costs has not led to renewed or normalised lending to SMEs or the economy in general. In Ireland the policy of putting €64 billion of our money into the banks has not led to any meaningful action on the crisis in mortgage arrears which is causing suffering and anxiety in 180,000 households and placing a suffocating dead weight on the economy. Unless we deal with this problem, there will be no chance of meaningful economic recovery. The Government and Europe's leaders are hopelessly addicted to failed policies and the neoliberal dogma that by cutting public spending and incomes, the markets will eventually come charging over the hill to rescue us. They are hostages to Europe's banks and multinationals. Either they do not realise this or they will not admit it. We will not achieve growth or employment, unless we have investment. Since the height of the boom, investment in the State has dropped by 70% and it is not recovering, despite the Government's episodic announcements about this or that project. The overall level of investment has collapsed and unless we reverse that collapse, there will not be meaningful economic recovery. This pattern is becoming evident across Europe and spreading to its heart.As parties in government who have long been committed to the European project, Fine Gael and the Labour Party should consider that their beloved Union is now threatened with break-up because of its failure to deal with these issues. It should be a major cause for concern to those committed to the European project that one country is considering pulling out. God knows, if there was a referendum in Britain, it is very likely the British people would pull out, particularly given the malaise that now exists in Europe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am for a social Europe. It would depend on whether it was a social Europe or a corporate Europe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have four minutes and 53 seconds, so why did the Chair cut across me before I had finished?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a practical and simple proposal for the Government to increase investment in this country. It should ask the European authorities-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Chair had not cut across me 15 seconds before I had finished, I would have concluded by now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Those in the Chair have a habit of doing that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why should I not make it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have plenty of respect for myself. The Chair should show some respect for the House as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Likewise, as I indicated on Committee Stage, I oppose this move to tax maternity benefit. In the various comments from the Minister and Government spokespersons when this issue was first highlighted, the defence put up was to suggest this was a significant anomaly where, if people were on maternity leave, they would end up with more than if they had stayed at work. The problem lies in the way that is put because, of course, when a woman is on maternity leave, she is at work. She is doing additional work, and it is additional work that benefits our society and our economy. Frankly, women are not sufficiently acknowledged for the role and contribution they make to our entire society and economy as a result of their role in bringing up children. We need more acknowledgement of that role and contribution, not less. I have no problem with women who are on maternity leave getting a bonus for giving birth to children and rearing those children in their early weeks and months. Indeed, I believe all women should get such a bonus and they should be recognised for the additional work they are doing for the whole of society, particularly when they work and then have to play this role as well. I do not believe this is acceptable. It is a cruel, anti-woman, anti-family and anti-child cut. Even at this stage, the Minister should row back on it. We have so often heard from the Government fine words about children and families, and the esteem in which the Government holds them, but we then see a measure such as this, which will penalise women and reduce a small extra acknowledgment of the important role they play in our society. I hope the Minister will row back on this, although he has indicated he will not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has not really grasped the central point made by some of us on this side of the House. His defence for this move to effectively cut maternity benefit does not recognise the contribution and role of women in society as a whole and the economy. When he argues that we have to make fiscal choices, he is implying that there is fiscal rectitude and proper fiscal management, on the one hand, while, on the other, there is a giveaway to women who are having children. He argues that even though we might like to be able to do it, we cannot really afford it and that it is not in the interests of the economy. The point we are making - a point also made by Deputies Peter Mathews and Catherine Murphy - is that women are making a very significant - I would describe it as unparalleled - contribution to the economy in bringing up children. The Minister might consider that many countries in Europe such as Germany, for example, have real problems with an ageing population. That will be an economic problem. Therefore, encouraging, rewarding, incentivising and supporting women who make the choice to have children - in addition to working in other sectors of the economy - is a positive measure which is good for society and the economy as a whole. It is a false argument to set one against the other, as it is not a case of the individual against the rest of society. In fact, these individual women are making a very valuable contribution. In some ways, the Minister's attitude sums up an ideological view that sees human beings as being in some way a burden on the economy, that the more we have, the more burdensome they become and that we cannot really afford this burden. That is a view which sees things completely the wrong way around. Those who generate wealth and economic activity are these very human beings. The idea that people should not be fully supported and that role should not be fully acknowledged is wrong, even in difficult economic circumstances. This is a mistaken cut which must also be viewed in the round, with the cuts to child benefit and the cuts affecting lone parents. These cuts have all hit women who are having and bringing up children. At least let us be fully honest when debating alternatives. The Government endlessly repeats that there is no pot of gold. I am not saying there is, although some gold was discovered in County Wicklow recently which we should investigate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will consider our view on that issue when we see who is mining it and who will gain the benefit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is diverting the discussion slightly. The economic cost of an oil spill in the bay would be far greater than the cost of any benefit we might receive. In any case, we would not receive the same benefit as the private multinationals. The Minister has alternative proposals which have been put to him by various Members. As I pointed out to him, responses from his own Department indicate that 108,000 people - the top 5% of earners - are earning over €100,000 a year, with average earnings of €185,000. On average, they are paying an effective tax rate of 36%.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In our budget submission, we proposed that the effective rates relating to these people should be increased and that hundreds of millions or perhaps billions of euro could be captured as a result. There are alternatives but the Minister just does not accept that they exist. He is of the view that it is more acceptable to hit women who are bringing up children and we believe he is wrong.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I referred to those with incomes of more than €100,000, all the way up to €8 million.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I stated that their average earnings were €185,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did. The Minister is just not listening.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have suggested increasing corporate tax, introducing a financial transactions tax, etc.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Self-evidently the Government's policy on jobs and its promise to get Ireland working is failing. We lost 14,000 full-time jobs last year. If it was not for emigration the unemployment crisis, which is already very severe, would be at absolutely catastrophic levels. It really seems as if emigration is the Government's jobs policy and that is a shame for any Government, given the history of this State. I have made those points many times as have others. Tonight I want to concentrate on two particular issues. The Government goes on and on about the need to upskill, re-educate and re-train people. I have just come from a meeting in Dún Laoghaire organised by teachers in the further education sector where they protested about the Government's plans to increase the staff-student ratio from 1:17 to 1:19. They point out that this sector has been absolutely critical in finding a pathway into third level education and employment for many of the people who are not suited to the normal CAO and academic system. It has been a very successful sector and they pointed out that as a result of what the Government is doing in our area alone 14 jobs will be lost, across the country 500, and thousands of places for students, particularly those from disadvantaged areas, who had a pathway into further education and employment, will be cut. How can the Government claim that it needs to re-train, re-educate and re-orientate our economy and at the same time slash a sector which will be absolutely critical to achieving that end? I appeal to the Government to back off on the increase in the staff-student ratio, take away the caps from the further education sector and protect and develop this sector which will be critical to re-training people who need to work or are coming out of school. My second point is about forestry. There are many studies which show in detail that every 15,000 hectares of forest planted can generate 500 or 600 jobs. We have completely failed to deliver on our afforestation targets. In Switzerland, a country half the size of ours, 100,000 people work on the same amount of forestry as ours yet only 10,000 are employed here. The Government proposes to sell off the harvesting rights to that forestry rather than have a programme of public investment to develop the forestry sector and create potentially 50,000 or 100,000 jobs over ten years if we meet our afforestation targets. I urge the Government not to sell the forestry rights and instead to invest in this sector to create jobs and revenue for the State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The trees will not be around for long.
