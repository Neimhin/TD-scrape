RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In a cynical and, frankly, despicable effort to protect the interests of the fossil fuel industry and oil exploration companies, Fine Gael and its Independent Alliance colleagues are abandoning their promise in the programme for Government to take "radical and ambitious action to deal with climate change" in which regard they said they would be world leaders. Simultaneously, they are sabotaging the democratic process of the Dáil to prevent Deputy Bríd Smith's Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018 to progress, notwithstanding the fact that it was passed overwhelmingly by the House. The Bill seeks to ban the issuing of further exploration licences for gas and oil exploration in Ireland. This is an abandonment of the Government's so-called commitment to deal with climate change as well as a very serious abuse of the democratic processes of the Dáil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. When Deputy Michael Lowry, Senator Michael McDowell, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, Deputy Seán Canney and Senator Joe O'Reilly are used to block a Bill and hold it hostage - many are Senators - notwithstanding the fact that it was passed by this House, to prevent it from progressing further, it is an abuse of the democratic process.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I will not. We learned yesterday-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----that this was being done for political reasons because the Taoiseach and the Government do not agree with the content of the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are using and abusing procedure to hold the Bill hostage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is an absolute disgrace and the Government must be called out for it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They think they can get away with these shenanigans.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are dancing to the tune of fossil fuel companies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Well then I will keep talking until it is addressed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I will not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Leas-Cheann Comhairle, there is an abuse of Standing Orders and Dáil procedures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is right that I am normally orderly-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----but when the Government is abusing the democratic processes of the Dáil and sabotaging-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, but it cannot get away-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government could resolve it fairly easily.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You have not seen the real me either.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what was agreed to.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not hold up the business of the House for much longer, but I seek clarification.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Bill was passed in February 2018-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What was requested of the Government was that it allow a motion to be tabled in the Dáil to enable it, not a committee made up of Senators, to decide what should happen to the Bill.Senators do not have the right to block a Bill passed by the Dáil. We are asking for Government time, even without debate, for a motion to allow for a debate on the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking the Tánaiste.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, it is a matter for the Government.
