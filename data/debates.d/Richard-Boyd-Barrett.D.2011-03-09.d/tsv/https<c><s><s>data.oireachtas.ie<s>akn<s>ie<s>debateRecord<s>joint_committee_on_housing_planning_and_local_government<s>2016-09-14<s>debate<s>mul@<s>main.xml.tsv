RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will try to say one positive thing. I welcome the fact that there is a serious discussion about this crisis, albeit very belatedly for a crisis that has been building up for at least the past five or six years. There is a serious attempt to engage with it, but I am deeply sceptical about the capacity of this plan to deal with the scale of the problem. This is primarily because it relies overwhelmingly on the private sector to deliver public housing. I have read the Minister's plan in detail and in its graphs the biggest bar by a long mile is for HAP. The graphs make it clear that, for every single year of its projected delivery of social housing, the private sector is bigger than any other category of social housing. I do not believe that will happen. It may happen in some areas but in my area it will definitely not happen. I want to know what the Minister is going to do about areas such as Dún Laoghaire. Given the caps, even the increased ones, why on earth would a landlord who is charging €1,800 for a one-bedroom property and up to €2,500 for two or three bedrooms sign an arrangement with a local authority for much less than that? They are not doing this in any significant numbers, and when they do get involved they pull out just as quickly, as they did under the RAS scheme. The reliance on HAP, RAS or leasing arrangements with the private sector means the quality of social housing is being degraded. When a person gets a council house there are certain standards it will have had to meet and a clear line of accountability on the part of the housing department to maintain it and make sure it does not fall below standards, but that is not true with RAS. In RAS, if there is damp or there are other problems that the landlord should remedy, the tenant is immediately in a quandary. They do not know whether to raise the issue for fear the landlord will pull out of the deal and leave them homeless. That is the reality, because the relationship is not a direct one between the local authority and the tenant any more. Many tenants suffer in silence because they are afraid to point out problems of chronic damp lest they be flung out. I wish to ask a straight question on rapid build. The Minister said the procurement process for rolling out rapid build was not yet fully in place. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister seems to be indicating that the procurement process and other things are the biggest delays, other than the building time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is an immediate issue in Dún Laoghaire, where a Part 8 has been agreed. Clearly, the council wants a rapid build. I cannot see an argument as to why that should not be bricks and mortar. One could start a bricks-and-mortar project straight away and have something that is permanent, rather than having a 60-year lifespan, and an asset that is appreciating as opposed to degrading in value as is the case with a rapid build. Rapid builds are as expensive, so I do not see any advantage there. It is very telling-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to add to that. In the Part 8 for the project to which I refer, in an area which needs one-bedroom, three-bedroom and four-bedroom units and where most of the people on the priority emergency homeless list are those with a need for a unit with more than two bedrooms, every single unit has two bedrooms. It makes no sense. Why is that the case? Any sustainable development will have a mix, but this project is proceeding because it suits rapid build. We are not getting the quality of a sustainable community-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have had less time than any of the previous speakers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is another question. On the 10% and 20% allocation of private developments and so on, it is becoming very irritating. There is a large NAMA development in Dún Laoghaire, the second phase of which is going ahead. Building is taking place. When it sought planning permission, there was a 20% allocation for social housing, which is being built, but we will now only get 10% of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It got 20% of the previous phase.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It got 20% of the previous amount. The developer was in NAMA subsequently and there is no reason to believe that we could not get the 20%. The situation in Dún Laoghaire is chronic. I ask the Minister to use whatever influence or power he has to make sure we get the 20% that was originally earmarked and not just 10%. Why, as I understand it, is the breakdown on public land one third, one third and one third? I do not understand that. Surely it is more complicated.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked whether we were on pillar 1, 2, 3 or 4.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Houses are now being built which were originally supposed to be council houses. They could house homeless people who are on the housing list but will now be given to the private sector. Why?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is there-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I ask the Minister-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are not doing it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In my area, they are all two-bedroom units.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am saying that the logic of why the Minister is doing it is to facilitate the rapid build-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He should answer my question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister did not answer one of the key points I put to him on the issue of HAP and RAS and the fact that this is leading to a degrading of the quality of what is now called social housing. With a council house, there are standards and the council is directly responsible to uphold those standards and the tenant knows who to go to. With RAS or HAP, it is much more insecure because the landlord can pull out and the tenant is in a much worse position because if there are problems, and particularly when the rental situation is as bad as it is in Dublin, the tenant is terrified to go near the council or the landlord to say there is a problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am looking at pillar 1.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It refers to the HAP scheme.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is leading to homelessness, and in any event-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I certainly will, if I am not attending another committee meeting.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not finished.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Right. I am allowed to talk about rapid-build housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister did not answer the point I raised regarding rapid-build housing. I can only deal with the concrete reality. Plans are one thing, and they look lovely, but then the concrete reality emerges. The first rapid-build provision being pushed by a local authority proposes that they will all be two-bedroom units. The reason it is proposing that, even though what is needed is a much more diverse mix, is that it wants to deliver rapid-build units. If the proposal was for bricks-and-mortar buildings, we would have a mixed sustainable development, which would be good in the long term. The Minister said in his response that we want to have mixed provision, build better communities and all the rest of it, but there is a proposal to build a substandard community because of the prejudice towards rapid-build housing. If there was not such a prejudice towards rapid-build and we built bricks and mortar, which the people on the housing waiting list would prefer, we would have a mixed sustainable community. Therefore, what was said was wrong, and it is being driven by the prejudice towards rapid-build housing. The Minister said we could not have a carte blanche moratorium on evictions, because it is complicated and there are unintended consequences. Can he explain to me why that is the case?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why can we not have a moratorium on evictions in the current circumstances where there is an emergency? Reference was made to unintended consequences. The big consequence that is of significance and that is at the bottom of this emergency is that people are being put out of their homes. I am not that bothered about what other unintended consequences there might be if it stops people from being put out of their homes. To be put out of one's home is a disaster. Why can we not introduce a moratorium on evictions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What happens further down the line?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what we are talking about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what is happening in Dún Laoghaire.
