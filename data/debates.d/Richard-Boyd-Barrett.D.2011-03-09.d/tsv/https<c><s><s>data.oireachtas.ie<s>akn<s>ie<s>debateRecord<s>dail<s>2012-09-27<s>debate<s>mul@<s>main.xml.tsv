RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, should go. It is clear from the resignation of the former Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, that he did not have the trust and confidence of the person who worked most closely with him. It could not be more serious - a junior Minister has resigned over the manner in which the primary care centres were selected. The failure of the Minister to give his own Minister of State an adequate explanation as to the criteria used to select those extra 15 primary care centres is of grave concern. It indicates, as a certain Minister suggested at the weekend, the possible return of stroke politics. It is also difficult not to see a coincidence in the fact that two of the extra sites selected were in the Roscommon area, where the Fine Gael party has suffered so badly politically as a result of its move to close down the accident and emergency department in Roscommon hospital. Notwithstanding the differences some of us on this side of the House may have had with the former Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, she has shown real principle in resigning on this matter and in demanding transparency and accountability when important decisions must be made, such as selecting sites for primary care centres.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It should give pause for thought to the Labour Party as a whole that the situation has come to this. Does it really want to stay part of a Government in which one of its more senior figures no longer has confidence-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----or does it want to stand on its own political principles, in the tradition of James Connolly, with the working people of this country who are being slaughtered-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----by the cuts the Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, and this Government are imposing on them? The Labour Party should now think long and hard about whether it wants to remain in a Government of which one of its most senior figures has decided she can no longer be part.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise for my late arrival. I was delayed in traffic. I did not hear all of the debate on the amendments, but Deputy Joan Collins has informed me what has been said. If I understand it correctly, the Minister's point is that what we have been presented with in the Bill is a step forward in that the State will be able to take proceedings to vindicate the rights of the child and because provision is made for the voice of the child to be heard in such proceedings.That is a positive step forward but the point of our amendment - it was proposed to us by the Children's Rights Alliance and by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties - was that others should be in a position to take proceedings if they are of the view that the rights of the child are not being fully vindicated and the right of the child to be heard is not being fully vindicated. Why would we assume that the State will in all circumstances be the guardian of the common good? Others could be the guardian of the common good - representatives of the child, parents of the child - other people who are concerned for the rights of the child. Our amendment proposes that by removing that deletion it leaves it open - the State and others would be in a position to take proceedings to vindicate the rights of the child and ensure that the voice of the child is heard as far as practicable in any proceedings. I do not see why the Government or the Minister would have any difficulty with that. She may have said more in her earlier responses but to my mind it seems like this is very sensible amendment that strengthens the objectives of the amendment of the Constitution overall. I ask the Minister to consider accepting this amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My amendment is coming at exactly the same issue as Deputy Ó Caoláin's but with a slightly different approach. The substantial point is the same.The Government's proposal serves to limit the conditions in respect of which the voice of the child must be heard in proceedings. By prescribing the applicability of Article 42A.1 in this manner, the Minister is limiting its applicability to the State and excluding other proceedings that might be taken in the interests of vindicating the rights of the child and ensuring, in any such proceedings, that the voice of the child is heard. Our amendment proposes to remove this limitation by deleting the words "brought by the State, as guardian of the common good" from Article 42A.4.1 (ii). Article 42A.4.1 would thus read as follows:Provision shall be made by law that in the resolution of all proceedings—i for the purpose of preventing the safety and welfare of any child from being prejudicially affected, orii concerning the adoption, guardianship or custody of, or access to, any child,the best interests of the child shall be the paramount consideration. As I said, I do not understand why the limitation imposed by the reference to "brought by the State, as guardian of the common good" is required. As I understand it, its effect is to assume that the State is the only party which might take proceedings in the best interests of the child and the only party that might be concerned to ensure the voice of the child is heard. That is not the case. In fact, there could be situations where the State is the offending party. My amendment would ensure the imperative that the voice of the child is heard would also apply in the case of proceedings taken by other parties. I urge the Minister to take on board the substantial point Deputy Ó Caoláin and I are making in these amendments. I do not see any argument against our proposals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, are we coming to the conclusion of the Bill in its entirety or just of Committee Stage? Will there be an opportunity to summarise our positions on the Bill as a whole?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not reiterate my substantial points in regard to these amendments. I would be inclined to press them to a division because I have heard no convincing argument as to why we should not do so. Unfortunately, however, we do not have the numbers to proceed to a vote. It is for this reason that I am not pressing the matter to a vote. Any sensible person will support the proposed amendment and call for a "Yes" vote, because it is a positive step forward. However, I do not see why the Minister will not accept our proposals in order to ensure the imperative regarding the best interests of the child apply in respect of all parties and not just the State.While I do not wish to labour the point, I would press the amendment to a division if we had the numbers required. In that context, I will record my views by means of a voice vote.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no doubt that the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, her team and many of those who worked on bringing the Bill forward and getting it to the point where a referendum will be passed to enshrine the rights of children in the Constitution deserve congratulations and credit. I am happy to say as much not only here but during the course of the campaign. We should give credit where credit is due. In so far as we will be campaigning for a "Yes" vote in the referendum, we will say it is a positive development that the rights of the child are specifically and explicitly enshrined in the Constitution and that they will be prioritised in the consideration of difficult situations and in areas in which there might be a conflict between family rights, also enshrined in the Constitution, and the rights of the child. The removal of the impediment to married couples voluntarily giving their children up for adoption is sensible and overdue. All of these are positive changes. The fact that children's rights will be explicitly enshrined in the Constitution raises the bar generally for us and for society. They will feature in any matters that we are dealing with in terms of our society as a whole and the issues we confront, including economic and social issues. The question of children's rights and the welfare and protection of children will now feature more highly and the recognition of these rights will be an imperative for all of us when we try to deal with the difficult challenges that we face in our society. I have no difficulty in being positive about the Bill and the constitutional amendment and I do not imagine there will be any great difficulty getting it passed. However, we should not be too self-congratulatory. In so far as there will be a concern among the public, let us be honest about what that concern will be. The concern, which I share, is that it is all very well giving legal rights to children and having an aspiration to protect and vindicate the rights of children, but where are the resources to back this up? People will maintain that many of the resources that would protect children and prevent them and their families from getting into difficult circumstances in the first place are currently being taken away. No one will have to make this point to people because it will occur to them anyway. When special needs provision is being capped, when care allowances are being more tightly distributed or held back, when there are cuts in education, when there is a failure to deal with the housing crisis, when the incomes of the less well off are being further cut and when we fail to deal with unemployment, the rights of children - whatever we may say in the Constitution or in law - are in fact and in reality being undermined. This is what the people will say and this is what they believe. Deputy Buttimer can shake his head all he wishes, but the fact is that, although not exclusively, the vast majority of children who have suffered abuse, neglect, exploitation and whatever other misfortunes have been visited upon children over many decades in this State have been children of the less well off in society. That is a fact and it will continue to be a fact. We must deal with this fact and with the underlying causes, including neglect and abuse and the things that contribute to these - mental illness among parents, family breakdown and so on. Significant social and economic factors contribute to these things. These are not the only factors but they are the greatest contributing factors to such situations. While we are moving in a positive direction in a legislative sense and constitutionally with this Bill and with the amendment, in terms of practical policy we are moving in the opposite direction. We are undermining the supports and taking away the resources that would truly guarantee and vindicate the rights of children and their families, and instead, we are creating conditions which could lead more children and more families into trouble and difficulty. I am unsure whether the Minister has ever seen a brilliant and shocking film by Ken Loach called "Ladybird, Ladybird", which contains harrowing scenes in which social services take children away from a very poor and troubled woman. If parents are left in poverty and destitute and if they are not provided with the support they need, they and their children can get in trouble. Consequently, the State can come in and take their children away because they have failed in their duty. However, this is not because they wanted to fail or were destined to fail but because the resources were not available to allow them to do what they wanted to do or to act as the parents they wanted to be.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is what is in the Bill. My amendments were ruled out of order-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----as a potential charge on the Exchequer. Anyway, the substantial point remains that the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child includes social and economic rights.It is a disappointment that we could not have been more explicit in the Bill by including these rights in order that there was a legal and constitutional imperative to provide such things as housing, education at all levels-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----health care and the resources that would truly vindicate the rights of children. It is a mistake that the Government did not accept the amendments on the question of proceedings surrounding children.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In some of the most terrible cases, such as the Roscommon case or the Kilkenny case, there were many civilians who knew what was going on and that something should have been done, and such persons should have the right to take cases if the rights of a child are not being vindicated and in those cases where the best interests of the child and the voice of the child should be paramount and guaranteed. It is unfortunate that the Government has not strengthened this Bill, and the amendment, to ensure that anybody could take such proceedings if the rights of the child are not fully being protected and vindicated. I welcome the Bill. We will support the constitutional amendment. However, the Government could have gone further and in its policies over the coming months, it must do a great deal better in terms of providing the resources that can ensure the rights and protection of children.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There were very few rich people in the industrial schools.
