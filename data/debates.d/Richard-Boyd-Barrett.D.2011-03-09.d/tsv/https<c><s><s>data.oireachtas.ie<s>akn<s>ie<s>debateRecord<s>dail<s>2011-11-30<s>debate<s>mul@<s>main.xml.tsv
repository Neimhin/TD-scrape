RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That sounds a bit like gobbledegook to me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister speaks about this body and the other body being responsible, this report and so on.  On 24 October, there was serious flooding in 89 different locations in my area alone.  Hundreds of families saw their houses flooded.  For many of those families, it was a repeat episode of flooding.  It happened again, again and again.  The thrust of my question and the appeal of the residents in Blackrock, Monkstown, Stradbrook, Sallynoggin, Dalkey, Ballybrack and Dún Laoghaire — I am sure this is repeated all over the city — is that the State takes responsibility.How the Minister brings different Departments and the OPW together to sort this out is really up to the Government.  That is what the Government is there for, but it is clear that this is not just a natural disaster problem, but essentially the consequence of developers being allowed to run amok over the years, putting up developments willy nilly all over the place and not putting adequate water and drainage infrastructure in place.  Local authorities previously identified flood works that they knew had to be put in place, but they failed to do so over years and failed to require developers to put in proper water and drainage infrastructure.  This meant a disaster for people on 24 October, which was not the first time for many of them.  They cannot get insurance any longer and they quake in their boots every time the rain comes down.Money should be made available to carry out the water and drainage infrastructure work in flood black spots as a matter of urgency.  An insurance scheme should be put in place by the Government, so that people who cannot get insurance because they are repeat flood victims will be able to do so, and local authorities should be given the resources to do simple things like regularly clean out gullies, especially in flood black spots.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of course the State has responsibility to put in place proper water and drainage infrastructure.  I do not understand the Minister batting this off to the local authorities, as if he was disconnected from local authorities.Deputy Hogan is the Minister with overall responsibility for this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister make funds available to the local authorities to take urgent action to improve the infrastructure in flood black spots?  I realise this is not directly the responsibility of the Minister's Department but perhaps he could raise this issue.  For example, many people in Avondale Lawn in Blackrock are repeat flood victims.  The backs of their homes look like disaster areas or like a Hollywood disaster movie.  They have been informed that because of means testing they do not qualify for assistance under the €10 million scheme.  What help will be provided for them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They do not because they are repeat flood victims.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a matter of resources.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.  They are on the Order Paper.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister could elaborate on it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the fact the Minister stated he will examine the cases of people without insurance who have been refused assistance under the €10 million scheme.  I would appreciate if the Minister follows through on this and I will send on to him the details.  I appeal for some joined-up thinking rather than having the Office of Public Works here, a section of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government there and the local authorities elsewhere.  This has been a recurring crisis.  If it were a once-off matter I could understand the Minister's response.  Every time the rain comes down heavily people in these flood black spots begin to quake in their boots with fear because of the possible consequences.  There have been cases of flood waters mixed with sewage swilling through people's houses resulting in appalling damage but everyone is passing the buck.If we could move heaven and earth to provide bank guarantee schemes to cover the banks, could we not have some interdepartmental co-operation, pooling of resources and joined-up thinking to resolve the various issues arising for those affected by flooding?  For example, the local authorities claim that their responsibility is limited to clearing out blocked streams if they are in public ownership but that they have no responsibility if they are in private ownership.  That is a nonsense.  They have a responsibility to ensure there is no flooding.  I put it to the Minister that local authorities have responsibilities to their tenants but they are not discharging them and where people's houses are damaged they are refusing to carry out repairs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister put heads together with the Office of Public Works, local authorities and his political allies?  At a meeting on this issue on Monday his Fine Gael and Labour Party colleagues in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council refused to support a motion calling for action.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister put heads together from the various agencies and bodies to provide a comprehensive solution and the resources necessary to deal with the victims of repeat flooding?  The State has a responsibility for it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some people do not have access to it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough.  What about the insurance?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think the Minister understands the logic of my question.  At a rough calculation, based on questions I asked in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, the average rent is estimated at approximately €600 a month, approximately €7,000 a year per tenant, and this is in differential rent schemes.  Every year, we are spending approximately €500 million or more of public money in the form of rent allowance and it is going into the pockets of private landlords and developers, many of them are the very same developers who helped bankrupt this country.  If those tenants, who are all housing applicants, were to be housed by local authorities, we would save approximately €0.5 billion a year directly and we would accrue, I estimate, about another €0.5 billion in revenue to the State.  This is a no-brainer.  Why do we not do it?  We could move immediately in this direction by directly taking into local authority control empty housing and developments in the hands of the NAMA developers.  In addition, I do not understand the logic of ending the direct construction of social housing when it pays the State a return to have its own local authority housing and the revenue would return directly to the State.  Rent allowances or leasing arrangements would not then be required which subsidise private landlords and developers.  We could make €1 billion in savings a year if we did this so why is it not done?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That sounds good.  However, I may stand to be corrected but that does not seem to be the situation.  As I understand it, it is proposed to lease the NAMA properties from the developers.  These are developers who are bankrupt and whom we are bankrolling.  Why not just transfer the houses, once it has been ascertained that these are up to standard, directly into the hands of the local authorities and cut out the developers so that the rental revenue accrues directly to the State?  The cost of leasing from these private developers would be saved.  I do not understand why this appears to be the policy as enunciated in June of this year by the Government.  It says it is abandoning direct build, probably on the grounds that it does not have the money.  This, however, is an investment which guarantees a return in the form of the rental revenue.  It will pay for itself over the long term, both in terms of the money saved from not having to fork out rent allowance payments to private landlords and the rental revenue that will accrue.  Even the troika could see the logic of that.  I do not understand why the Government will not move in that direction, not to mention the jobs which would be created.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are all on the same side now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is speaking of socialism.
