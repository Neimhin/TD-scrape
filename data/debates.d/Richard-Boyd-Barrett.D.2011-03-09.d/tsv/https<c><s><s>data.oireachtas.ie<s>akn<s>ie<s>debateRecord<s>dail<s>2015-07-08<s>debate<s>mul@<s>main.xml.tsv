RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did we hear back from the Minister of State?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let me assure the Minister of State that we are not in any way being cynical for the sake of it. It is because the crisis we face is so serious and is set to get worse unless radical action is taken. The point I made and, as far as I am concerned, the point of this amendment is that if the local authorities are forced to levy themselves because they have not developed a particular site for social housing purposes, because they do not have the funding and they are not guaranteed the funding to develop that site from central government, they will have no choice - there will be at least significant pressure - but to sell that site or enter into public private partnerships, effectively privatising it or requiring some significant trade-off where public land is given over to private developers. That is back-door pressure for privatisation and it is the wrong way to go. I might be a little less anxious about this levy if the Minister of State stated that if a local authority came forward with a plan to develop any of its land, no matter how big those plans are and no matter how many of them there are, the Government would guarantee that the local authority would get the funding to develop those sites. For example, in my area there are 5,000 applicants on the housing list and if Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown came forward next year and stated it would build 5,000 houses on the land it has available, the Minister of State would give it the funding. However, in the absence of such a guarantee, which I do not believe the Minister of State will give, this is, at best, tokenism and, at worst, a pressure to privatise.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 3:In page 6, line 29, after "land" where it secondly occurs to insert "other than land owned by a housing authority".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us hear from the Minister of State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would be interested to hear more from the Deputies who tabled these amendments about the logic of them. Setting aside the debate we just had about the imposition of this levy on local authorities, with which we disagree for all of the reasons already discussed, the levy is not a bad idea. The conditions the Minister has attached to it are reasonable, although open to interpretation. Is there any area of the country that does not have a need for social housing at present? I cannot think of any. Perhaps there is. Certainly, in all of the urban centres there are ridiculously long waiting lists, of 18 years and rising in the case of Dún Laoghaire. Is there anywhere in the country where there is no waiting list? If that is the case, people would flock there from Dublin. While it is reasonable to be targeted, I do not fully understand some of the conditions the Minister has attached to it. However, the basic principle is not a bad one. An issue I wish to raise in the context of this group of amendments is one we discussed on Committee Stage. I did not submit an amendment because I am not sure how to go about it, but I raised it on that Stage and wish to raise it again. The Government has the resources to examine it and perhaps come forward with a proposal, even in the Seanad. The issue is privately owned dwellings that are empty. Quite correctly, the Minister has excluded private homes which are usually inhabited by the owners of those homes. That is entirely reasonable. Any measure we would wish to take would have to ensure that we do not end up seizing the homes of ordinary people. However, in other parts of Europe where a house is privately owned, is not inhabited for long periods of time and is just sitting empty, there are measures in place to take those properties and give them to people who need social housing. There should be a provision in this Bill to focus on this as well. We are not talking about sites suitable for the development of housing, but physical houses that are sitting empty for whatever reason and into which people could move. There would have to be a series of criteria around it so one does not end up unfairly targeting people who might have a legitimate reason for not inhabiting their house for periods of time. None the less, it would target the real phenomenon of houses simply sitting empty for years when people could be living in them. We need a provision in that area. Perhaps the Minister would address that and let us know if he intends to bring forward some type of amendment in that regard in the Seanad.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the same issue, the fear is that moneys that flow into the coffers of local authorities from the levy will be frittered away for other purposes. There is no guarantee this money will be used to contribute to the provision of additional social housing. The Minister of State was studied in his vagueness in answering the question. I ask him to provide a direct "Yes" or "No" answer to the following question. Will the money that accrues from the levy be ring-fenced specifically for social housing and must it be spent solely for the provision of social housing? We want a direct and clear answer to that question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked a very direct question and, yet again, got a very indirect answer or none at all. The question is: are local authorities required to spend the money on social housing or can they spend it on other things? That is what we want to know. As I understand the amendment, it states that we need to spend the money on social housing. I think the Minister of State has told us they can spend it on other stuff. Can he just clarify that? We cannot even vote on something unless we get a clear answer from the Minister of State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State did not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He should answer the question. Are the local authorities required to spend the money on social housing? "Yes" or "No."
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was. The Minister of State said they were allowed to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is allowed. So they are not required to do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So they are not required to spend the money on social housing. The Minister of State could just say that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Somebody asked why the Government would want to reduce the requirement for developers to reduce from 20% to 10% the level of development given over to social and affordable housing. I found part of the answer in the latest document from the European Commission, the post-programme surveillance report. It comments on the shocking rise in rents and so on and states: "Policies should aim to increase supply more effectively through raising low private sector financing to developers and revising planning and development regulations." That is, essentially, what the Government is doing and what its strategy involves. The Government opposes, on an ideological basis, large-scale public investment in the direct provision of local authority housing and has submitted itself to the diktat of the troika and the neoliberal ideologues in Europe. Therefore, public investment in the direct provision of local authority housing is not on because it is ideologically opposed to it and favours the privatisation of everything that moves. One is left with no option but to rely on the private sector to deliver social housing. As a result of the scale of the crisis, the Government has to pay some lip-service to a return to local authority housing provision. However, as I said yesterday, when I rang the alarm bills about a document that came from the Department of the then Minister of State, Deputy O'Sullivan, in 2011, I got very little traction. I do not know why, but I suspect it was because media commentators could not get their heads around the idea in 2011 that a housing crisis would be coming down the line. We had just come out of an enormous and unprecedented housing boom, so it probably seemed inconceivable to people who did not understand what was happening in regard to social housing lists that we would face what is now a catastrophic crisis.  I, and one or two others, tried to ring the alarm bells when the document was released. The Government said it would no longer be involved in the construction of direct social housing, but would instead source it from the private sector. As a result of the crisis that ensued from a policy decision taken by the Government, a situation that was bad turned to disaster, about that there is no question. We are no longer building council housing and are instead relying completely on the private sector. We have since seen the results. The homelessness rate is spiralling out of control. When I came into the Dáil, people were on the social housing lists for nine or ten years, which was outrageous. People would get on the list when their children were born and their children would be ten before they had secure housing. If one goes onto a housing list in Dún Laoghaire now - I know it is the same elsewhere - it will be 18 years before one gets a house. If ones goes on a housing list when one's child is born, he or she might have reached an age where he or she would be moving out and will have had no secure housing. The dramatic spike in the length of the housing lists happened because the Government made a bad situation a hell of a lot worse with a policy decision that was set out in clear and unambiguous terms in July 2011. For that alone, this Government should be flung out of office. It was incompetence on a scale that is quite staggering. Now, having made that catastrophic mistake, it is continuing along the same line by saying that it cannot or will not deliver social housing, therefore it will get down on bended knees, with the encouragement of the troika, to again incentivise private developers to deliver it for us.  Surely it is obvious, after what happened during the last boom, that even if the private sector builds the record levels of social housing it did during the boom, which were mentioned earlier on, when 70,000, 80,000 and 90,000 houses a year were built, the housing crisis will worsen.Every single year of the building boom the housing list got longer and the homelessness crisis got worse. If we wanted a textbook example of how the housing version of the trickle down just does not work, we have it in Ireland with the building boom. It just does not work, yet the Government wants to do it again. It wants to state it cannot, or will not, do this because the EU will not let it and it is submitting to it. In any event, it believes in the private sector anyway, even though we have the most clear evidence of the failure of this ideology and strategy in our very recent history but here we are doing it again, saying we must incentivise it. Then we have the troika. It is beyond belief these guys are pushing this stuff. I do not really care whether it is because the troika is pushing and the Government is submitting, or because they are all in cahoots in just believing in this stuff, but it is absolute madness. We have said we agree with the levy, but the truth is that levy is small beer really. We agree with it, but it will not really address the issue in a very substantial way. If property prices rise at the level at which they are at present, even the levy will not hurt the developers who are land-banking because they are sitting on a rapidly accumulating asset. The really substantial elements of the Bill are the reduction of the requirement for social and affordable housing from 20% to 10% and the issue of leasing. What will be the cumulative effect of this? To cut a long story short, the developers will not have to give 20% but will have to give 10%. However, they will not actually have to give the 10% because they can lease. They can discharge their obligation on social housing not by giving the housing to the local authority but by leasing it to the local authority and making a fortune on the rents they set, which will be controlled by a tiny oligarchy of huge owners of property. The other interesting thing in the EU Commission document is the comment made about the scale of the real estate investment trust, REIT, business, which is now €1.8 billion, so these guys control 1% of GDP. The document states REITs have become an important channel through which foreign capital can enter the Irish property market. So far, REITs have primarily focused on purchasing or refurbishing existing properties. How true it is that they are just interested in making money. They do not give a damn about providing social housing or providing the supply the people desperately need. They are just interested in making money out of it, yet we are getting down on our knees trying to incentivise these people. It is total madness. The points have been made, but we must ring the alarm bells. The people who said we are heading towards a disaster before the crash were told by one Taoiseach that they should go and commit suicide and that they were insane. It was only afterwards that it was said we should have listened a little more to these people whom Nyberg called contrarians. I can tell the Minister of State, and quite a few other people are saying it here, we are heading towards a disaster if the Government continues down this road. There needs to be a radical shift back towards the direct provision of local authority housing on a very large scale for obvious reasons for the people on the housing list but also for the sustainability and security of the economy as a whole. If we do not do this, we will pile up a massive problem. I have raised this with the Fiscal Advisory Council and it acknowledged we have a point on this. I do not see how, when the troika wants to push so hard on the question that we must keep public spending down and we are not allowed to have public spending, that it does not see the Government will continue to spend more for years and years to come, in a way that will suck money out of the Exchequer, by trying to deal with the social housing problem in this way. It is just billions and billions of euro and it is set to expand every year, going into the pockets of property developers and landlords. As a proportion of the overall social housing stock, it will increase exponentially as a result of what Government is doing. It potentially could bankrupt the State, that is how bad it is, when these people control the rental and property market to the extent they now do. It could actually bankrupt the State. The Government will not introduce rent controls, so there will be no mechanisms to control these guys. We will be utterly at their mercy and the housing crisis and homelessness crisis will be out of control. We are doing our best to ring the alarm bells. It would appear the Government is immune to it, but sooner or later this crisis will blow up in a very big way in all of our faces unless we radically change tack.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can help Deputy Coppinger on that one. In response to a recent question, the Minister of State informed us that 1,700 housing units are to be built in 100 separate projects across all 31 local authorities by the end of 2017. To put that in context, in my area alone, 1,200 people joined the list last year. They are joining the list at a rate of 100 per month. The figures are the same elsewhere. Not only will that not deal with the crisis, but based on those figures, it will be ten times worse by the end of 2017. In terms of Part V, the Minister of State says the Government estimates 4,000 additional units will be made available, although this is entirely conjectural because it is based on the private construction industry, over which we have no control and which even the European Commission says is not interested in building at the moment because it has a captive market in terms of buying up property that is already there and renting it out at massive prices. This is pathetic and I do not want to say that. For the sake of what I have to go through every Monday and Friday in my clinic and what so many others have to go through, I wish I could say there was something in this that gives me hope. People come in who are in absolute bits, faced with the possibility of homelessness. Landlords just announce they are putting up the rent and the tenants have nowhere to go. There is nowhere anywhere near the rent allowance caps and they just do not know what to do. They have been on the list for 18 years, they have kids who are sick and all the rest of it. I welcome the levy and the removal of the cash in lieu provision but it will not even come close to solving the problem and it will be counteracted by the renewed reliance on the private sector, which will make the problem worse.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have had a long debate on this matter. We have gone through the various arguments in great detail on Committee and Report Stages. The five amendments I have tabled and the amendments tabled by some other Deputies deal with the worst aspects of this Bill. We have argued at length about the big weaknesses in the Bill. There are one or two strengths as well. The get-out clauses and loopholes in this Bill will allow private developers to avoid providing the amount of social and affordable housing that is necessary to address the absolutely dire crisis in this area. All of the Government's efforts in this regard will come to nothing because of what it is proposing to do in this section of the Bill. Developers will no longer have to assign 20% of any development to social and affordable housing. Instead, they will be able to get out of having to meet the 10% level that the Government is now setting by opting to lease the property back to the council. They will keep the property. The tenants, the State and the wider public Exchequer will fork out money to them week after week and month after month. The gold mine we are opening up for developers will cost the State an absolute fortune at a time when rents are increasing. A tiny number of property developers and big property speculators control a vast amount of the property in this country. Indeed, the ownership of commercial residential property is now more concentrated in them than it was before the disastrous boom. We are going to be complete hostages to them, to such a degree that it could bankrupt the State. Rather than dealing with the social housing crisis, this measure will suck money out of the public coffers. That money could be used to deal with the social and affordable housing crisis in the permanent, serious and sustainable way in which it should be dealt with. The direct construction by the State of its own council houses would save us the money that would not have to go to private landlords and would generate rental revenue back for the State. It is beyond me that the Minister of State and his colleagues do not see the economic logic of such an approach, which also represents the best solution to deal with the housing crisis. I suggest the only explanation is that they are the hostages of these big developers, speculators and financial institutions and that the troika is backing all of this up. That is the purpose of this measure. The decision to give the developers a big get-out clause that will make a bad situation worse completely unwinds any possible progressive element in this Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Any good that is in this Bill is completely wiped out by these leasing provisions. This marks another fundamental watershed in this Government's gallop away from the principle of the provision of social housing by local authorities and towards outsourcing such provision to the private sector. When private developers build housing under this Bill, nothing at all - not 20% and not 10% - will have to be handed over to local authorities on a permanent basis. They will be able to engage in leasing to get out of their obligations. We will be paying them for years and years to come. It is a form of corporate welfare on a massive scale, as if we have not had enough corporate welfare in this country for the past 20 years. It will cost us an absolute fortune. The sky is literally the limit when one looks at where property prices and rental prices are going at the moment, and they will continue to go in that direction. It is not surprising that Fine Gael would do this, but it is shocking beyond belief that the Labour Party is a party to it. This is the beginning of the end of local authority housing. When we look at the figures for next year and the year after, we see that the number of actual real physical council houses that are going to be built is negligible. It is all rental accommodation scheme leasing and housing assistance payment scheme agreements. This is rotten stuff. It has to be opposed vigorously.
