RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are the figures from the EPA on our CO2 emissions not yet another damning indictment of the failure of this Government to take the issue of climate change seriously? Some 5 million tonnes of CO2 have been emitted above the required targets and this is the third year in a row that we have missed them. From the point of view of the public, crucially, we are now facing fines amounting to hundreds of millions of euro. That is money that could be spent on housing, health, education and actual climate measures. The Government is intending to make ordinary people pay for its policy failures on climate change with a punitive and regressive carbon tax. Even the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, stated that it is regressive. It will hit the poor and the less well off. The carbon tax has been in place for some years but has done nothing to reduce our carbon emissions. Do these figures not demonstrate that the Government is guilty of rampant climate hypocrisy? It has blocked Deputy Bríd Smith's Bill to keep fossil fuels in the ground, which was the central demand of the secondary school students who were on the streets seeking climate action. This week, the Government proposed to the EU that a liquid natural gas, LNG, terminal be built at Shannon to import, for decades to come, poisonous, toxic fracked gas from the United States. The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Creed, this week refused to take action against the beef barons on the issue of feedlots, which are the major culprit when it comes to emissions in agriculture. He also refused to act against the dairy barons while the poor small farmers, meanwhile, who are not guilty of climate sabotage, are being thrown under the bus with the Mercosur deal. That deal was agreed with the Brazilian president, Bolsonaro, who is burning down the rain forests that produce our oxygen and flooding Europe with cheap beef at the expense of small farmers. The Government is also allowing bus fares to increase, and they will increase further following the carbon tax increase, which it should be encouraging people to use public transport but this Government is privatising it. It also consistently fails to meet afforestation targets.  Why does the Government not listen to our proposals? We have been relentless in proposing to keep fossil fuels in the ground, stop the LNG terminal at Shannon bringing in fracked gas, get rid of fares on public transport and add 1,000 more buses to the national fleet to improve our public transport system. There should also be better grants to make it affordable for people to insulate their homes and enable them to reduce their energy usage and energy bills. Grants for small farmers should also be dramatically increased so that they can move away from environmentally-damaging agricultural activities and into afforestation. We have repeatedly asked the Government to do these things. All it wants to do, however, is tax ordinary people for its failure. Is that not climate hypocrisy and climate failure?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government's policy is always to make the little person pay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Whatever it is, be it water charges, property charges, parking charges or carbon taxes, the small person always pays-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----but the Government never asks the polluting corporations to pay. They get away scot-free. When they lobby the Government, it states it will block Deputy Bríd Smith's Bill to keep fossil fuels in the ground.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government states it will install a terminal that will lock us into the use of toxic fracked gas for decades to come at a time when, by the way, the British energy regulator has told the Government that it can use British gas up until 2035, by which time we should have reduced our use of that fossil fuel.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where are the grants to make it possible for somebody who needs to have his or her home insulated, who is living in a damp and cold home but does not have the money to insulate it? The Government wants to tax such a person because he or she does not have enough money to do the work.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government always blames the small person and never takes on the corporations. One hundred corporations are responsible for 70% of global emissions. Where are the taxes on them? Where are the penalties to make them change their behaviour? The carbon tax which has failed to reduce emissions to date is the only measure about which the Government talks. On everything else such as public transport, it privatises and lets fares to go up. It is not serious about tackling climate change. It is merely using it as an excuse to attack ordinary people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is still unaffordable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I pressed for this debate at the Business Committee because the massive overruns relating to the national children's hospital, involving hundreds of millions of euro of public money, and the resignation of the chief procurement officer from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board are examples of the substantial and important issues which have been overshadowed by the Dáil voting scandal. The latter involves many aspects, of course, and has, critically, called into question for many the integrity and credibility of the voting system and the House. While that needs to be investigated in and of itself, an unfortunate consequence is the overshadowing of the issues regarding the national children's hospital, which would otherwise have been at the top of the news agenda. They are issues of enormous national importance. The country has been scandalised by the level of the overruns which have seen the initial cost estimate of €500 million increase to €766 million, then to €983 million and on to €1.4 billion. There is now of a figure of €1.7 billion and suggestions that the cost will rise above €2 billion. This involves hundreds of millions of euro that could have been allocated to other things and overruns which may affect other vital health capital projects. Deputy Bríd Smith tells me that there are serious questions over primary care centres in her area in Drimnagh. While she is not certain about the centre's fate, it seems to no longer be on the capital programme on which it formerly appeared. She has asked questions but I do not know about it for certain. The point remains, however, that this is a great deal of money and people have been scandalised by it. Against that background, I find the response of the Taoiseach and the Minister on the resignation of the chief procurement officer incredible. The chief procurement officer, Mr. Quinn, was appointed by the Minister in 2013. It was a Government appointment and he was presumably given the position because of expertise in the area of public procurement. He was put in charge of the largest capital project in the history of the State and that project then spiralled out of control as a result of underestimates. We have had a damning report from PwC on how badly the project has been mishandled, how gross were the underestimates and how there was a failure to anticipate higher demands from contractors and so on. Against that background and rumours that the Taoiseach is briefing the Leader of the Opposition about possible further overruns because of further demands from contractors that could push it well above the already shocking current figure, the Minister says the resignation of the chief procurement officer is not a matter for comment. I find it unbelievable he does not think that this is news or that the Taoiseach could say it is a private matter and that it is nothing to do with him, so why on earth would he make a statement. That stretches credibility. Does the Minister accept that most people looking on and seeking transparency, clarity, answers and accountability with regard to the scandal involving this project will consider it odd that there has been yet another resignation of a key civil servant? He was not only responsible for public procurement on this project but was in charge of public procurement more generally, including €9 billion worth of procurement projects in the year he was appointed. Yet, there are no questions and no comment from the Minister and we are told this is not a subject of interest. It is, in fact, a subject of huge interest for the public and the Minister's answer is, frankly, unacceptable. The Taoiseach's approach is not acceptable. There must be a full explanation as to whether the resignation was linked to the continuing and likely increase in the cost overruns relating to the national children's hospital, which is already a major national scandal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am fairly stunned by the Minister's response.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Maybe I am missing something here. Does the Minister recognise that the public are appalled at the level of overruns with the children's hospital, the amount of money involved, the scale of the project and the damning criticism by PwC of the entire process? Against that background, does the Minister not understand why the public would be even a little concerned that someone who was appointed by the Government, who was the Government chief procurement officer and who was appointed to the board has resigned? The Government's attitude to him seems to be that he was simply appointed and sat on the board for several years when all these overruns arose and now there are suggestions there could be further overruns. The Minister is telling the Leader of the Opposition there might be further overruns but that his resignation is something we should not be concerned about. I find that a highly strange attitude. Does the Minister not understand why not only I but the public might think that is a particularly odd attitude to take given everything that is happening? The Minister is casually saying that this individual was on the board for several years but the Minister did not really know what he was doing and has not really talked to him since he resigned. It seems the Minister is not really that concerned about why he resigned. He seems to be suggesting it is normal for someone to step down. Is this not a little odd given the scale of the project, the importance of his role and the fear that there could be further overruns on this project?Does the Minister not think there should be a little more interest from the Government in Mr. Quinn's reasons for resigning? Should there not be a little bit more explanation, transparency and accountability? Does the Minister not think that is a reasonable thing to ask?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not a conspiracy theory.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister said that he had not talked to him.
