RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what the Government promised.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the banks? The Taoiseach needs to answer the question he was asked.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Like my colleagues, in all sincerity, I wish the Taoiseach and all other Deputies the best for Christmas and thank the staff for all their hard work. In doing so, I am acutely aware, as I am sure the Taoiseach is, that there are hundreds of thousands in this country who will not really be celebrating Christmas and for whom it will be a tough time, a trial, something to get through rather than enjoy. That is our responsibility, the Taoiseach's responsibility and the responsibility of European leaders. That brings me to what I see as something of a merry-go-round of European Council meetings that have gone on for the past two and a half years. Almost invariably, such meetings are accompanied by announcements of breakthroughs, triumphs and, famously, in June of last year, game-changers, but despite all the triumphalism, the critical issue of the significant odious debt mountain and the accompanying costs of paying off that debt, which was put on the backs of the Irish people, remains unresolved. As the Taoiseach will be aware, that cost is considerable. Our citizens, many of whom will suffer this Christmas, carry 40% of the cost of the European bank bailout, or €9,000 per citizen.That is a tough burden for anybody to carry. It is a gross injustice because we are not the ones primarily responsible for the crisis. We can argue about burden sharing and responsibility sharing but the vast majority of those citizens who will suffer this Christmas are not to blame for what happened, yet they are carrying the can. It has left us in a terrifying situation as an economy, with 120% debt, but if one takes a more accurate measure of our economy the percentage is 150% of GNP. Against that background, the Government has refused to demand, as we would like, or even to ask for a write-down of that debt, and now the promise that we got last June that there would be retrospective recapitalisation of the banks, which is not a write-down but the nearest thing to one that Europe seems to be talking about, appears to be disappearing into the fog of abandoned promises. I ask the Taoiseach how that can be allowed to happen. How can he let it happen, given the gross injustice that loading this debt onto the backs of citizens involves? It is irrefutable that this is an injustice. There is no way they can justify that level of disproportionate unloading of the cost of the European crisis onto the backs of our citizens.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should demand more. The Taoiseach might not want to go as far as I or others would go, but to let this drift on as another abandoned promise is not acceptable. That abandoned promise is now being replaced with the strategy for growth, as Deputy Collins pointed out. Let me acquaint the Taoiseach with a conundrum that he must understand.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, but this is what is replacing the necessary debt write-down.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are two lines in it and then we will move on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask that the Taoiseach let me finish; he will have a chance to respond. There are two lines in the document about that, but the approach is to let us forget about that and talk about growth.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We all want growth, but there is a conundrum: in order to make that debt sustainable we must have growth, but in order to have growth we have to get a break on the debt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One cannot have growth without a break on the debt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To follow that through, we should not pay out €9.1 billion in interest next year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It will kill us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It will make the level of growth that the Taoiseach is talking about impossible. He will have his chance to respond.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the Taoiseach's growth forecast in this strategy he has a baseline assumption of 2% growth and an optimistic scenario of 2.3%, but the ESRI has three scenarios. It has a stagnation scenario in which the debt issue is not resolved and the growth the Taoiseach hopes for in Europe does not materialise. Why is that stagnation scenario not set out, when IFAC and the troika have said that the downside risks are the greater risks? They have said on the record in the Department of Finance that those are the greater risks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Any objective analysis of the economic scenarios facing us would at least have indicated that this was a possibility. Instead, the Taoiseach has given us an aspiration which may materialise.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A suggestion I gave to the Taoiseach yesterday is that he should go to Europe tomorrow and say that instead of giving them €9 billion next year, we will hold €3 billion and use it to fund a major programme of social house building by the State-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Acting Chairman ask the Members opposite to stop interrupting me?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The building of social housing would house the people who have no roofs over their heads and will be homeless over Christmas. It is not funny.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would generate revenue for the State. It would save in terms of social welfare expenditure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would put people back to work. It would genuinely stimulate the economy and it would pay for itself. The Taoiseach knows the maths. We are paying out half a billion a year, €600 million if we include leasing arrangements to private landlords. That money will come back to the State and we would save money by putting construction workers back to work, allowing them to pay tax. We would save huge amounts in social welfare expenditure. Why can the Taoiseach not do that? Why can he not tell our European partners to do that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I cannot believe the Taoiseach is heckling me so much.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a suggestion for the Taoiseach. I suggest he does that because his policy is to give tax incentives to property speculators again. I cannot believe it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is causing a rent bubble in Dublin that is directly contributing to homelessness and is giving monopoly control over property in Dublin to big corporate speculators.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Frankly, it beggars belief. Lastly, I have a genuine request. Four hundred workers at Lufthansa are facing the loss of their jobs. Lufthansa is a German company and all the workers want is a fair redundancy package and for a €12 million deficit in their pension scheme to be filled by the company. It made €261 million in profits last year and it has massive accumulated profits. Will the Taoiseach ask Angela Merkel at the margins of the European Council meeting to put some pressure on Lufthansa to do a fair deal in order that those workers who face the loss of their jobs at least get a fair redundancy deal and have the deficit in their pension fund filled by Lufthansa, which is a very profitable company?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not heckle while the Minister of State is speaking.
