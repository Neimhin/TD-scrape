RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, is it that we are not getting to the other groupings?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not affect us. Workers have no country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We think people are entitled to have a Border poll if that is what they want. We have to listen to the people in the North as to whether that is what they want.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is called "consultation". It is called "listening to people". It is a legitimate question but it does not help when Deputy Adams mischaracterises the position of People Before Profit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He suggested we were opposed to a Border poll but we are not. It is one thing to have a Border poll but it is another thing to win it and there is no point in posturing about polls that one knows will not be won or will not even take place. James Connolly said the working class were the incorruptible fighters for Irish freedom. In saying this, he understood that unity meant having a consistent line of defending and promoting the interests of working class people North and South and needed to be built from below by winning over Protestant workers to a united fight against inequality North and South of the Border. Connolly was primarily an internationalist and his motivation was to break from empires, rather than siding with them or going into Government with people who were loyal to empires. If we want unity we should start not by looking for corporate tax reductions, which will only come at the expense of working class people, or having a race to the bottom in the area of pay for working class people but by siding consistently with working class people, North and South, in the fight against austerity and inequality.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister, who represents the constituency of Dún Laoghaire, will be acutely aware of the pressure on small and medium enterprises in Dún Laoghaire town and the huge number of businesses that have closed, leaving many shops vacant, which is a picture that is probably repeated in many towns around the country. While there are many factors involved, the most significant is the impact of large multinational retail chains on small business. Has the Government considered the introduction of a progressive rates system which essentially gives a break to small and medium enterprise and gives them a leg up in terms of the competition they face from large multinational companies? This is commonplace in places like France, Scotland and elsewhere.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are many facets to the difficulties that small enterprise in towns and villages face, including parking charges, planning issues and the impact of recession in terms of cuts to people's income and so on. A significant factor in this regard is the impact of large multinational retail chains. These chains are draining people away from the small retail businesses in towns and villages. I am proposing - as I did by way of motion to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, which was passed unanimously - that, as is done in many other European countries, we introduce a progressive rates system such that the small butcher, baker and candlestick maker pays a lower rate than the multinational chains, thereby giving small business a break. That is not a radical left proposal: it is just a practical proposal that should be taken up nationally. To me, it is crazy that a bank-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The rate can be set by the local authority but the system of rates is set nationally so this is the responsibility of the Government. I am asking for a change in the way we administer rates. In Scotland, rates were changed to give preferential rates to smaller businesses. A total of 60% or 70% of small businesses benefitted and got reduced rates as a result and it has helped reinvigorate small towns. This is a fairly standard policy in France, which is why its town and village centres sustain themselves far better than many of our town and village centres. I suggest that as part of this framework for supporting small and medium enterprises in towns, the Minister must think about a new rates system that distinguishes between a bank that might have the same square meterage but has massive profitability and turnover and a small flower shop or shoe shop. The Minister gets my point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A few weeks ago, the Government opposed an EU proposal to introduce public country-by- country reporting of corporation tax for large multinational companies on the spurious grounds of subsidiarity. Are we going to bring in public country-by-country reporting ourselves?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister may have heard this week that we are already paying a big price because of aggressive tax avoidance by multinational corporations. We will have to pay an extra €280 million to the EU this year because of the artificial inflation of the growth figures. Already, even before that, our contribution to the EU is grossly inflated and distorted because it is, in proportion to population, double that of countries such as Portugal and others due to the tax avoidance strategies of multinationals based in this country. It is in our interests to have public country-by-country reporting of the big multinational companies to stop them engaging in aggressive tax avoidance. Yet, incredibly, when offered the opportunity to do that by the European Union, we used the spurious excuse of subsidiarity to reject that proposal. What the Minister seems to be saying is that we cannot do it on our own. I agree with that, but why the hell did we not sign up to a pan-European proposal to do it, instead saying that we could not sign up to it because it infringes our sovereignty? It does not make any sense.
