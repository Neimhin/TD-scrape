RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the delegates for their presentations. As I was watching the proceedings on the monitor earlier, I caught their earlier contributions. It would take a lot on their part to convince me that there was a point in even looking at public private partnerships. Will they explain to me how under any circumstance it could be cheaper, faster and more efficient to go through what seems inevitably to be a more complex and cumbersome process in which we must involve private sector actors and their concerns about risk, the market and so on and essentially pander to them and de-risk things for them? Is it the job of the State to de-risk things for the private sector, as opposed to using our own money to build on land we own, taking out site costs or whatever one calls them, to provide houses at the cost needed, getting architects in to design them, putting infrastructure in place and then getting brickies, carpenters, electricians and the rest to go in and put them up? A building worker will say that if the basics are done, a house will be built in six weeks. Therefore, I do not understand how this just goes on and on. In that regard, I would like to ask about a specific site in Shanganagh. I understand various options being discussed for the site have been referred to the National Development Finance Agency because, inexplicably in my opinion, the council is required to look at a PPP. The elected councillors do not want one and I am absolutely certain the people of the area do not want one. They want public and affordable housing for people who are on the waiting list and those who are above the income thresholds to be included in the list and who cannot afford to buy in the private market. That is what they want. They want to be able to rent or buy in the private market. It seems that it is logically and obviously the case that it could be done as one big bundle. The councils could put the infrastructure in place and design the stuff themselves. Obviously, they can build at the lowest possible cost because they do not have to seek outside finance or borrow. We could use the State's own money and not borrow. There would be no risk involved because we know that there are plenty of people on the housing list to take the houses, as well as plenty of people who cannot buy in the private market and who would be jumping over one another to take a cost rental and affordable house. Is there any case in which the model I am setting out would be less efficient than all of the PPPs, with all of their complexities and all of the other considerations that necessarily must be included?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of course.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it the case not just in Shanganagh, although that is an example, that we have a requirement to look at all the different models? I do not see the logic, especially when Ms Bryce has more or less admitted that the PPP has a much longer timeline and that is because it is a more complicated process. I do not see the advantage of it and even less so given the point made about competition between the public and private sectors. There is limited capacity to build at the moment and I would have thought that the State must grab as much of that capacity as it possibly can, to produce affordable housing. The obvious danger with the private providers seeking the highest possible return is that like lemmings they will all go running after the highest return and after a certain point, because they are all looking for the same highest return, there is an oversupply in one part of the market and a chronic undersupply in another part of the market. There is some evidence that that is happening already. Some builders are building homes that nobody could ever afford to buy, or very soon the limited market that could afford houses for €800,000 or €900,000 will run out and we will have houses that cost that amount sitting empty when that building capacity should have been used to build houses that cost €200,000 or €300,000 and social housing. I know the NTMA witnesses cannot comment on the ideological debate but on a purely practical level, given the limited capacity they are talking about, I do not see why they would go for a more cumbersome complex process and want to include a sector that is taking risks, because given the urgency we cannot afford to take risks with limited capacity. I have one last question which I did not ask in my initial contribution, on which I invite the NTMA witnesses to comment. Do they have any role in Part 5?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	None at all.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to comment briefly on that point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked earlier if any of the witnesses were involved in Part V housing and I was told they were not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland involved in Part V projects?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The reason I ask is a concern prompted partly by the experience of Cherrywood and partly by recent comments by Mel Reynolds. Mr. Reynolds fears that the developers on many big private sites are in no hurry to build or may not have any interest in building. Therefore, we should take the Part V component as land upfront and build on it ourselves, which I would have thought would bring in the organisations represented here. Mr. Reynolds' argument was that this would be cheaper and the State would also control the timeline. That seems to be a very good suggestion in light of the number of sites on which we are hoping to secure Part V builds but the matter is completely in the hands of a private developer. In the case of Cherrywood, the developer has already flipped some of the land. We do not know what is going to happen there. If the State took its 10% upfront - I would like that percentage to increase to 20% or more - and started to build on it, that would move things forward. I do not know if the witnesses have any comment on that, but it seems to be a very sensible suggestion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In fairness, I am asking the witnesses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should take the 10% closest to the site entrance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are all on the same hymn sheet. I agree strongly with Dr. Hearne's narrative about the inefficiency, cost and viability of PPPs, or privatised forms of social housing delivery, being crazy from the point of view of trying to resolve the housing crisis. Instead, we need to move urgently towards the direct provision of public housing on public land. I am curious to know the delegates' opinions on what is happening in the private sector and its capacity to deliver. We have gone over how relying on the private sector to deliver public housing will cost us a fortune. On the leasing component, Dr. Hearne added to the facts we already knew. It is a stark figure, in that we could get four directly built council houses for the cost of leasing one for 25 years. He produced the staggering figure of in excess of €20 billion for the overall cost of the HAP scheme over a period of 35 years. That is a folly about which we have all talked a great deal and which we have contrasted with direct provision by council housing which is cheaper, faster, more efficient and better at every level. What we have not talked about enough - it is the matter on which I would like to get the delegates' opinion - is the question of where the private market is going. Aside from the cost issue, is the private market capable of delivering the housing the Government hopes it will? Mr. Mel Reynolds has made a convincing argument that, whatever we may think about the private market's capacity to deliver social housing - we do not think much of it - it may not be able to deliver any housing at all on the scale the Government imagines it will.This is because the costs for the private sector are now so high that it is becoming increasingly tenuous as to whether it is viable at all for the private sector to deliver. At some point, it will become very clear that is just not viable for the private sector, which is an even bigger reason to shift over to public sector provision. I am curious as to the thoughts of the witnesses on that, given it has already been said that an incredible 85% of the Rebuilding Ireland plan is dependent on private sector output, which is terrifying. Where we are heading is terrifying. Would the witnesses agree that we really have to start ringing the alarm bells on that front?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have to leave, unfortunately.
