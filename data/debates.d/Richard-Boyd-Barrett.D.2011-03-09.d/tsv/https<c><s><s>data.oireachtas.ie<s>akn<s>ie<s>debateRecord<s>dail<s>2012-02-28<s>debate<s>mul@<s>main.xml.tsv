RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not reasonable that the political parties registered in the Dáil should have a brief opportunity to come back on this, to reflect the full diversity of the Dáil?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Constitution has today forced the Taoiseach and his Government to hold a referendum on the brutal austerity agenda that it and our EU-IMF overlords have been inflicting on the people.  That has happened despite the Taoiseach's-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These are directly connected.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will explain if the Ceann Comhairle gives me a chance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That has happened despite his best efforts behind the backs of the people to avoid a referendum.  The question relating to Davos is whether the stock in trade of the Government is being two-faced and duplicitous when it comes to saying one thing to the people here and saying quite different things when talking to the high and mighty in Davos or in the European Union.  On the one hand the Taoiseach told the people here he did not blame them and that they were not responsible for the economic crisis.  Then he told people in Davos - in many cases precisely the people who helped cause the economic crisis and were guilty of all the greed he mentioned - that people went mad borrowing.  He did not say that some people went mad borrowing.  He did not say that a few super-rich people went mad borrowing.  He did not say that the cronies of Fianna Fáil went mad borrowing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He said that people went mad borrowing.  Is there not a consistency in the Taoiseach's behaviour which is that he says one thing to people abroad and a different thing to people here, whether it is on trying to avoid a referendum on the austerity treaty or on whom to put the blame for the current economic crisis?  Was it not a treacherous thing to say given that on that particular day an all-party delegation, including members of the Taoiseach's party, the Labour Party, the Fianna Fáil Party and Independents, made the case to the Bundestag finance committee that ordinary people in this country were not responsible for the economic crisis and that there should be debt relief?  On that very same day the Taoiseach made a statement to this-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----gang in Davos blaming ordinary people, fundamentally undermining our case to get a write-down on the debt that has been unloaded on the backs of ordinary people because of the gambling and speculating of international financial institutions and bankers in this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what ordinary people are feeling.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have been doing that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are not too happy in the Taoiseach's neck of the woods.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Public works programmes, as I have said many times.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government not responding to this matter?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With all due respect to the Minister of State, I am sorry that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, is not present because he will be taking the decision on the Providence Resources foreshore licence.  My appeal is to him in the first instance but also to the Government more generally to reject the Providence Resources foreshore licence application to drill for oil or gas in Dublin Bay.It has been suggested that those who are concerned or opposed to the drilling live in Dalkey and the immediate vicinity of the proposed drilling.  I want to emphasise that this is an issue for the whole of Dublin Bay and has wider national ramifications in terms of environmental, public consultation and planning issues, as well as the management of this country's natural resources.The proposed drilling is to take place 6 km off Dalkey.  Even Providence Resources admits there would be potential for oil spills.  The Government has to understand if there was an oil spill that close to the coast the whole of Dublin Bay would be contaminated within hours.  There would simply be no way to prevent the oil coming ashore.  As I understand it, it will not be the responsibility of Providence Resources to prevent that happening, rather it would be the Irish Coast Guard.  We would have no chance of stopping major contamination of the entirety of Dublin Bay, given the proximity of such oil drilling if the project goes into production as an oil well.That is a risk too far for Dublin Bay.  Any economic advantages that we might hope to derive from producing oil or gas would be completely outweighed by the environmental damage that would be done to one of the most important natural amenities in this country and the most important natural amenity in Dublin.  It could ruin tourism, the marine environment, our beaches and our natural heritage and do all sorts of damage which makes the risk too great to take.One might consider taking that risk if there was some significant economic advantage.  I would not take the risk, but some people who are desperate, given the current economic climate, might think it is a risk worth taking if the State got something back in terms of jobs and revenue.  Such is the licensing arrangement in this country that we will get virtually nothing back.The company is allowed to write off 25 years of previous losses and capital costs before tax kicks in on any profits it would make.  Given the fact that Providence Resources is partnered by an Malaysian multinational, there would also be the opportunity of transfer pricing of costs incurred elsewhere in the multinational which means that virtually nothing would come back to the State.  The only beneficiaries would be Providence Resources and a Malaysian multinational.In these circumstances, there is simply no case whatsoever for allowing drilling close to the coastline in Dublin Bay.  In Norway, no oil drilling takes place closer than 25 km to the coast.  Wherever there is oil drilling, there is a public inquiry.  The Government is refusing to grant a public inquiry on this licence.  In Norway, the state gets 70% of the profits and revenues from oil production, while we will get next to nothing.  I appeal to the Minister of State not to take risks with Dublin Bay, reject the foreshore license application and, at an absolute minimum, give us a public inquiry before any decision is made to grant such a licence.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is all too late.  Now is the time to act.  If Providence Resources discovers oil or gas in any significant quantities it is unprecedented for any company in that situation not to be allowed to go into production.  In reality, this matter will be decided on this application. Normally such applications are not allowed.Countries like Norway, where best practice is followed, simply do not allow drilling for oil or gas close to coastlines.  The public consultation process that went into this application was pathetic.  Providence Resources must have had years to prepare its application.  The public only found out about it because local residents groups in Dalkey, Protect Our Coast and Save Our Seafront, rang the alarm bells and public meetings were called at very short notice to inform people they needed to make submissions.It was only in the immediate area of Dalkey and Dún Laoghaire that people had time to do that.  People in Sandymount, Ringsend, Clontarf, Fairview and Greystones were not informed of the application even though they would be directly affected if there were any damaging environmental consequences.  For that reason, there should be a proper public inquiry so that every stakeholder and resident in the Dublin Bay area is given an opportunity to have his or her say.Best international practice is that one does not allow drilling so close to the coast.  There is always a public inquiry, drilling takes place at safe distances out at sea and the state gets a proper share of the revenues.  None of those criteria is in place.  Therefore, there is no reason to take this risk or allow the licence to proceed.  I appeal to the Government to reject the foreshore licences, establish rules that will safeguard our environment and have proper public consultation and management of natural resources in the future.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is because of us.
