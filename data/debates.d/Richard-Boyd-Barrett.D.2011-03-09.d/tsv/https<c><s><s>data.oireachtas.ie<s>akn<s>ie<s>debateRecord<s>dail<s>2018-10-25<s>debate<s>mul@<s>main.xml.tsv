RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The main path to emergency accommodation and homelessness, in which we see a shocking further increase today, is from the private rented sector. People are being made homeless by the private rented sector. From a macroeconomic point of view, never mind the humanitarian and social point of view, why is 80% of the housing plan dependent on the private rented sector? It is madness - social madness, economic madness and financial madness.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have no choice but to do everything we can to get people into accommodation other than hotels, hubs or the streets. Taken as a whole, 80% of Rebuilding Ireland is dependent on HAP, RAS and leasing and that is the problem. We do not know how much it will cost but some estimates are for between €20 billion and €30 billion in current expenditure over a 30-year period, for which we would get nothing. One estimate is for €1.7 billion per year which, over the period of a home mortgage of 30 years, would be some €30 billion. If we built homes, the upfront costs would be greater and we would need capital, which links to the argument about rainy day funds and strategic investment funds, but ultimately we would have an asset and revenue would be coming back in.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point I made is that the private rented sector is what is driving people into homelessness. The Minister says we are getting something back but we are getting back social housing that is not social housing. It is precarious and the landlord can pull out at any time. There is nothing in the HAP arrangement, which is the bulk of Rebuilding Ireland, that prevents landlords from pulling out, which they do. The people in hubs will be able to tell the Minister that they have been in and out of two or three RAS, HAP or private rented homes and are back in homelessness. To categorise this as social housing and call it part of a social housing plan is deceptive. One cannot hide the grim reality of what it means, which is record numbers of people in homelessness and huge numbers of people in a deeply precarious situation paying extortionate rents.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister will see that I am on the theme of housing, and the Minister's connection to it, with all my questions of both yesterday and today. The other side of the coin in regard to this housing and homelessness crisis is the lesser known fact that vast amounts of money are being made by corporate landlords and property speculators who are also availing of tax reliefs. The Minister cannot give me an answer to a question I have asked repeatedly as to how much tax is being forgone in section 110 tax relief. Given the obvious profit bonanza being enjoyed by property speculators and landlords, we need to look at whether we need to find new ways to tax this sector to give us more money to build social housing and other things we need in our economy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are talking about the likes of Lone Star, Kennedy Wilson, Cerberus, all these people with whom the Minister's Department, under the management of Deputy Noonan, had 65 meetings in 2013. They swooped in and bought huge amounts of land and property. They will, if I understand this correctly, continue to benefit from section 110 tax relief, which means that if they maintain their investments for a certain period - seven years, I think - they will pay no tax on the rental income or capital gains. Considering that rents have gone up 60% to 70% in that period and property prices have gone up by about a similar percentage, they are walking away with an obscene fortune. Making a distinction between a property and the loans used to purchase property is just semantics because that is what they do: they borrow money to get into Irish property or land and they can then write that off if they are a foreign investor and get massive tax relief. What is shocking is that the Minister cannot quantify it. There is the answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The 2017 figure is misleading because we are talking about the window between about 2012 and the point at which the change was made in 2016. It was in this period that NAMA flogged off most of its land and assets, about €40 billion worth. It was not the little accidental landlord buying the stuff from NAMA; it was Kennedy Wilson, Cerberus, Lone Star and all these big boys. They swooped in on Irish land and property assets. Did they solve the housing crisis, as Deputy Noonan predicted they would, and create a new professional landlord sector? That is what Deputy Noonan said at the time. Not at all. They sat on their assets and will get huge tax relief. In many cases they just sit on the land; in some cases they are sitting on empty property. I know of two such cases and have highlighted them twice in here. Cerberus and Apollo Global Management are trying to de-tenant property and are just sitting on perfectly good empty apartments because they are watching the value clock up and they know they will walk away without paying any tax.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It built the Beaumont Hospital extension and the Temple Street hospital extension.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was with Western Building Systems.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In 2011, several building workers took the trouble to join the Labour Party, specifically the branch of former Deputy Ruairí Quinn. For the next three or four years, they tried to impress on him the problems in the school buildings programme and, specifically, companies such as Western Building Systems. The workers described it as the "Wild West" and stated that some people on sites did not have a clue what they were doing, as well as highlighting that the required ties had not been installed. We are now discovering seven or eight years later that those ties are the most basic component in ensuring a wall stays together and does not fall down. Their claims were ignored by the former Deputy, Ruairí Quinn, and Deputy Alan Kelly. Prompted by the workers, I raised the matter in September of last year at which stage the then Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, who is sitting beside the Tánaiste, stated that he was confident that the problems identified in the schools were not widespread.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the Government going to do to bring forward a Bill on building controls and addressing the issue of bogus self-employment on building sites, which is directly connected------
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----to the catastrophe we are now facing in schools, as well as hospitals such as Beaumont and Temple Street hospitals?
