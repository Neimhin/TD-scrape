RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Facing into Ireland's Presidency the key issue facing the people of this country and those across Europe is what kind of Europe we will have and what the Government will do to shape the future direction of Europe.  The answer to the question as to what kind of Europe we should have is that we should have the sort of Europe the people want.  In recent days we have got very clear messages from the citizens of Europe about what sort of Europe they want.  In France, Greece, Holland and Austria and with mass protests in countries such as Spain and Portugal the message from the people of Europe is unmistakable.  They are saying that they want an end to a Europe which is characterised by brutal austerity being inflicted on ordinary families and citizens in order to bail out banks and speculators.  They want a Europe which prioritises jobs, economic growth, fairness and a decent standard of living for all.  They want a people's Europe.  Sadly all the evidence coming from the Government, Chancellor Merkel and the Government's new best pals in Fianna Fáil indicates that they are hell-bent on continuing to cling to the failed policies and the failed agenda for Europe that has led us to the catastrophic crisis that Europe now faces.  They are hell-bent on continuing to cling to the discredited policy of bailing out banks and speculators at all costs and at the expense of the welfare, jobs and hopes of ordinary citizens, sacrificing those things on the altar of banks and profit-hungry financial markets.Whatever fine words and high-flung rhetoric the Government may use in the run-in to or during the Presidency, its real agenda for Europe is contained in its commitment to the austerity treaty.  Under pressure from the people of Europe and the citizens of this country, it can repeat the words "growth" and "jobs" all it likes, but simply saying those words does not create jobs or growth.  A commitment to the fiscal austerity treaty is incompatible with any serious commitment to creating jobs and promoting growth in this country or across Europe.  All the evidence is clear on that matter.  The impact of austerity over the past four years has been disastrous and has failed to produce anything but greater levels of unemployment and deeper economic stagnation and recession.  It has had precisely that effect in this country.  At what point will the Taoiseach acknowledge that?The Taoiseach has accused us of fantasy economics in opposing the fiscal treaty and tried to claim that it is the Government that is being realistic and pragmatic.  However, the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council - set up by the IMF and not a left-wing think tank - has set out clearly the figures showing what will be required to meet the debt and deficit targets over the coming years.  Those figures make it clear that the Government would need to inflict a brutal level of cuts - billions of euro of cuts - for years if we sign up to this treaty.  An alarming graph in the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council's recent report shows what would happen if we miss our growth targets by even 1%.  It shows the Government would need to ratchet up the level of cuts from €8.6 billion over the next three years to more than €13 billion and all the signs are that the Government's growth projection targets will be missed by a very significant amount and are being downgraded.  Will the Government continue down a failed road or will it recognise what the people of Europe and this country want, which is to change tack, end the austerity agenda and put the jobs and welfare of citizens first?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister of State confirm what she just said because it was a pretty extraordinary statement?  Does she seriously suggest that if the people vote "No" to the fiscal austerity treaty, as we call it, the Government will still commit up to €11 billion to the ESM and ratify the treaty?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have the explanatory memorandum for the Bill and I will read it in case Minister of State has not done so.  It states, "Section 3 provides for payments to the ESM in respect of Ireland's contribution to the ESM's authorised capital stock to be paid out of the Central Fund.  This provision caps payment at €11,145,400,400".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will be on the hook for €11 billion.  Is the Minister of State seriously telling us that even if the people vote "No" to the fiscal treaty the Government will still pay this money to the ESM?  It is an extraordinary statement if it is true.The Minister of State and the Government keep repeating that they are in favour of jobs and growth.  Will the Minister of State tell us specifically what she is speaking about in terms of a stimulus for jobs and economic growth?  Economist after economist, including Martin Wolf in The Irish Times today, state if we sign up to the provisions of the fiscal treaty it will rule out any substantial or meaningful financial stimulus and that all that will be available to governments are what are called “structural reforms”, which are more privatisation, property charges, water charges and downward pressure on wages and conditions for workers and workers’ rights because they will have given away the option of financial stimulus by signing up to the targets of the fiscal treaty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do not interrupt me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will you stop her from interrupting me?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State said there are certain optimistic economic projections for growth which means our worst case scenarios are not likely to be borne out.  Will she explain why the Fiscal Advisory Council suggests if we are even 1% off on our growth forecasts over the next three years, and all of the forecasts and commentary suggests we may well be, instead of having to have €8.6 billion of cuts over the next three years we will need €13 billion in cuts?  How the hell can we promote jobs and economic growth if, as is looking very likely, we are significantly off on the growth forecast?To meet those debt targets we will have to reduce our debt by half.  Just under half of our national debt is bank related debt.  Is it not true that what the treaty actually requires is that over a 20 year period we will be forced to pay off the bankers' portion of the national debt?  That is what it will require us to do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where is the growth?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It will be our fault not the Government's.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All the highly paid corporate executives.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are overpaid corporate executives and do not pay tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what it is doing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked a question about specific proposals for jobs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First, this issue is not being debated in the House this evening because of the actions of the Technical Group, Independent Members or the United Left Alliance.  It is being debated because of the tremendous commitment, bravery and determination of the families themselves and their concern to vindicate the rights and needs of their children.  The Technical Group Members are merely acting as their agents in bringing forward these issues.  I pay tribute to the DCA Warriors and all the other families of children with disability and special needs who have forced this issue onto the agenda.  Above all, I urge them to keep going, to keep protesting and to keep fighting.I was extremely disappointed both by the Minister's speech last night and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, this evening because there has been virtually no acknowledgement of the desperation, frustration and anger being felt by the families of children with disability and special needs, which have forced this issue onto the agenda.  As Deputy Donnelly noted, the Government amendment is disappointing and frankly disingenuous in the extreme.  It implies there really is not a problem, more money is being spent, more people are in receipt of domiciliary care allowance, DCA, and while everything really is fine, the Government will have a review and will have a look at the issue.  This is not good enough and it is particularly disappointing that the Government quoted figures on the absolute numbers of people in receipt of DCA and the absolute quantum of money that is spent.  That is the oldest trick in the book, namely, covering up something of which the Minister of State is well aware.  Moreover, it leads me to believe the Government is being disingenuous on the issue because the reason more people are in receipt of DCA and more has been spent is that each year, 10,000 additional children reach school age.  As Ireland has a demographic bubble of young people coming online, therefore the demand for DCA and other supports for children with disability and special needs is increasing.However, this simply is not the issue Members on this side have raised.  The issue is whether there is a bureaucratic and cost-cutting approach to dealing with people who make applications for DCA and other supports for their children.  Members, and most importantly the parents, are asking whether a stealth cut has been instructed politically from the top but which has not been announced.  I refer to a bureaucratic cost-cutting measure in which people who make applications for DCA are being treated in a callous, brutal, humiliating and inhuman way when they seek supports they need, deserve and should have.  Is it the case they are being put unnecessarily through further hardship, stress and humiliation because of a political decision to tighten up, cut back or to have a bureaucratic and cost-cutting approach to dealing with human beings and families who have special needs, are vulnerable and who need support, not hardship?  Moreover, the figures bear this out.  The point being made is that in 2009, only 25% of those who applied felt the need to appeal while in 2011, some 50% did so.  The number of people who were forced to appeal has doubled in two years and has increased significantly since this Administration came to office.  When one then discovers that 50% of those who then go through the arduous and difficult process of appealing actually succeed, this means that huge numbers of families are being put through such hardship unnecessarily.  They should not have been forced to appeal in the first place.  They needed the support but did not get it because they were dealt with badly.  This is the issue and it is not addressed or acknowledged in any way by the Government amendment.  As a result, families are being put through this additional hardship and humiliation, as well as the additional expense of being obliged to gather evidence to make the appeal.  Moreover, people are being contacted in the context of reviews and are being asked questions like whether their child is cured even when the child in question has permanent disabilities.  This is an unbelievable situation.I will turn to what is being sought in the motion, by Members on this side and, most importantly, by the parents and families.  While the Government should carry out a review, for which there is an urgent need, it should be real and the stakeholders, that is, the families themselves and the organisations representing them, must be absolutely central to such a review.  However, there is no need to await the outcome of such a review to take action.  Nothing in the Technical Group's motion could not be acted upon immediately by the Government, while still carrying out its review to improve the position even further.  The Government could take action right now to alleviate the unnecessary hardship and suffering that vulnerable families and their children are being put through.  I disagree slightly with Deputy Donnelly on the question of who is responsible.  There is an old saying that the fish rots from the head and the buck stops with those at the top, namely, the Ministers and Government.  I believe this is part of cost-cutting by tightening up instructions.  In addition, instructions appear to have been issued either formally or informally to those working in the public health services that they no longer are allowed explicitly to recommend that people get DCA and other such supports.  This appears to me like pressure for cutbacks in order to justify them.  In addition, the savage staff cuts in the public service must explain the dramatic increase in outstanding appeals.  Why has the number of outstanding appeals risen from one in 2009 to 900 in 2011?  This unquestionably pertains to cutbacks.  The Technical Group's request is very simple and the Minister of State should accede to it.  If there is serious evidence from social workers or GPs that a child has needs over and above those of a child of the same age without a disability, this simply should be accepted.  One can decide immediately there will be no reviews of those who have permanent disabilities, for whom no such review ever would be necessary.The Government can also ensure that people do not have to wait 38 weeks for appeals and that resources are provided to ensure this do not happen.  It can do this immediately, following which it can have its review to make the situation even better.  I appeal to the Minister to do so.
