RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have two questions. The Harbours Bill 2015, that was passed shortly before the dissolution of the previous Dáil, allowed for the Minister to make decisions about the status of particular harbours. This morning I heard an alarming report that a decision has been made regarding Dún Laoghaire harbour to establish a new quango. The House should be informed of such a decision on foot of the Act, if it has been made by either the outgoing or incoming Minister. According to the due diligence report I got this morning a decision has been made. We were informed by the previous Minister that this report would form the basis of any decision and is now available to county managers although it has not been made available to any public representative, either here in the Dáil or in local authorities affected by these decisions. That is completely unacceptable. I want to ask the Minister has a decision been made and will it be brought to this House. With regard to the Payment of Wages Acts 1979 and 1991 and legislation dealing with public procurement, we have learnt in the past few days that the company Transdev is planning to dock wages for hours worked from Luas workers, which is a breach of these Acts, and to interfere with their sick pay entitlements, which is also in defiance of the Acts. We have heard that Transdev is bidding for bus routes but no company engaged in breaches of the law should be allowed even bid for public contracts. Is the Tánaiste aware of these breaches and does she believe that this necessitates a strengthening of the Payment of Wages Acts and other legislation dealing with outsourcing and public procurement?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was not my question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First of all, I welcome the chance to discuss the issue of Dáil reform and make some comments about the wider need and popular thirst for political reform. This is at least a step towards addressing that concern. I pay tribute to the members of the committee who, by all accounts, have worked well together, not withstanding the differences of opinion that they have, in trying to make this Dáil function in a better way. Some people are sceptical about what is being described as the new politics. Interestingly, the most sceptical people I have met are those in the media, who do not believe for a minute that there can be a new politics but believe that everything will revert to type sooner or later. While I believe there are fundamental policy and ideological differences between many of us on key issues of policy, that does not mean that it is impossible for us to move from the politics of being adversarial for its own sake to beginning to discuss policy and try to solve problems in a serious way and, where necessary, debate genuinely held differences of outlook, philosophy, policy or whatever, and let the public decide on those. I hope all of these measures will move us in this direction. Like others, I want to pay tribute to the staff who are involved in trying to collate all of the opinions on this and work it into a new system for organising the Dáil. I also pay tribute to the new Ceann Comhairle, who has played a very active and genuine role in trying to move this forward. Before I get into the specific measures proposed, I want to make a general point. There were probably two things that in general terms drove the political and electoral choices that people made in the last election. One was the consequences of the economic crash, namely, austerity and the anger at the injustice and inequality of it, which was reflected in a fairly substantial, arguably historic, change in the balance of power in the Parliament. The other factor, as well as economic and social concerns, was the question of democracy. It was most popularly expressed in the idea of, and the anger directed against, the fact that people could make promises prior to elections and then do something completely different when they got in here. This has begun to be reflected in a whole series of civil society-led initiatives calling for radical democratic reform, most notably the One Year Initiative, which calls for citizen-led referendums and provision for a certain number of citizens to be able to require the Dáil to hold referenda on issues about which enough people feel strongly. The idea is that people could petition in sufficient numbers for popularly inspired or people-inspired legislation and force us to address certain legislative proposals that would come from the people themselves. That idea of a direct and participatory democracy, which is not just about an election every five years but about an ongoing engagement between the people and the House of representatives, is something that we really must consider. This leads me to another point about democracy. Here I quote a brilliant pamphlet James Connolly wrote in 1910 which should inform all of our attitudes towards democracy. I will read just a few parts of it. I cannot read it all because it is a brilliant but reasonably lengthy piece. Connolly said: All hail...to the mob, the incarnation of progress! In [its] civilising...work the mob had at all times to meet and master the hatred and opposition of kings and nobles; ...there is not in history a record of any movement for abolishing of torture, preventing war, establishing popular suffrage, or shortening the hours of labour led by the hierarchy. In the course of [its] upward march the mob has transformed and humanised the world. It has abolished religious persecution and imposed toleration upon the bigots of all creeds; it has established the value of human life.The rest of it, by the way, is brilliant as well. The pamphlet turns the popular - I would say the conventional - conception of politics on its head. It puts it the right way up, that it is the people who drive change and always have, and people elected to this House - all of us - need a bit of humility about that fact. The words "Teachta Dála" mean-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what we should be. I thank the Deputy for the translation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We must take extremely seriously that we are messengers. We are not rulers; we are the messengers of the people, and we must have faith and belief in the wisdom and power of the people to bring change, as has always been the case, as Connolly mentioned. This is absolutely true about the recent election. To my mind, there is no doubt whatsoever that the changed political landscape in here has to do with a level of popular mobilisation and politicisation of the public. There has been nothing in my experience like the level of political sophistication across the public that we have now, and that is a very good thing. The days when anybody could pull the wool over the public's eyes with rhetoric or spin about what he or she does are coming to a close. People are engaging. They are discerning and sophisticated in their understanding of what we do in here, and that is very much to be welcomed. The logic in the long run of this is a much more thoroughgoing democracy that involves direct and participatory democracy and measures like, as Deputy Paul Murphy mentioned, the right of the people to recall Deputies if they do not discharge the mandate given to them during an election. We need to move in that direction. The specific measures proposed are generally all positive. The new business committee, which will allow the parties to discuss and have an input into the ordering of Government business, is a very positive development. Similarly, the new budget oversight committee and, connected to it, the independent budgetary office could be potentially very good. They would give all parties, those in opposition and in government, serious input into the budgetary process and, hopefully, in line with what I said earlier an opportunity for the public to engage in a serious way with what we do in the process of putting together the budget and to influence our priorities.Although this is an improvement, I agree with earlier comments on the question of the Opposition still not being able to put forward proposals that involve a charge on the State as being problematic. Notwithstanding the constitutional limitations there, we need to push that envelop as far as we can so that there is that opportunity to put forward suggestions on tax and revenue raising and other matters that could be a charge on the State. There was nothing more frustrating for me in the past five years than when proposals of that sort were ruled out of order. The pre-legislative stage is positive and can potentially offer the opportunity for the public to engage more in the process of putting together policy and legislation and for us to be conduits for the public to engage in that process. The abstention proposal is positive for reasons that have already been outlined. It creates the possibility at least for everything not to be adversarial where there is not a necessity for that. Regularly, there are Bills where one might agree with some elements of them while disagreeing with others. I sometimes think the Government has done that deliberately in order to make it difficult for the Opposition to say it opposes one aspect but not another and try to put members of the Opposition in a difficult position of having to be in favour or against, even though they have mixed views on the legislation. Hopefully, that can change. I raise a couple of questions about some aspects of the reforms that I generally welcome. The issue of Leaders' Questions highlighted by Deputy Ó Snodaigh is potentially problematic. On one level, proportionality is important but it is a problem if we have groups having multiple Leaders' Questions on the same day as a result of proportionality. We have never had that. It does not make a great deal of sense, particularly when it will be the case that as a result others, either in the smaller groups or in the technical groups that are likely to be formed, may not get a chance even in the entire week to make a comment on issues of important topical interest. We need to look at that. Fairness requires that groups, such as Fianna Fáil, which is bigger proportionally, should have a bigger share of these but reflecting the diversity of the Dáil also requires a little rebalancing of that to ensure all voices at least get some chance in any given week to contribute to those leaders' debates. I would also make a point about Taoiseach's Questions, which has not been touched on at all. Taoiseach's Questions has to change. It is crazy. Often these are not questions and they go on for too long and the answers are nothing but exercises in winding down the clock. There can be answers of up to 15 and 16 minutes for questions. That is bonkers. To be honest, it takes completely from the value of Taoiseach's Questions, which could be a valuable exercise, for it to merely be an exercise in rambling and - what is that expression for just talking to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Filibustering. There should be time limits put on-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does but Taoiseach's Questions was an exercise in serious filibustering on the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe's, side as well. Let us do something about that. All of this democratic reform can be undermined by what is going on in Europe at present and the control that the banks and the financial institutions, which the ECB is acting as a conduit for, wield can circumscribe and undermine our ability to function in any sort of democratic way. This was summed up by Trichet's incredible threat, which people really need to think about, to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, at the beginning of the previous Dáil where he stated that if there was any attempt to burn bondholders, he would let off a financial bomb in Dublin. Let us think about the use of that language. It is not hyperbole to describe that as economic terrorism, that a bomb would go off if one democratically decides to do something the people have asked for, want and have an entitlement to and if that is what the popular will is. We have to seriously address the question of an unelected economic power or unelected financial institutions dictating to democratically elected parliaments.
