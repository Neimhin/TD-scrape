RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are two commitments in the programme for Government which the Government has abandoned or completely failed to deliver on, the first of which, following on from Deputy Joe Higgins' question, is in the area of transparency and accountability. The democratic revolution, with a new openness and transparency, was central to the programme, as well as the Taoiseach’s speech when he was nominated for office. Last week we had the debacle over Irish Water, with the gross, obscene pay-out to private consultants, as well as the high salaries of its executives, and with the obscenity ongoing in the Central Remedial Clinic, with cronies of the former Fianna Fáil Government and the Bertie Ahern Drumcondra mafia. Can the Taoiseach, with a straight face, forgive the public for thinking the commitment to transparency and accountability has actually turned into a turf war between the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael mafias of cronies fighting over the spoils, while ordinary people are hammered by cuts, unemployment and poverty? They are struggling, while there is a feeding frenzy among the pigs at the trough of public moneys. Much of this has to do with the persistence of quangos and corporate subsidiaries such as Irish Water and other semi-State bodies which are at one remove from government responsibility and accountability. The Taoiseach is doing nothing about this. In fact, he is doing the opposite by continuing to set up these quangos from which we cannot get accurate information on what is going on in their areas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be brief. The Taoiseach committed in the programme for Government to end homelessness by 2016. He has failed abysmally on this commitment. The levels of homelessness have not improved one iota but are getting worse, facts confirmed by all agencies and individuals dealing with the problem, including Fr. Peter McVerry. What does the Taoiseach have to say about this? Far from delivering on his promise to eradicate homelessness, the Taoiseach’s policies, cutting of rent allowances and failure to deliver social housing have actually worsened the homelessness crisis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I would like to know much the individuals were paid.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I referred to the transparency and accountability elements.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Consistency is a good thing, not a bad thing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Direct-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do we know the hourly rates of the consultants? One hundred euro an hour.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Because council houses are not being built.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Because the housing list is 14 years long.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would welcome this as soon as possible.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government should build a few council houses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I endorse the call for a debate on the North because there are many issues and we need some kind of regular space to discuss these. While we all want to see greater levels of all-Ireland co-operation and common work North and South, there are worrying signs that we are co-operating or echoing one another in the wrong areas. Last week, in the Royal Victoria Hospital there was a trolley crisis, with 46 people on trolleys. People before Profit representatives in Belfast tell me that is as a direct result of the closure of the city hospital. This parallels what is happening here, with the resurgence in the trolley crisis because, as a doctor from St. Vincent's said recently, of the closure of the 24 hour accident and emergency facility in Loughlinstown. This is a worrying sign of us co-operating and adopting common policies in the wrong areas and of applying austerity and cutbacks in a way that is detrimental to public services. This ultimately fuels the sectarian conflict, as different communities struggle and compete with one another for ever reducing resources.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sometimes it is sad when one's predictions are dramatically confirmed. The prediction made by those of us who opposed the Lisbon and Nice treaties and the Iraq war that Europe was moving towards becoming a corporate, militarised, imperial power - to use what some might consider the archaic language of the left - is dramatically confirmed by this European Council meeting. There is a huge irony with regard to arguments that were used by Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party during debates on the Lisbon treaty. They argued that we must support Europe because the European project will prevent a repeat of the horrors of the First and Second World Wars. They said the European Union was a project of European co-operation, bringing peace to Europe and ensuring those horrors could never happen again. Yes, I understand - the way to prevent the horrors that we saw in the First World War, when big powers sent millions of people out to slaughter one another so that those powers could control resources and colonies, repeated again in the Second World War, is to develop a European arms industry, to produce drones and weapons of mass destruction and to gear the European Union up for military actions outside its territory. That is Orwellian doublethink if ever I saw it. One reads in the communiqué that the Council "laments" the fact defence budgets in Europe are "constrained". There are many things to lament in Europe and there are a hell of a lot of things that are constrained, including budgets for health, education and economic stimulation to provide employment for our young people. Something that is not lamentable, however, is constrained defence budgets, particularly if the European Union is supposed to be about promoting peace and international solidarity. We should be delighted and should be seeking to reduce the defence budgets further and to redeploy those resources into areas that actually improve the lives of ordinary citizens. We should not be developing ever more sophisticated ways of killing people, but that is what the European arms industry is about. The latest fad among big Western powers and the European Union, in terms of sophisticated weapons to kill people, is the drone. Tragically, the Irish Government has embraced the new European enthusiasm for drones. These disgusting weapons are manless machines which wreak death and destruction at the push of a button by people on the other side of the world on innocent people in some of the poorest countries in the world, including Pakistan and Afghanistan. One would not see it in a bad James Bond movie in which characters are dreamed up who are bent on world domination and who inflict untold horrors on ordinary people. That is what these drones do and the Irish Government is now buying drones from Israel. I would like the Minister of State to outline the extent to which Israel is involved in this new European drive towards greater militarisation and more co-operation with NATO. It is unbelievable that we are buying drones from Israel, a country involved in systematic and ongoing violation of human rights, which has been condemned by just about every humanitarian organisation in the world for its use of vile weapons, including chemical weapons, against the Palestinian population. The Irish Government is buying drones from Israel and the European Union is integrating Israel's military-industrial complex into the new European military-industrial complex to provide the base for creating a European army - to fight whom? Margaretta D'Arcy is an artist, a writer, a member of Aosdána, a pensioner, a Parkinson's disease sufferer and a peace activist. She has been protesting against the use of Shannon Airport to facilitate the illegal rendition programme of kidnapping and torture being conducted by the CIA. She has opposed the use of the airport as a stop-off point for American planes on their way to bomb people in Afghanistan and, previously, in Iraq. She is now languishing in jail, and meanwhile the Taoiseach swans off to the European Council and supports the militarisation of Europe.Last week he was in the United Arab Emirates, hobnobbing with the brutal dictators of the gulf states, cementing trade deals with people who did not allow democracy, who cut off the heads of their political opponents and denied every basic human and civil right. They are vile regimes. We have also cemented new trade deals with the Chinese dictatorship. That is what we now do - we consort with and celebrate our new arrangements with dictators - and we are supposed to applaud this, while a peace activist, writer and an artist languishes in jail because out of good conscience she said a neutral country should not participate in or in any way facilitate a military machine or a programme of kidnapping and torture, something that has been well documented by international human rights organisations, while we say nothing. Is that the type of society we promote? We do not even raise issues, as commented on by some members of the media when the Taoiseach was in the United Arab Emirates. They asked why he had not raised the issue of human rights. He was told it was not the time or place to do this; it was just business. If business means ignoring human rights, dictatorships and regimes that use violence, we will not say a word and, in fact, will emulate them. We will do the same in Europe, as Romano Prodi put it a number of years ago in a rare moment of honesty - to fight the resource wars of the 21st century, just like we had resource wars at the beginning of the 20th century and again between 1939 and 1945. It is absolutely despicable. The ordinary citizens of Europe pay the price, with 20 million unemployed, public services being decimated by cuts and austerity, while the corporate, military, industrial complex is protected by the powers that be, aided and abetted by the Fine Gael and Labour Party Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Direct answers to my questions would be very much appreciated. Does the Minister of State believe it is acceptable that the European Union is purchasing military hardware, including drones, from Israel, given its appalling human rights record? For that matter, does he believe it is acceptable that the Israeli military-industrial complex is being integrated into this European drive towards militarism? On the point about fortress Europe and immigrants, particularly after the Lampedusa tragedy, was there further discussion on the proposal floating around that Frontex, a private EU security border company which patrols for profit, be given some of the responsibility for enforcing border controls to prevent poor migrants from north Africa and elsewhere getting into Europe? Does the Minister of State believe Ireland should be associated with a European Council meeting, at which these matters were discussed, that was preceded by an address by the Secretary General of NATO, a nuclear military alliance? It is clear from the succession of events that when NATO tells the European Union what it wants, it gets it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the Minister of State respond to my questions on Israel and drones?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is deeply ironic that Ministers are expressing concern about events in Ukraine, the Government of which is trying to pass a law to make it a serious offence to engage in peaceful sit down protests at public buildings. This has caused a near revolt. Everybody acknowledges that the actions of the Ukrainian Government, following on from the actions of President Putin's Government in Russia, are actions of a repressive and undemocratic regime and that we must uphold the right to peaceful protest. In this country, however, a 79 year old writer - like the Minister - and activist of conscience who engaged in an act of civil disobedience is languishing in prison even though she is ill with Parkinson's disease. Is that not appalling? Whatever one may think of her views, Margaretta D'Arcy is acting on her conscience on an issue with which a huge number - probably the majority - of people in this country are in agreement, namely, that the airports of a neutral country should not be used to facilitate the CIA programme of illegal torture and kidnap or the transport of military equipment and troops used in the bloody wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. She has a right to protest against that and she should not be imprisoned for doing so. I appeal to the Minister to intervene on humanitarian grounds to direct that Margaretta D'Arcy be released. True to herself, Margaretta has asked us not to worry so much about her but to raise the issue. For the umpteenth time, I ask the Minister to investigate the use of Shannon Airport in the illegal kidnap and torture programme and for the purpose of conducting war.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Quite simply - this is what I believe Margaretta D'Arcy would want to convey to the Minister - the Minister would not have to spend €17 million if the Government stopped facilitating the US military machine at Shannon Airport and stopped facilitating CIA aircraft that are involved in the illegal torture and kidnapping of persons. Margaretta is acting also on the principle of the Nuremburg judgments, with which the Minister may be familiar, arising out of the trials of Nazi war criminals and the obscenities they inflicted on the Jewish people and other innocent victims of Nazi horror, which stated that citizens of any state were obliged to break the laws of their own state if they believed it was preventing a greater crime. It is precisely on that basis that Margaretta D'Arcy has acted. Is the Minister really saying there is nothing he can do about an elderly 79-year-old woman languishing in prison on the basis of an act of conscience for doing something similar to what Martin Luther King or Mahatma Gandhi would have done? Do we want to be the type of State that would have imprisoned Martin Luther King or Mahatma Gandhi? We are, as long as Margaretta D'Arcy languishes in prison.
