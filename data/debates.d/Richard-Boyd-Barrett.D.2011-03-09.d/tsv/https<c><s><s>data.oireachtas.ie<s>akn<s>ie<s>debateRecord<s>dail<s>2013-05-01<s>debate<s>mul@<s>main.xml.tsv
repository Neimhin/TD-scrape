RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yesterday the Taoiseach told the House that the sale of Coillte's harvesting rights was being considered and in the event of it going ahead, legislation would be required. However, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, said the sale of Coillte's harvesting rights was unlikely because of protests and opposition, in which case no legislation could be expected. I ask the Taoiseach to clarify these competing messages from the Government. Can we expect legislation relating to the disposal of the harvesting rights of our public forests or not? I ask the Taoiseach to give a straight answer to that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are trying to figure out whether the Government will separate the wood from the trees.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister of State explain why there is a time lag? The tenant purchase scheme, which operated from 1995 until December of last year, was quite successful. It provided reasonable discounts for local authority tenants who wanted to purchase their own homes. The Minister of State was very vague regarding the context of when a new scheme will be established and she also did not indicate why there is a time lag between the end of the old scheme and the establishment of a new one. I am sure she is aware that many council tenants wish to purchase the homes in which they live. Obtaining council homes often acts as a stepping stone for those on lower incomes to eventually purchase their own homes. There is no good reason for the time lag to which I refer. Will the Minister of State clarify why it exists and will she be more specific as to when the relevant legislation will be brought forward and when the new scheme will be established? I have been contacted about this matter by many people who live in the city. I stress that I am of the view that all of the moneys relating to any new scheme should be ring-fenced in order to provide new social housing. It should not be a case of running down the stock of social housing. If anything we desperately need a new social housing programme, particularly as the waiting time relating to some housing lists is now 12 years. Will the Minister of State answer the questions I have posed and indicate whether a new social housing programme designed to deal with the unsustainable waiting lists to which I refer will be put in place?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State indicated that people were put on notice in 2010. I was not a Member of the House at that stage. The Minister of State has still not indicated why there is a time lag. The tenant purchase scheme was successful. As as been pointed out, giving people the right to buy their own local authority homes is obviously very good for them but in general it is also good for local authority areas because it gives those to whom I refer a stake in those areas. This is a positive, win-win situation. I do not, therefore, really understand the reason for the delay. If one were suspicious one might think that the Government is trying to wind down matters in respect of social housing altogether. I say this particularly against a background of there being no social housing programme, where the waiting times on the housing lists in my area are stretching out to ten or 12 years, where the only people who seem to be able to obtain houses are those who are given overall medical or some other form of priority and where normal applicants in places such as DÃºn Laoghaire are no longer being housed. Will the Minister of State explain the delay in bringing forward the legislation to create a new scheme? The old scheme was a success and there is no need for a break between the two.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where are the scheme and the houses?
