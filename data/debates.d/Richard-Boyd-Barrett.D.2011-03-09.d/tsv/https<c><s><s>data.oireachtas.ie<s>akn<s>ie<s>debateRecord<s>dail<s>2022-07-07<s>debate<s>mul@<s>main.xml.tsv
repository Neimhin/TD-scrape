RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Following on neatly from the previous discussion, student poverty last year was rampant, with accommodation costs being a key element. Public transport costs and all the cost-of-living issues are now going to hit students. What is the Minister going to do about this? Will he consider bringing in free public transport for everybody in higher education? What are we going to do to bring down the cost of accommodation?There should be subsidies for student accommodation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These are very small changes. We need to go a lot further. There needs to be a complete change of mindset. Accessing further and higher education should be seen in the same light as primary or secondary education. We want as many people to access further and higher education as possible, and we need to remove all barriers in order to facilitate that. We have the highest fees in Europe. They should be abolished. It is crazy to have registration fees. Only 30% of students benefit from grants.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Maybe it has gone up slightly, but the vast majority do not get grants. The new student accommodation being built on the UCD campus will cost students €1,400 to rent. Even as a temporary measure, all third level students should get the housing assistance payment, HAP. I do not really like HAP but at least it reduces the cost of rent. That is a temporary measure the Government could bring in for all third level students. Why do we not do what is being done in Germany, where public transport fares have been reduced by 90%. Could we not at least offer free public transport to all third level students or dramatically reduce the cost in the same way we have done for school-going students?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For some.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Although the student unions do not have all the figures, I spoke to them this morning and they reckon that more people dropped out of college last year than ever before because of accommodation costs and the cost-of-living crisis. That is their estimate. In University College Cork last year, there were record numbers of students going to food banks at the beginning of term. Such were the numbers and so desperate were the students for food that, according to one report, all the food in the food bank was gone in 48 minutes. Imagine how much worse it will be with the cost-of-living crisis? It is unacceptable that students are paying €1,000, €1,200, €1,400 in accommodation costs. It is madness to impose any transport costs on them. We want people to go to college. We should get rid of fees, full stop. There is no justification for having college fees. There are fees in private schools and in our two-tier education system, but we should not have fees at all for education, be it primary, secondary or third level.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is still a majority.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will check the figures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last year, there was an absolutely dire student accommodation crisis, to the point were many students were paying up to €400 a week for hotel accommodation. Some could not even get that. What is going to be different this year? Student union leaders believe that we are going to face the same student accommodation crisis this year, as last year. What has the Minister done, and what is he going to do to prevent that from happening?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The cheapest student accommodation at UCD is more than €8,000 for the college term. The new student accommodation that is going to be provided at UCD costs €14,000 a year. That is just insanity. It is not acceptable. To be honest, the Government should intervene immediately to ensure that students and their families are not being screwed with that level of rent. It is not that I am a fan of HAP but, as I said, a temporary stop-gap must be introduced. People should not be paying that level of rent. I would be in favour of nationalising all the privately- and investor-built student accommodation. The developers are getting tax breaks and they are charging €1,000 a month in rent, which most students cannot afford. Then there is the bigger issue of the need for major investment in providing student accommodation that is affordable on campus or near campus.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The problem is that rather than the Government making a decision that we have to have the necessary student accommodation to avoid a student accommodation crisis and to make it affordable, the onus is being put on the colleges to provide it. The result is that we are getting accommodation such as that being offered at UCD, which costs €14,000 a year. I made a general suggestion to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, but he did not take it up. The Seamark Building, a multistorey building located opposite the Merrion Gates, has been sitting empty for ten years. I suggest that the Government buys the building and refurbishes it for student accommodation. Nothing the Minister said really suggests to me that we are not going to face major problems again this year. Does the Minister agree with me that, although HAP is not an ideal scheme by any means compared to the direct provision of student accommodation or any form of accommodation, we should at least be bringing the rents down to affordable levels for student by providing subsidies such as HAP?
