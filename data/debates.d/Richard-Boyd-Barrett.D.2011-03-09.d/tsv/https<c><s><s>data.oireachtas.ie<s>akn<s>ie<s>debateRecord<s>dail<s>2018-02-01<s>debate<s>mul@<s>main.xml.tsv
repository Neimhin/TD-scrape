RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just before Christmas, the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, promised legislation to deal with zero-hour contracts and other problems. As we know, workers in their tens of thousands are on if-and-when contracts or in precarious employment, and sectoral agreements are not being adhered to. Yesterday I met workers working on the historic Boland's Mills site which is being run by a contractor that also has the contract for the national children's hospital. Those workers informed me that they do not get payslips. They do not know what deductions are being made. They say Romanian workers are being paid less than the sectoral employment agreement rates. This stuff is rampant. Agencies are being set up that are not registered, paying people less.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 3:To delete all words after “Dáil Éireann notes that” and substitute the following:“— the number of individuals or couples with a housing need that are neither eligible to apply for social housing because of the low income thresholds, nor able to afford to purchase a private home at current prices, far exceeds the approximately 100,000 on the social housing list, possibly by a factor of three;— since taking office in 2011, Fine Gael have not delivered a single affordable home through any Government scheme;— the Rebuilding Ireland Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness contains no targets and no clear funding stream for the delivery of affordable housing;— the Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil Confidence and Supply Arrangement for a Fine Gael-led Minority Goverment has no targets or proposals for the delivery of affordable housing;— Fianna Fáil have facilitated two Fine Gael budgets despite neither containing any credible proposals for delivering affordable housing;— Fianna Fáil’s Budget 2018 proposals contain no targets or proposals for the delivery of affordable housing;— the €90 million Help to Buy Scheme is driving up house prices and by the most generous estimate will help no more than 1,000 home purchases;— the €200 million Local Infrastructure Housing Activation Fund (LIHAF) is unlikely to deliver significant numbers of genuinely affordable housing and may deliver no affordable homes in Dublin;— the €25 million affordable housing fund announced in Budget 2018 will only deliver 650 affordable homes;— the revised local authority first-time buyers mortgage will be of limited value if genuinely affordable homes are not available to purchase;— the introduction of Rent Pressure Zones has not constrained rents by 4 per cent, particularly with respect to new tenancies;— no affordable homes will be delivered by any Government scheme in 2018; and— no precise definition of affordable rental homes has been forthcoming but the indications that such rents would be pitched at approximately 80 per cent of market rates, or worked out on the basis of a 25 year cost recovery on the commercial construction cost, are in no manner ‘affordable’; andcalls on the Government to:— immediately introduce regulations to ensure that, independent of commitments in Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, a minimum of 20 per cent affordable housing is delivered in all private developments;— directly construct 100,000 council and affordable homes over the next five years;— immediately establish what price or rent level is defined as affordable and to ensure that this is genuinely affordable for those on average incomes above the eligibility threshold for council housing;— achieve mixed income public housing estates through a combination of affordable housing but also by raising the eligibility criteria for renting local authority homes, at minimum, to include all with a housing need that cannot purchase privately at current market rates;— not deplete the public housing stock, as happened in the past, by making it mandatory that the local authority have first refusal in buying back affordable homes that occupants seek to sell;— immediately introduce an affordable housing scheme for public land that will ensure no land is sold off, in part or in whole, to private developers or landlords and further ensure that public private partnerships will not be considered in the context of council and/or affordable housing on public land;— ensure that in any delivery of affordable homes on public land, all of these homes remain affordable into the future i.e. where purchasers do sell at a future date, they will be required to sell back to the local authority and that home will be either resold as affordable or revert to council housing;— fund the delivery of the affordable housing schemes through a combination of the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund/Home Building Finance Ireland (HBFI), Housing Finance Agency and exchequer funding as appropriate, and provide local authorities with multi-annual funding commitments to facilitate forward planning;— design the HBFI fund to prioritise loan finance to small and medium-sized builders participating in council-led affordable housing schemes;— ensure that all residential housing on National Asset Management Agency sites, or on sites supported by the Strategic Investment Fund, will be a mix of council and affordable housing only, with no housing on these sites being sold at market prices;— ensure that all LIHAF and HBFI funded developments deliver, independent of any commitment in Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, 40 per cent affordable homes as per the Government’s original proposal for LIHAF, putting in place appropriate claw-back mechanisms to ensure the State benefits proportionately on any capital gain arising from future sale of these homes;— immediately scrap the failed ‘Land Initiative’ and commit appropriate public funding to all council developments for projects currently underway in O’Devaney Gardens, Oscar Traynor Park and St Michael's Estate in Dublin City, The Grange/Kilcarberry in South Dublin and Shangannagh Castle in Dún Laoghaire, but ensure that all of these lands remain in full public ownership and that any affordable housing remains affordable into the future and that any tenure mix on these sites will ensure a majority percentage being developed as traditional council housing;— identify public sites around the country for similar council-led developments and introduce legislation to allow for the purchase of land needed to meet the public and affordable housing needs, at use value prices, and immediately bring forward plans similar to the Damastown proposal in Fingal and Whitechurch in Cork brought forward by Solidarity-People Before Profit public representatives;— commit the required funding to ensure the maximum council and affordable housing in the Poolbeg and Clonburris Strategic Development Zone's (SDZ) and to dramatically increase the proportion of council and affordable homes in the Cherywood SDZ;— amend Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000, to provide for a minimum of 20 per cent council housing requirement;— introduce real rent controls that allow local authorities to set rents at affordable levels and ensure that future rent increases are linked to an index such as the Consumer Price Index; and— defend and maintain the differential rent levels in local authority rented housing.”
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister knows, the board, students, parents and teachers of Clonkeen College were shocked and dismayed to discover last May that the Christian Brothers intended to sell their school playing pitches to property developers, despite previous promises from the Christian Brothers that the fields would be given to the school in perpetuity as long as it continued to exist. Some €450,000 has been spent on draining the pitches and €260,000 was spent on fencing, including €120,000 of which was public money. They are now even more shocked to discover that in response to their campaign, which involved appealing to the Minister and Christian Brothers not to do this to the school and steal their facilities from the the Edmund Rice Schools Trust, ERST, has now, in an act of purely vindictive retaliation against the campaigning of the school, threatened to dissolve the voluntary board of Clonkeen College. It is an absolutely extraordinary act of bullying by ERST against the school. The voluntary board is doing nothing more than trying to protect the interests of the school and its students. It is ERST which, incredibly, has claimed that the board is acting against the interests of the school when it is ERST which is acting against the interest of the school by threatening to take away the playing pitches and dissolve the school board. As the Minister knows, the request to dissolve the board has to be approved by him. To put it bluntly, this is a moment of truth for the Government in terms of deciding which side it is on. I and the Minister know that the school is asking him to back the board and school and dismiss out-of-hand the outrageous suggestion that the board be dissolved by ERST. As the Minister knows, the members of the board have been forced to take very costly legal action to try to protect the pitches. The case will be heard in the High Court in March. They ask that not only the Minister reject the proposal to dissolve the board but that he back the board in its legal action against the congregation to protect the pitches for the school's students. Not only is this important for the 500 students of the school and future generations of students, it will also affect students in the moderate to general learning disability facility. It was built recently and will be directly and very negatively impacted by the development proposal and plan to sell the pitches. St. John of God services in the area said that it was dismayed to hear about the planned sale of the sports fields and the negative impact this would surely have on students with disabilities. It went on to say that the change would have a dramatic negative impact on their environment as noise and other distractions would wreak havoc with their learning and greatly impede the teachers' ability to connect and teach. It implored the Minister to support the school and board. I ask that the Minister do that, and indicate that he will not agree to dissolve the board and instead support the school.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Expressions of concern about this are not enough. We have an extraordinary situation which could have been resolved if the Minister told the Christian Brothers that he is not taking the pitches to pay off the redress scheme because that is punishing future generations of kids for the crimes of the Christian Brothers against past generations of kids. The Minister should have done that at the beginning. This also raises the extraordinary situation whereby schools which are publicly funded are run by patron bodies which, it seems, are accountable to nobody. They are not accountable to the Government which funds them.It is absolutely ridiculous. Now ERST, which is supposed to be protecting the interests of the school, is threatening to dissolve a school board which has been exemplary. There should be no question of its being dissolved as its members have defended the interests of the school and its playing pitches. The board should be commended and the Minister should get behind it, by telling the Christian Brothers and ERST where to get off. In what sense is ERST acting in the interests of the school? It is demanding to sell lands for €18 million to pay a debt which is only €9 million so where is the rest of the money going? Is there a conflict of interest here? What are ERST and the brothers going to do with the rest of the money? The Minister needs to get off the fence and tell the Christian Brothers there is no way we will dissolve a board which has done fantastic work to defend the school. He also needs to step in to resolve this in a way that secures the pitches for the school for the future.
