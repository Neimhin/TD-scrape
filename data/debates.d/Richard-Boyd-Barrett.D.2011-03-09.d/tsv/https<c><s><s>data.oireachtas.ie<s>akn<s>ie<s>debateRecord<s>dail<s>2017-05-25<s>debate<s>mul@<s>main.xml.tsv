RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have been hearing that for six years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why did the Government oppose our Bill?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The fact that Seánie FitzPatrick, with his rotten and corrupt practices at Anglo Irish Bank, is walking away free is not a blunder; it is a set-up. This stinks to high heaven. There is a direct line----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I believe the fact that Seánie FitzPatrick is walking away is not a blunder but a set-up that stinks to high heaven. There is a direct line between Seánie FitzPatrick's rotten, corrupt activities at Anglo Irish Bank and the families that are this week being sent to Garda stations or are sleeping in parks because no homes are available. The establishment in this country has contrived and conspired to ensure that he walks away free. It is an absolute scandal. Consider the facts. An individual with no previous experience in criminal prosecutions is put in charge of the case. He has never even taken statements from witnesses in a criminal trial. In 2012, a judge presiding over the High Court's commercial list wonders why only 12 gardaí have been assigned to the case. However, nothing is done. Some gardaí are even moved to other cases. In March 2011, the Minister with responsibility for trade is told in a report that there are irregularities in the way the investigation is being carried out. In December 2010, a preliminary report was shown to the DPP making the DPP aware of the manner in which the statements were being taken, which was irregular. Mr. O'Connell told the court that the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement changed its practice since he gave evidence in 2015. Therefore, it knew, yet we only find this out now. To me, all of it stinks. Ministers, gardaí, judges and the DPP knew there were problems, but nothing was done and he walks away free because of the apparent blunders of one scapegoated individual. I do not believe it for a minute. It is rotten and absolutely stinks to high heaven. As Deputy Coppinger said, the ordinary people on the street have been shafted by Mr. FitzPatrick and Anglo Irish Bank and the disaster inflicted on the country rolls on. The property assets that these people bankrolled with gambling and speculation were handed over to NAMA and then handed back to vulture funds and to some of the same developers who are now evicting people, resulting in a homelessness catastrophe. One of the chief architects of this walks away and we are told it is because of a mess up in the investigation. I do not believe it is primarily to do with resources in the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, although that is part of it. That is part of the ongoing fact that there is one law for the rich and one law for the poor in this country. This situation is perpetuated and protected by Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the establishment in this country. However, I think it is worse than that. I believe that many people in government and in the State knew that this was going to collapse and they let it collapse. They let it run to this point so that Mr. FitzPatrick would get off. The people have been shafted yet again. The economy and people's livelihoods were destroyed and we have a housing crisis that rolls directly on from it, yet one of the chief architects walks away. How convenient. If anyone believes that this is a blunder, a mistake, a resource issue or the result of one individual not being able to cope with the stress, he or she must be living in fantasy land. I do not believe the Government's fake tears. It must have known it. The Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation was not present but her Department must have known because we have been told that there was a report stating there were problems in how the evidence was gathered. It stinks to high heaven.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like the Minister to respond to the suggestion I made that this whole thing stinks to high heaven because the series of events simply defy credibility in terms of being characterised as blunders. Mr. O'Connell in court emphasised that many other people knew how the investigation was being conducted. According to him, the then Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, in March 2011 received a report outlining the progress of the investigation and noting that the extent to which witnesses required the assistance of legal advisers was unusual and uncommon in the experience of the Garda. Therefore, the then Minister knew. Will the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, confirm that the then Minister knew and explain why alarm bells did not ring? We were told the DPP in December 2010 was made aware of the manner in which the statements were taken to some extent, so the DPP knew there were problems with how statements were being taken. The Garda knew they were not taking the statements, even though this was not supposed to be the case, and that means the current Commissioner, Nóirín O'Sullivan, or the then Commissioner would have known. Are we asking them? Did the Minister's Department have any discussion with the Garda Commissioner or other gardaí about the irregularities? The lead prosecutor shredded documents, documents he said he never read, but there is no prosecution or no investigation into the shredding of the documents.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To conclude, on a connected matter, does the Minister find it very unusual that when selecting the jury, the judge disqualified people on the basis of asking them had they ever been on an anti-austerity demonstration.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is relevant.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a question I have and a question people out there have.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Selecting juries on a political basis is very suspect.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am disappointed the Minister for Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, is not here. Is the Minister of State, Deputy Damien English, not utterly ashamed of his Government? On the day it was revealed that we have reached a new low with 12 homeless families being told to go to Garda stations, some of whom ended up sleeping in parks, the Government claimed it was doing its very best to deal with this issue and simultaneously chose to vote against a Bill which would stem the flow of people into homelessness by reducing rents to affordable levels and preventing economic evictions. That position exposes the utter hypocrisy of the Government. It says it cares about the families who are in this unprecedented and diabolical situation with children and their mothers in parks. It says it wants to do something about it but when it is given an opportunity to do so, it votes against a Bill that would enact emergency measures to prevent people sliding into this dire position. It does so because it wants to protect the so-called market, in other words the landlords and vulture funds who are evicting people. I received a telephone call as I was coming into the Chamber from Sinéad Murphy, a woman whose case I have raised twice with the Taoiseach. For the second time, she has been placed in a hostel in Dublin city centre that is located 12 km from her four year old daughter's school. The council will not allow her to take an available place in a hotel near her daughter's school in which there are people who want a place in town but are not allowed to take it. This is unbelievable. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This morning, Mr. Mike Allen of Focus Ireland stated that emergency accommodation would not solve the crisis and, specifically, that we needed legislation to stem the flow of families into homelessness. A few hours later, we had a Bill in the Dáil that would have done precisely that - stop economic evictions and reduce rents to affordable levels - but the Government and Fianna Fáil voted it down to protect the landlords and vulture funds. How can the Minister of State live with himself when families are degraded to the level of sleeping in parks, when young children are put in danger and when people are neglected in this way and the Government still votes down measures that could do something about the situation? How could the Taoiseach write to me to say that the Government is making progress when the numbers in emergency accommodation have increased by 462% since Fine Gael entered government in 2011? It should be ashamed of itself. This is unbelievable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some 12 km or 15 km away from a school is no good.
