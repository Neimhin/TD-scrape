RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is the week in which President Donald Trump has declared war on the people of Palestine and the wider Arab and Muslim world by recognising Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, an act which threatens to enflame conflict across the Middle East. Against that background of warmongering and increased militarism on the part of President Trump, it is more important than ever that Ireland holds onto its traditional position of military neutrality and opposition to warmongering and militarism. Yet, the Government has until this week quite successfully buried what is the biggest betrayal of Irish neutrality since the decision to allow US forces to use Shannon Airport to bomb Iraq back to the Dark Ages. The vote which will take place today on Ireland joining permanent structured co-operation on a new common defence project in the European Union is an absolute betrayal of Ireland's military neutrality. It is a step towards involvement in what is being explicitly touted by Donald Tusk, Jean-Claude Juncker, Emmanuel Macron and Federica Mogherini as a new European army and common defence pact. The Government has buried this. It misled the Business Committee. We were briefed by the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Paul Kehoe, who did not know much about it. Yesterday he informed us that the decision was taken on 21 November. It was not mentioned in the two subsequent meetings of the Business Committee that the Government planned to push the vote through this week. There is no doubt the Government has briefed the media that there is nothing to see here and that this is not relevant or significant, and that there are no legal implications.  The truth is that Ireland is joining a common defence pact which will require it to regularly increase defence budgets in real terms to meet the 2% of GDP benchmark. That would mean a quadrupling of Irish defence expenditure. These are binding common commitments. It will involve bringing our defence apparatus into line with other member states, establishing permanent interoperability with NATO and increasing expenditure on arms and weaponry in order to benefit the European military industrial complex.Why has the Government misled the country and tried to bury this significant betrayal of Irish neutrality? Apart from everything else, is this not unconstitutional? Article 29.4.9° of our Constitution states: "The State shall not adopt a decision taken by the European Council to establish a common defence pursuant to Article 42 of the Treaty on European Union where that common defence would include the State." That is our State and this is a common defence. It is explicit and anybody who doubts it should read the PESCO agreement. We are signing up to a common defence in defiance of our own Constitution. The Government has misled the public and the Dáil while playing fast and loose with the Business Committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the most cynical rubbish I have ever heard. I appeal to the public and press to simply read the document, Notification on Permanent Structured Cooperation. It refers to 20 binding commitments and there is no ambiguity about the language. One of these includes a "commitment to agree on common technical and operational standards of forces acknowledging that they need to ensure interoperability with NATO."
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the same NATO that involves Donald Trump and the United States.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is what we are talking about. We are committing to the integration of Irish Defence Forces with NATO. We still have not got answers on the fact that it commits us to real increases in defence budgets, or a "successive medium-term increase in defence investment" and "increasing the share of expenditure allocated to defence research and technology". That will be reviewed on an annual basis. There is to be a national implementation plan to meet these targets. This is the military equivalent on the fiscal treaty and we are signing up to it. President Tusk has said the purpose of PESCO is to protect the bloc from the "effects of the migrant crisis and hostile bordering states". He is referring to the 35,000 people who have drowned in the Mediterranean, thanks to fortress Europe. These people want to militarise the wall that Donald Trump dreams of building to keep out those desperate people. This is what they are about. The Government has deceived the public. I have a simple request. Give us the legal advice that this does not run counter to Article 29 of our Constitution before we have to vote today. It would come from the Attorney General and say this does not run counter to Article 29 of the Constitution.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Give us the advice then.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So the Tánaiste cannot give us that legal advice.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Attorney General given that advice?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is putting lives at risk.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For Europe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is about the money message.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to share time with Deputy Bríd Smith. The Government is pulling a fast one here and Fianna Fáil is collaborating, indeed colluding with it in that. That should be no surprise. Fianna Fáil brought eternal shame on this country in allowing the US military use Shannon Airport to prosecute the criminal US assault on Iraq which resulted in as many as 1 million deaths, 4 million people forced to flee their homes, the absolute destruction of Iraqi society and, ultimately, laid the seeds for the destabilisation of Syria that is now unfolding in the most horrific way. All of those matters are directly connected. We facilitated that, and the two major parties in this country supported it - to the tune of well over 1 million troops going through Shannon to prosecute that horrific war. It should come as no surprise that the two main parties that pretend to be in opposition to one another are now also colluding in further abandoning our military neutrality as part of joining up to the evolving European army and the development and reinforcement of the European military industrial complex. It is shameful. The process behind this was deeply cynical. The decision to sign off on this was made on 14 November and then confirmed at the Cabinet on 21 November. The Government knew, but the Chief Whip did not indicate to the Business Committee, despite several meetings taking place, that there was any intention to put this on the agenda for a vote, and then turned up this week, on Monday, stating, we were to have a vote on joining PESCO. The Business Committee orders the business of the Dáil and gives indications at least two weeks in advance of something happening. At neither of those meetings did the Government give any signal that this was coming up. Deputy Clare Daly raised the question of what was happening with PESCO and there was not a word from the Government about a vote. This was deliberate. The Government gambled that, given all the focus on Brexit and the rush of legislation in the past couple of weeks, this story would be buried and ignored by the media. It has largely succeeded in doing that. It is shameful because this is the biggest move away from our military neutrality since the momentous and disastrous decision to facilitate the US military at Shannon during the Iraq war in the teeth of overwhelming public opposition, reflected in one of the biggest demonstrations that ever happened in the history of the State and clearly in opinion polls. Every opinion poll that has been taken on it shows that the people oppose that decision. This decision is the biggest departure from military neutrality since that decision. The Government is now seeking to deceive us as to the real content of this motion. Let me read from the EU fact sheet on PESCO. It refers to, "enhanced coordination, increased investment in defence and cooperation in developing defence capabilities". It goes on, "The difference between PESCO and other forms of cooperation is the binding nature of the commitments undertaken by participating Member States". Deputy Lisa Chambers, who was looking for evidence, should read the fact sheet. The "binding nature" is the difference. It goes on to state, "It will be a driver for integration in the field of defence". What is a common defence, which is precluded in the Constitution? It states that this will be a driver for integration of a common defence. The fact sheet goes on to state that there will be implementation plans that will be subject to regular assessment. The PESCO body in the European Union will tell us whether or not we are meeting the binding commitments to ramp up military expenditure and involve ourselves in the PESCO project. The fact sheet could not be more explicit, stating, "This is different from the voluntary approach that is currently the rule within the EU's Common Security and Defence Policy". It is not the voluntary approach, which the Minister claimed it was. It is not voluntary; it is binding. We are moving into a binding enhanced defence pact. When one looks at what the major architects are saying about this, it is absolutely clear what they are talking about. One need only look at who the main players are. President Macron of France is talking about putting boots on the ground in Libya, as if they did not do enough damage there. One looks at the destruction of Libya as a result of French and western bombing of that country and the refugee disaster that has come from it. Now they are talking about further exacerbating that.I will repeat the quote from the President of the European Council, Mr. Donald Tusk. He specifically referred to the objective of PESCO as "to protect the bloc from the effects of the migrant crisis, hostile bordering states and forces that risk tearing the bloc apart". It does not get more explicit and, frankly, disgusting than that. What does he mean by "protect ... from the effects of the migrant crisis"? It means a military machine to stop desperate people fleeing from Libya, Syria and other places in which the west was responsible for causing the initial chaos. Now we are going to ramp up military defence and be part of keeping those people out. What are the "hostile bordering states" for which we need this common defence policy and to increase military expenditure? There is no doubt that this is an abandonment of our neutrality and a move into a common defence. I believe it is unconstitutional. It is counter to Article 29.4.9° of the Constitution and it should be challenged. We will have to seriously consider challenging it on constitutional grounds if the Government refuses to pull back from this shameful decision to abandon Ireland's military neutrality.
