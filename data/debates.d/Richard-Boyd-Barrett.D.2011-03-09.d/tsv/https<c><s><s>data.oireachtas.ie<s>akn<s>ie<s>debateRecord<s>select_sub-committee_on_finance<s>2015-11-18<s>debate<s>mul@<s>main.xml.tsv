RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As long as it is not ideological.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On what basis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am utterly opposed to the knowledge development box. I do not accept the Minister of State's assurances that this is not just replacing the double Irish tax scam with a new tax scam. I think that is exactly what the Government is doing. Having been exposed very badly with the double Irish, the Government in collusion with the multinationals has engineered a new tax scam, which is the knowledge box. This is borne out by the fact that on a number of occasions the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, has had meetings with the US multinationals, and he has openly acknowledged that he has discussed this in detail with them. From his most recent meeting in October he reported very positive feedback from the multinationals. I am quite sure there is very positive feedback from them because, as we know from an abundance of evidence, they are keen to pay as little tax as they possibly can on their absolutely extraordinary profits. In recent years we have allowed them to evade an extraordinary amount of tax under the double Irish mechanism. I do not believe the Government or the Revenue Commissioners did not know of the abuse that was going on. That applies to the previous Government and the current one. I made a point on Second Stage and I will expand on it here, as I have a little more time now. The Department of Finance's technical paper on the effective corporate tax rate contains a table produced by Revenue, table 3.25, on corporation tax distribution statistics. There are the gross trading profits figures and then the allowances are taken out. There is net trading income, other income and then total income. It is amazing that in 2007, total income was €63 billion after the allowances were taken out. The deductions in that year were €6 billion, so the taxable income was €56 billion. To be clear, those deductions include trade charges, which was the main mechanism through which the big multinationals wrote down their tax liability. One subsidiary of a company would charge another subsidiary of the same company for the cost of using its intellectual property or patents. They effectively wrote off most of their profits by charging it to intellectual property. In 2007, €6 billion was written off, mostly under the heading of trade charges by the big multinationals. Two years later that figure jumped from €6 billion to €19 billion, which is a factor of three. If I were in Revenue or in the Government of the day, I would be asking, "What the hell is going on here? Has the cost of intellectual property jumped by that much?". The total trading profits were not that different; in fact they were less.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is about the knowledge development box.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. We need to go into this detail to establish whether the knowledge development box will prevent the sort of tax evasion or the aggressive tax avoidance of the past. If this committee serves any purpose, it needs to go into this detail. The gross trading profits in 2007 were actually €10 billion more than they were in 2009, but the amount written off jumped by 200%. Therefore, the taxable income went from €56 billion in 2007 to only €37 billion in 2009. This is blatant tax avoidance using intellectual property. As I pointed out to the sub-committee dealing with this, I did not fully understand how this worked until I got an e-mail from an anonymous whistleblower who worked in one of these companies, who explained very simply how they did it. He said they would just adjust the amount they charged to royalties or intellectual property according to what profit margin they wanted. They could literally decide what profits they wanted to make. That is how they were operating. There have been these absolutely unbelievable increases in the amount they are writing off, and are allowed to write off, under the old scheme. The first thing to say is that the Government has not got rid of the double Irish, the mechanism through which they have done this; it is being phased out. The Government has given them the time. The companies that have been doing this will continue to be able to do it for the next few years until they acquaint themselves with the knowledge box. In response to Deputy Tóibín, the Minister of State said he did not anticipate that much uptake in the first year. They do not need to do it in the first year because they will continue with the double Irish, but they will slowly acclimatise themselves to the knowledge box. Given that this is how they engaged in blatant tax avoidance in recent years, what assurances can the Minister of State give us that the knowledge box is not just the same thing? It all turns on the question of the value a company can assign to patents and intellectual property. The Minister of State has just made the really big admission that the sales that derive from the qualifying intellectual property will be able to benefit from the knowledge development box tax break. There it is. All they have to do is make the very slightest adjustment to the intellectual property. Deputy Tóibín spoke about medicines and stuff. Making small changes in medicines can actually result in big changes. It is not medicines that we need to worry about here. These are the tiniest cosmetic changes, or they could appear to be significant changes but actually be cosmetic changes. We know the companies involved: the big IT companies, including Google and Facebook. They can make cosmetic changes. They might even appear to be significant changes, but they are not significant because they are always upgrading the stuff, with new versions of this, that and the other happening every few weeks. It is really just variations on basic themes.However, those variations will then be constituted as new intellectual property, with new patents associated with them, and all sales deriving from those products will be written off for tax purposes. The Government has given them six years to refine this measure, just in case there are any difficulties, because we know the Government is under pressure from certain voices in Parliament, but, more importantly, it is under pressure internationally on this matter. The Minister is clearly having lots of consultations with the multinationals and they are being given a six-year phase-in period to refine how they can fully exploit this new tax loophole. It is important to understand just how much we are losing. We are in an extraordinary position in which the Government does not want a possible €19 billion from one company alone. That is the upper estimate of what Apple would have to pay us back if it were to pay back the tax that it appears it should have paid to us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not speculation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am dealing with the Bill. We need to understand what is at stake.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Estimates have been put on the amount of tax Apple would have to pay back in the event of an adverse ruling. The signals are that the European Commission believes we engaged in state aid in making special deals with companies such as Apple in order for them to avoid paying tax. I believe that to be the case, as do many others. That is why there is an investigation. The upper estimates of how much tax was forgone in respect of one company suggest it could be as much as €19 billion. We are in an extraordinary situation in which the Government does not want that money. If I were the Minister of State I would be chasing that money, but he is sitting back and saying "We will see what happens," and "There is nothing to see here," when we could be talking about as much as €19 billion. Let us look at the serious estimates of the effective tax rates. The Government refers to a figure of an effective rate of 10.9%, which is laughable, because it is after the deductions to which I referred, namely, trade and charges, which is how companies write down their taxable income. Any serious analysis of the profits being made by those companies would start with their gross trading profits at least, if not their total income. Then one gets a very different picture. One gets an effective tax rate of approximately 6.2%, which roughly coincides with EUROSTAT’s estimate. EUROSTAT's estimate of our effective tax rate is 5.9% for 2012. As we know, the United States Congress estimated that the companies that are in the eye of this storm, the big players, are paying a rate of 2.2%. Every time figures about their profits or revenues come out, that is borne out. We had the extraordinary revelation recently that Google made €18 billion in revenue last year and paid €28.6 million in tax. I calculate that rate to be less than 1%. That is what is going on. Everybody knows it. I believe the Government knows it and that Revenue is aware of it, but it is being actively facilitated. The knowledge development box is the new mechanism to facilitate the process. I am sure the Minister of State will try to tell me that is not true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But I do not believe him.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Robin Hood would be very good.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not have a problem with a Minister or the Government consulting anybody. I was referring to the fact that, according to the reports, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Richard Bruton, was discussing the knowledge development box with multinationals and essentially seeking their approval.He received very positive feedback. There have been many such meetings with key multinationals which are not happy that there is a move internationally to close down tax avoidance schemes, but it is not the job of the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, or any other Minister, to reassure them that we will not go after more of their profits in tax and that is what it sounded like in the reports. It sounded like we were reassuring them. I wish the Government had engaged with the water charges protesters and asked them what they would like in the tax code and how they would like taxes to be levied. If it had, we would have a very different tax system.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The policy of the Government and the previous Fianna Fáil Government is and was to dance to the tune of the multinationals in how we design the tax code. That is not right. The amount of tax they pay on their profits is shockingly low and obscene compared to the amount ordinary workers must pay and we should seek more from them. Our proposal is to charge them 12.5% as a minimum effective tax rate and specify that allowances or deductions would kick in only after they had paid the 12.5%. God almighty, 12.5% is a pretty low level of tax for them to pay on their astronomical profits. However, even 12.5% is not low enough for these companies and we are giving them a mechanism by which they can pay half of it, which is what they have been paying through other mechanisms. It is no coincidence that the figure set for the KDB is 6.25%. According to EUROSTAT, 6.25% is approximately what these companies are paying. We are establishing a system which will ensure they will not have to pay any extra tax. We should be asking them to pay a little extra. This will come back and bite us all. If the Minister of State walks down to the Liberties area where Guinness is based, he will notice that Guinness built houses for its workers, parks, swimming pools and other infrastructure. It was not a sublimely progressive or benevolent entity. It made a lot of money for itself, but it understood that, in order for it to make profits and sustain its business, it had to contribute something to the infrastructure and give the employees who made its profits for it houses, basic sanitation levels, etc. These multinationals do not think they have such responsibilities. However, they rely on our infrastructure and need our educated workforce. We are running into a problem, whereby the lack of affordable accommodation in the city may become a disincentive for the multinationals to locate here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It could become more of a factor. Why do we not have the money to provide affordable accommodation? The answer is we will not make these companies pay taxes to contribute to our universities and infrastructure, including water infrastructure, on which they rely heavily. They do not want to pay anything towards the cost of our infrastructure and we are facilitating them. It is a pity we do not demand that they pay a minimum of 12.5% which they could well afford and which would give us €4 billion extra in tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have just one specific question. The general issues have been bashed around and will be again on Report Stage. Will there be an upper limit on the amount of relief a company can get? The Minister of State spoke about small and medium enterprises, and I am all for incentivising small and medium enterprises, but I do not believe they will be the main beneficiaries. If it was targeted at small and medium enterprises, as the Minister of State suggested, should there not be an upper limit on how much any company can benefit?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To stop-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, no.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All the information on HSBC which came from Swiss leaks showed all the tax avoidance that was going on. This was leaked to several European Governments before it was leaked to the media and absolutely nothing happened. As a result of the inaction of governments across Europe, it was leaked to a host of international media organisations which then published the information. That is one example of why we need public country-by-country reporting. To put it bluntly, governments cannot be trusted to make known to the public important information that is in the public interest. I am reading quite a good paper on this very issue, which points out - the Minister of State can confirm whether this is true - that the Irish tax authority has 201 members of staff in its office for large taxpayers, but this covers more than 12,000 companies of domestic and foreign origin, among which are 1,000 foreign transnational enterprises. The paper goes on to point out that even with the best systems and procedures, it seems unlikely that 201 staff members would be able to scrutinise effectively and ensure the accuracy of these companies' tax returns. That seems like a pretty good point. By having them publish the information, we would save ourselves a lot of work and effort. It would allow the public and all sorts of people to scrutinise these accounts and establish whether multinationals are playing by the rules. It would establish whether Government policy is working. It might be useful to know what subsidies of various types are going to companies. The public is entitled to know all this information, particularly given the sheer size and significance of multinational companies, many of whom have bigger economies than large countries. These companies are like Colossi, dominating the world economic system, and we know very little about what they are really up to. They have extraordinary influence on what happens in the world, to the point that, effectively, they can blackmail governments. They have pretty much succeeded in doing that here because the Government is afraid of them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is afraid of them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is afraid of saying "Boo" to the multinationals. When we were discussing the effect of corporate tax rates, we were not allowed to have Apple or any other multinational appear before the committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We can ask the banks to appear but we cannot ask these companies. We are afraid of them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. The Chairman was afraid of them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Come on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government did not even want a discussion on whether multinationals should have appeared before us in public.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The American Congress had them attend, but we could not. The British Parliament had them attend, but we could not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not. I opposed them and called a vote.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, and I strenuously disagreed. It is-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have read it in detail.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I still believe that the multinationals should have appeared before us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is shameful that we were afraid to have the multinationals attend. Regardless of that sub-committee, they should attend to answer questions just as they had to appear before the British Parliament and the American Congress. In 2014, PricewaterhouseCoopers conducted a poll of business leaders, of whom 59% stated that there should be public country-by-country reporting. Even the business leaders do not see a problem with it, yet a minority of business leaders - those associated with the large multinationals - and governments with close relationships with those multinationals do not want it. I do not see how anyone can sustain the claim that we do not need this information, given the aggressive tax avoidance of such companies, their importance to all of our lives and the way in which they influence the global economy. It is not on that this reporting would not be done publicly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In which case, there is a big problem with the agreement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was "ish". I said that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Heavily disputed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The conclusion of the paper that the Minister of State referred to that the effective rate was 10.7% was heavily contested, and I do not accept for one second that such is the effective rate. The introduction to that paper sets out the incredible spectrum of different effective rates depending on how one chooses to calculate it. They go from the 2.2% rate from the US Bureau of Economic Analysis to the EUROSTAT or so-called implicit rate, which is estimated at 5.9% for Ireland. I do not accept 10.7% as a credible estimate of the effective rate precisely because, as I explained earlier, it is after the deductions that have been the mechanism through which these companies have aggressively avoided tax using intellectual property and patents. That method of calculating the effective rate comes in after all that has been taken out of their taxable income, and one ends up with something that looks like 12.5%, but it is following the deduction of billions of euro in profits under the heading of trade charges. I also believe, as I stated earlier, that it was a huge gap in the remit of that investigation into the effective rates that we did not bring some of the companies at the centre of this controversy in here to be questioned in detail about their tax affairs. We did not get to the bottom of what was going on with effective tax rates. The public still has the right to know the truth about this matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Definitely.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely. There are a number of points I want to make. For some time we have been arguing for a wealth tax. In our pre-budget submissions I quoted extensively from both the most recent Credit Suisse report and the one before that to press the argument for a wealth tax. The Minister comes back with the same arguments each year. To some extent we are on ideological terrain, because the Minister just does not believe in doing this, but it is worth responding to some of the points he has made. There is a distinction between wealth and income. That is absolutely true. Sometimes when we talk about the need to tax wealth and higher incomes, other Government spokespeople - not so much the Minister - blur that distinction for political and rhetorical purposes. We are very clear about the distinction and believe we need to capture extra revenue for the State from higher incomes and wealth from capital and financial transactions. We are very clear on the distinction, as I am sure the Minister is, so he should not misrepresent our view on this. I said to the Minister yesterday that there is a connection between income and wealth. It is spelt out in the Credit Suisse report - if the Minister has read it - and it is obvious if one thinks about it. They are not the same thing but there is a connection. Credit Suisse makes the point explicitly in its report that those who receive higher incomes over time generate wealth because-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely. I thank the Minister for making my point for me. Only a tiny group of people has surplus wealth. That is critical. Only a very small group of people has surplus wealth. Most people have debt. That is what they have. The owe money. When income, wealth and assets are set against liabilities, for most of their lives most people are operating in negative territory. For a small minority of people, that is not the case. We are trying to get at the very small group that has extraordinary wealth. That is also linked to the fact that they have very high incomes, so they have surplus wealth every year that they can translate into wealth, as the Minister put it. That wealth becomes self-perpetuating. If someone has a lot of money, a million quid, it makes money for them. They just sit there and watch it accumulate. As the Minister pointed out, it is not just property. We understand the distinction, but the point is to get at that accumulated wealth. The Minister says that for the majority of people the wealth they have is primarily made up of the family home. This is obviously by way of justification of the property tax. That is true for the majority of people but when one reaches the top 5%, or the top 1%, that is no longer true. Their family homes are a much smaller proportion of their overall wealth, which is made up of commercial property interests, big investments and cash. The purpose of a wealth tax is to capture that. Even on the most conservative assessment of wealth distribution, as the Minister has set out with the CSO report, if we accept that the top 20% - approximately 300,000 people - have 40%, a conservative estimate is that they have €151 billion, most of which is assets other than family homes. That is the point. One will find that the concentration is even greater when one gets to the top 10%, but with that top 20%, the €151 billion that they have consists mostly of commercial property or financial assets. If a 2.5% tax was put on that €151 billion owned by the top 20%, it would raise €1 billion a year.They would still end up wealthier at the end of each year if a wealth tax at a rate of 2.5% were levied on them annually; it is just that the growth of their wealth would be slowed down. The average increase in the value of that wealth, accounting for investments, etc., is probably running at 4% to 5%. Those affected would still end up better off, but the accumulation and concentration of their wealth would be slowed down. It would be a very significant boon to the Exchequer. Why would the Minister not even consider opting for this, or even a measure that was a little more conservative? We suggest a rate of 2.5%, but even a slightly more conservative rate would result in a few hundred million euro. Why would the Minister not even consider this as a source of revenue rather than unloading a regressive property tax on those who cannot afford it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. The amendment is about compiling a database on wealth. Obviously, this is proposed with a view to having a possible wealth tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have not. Is that not what the Finance Bill is for?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yippee. The Minister is doing that, although he said it would be very difficult to do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Under pressure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just want to make a point to the Minister on collecting the data. In responding to the suggestion we collect data on wealth I must re-emphasise that we are focusing, in particular, on those at the very top, not the ordinary person who has a house. I refer to those with multiple properties and vast financial and other assets. They are the people at whom we are trying to get. The Minister says he or people might balk at collecting data for each individual, but that happens all the time in the case of the ordinary citizen. If the poor apply for a social welfare payment, they are means-tested forensically on their income and assets before receiving it. The Minister has the information on property through the property tax system. He has gathered it. The second home tax was progressive. It was levied on properties one had, in addition to the family home. We could reinstate and increase that tax and consider the property assets in question and their concentration. It would be interesting to see who owned multiple properties and ascertain what tiny group of investors and property owners owned multiple properties. We would find there was a heavy concentration in this area. We should direct taxes at those who are generating considerable revenue and have an appreciating asset because of concentrated ownership of large amounts of property. There is nothing to stop the Government from gathering information that would allow us to have a wealth tax targeted not at family homes but at the very wealthy, or those who have many financial and property assets above and beyond the family home.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not differentiate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know that. It would be easy to establish who owns three, four, five, ten, 15, 20 or 50 homes. There is a big difference in that regard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what we are talking about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said the information is available to the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Put in place capital controls.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I no longer have the money to do it.
