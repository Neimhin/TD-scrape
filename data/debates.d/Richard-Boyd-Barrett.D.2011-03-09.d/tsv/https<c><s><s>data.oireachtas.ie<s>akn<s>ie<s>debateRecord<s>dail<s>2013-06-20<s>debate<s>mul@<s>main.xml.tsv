RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government has had on its legislative programme almost from the beginning of its term of office reference to a housing Bill. We are now two years on, and the housing crisis is worsening daily for the 100,000 or so families on the housing list with virtually no prospect of getting a home because of waiting lists which are 12, 13 or even 15 years in many cases. This week alone in my constituency, eight families are faced with homelessness because of the inadequate rent caps. Landlords have indicated they can get higher rents and they want these people out, so they are faced with homeless or being told to go to emergency accommodation hostels on the far side of the city. Where is the housing Bill? The Government can plead that it does not have any money but it cannot say that we do not have houses in the country. We have houses and we need a housing Bill to deal with the disastrous housing crisis facing 100,00 families in this State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This debate and this legislation are at least 20 years too late. Given the tragic circumstance surrounding the X case, when a 14 year old rape victim was denied the right to have an abortion in this country, and initially denied the right to travel to Britain for an abortion, who then became suicidal, and only as a result of public outrage was the Supreme Court finally forced to acknowledge she had the right to an abortion because her life was threatened as a result of suicide, it is shameful that 20 years on we still have not acknowledged the legal right to termination in those circumstances, which was decided by the Supreme Court. That 20 year delay, a result of the cowardice of successive Governments, contributed substantially to the tragedies of the A, B, C and D cases and, most recently, the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar. Let me say before dealing with the specifics of the Bill, whether it passes or not - it probably will pass - it will still leave us with the disgraceful situation where, if a 14 year old is raped but not suicidal, she will be denied the right to have an abortion in this country and will be forced to travel abroad. It will deny huge numbers of other women in crisis pregnancies where their mental or physical health might be threatened the right to terminate those pregnancies. Thousands more women, irrespective of whether the Bill passes, will be forced to travel in the dead of night, with all the stigma associated with abortion, which this legislation sets out to reinforce with its continuing criminalisation of abortion, will continue. Disgracefully, where the health of women is threatened, they will be forced to leave the country and their support and family networks to seek abortions elsewhere because the Constitution maintains an utterly false distinction between the life and the health of a woman.Any doctor will tell the Minister there is no such distinction. There is no distinction between the life and the health of a woman. Whatever happens with this legislation, as soon as it is passed, as it probably will be, the campaign to repeal the eighth amendment, and to remove the prohibition on abortion that exists that results in a situation where thousands of women every year in tragic and difficult circumstances must travel abroad, must begin immediately. That, in a way, is a campaign and a debate for another day. I accept that the Government must deal with the current constitutional framework set down in the X case judgment. However, this legislation is the absolute most minimal possible interpretation of the X case judgment and needs to be radically amended if it is not to leave us in a situation where many of the injustices and the ignominies that are inflicted on women in this country as a result of our laws on abortion will continue. First, let me address the issue of fatal foetal abnormalities. Here the Government has no excuse. There is no reason whatsoever this legislation should not contain the right for women who are pregnant in situations where the foetus has fatal abnormalities which are incompatible with life to terminate those pregnancies. As someone who had a daughter with fatal foetal abnormalities, I am aware that the diagnosis that one is given when one gets that terrible news from the doctors is that the condition is "incompatible with human life". Therefore, as a series of professors of law, barristers and solicitors have testified in a letter to The Irish Times this week, because such conditions are incompatible with life, to allow for terminations in that circumstances does not run foul of the Supreme Court judgment and of the current constitutional position. The Government could legislate for that in this legislation and it should. Its failure to do so is really quite reprehensible and will lead to a situation where people who have wanted pregnancies but get this terrible news that the foetus has fatal abnormalities will continue to be forced to have to travel to Britain where they do not have their family and support networks, etc. Added to that, they will still have surrounding their actions in seeking terminations abroad the stigma that the terminations they seek will in this jurisdiction be considered criminal actions, and it is absolutely incomprehensible to me that the Government could include in this legislation a 14-year prison sentence sanction, for example, for somebody who had a pregnancy with fatal foetal abnormality and sought a termination in this country, and that she could be criminalised and, potentially, imprisoned for 14 years. It is unbelievable that such a sanction would be included. I seriously ask anybody on the Government side if he or she really believes that a woman in those circumstances who seeks an abortion in this country is a criminal and should be subject to a 14-year prison sentence? Does any of them really believe any woman in a crisis pregnancy situation who, for example, takes an abortifacient should be criminalised? Nobody in all of the committee discussions stated that should happen or such women should be jailed, yet it is included in this legislation. It is simply unbelievable. It means, with the stigma surrounding abortion, that the thousands of women who under whatever circumstances still have to travel abroad to Britain for an abortion will be under a veil of criminality that what they are doing is shameful and criminal according to the law of the State. That is absolutely unacceptable and that section of this Bill should be removed. Furthermore, in the situations of suicidal intent, it is unacceptable that a distinction is made in this Bill between mental health and physical health. For doctors in the medical world, no such distinction exists. The idea that there should be a higher threshold for someone whose life is threatened as a result of suicidal ideation or mental health issues and somebody whose life is threatened as a result of physical health issues, that any distinction of that sort should be made, is unacceptable. The requirement that women who are suicidal should face interrogation by up to seven doctors is simply inexplicable. There is no medical justification for it whatsoever. For example, why do we need an obstetrician? An obstetrician has no role whatsoever to play in assessing whether somebody is suicidal. An obstetrician is simply not required in this equation. There is only a requirement for one psychiatrist and for a GP, as in other cases where the life of the woman is threatened as a result of a physical threat. Why make this distinction? The only reason the Minister is making that distinction is to assuage the opposition of Members in this House who believe they have the right to impose their morality on the bodies of women in such a way as, potentially, would threaten the life and the health of those women, and that is unacceptable. This legislation must be radically amended and I appeal to the Government to accept the amendments that will come forward on those issues.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As far as I am concerned, the Seanad must be abolished. There is no justification for the current set-up, which is elitist, is not representative of the majority of people and has not had any serious political function on behalf of the citizens. Consequently, it must go. Most Members, in one way or other, have accepted this in the course of the debate. While there is a question before Members as to whether it should simply be abolished and left at that or whether there should be some other tier of democracy or other new democratic institutions to replace it, there can be no doubt but that the existing set-up must go. However, before one addresses that question, one must ask the reason Members today are discussing the abolition of the Seanad in the first place. The reason they are doing so is that politics as a whole, not just the Seanad, has been thoroughly discredited. People are deeply alienated from politics and are extremely angry at politicians right across the political spectrum. To be honest, there are times when, were people given the opportunity, they would not simply abolish the Seanad but would abolish the Dáil as well and probably the local councils. That is where we are, and that is the level of anger and alienation that exists with regard to the political system. I must state that were Members being honest, they would admit that this anger is justified. As to the reason that anger exists, it is because the current political system brought us to this unprecedented economic crisis. At best, it did little to prevent it from occurring and at worst, most people would state that the political set-up in this country facilitated it. They would refer to the culture of cronyism, personal ambition and following one's own personal interests ahead of the interests of society as a whole, which was present among developers, bankers and certain corporate interests, and would state that this culture crossed over into and was facilitated by the political establishment and the political structures in the State. This is what most people think, and they have a point. People also would state, as a common observation on politics, that no matter whom one elects one always gets the same government, and nothing ever changes. Politicians make and then break promises and people have no way to make them accountable for that. One of the most powerful sentiments that is driving rage against the political system at present is the belief that politicians and the political system operate in such a way that they can play fast and loose with the trust of the people in order to get themselves into position but can then protect themselves from any degree of accountability. The belief is that politicians, who have regularly done this to people, cannot be recalled or held responsible for so doing. In addition, since at least the time of the former Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, and the beef scandals, there has been an entire litany - a relentless line - of scandals involving graft, corruption, cronyism and so on. People would say that at best the political system has failed to prevent this, and at worst it has been responsible for it. It has facilitated all of that and has engendered a political culture and a political class that is rank and rotten and has little to do with representing the needs, wishes and aspirations of ordinary people. Consequently, this debate should be about how to achieve a real democracy that functions and in which politicians are accountable. It should be about how to achieve a democracy that eliminates the potential for corruption or cute-hoor politics and in which politicians can be held accountable for the promises they made when going before the people. It should be about how to achieve a democracy that will ensure we are not plunged into the sort of economic crisis this State is in at present. It is important to point out that these are old problems. In the context of the Private Members' debate earlier this week on the 1913 Lock-out, I read through some articles written by James Connolly at the turn of the century. While he was apparently writing about a different constitution and a different political set-up at that time - namely, British rule - if one reads the article one sees resonances that are simply astonishing. Allow me to read out a few brief passages. Connolly talks about the power of the Cabinet and states:The cabinet formed out of the members of the party strongest numerically constitutes the government of the country and as such has full control of our destinies during its term of office. But the Cabinet is not elected by Parliament, voted for by the people nor chosen by its own party. The Cabinet is chosen by the gentleman chosen ... as the leader of the strongest party. The gentleman so chosen ... selects certain of his own followers and invests them with certain positions, and salaries and so forms the Cabinet.While Connolly rightly rails against this, 100 years on nothing has changed. Moreover, he was talking about a colonial parliament imposed on this country.The problem of immense amounts of power concentrated in a Cabinet that does not even have constitutional status and that essentially can impose its will by fiat on the Parliament and on the population in general persists 100 years on, even after we got so-called independence. Connolly further states:The powers of Parliament are...arbitrary and ill-defined.If Parliament, elected to carry out the wishes of the electors on one question, chooses to act in a manner contrary to the wishes of the electors in a dozen other questions, the electors have no redress except to wait for another general election to give them the opportunity to return other gentlemen under similar conditions and with similar opportunities of evil-doing.It is archaic language but the Minister gets the point. Nothing has changed from what Connolly described. That is what people feel.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister should not be smug about it because that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister not think they feel that anger? He is living in cloud cuckoo land if he does not think they feel that anger.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He goes on to state:Parliamentary Democracy gives [people] the right to a voice in the selection of [their] rulers but insists that [they] shall bend as a subject to be ruled.In arguing for the alternative he states:[We need a democracy that] will change the choice of rulers which we have to-day into the choice of administrators of laws voted upon directly by the people; and...substitute for the choice of masters...the appointment of reliable public servants under direct public control. That will [be] true democracy.That is actually what people want. The language is a bit archaic but they want direct control. They want a direct say in the laws. They do not want to see people get elected on the basis of certain promises and then implement other policies and laws which people did not vote for and in which they have no say. They want to have a say in the issues that directly affect them. Connolly was so right, and that challenge remains. If we do not meet that challenge by giving people the real democracy and accountability they want and of which they can have real ownership, we face a dangerous situation. One only has to look at the growth of the far right in Europe to see the chilling reminders of what happened in the 1930s, when faith in the democratic system broke down completely. The greatest horrors in human history were unleashed on our society across Europe and the world. It is frightening to see the rise of Golden Dawn and other neo-fascist organisations across Europe. As Yeats put it at the turn of the century:Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world.He was describing the situation in the 1916 to 1919 period including the First World War, the economic collapse, the crisis and the political polarisation that took place. It happened again in the 1930s and in the face of anther economic crisis, we are seeing the worrying signs of that developing again. Where does that assessment of the crisis of democracy that I believe exists, and I think most people believe exists, lead us in terms of trying to deal not just with the issue of the Seanad but the way we could have democratic institutions that command respect, where there is a vibrant democracy that functions as opposed to the dysfunctional one we have now? We first have to have a democracy in which there is recallability and accountability for decisions made. People are screaming for that. In the Meath by-election the group that shocked and surprised many people in the vote it got was Direct Democracy. It was precisely on the basis of arguing for that kind of direct participatory democracy that it surprised everybody and got a huge vote. We must have a democracy which has that level of accountability rather than simply electing people for five years during which time they can do whatever they want. We also have to have a democracy that is genuinely representative of all sectors of society. There have been ups and downs in regard to that but in general terms there is a decline in the numbers voting in elections compared to a few decades ago. Generally speaking there is a decline in the western world in the number of people voting, and that decline tends to be concentrated among young people, the less well off and the disadvantaged sectors of society but there is a definite decline in enthusiasm for, involvement in and engagement with democracy. That tells us that we must have a democracy that is genuinely representative of all sectors of society. We have to have a democracy that is not just a political democracy but one in which people have real control over the economic forces that govern and dictate their lives. There is a fundamental deficit in democracy if a small minority of people have control of the vast majority of wealth and resources in a society because they can use that wealth and resources to undermine democracy. That is where corruption has come from; it is not something that is unique to Ireland. We have had corruption scandals where big money has bought off, corrupted and corroded the democratic system in almost every major western country, not to mind the global south. It is always the same pattern. People with a great deal of money use that money, power and influence to corrode, undermine and corrupt the democratic system. It follows logically from that that if we have a more democratic system and a more democratic society, the more equally we distribute the wealth and the control of the resources in society. If wealth and resources are privately owned, regardless of the democratic structures we have, the people who control that wealth and resources use them de facto to control what goes on in society. The heavy concentration of control of the media in this country by two of the wealthiest individuals in the country is symptomatic of that fact. That is just one example. We have to address that inequality. It is obvious that the privatisation of State assets and natural resources, which are key to the functioning of our society, is also antithetical to democracy because if we hand over those resources, assets and infrastructure, which are vital to the functioning of society, and remove them from any kind of democratic control or accountability, it hollows out democracy itself. It makes democracy a meaningless side show to the day to day reality where those who control those resources, assets and infrastructures decide who does or does not access them. We are seeing that is the case even in areas like health and roads. One has to pay to travel on roads now. One has to pay to access decent health services. One can get a higher class of education if one can pay extra for it. These things are corrosive and they undermine democracy. Those are the issues we have to address and if we do not address them, we will be in trouble. I want to speak about protest in this regard. Some people, particularly professional politicians, are contemptuous of popular campaigns of protest. They like to present them as mindless activities that people engage in, that people like serial protesting, and that there is no reason for it.This was evident yesterday when I said the decision on the selling off of Coillte was a victory for people power and there were hoots of derision from Government and some Opposition Deputies. They were laughing at and deriding the idea that ordinary citizens might have had an influence on the Government decision on the sale of the harvesting rights of Coillte when they should celebrate the fact the public engaged so much with that issue. They should celebrate the fact that such a wide and diverse coalition of our society engaged with an issue that was critical to our society and if that meant they changed the Government's mind on something, that is good. It is an indication of democracy working at some level and the Government and our political system should not be afraid of that or seek to insulate itself from it but should seek to embrace it and learn from it how to develop a thriving, dynamic, functioning democracy. Where does that leave us in terms of the Seanad? Abolish it, but the Dáil is dysfunctional as well. We must establish new institutions, starting at local level, that are genuine popular assemblies that represent all sectors of society, ensuring worker representation, small business representation-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is contemptuous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The present system is working so well, is it not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister will be saying that as the political system sinks further into-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If that is the manner in which the Minister treats the debate, we are going nowhere. The Minister does not understand how angry people are. The principle on which the Seanad was set up was on the basis of different sectors, but the problem was that the sectors were representative of elites.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They should be representative of all sectors of society and if they were elected at local level from among the disabled, young people, student groups and so on, they would be accountable to those groups at local level. They could then select people to go forward to a national assembly that would be accountable to assemblies at local level. People could have a real say in the laws that are made by putting forward proposals for legislation and influencing the decisions the Government makes on a day-to-day basis. That is the sort of democracy we need. It is obvious from the Minister's demeanour that he has nothing but contempt for the anger and disillusionment out there. If the Minister thinks it is just coming from me, he is sadly deluded. He will learn.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister for his answer. I raised this issue with him on a number of occasions. It would be useful to conduct an overall study of this. In the first year I got into the Dáil I asked about the relative cost of direct labour as against outsourcing to agencies, consultants or whatever. I submitted one question but got more than 50 answers - a considerable thick file spread over weeks. I would have to do the same again every year. It is difficult to get an overall picture of the value for money or otherwise from outsourcing. However, the former Federated Union of Government Employees, FUGE, branch of IMPACT which deals with cleaners, porters, attendants, service officers, etc., has indicated to me that, for example, with the €2 million the Department of Social Protection spent on outsourcing cleaning work last year it could have directly employed 96 full-time cleaners, and that with the €1 million spent on private security which was outsourced instead of having directly employed service officers, the Department could have employed 70 service officers. This IMPACT branch contests that outsourcing in all Departments in its area covering such grades added up to approximately €16 million whereas the same number of staff could have been provided for €9 million - a difference of €6 million. In my own investigations, I have certainly found several examples. How representative these are is difficult to say for the reasons I mentioned but it looks as if it would be much cheaper to employ staff directly rather than outsource the work to agencies, consultants etc. Should we conduct a comprehensive overall study and analysis of this because we are looking for savings everywhere and workers would prefer, if they can make an argument that it provides value for money, for there to be directly employed secure employment rather than the more casual outsourced work which, obviously, is not as favourable to them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister's openness to looking at this. On the specific examples I cited, I hope he would engage with the former FUGE branch of IMPACT. They have compiled an analysis, the facts of which I have given the Minister, in which they maintain the Department could get the same services for considerably less money. Obviously, they would favour full-time staff employed in these low-paid jobs. Often it is thought that IMPACT represents higher-paid workers. In fact, IMPACT represents a substantial number of low-paid workers in the Government service. I agree with the Minister that there must be robust scrutiny of these matters. One cannot generalise too much, but it has been acknowledged that we had a problem, for example, with hygiene in many hospitals. A case at least has been made to me - it must be looked into - that part of the decline in hygiene standards in hospitals is because there are outside contractors which do not have the same allegiance to the hospital. They are in and out and the company or agency picks up its money. They get the job done in the minimum time possible, whereas directly employed staff would have a real feeling, passion, loyalty for and an association with the hospital on a fixed base. There is a case for looking at whether there is a connection between those two issues because we are seeing a much greater degree of outsourcing of such services in the health service. For example, is there a connection with MRSA?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not take all of the time, but I might take the opportunity to ask the Minister-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough. I was hoping to make some points to him.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but I have supplementary questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will keep this extremely short. Prior to the adjournment of Second Stage I stated my problem with the Bill is that it is part of a suite and architecture of economic control and surveillance which is demanded by the fiscal treaty and the EU Commission. It is fundamentally misconceived in that it identifies the problem which led to the crisis and the solution to preventing further economic crises as being public spending, and therefore setting ceilings, even on a multi-annual basis, is somehow a recipe for economic stability, growth and development. This is clearly the view the Government holds. I disagree because it identifies the wrong problem. It was not out of control public expenditure which caused the crisis. There were gross examples of misspending, particularly at the top by consultants, politicians and top executives of Semi-state bodies, but the fundamental reason for the crisis was not out of control spending, it was out of control markets, banks, developers and greed, mostly in the private sector but facilitated by politicians in the public sector. Therefore, to create an architecture which puts very strict limits on public spending does not necessarily solve our problem and may hamper our ability to get out of the crisis. I will give an example of what I mean, and ask the Minister of State for a quick reply. It follows on from the earlier discussion on privatisation. We have made the very positive decision, with some dispute about how it was arrived at, that Coillte will remain in public ownership. If Coillte is to be used as a vehicle for job creation there should be substantial public investment in it and the State should employ people in forestry to reach our re-afforestation targets and develop the potential of forestry in tourism, timber and a range of areas. This could be best done by employing more people in a body such as Coillte; not just employing them for the sake of it, but with a specific plan in mind about how, through greater levels of timber production and enhancing our tourist amenities, we could create jobs and therefore fuel economic growth. The type of ceilings included in the Bill will preclude our ability to do this, and we will not be able to invest money in these areas if, for example, we decide at a particular point that substantial public works programmes would be a way to get people back to work. One could make the same argument about social housing and the value it might have in terms of saved revenue to the State, given all of the money going into rent allowance at present. If we build more social houses by employing people directly in the local authorities to do so, we could save money and create employment. These rules preclude and prevent this type of stimulus by the State in creating the employment and growth we need. It locks us into a particular ideology, to which the Minister of State may subscribe, but at some point he, or another Government, may decide we need to do things differently but will be prevented from doing so because of these straitjackets the EU Commission and the fiscal treaty impose on us. This is my question to the Minister of State. I probably know what the answer is but I thought I would ask it anyway.
