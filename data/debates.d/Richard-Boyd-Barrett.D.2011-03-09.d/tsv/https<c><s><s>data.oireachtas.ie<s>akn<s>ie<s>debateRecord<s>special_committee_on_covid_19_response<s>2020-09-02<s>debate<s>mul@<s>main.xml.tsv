RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister think that protecting the health of Deputies is 50 times more important than protecting the health of children returning to school, teachers and parents? I ask this question because 50 times more public money is going into ensuring social distancing among Dáil Members than the Minister is putting into ensuring social distancing, funding safety in our schools and minimising the possibility of Covid-19 transmission. In total, €375 million is being allocated per year and we have 1 million students. At present, we are paying approximately €50,000 a week for the Convention Centre to ensure 160 Deputies can physically distance fully in accordance with NPHET guidelines. Of course, the consequence of this much lesser investment in protecting our students and teachers and the parents of those students is that many of the guidelines for the schools include the phrase "where possible", such as references to 1 m distance where possible and not sharing work stations and tables where possible. "Where possible" is not applied to us but it is applied to schoolchildren. Does the Minister not think this is just not good enough and that we are not providing the resources, a sufficient number of teachers or the physical space necessary to ensure that pupils, teachers and parents of pupils, particularly those with underlying conditions, can have some sense of assurance that the return to school will not pose a very serious health risk to them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The phrase "where possible" is a get-out clause from public health guidance. We hear stories from everywhere.We already had massively overcrowded classrooms, massive underinvestment and a huge physical infrastructural deficit before Covid-19. The term in the guidelines that states things should be done "where possible" is not possible. We are putting pupils and, in particular, teachers and the parents of pupils with underlying conditions, at significant risk. The only way we can minimise that risk is to dramatically increase investment, reduce class sizes and have more teachers and more physical infrastructure so that we can have the sort of social distancing that is possible for Deputies in the Convention Centre but is clearly not possible in schools. I have a brief supplementary question on public transport. The current guidelines for 50% capacity present a significant problem. Taxi driver representative groups have, I understand, written to the Minister and asked her to engage with them. They have very little work at the moment and would be very keen to talk to her about how they could assist with the school transport crisis and deficit that exists given the Covid-19 guidelines. Is the Minister willing to respond positively to their request to discuss this with her?
