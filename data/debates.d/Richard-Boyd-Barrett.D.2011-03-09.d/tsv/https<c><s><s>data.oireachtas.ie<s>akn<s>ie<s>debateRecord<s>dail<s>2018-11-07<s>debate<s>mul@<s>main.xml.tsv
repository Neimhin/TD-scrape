RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The value of early intervention for vulnerable young people and families is beyond question. All NGOs and organisations working in this area agree and I have seen the Minister at some of their gatherings, including a meeting of the Children's Rights Alliance at which the undeniable value of early intervention was discussed. In that context, my question is really a plea to the Minister to make funding available to the Cottage Home family support service in Shankill. The service needs just €400,000 to keep going. It has been funding itself from the proceeds of the sale of the Cottage Home in Tivoli Road, but that money is now running out and the service is under threat if it is not funded by the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister's reasonably positive response and acknowledge her response to my previous correspondence. However, there is uncertainty here because the private funding from the proceeds of the sale of the Cottage Home on Tivoli Road is running out. There are six qualified staff here and they are, frankly, saving the State a great deal of money. This is the important point about early intervention. It is estimated that every child who has to go into State or residential care will cost the State €200,000 a year. Here we have a service with six qualified staff, which has dealt with over 150 young people in its few years of existence, keeping many of them out of residential care and saving the State money, and it is asking for what is really a pittance.It needs certainty as it is very difficult without it for it and the service users it supports They are hoping for an assurance that this small amount of money will be made available to secure the future of the service.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not quite sure what to make of the Minister's answer. If this service goes, it will be a major blow to an area where there is very substantial disadvantage and in which there are many vulnerable families and young people. Reviews and new ways of commissioning are fine, but this service needs to be maintained. If it is not, vulnerable families and young people will lose a vital service. The State would be cutting off its nose to spite its face. It will cost Tusla and the State more if the service is not maintained. I do not see why there is any ambiguity about this. It may be an issue that the funds have been allocated for this year, but we are very familiar with overruns in the health service and moneys being found in those circumstances. We are talking about a small amount of money in the greater scheme of things. I would like a bit more reassurance, as would the people who work in the service and the families and children who depend on it.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to tell the Minister of State a little story which sums up what we need to do if we want to encourage people to get back into apprenticeships. I was at the Select Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach dealing with the Finance Bill so I have not heard all the debate but I am sure other speakers have said that there are not many issues more important than dramatically increasing the number of apprentices. Many of the hopes we have of solving the housing crisis in particular critically depend on us increasing the number of people taking up apprenticeships in the trades in a dramatic way. Also, in terms of our hopes for infrastructural development, we have to get large numbers of young people taking up apprenticeships again. The story I am about to relate sums up the problem. I met a young man, whose name I will not mention, at a protest involving film workers on precarious employment in the film industry. It was interesting, and I will talk more about this in the finance committee in a while, that a bit of a hatchet job was done by RTÉ on those protesting workers last Thursday, which was shameful and a gross misrepresentation of the issues affecting workers trying to find a career for themselves in an industry like film, where many of them would be tradespeople and which depends heavily on tradespeople. The day after that protest, and I would like the producers of "Prime Time" to take this on board in terms of the way they misrepresented some of the issues involved, an apprentice painter who was participating in it rang me. He has served his entire apprenticeship while living in emergency homeless accommodation. I spent the next few days, thankfully successfully, pleading with Dublin City Council to assist him with his housing assistance payment, HAP, because he was threatened with eviction by his landlord. In fairness to Brendan Kenny, we succeeded in sorting it out, but that is what he has had to put up with for four years as an apprentice. His case brings into focus two very important issues. Why do we have difficulty getting people to enter the trades? I will tell the Minister of State the reason. It is because precarious employment for the trades is rampant. Many people have left the trades and do not want to go back into them. Many of those who worked on construction are driving taxis now and would not dream of returning to construction or other trades because of the precarity of much of the work and bogus self-employment, which means they cannot get mortgages, they cannot be guaranteed to pay their rents and so on. Unless we deal with that side of it, there will not be the encouragement necessary for people to go back into the trades. In areas like film, construction and many other areas where we are talking about apprenticeships, people need to have some prospect that they will have some kind of employment security, half decent conditions of employment, half decent pay and so on if they are to enter the trades. I also believe, given that type of situation, that we need to consider increasing the income apprentices earn while they are apprentices to encourage them to take up apprenticeships in the first place because many of them will not do it for that reason.
