RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We found out recently that 33 families and households who had been on the housing list in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area for many years were removed from that list last year because they slightly exceeded the income thresholds. For at least five years, we have been asking for the income thresholds to be increased. We have had promise after promise by the Minister. He told me the review was completed at the end of last year. To give an example, I am aware of a woman who, along with her daughter, has been in homeless accommodation for three and a half years. She is working for a State agency and has just been taken off the list. I know of a couple, one of whom is a hairdresser while the other works in Tesco, who have been removed from the list. These are people on very low incomes. They have now lost all their years on the housing list. Their incomes would never even begin to get near the rents and house prices in the area and they have been removed from the list, yet we still do not have the raising of the income thresholds.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When is it going to happen? Will the people who have been removed get their time back?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The delivery of affordable housing is absolutely key to economic recovery. My colleague in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, Councillor Melisa Halpin, just received a reply from the local authority about Cherrywood, which is the biggest residential development going on in the State. The local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, funding which the State extended to the developers was supposed to be reciprocated with 300 affordable homes, but the local authority now thinks that will not happen. There is extremely poor engagement from the developers. It seems that whatever affordable housing the local authority gets will only be €37,000 less than the market price, which is now on average €644,000 in Dún Laoghaire, which means it will not be affordable. There is similar pessimism with regard to the Woodbrook-Shanganagh site, which is also LIHAF-funded. Public money was given to the developers for infrastructure in exchange for affordable housing.The discount is slightly more at €63,000 but given the average house prices in the area, the affordable housing we were supposed to get will almost certainly be unaffordable for the vast majority of people. That is utterly unacceptable. Indeed, the failure of the Cherrywood developers to engage seriously with the council after getting this money for the infrastructure to deliver affordable housing is a scandal. What is the Taoiseach going to do about this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Price matters.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People Before Profit has for many years campaigned for free public transport on buses, trains and the Luas as the type of radical measure necessary to increase the use of public transport. We have also called for much more investment in public transport to make it more frequent and reliable and a more attractive service to use. The Government has gone a tiny way towards what we have proposed with a 20% reduction.I welcome it but I do not believe it is enough. I have heard concerns from bus workers and I think they would like reassurances that given our privatised model that allows private operators to operate, the NTA will not now use the reduction in fare income as leverage to demand that lower tenders are put in and pressure is put on wages and conditions of bus workers, which have been under threat for some time. They need reassurance on that because our bus workers-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The NTA because it is the one that tenders the routes. The NTA has given the 20% reduction but it is also the body that makes decisions about tenders. Bus workers do not want reduced fare income to be used as essentially a means of then demanding cheaper tenders and pressure being put on the pay and conditions of bus workers, who actually need a pay rise at the moment. They do not need pressure on their pay and conditions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tax profits instead of consumers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government never taxes profits.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We recently sought to hold a referendum to debate our neutrality. The Taoiseach suggested, in response to that and in voting down our motion for a referendum, that we consider a citizens' assembly on neutrality. Is he serious about that? I believe we should still have a referendum to give the people the right to debate and decide. Will we have a citizens' assembly, which would also be welcome, to discuss the issue? One of the issues it could discuss as part of defining neutrality is consistency in standards and principles when it comes to foreign policy.  I draw attention yet again to the double standards in the response to what happened in Jenin in the past 24 hours. The Taoiseach has rightly condemned the murder of a journalist, and I am glad he has done so. He also called for an investigation. However, there is another important issue about that event. What the hell were the Israeli Defense Forces, IDF, doing carrying out “an operation” on Palestinian territory? For the last six weeks, the Taoiseach and western leaders have rightly condemned Russia’s “operation” in Ukraine. They have called it out for what it is, namely, a brutal, unjustifiable, inexcusable act of military aggression on somebody else’s territory. Why is the same thing not being said about Israel’s incursion into Jenin in Palestinian territory? What was Israel doing carrying out a military operation on Palestinian territory? What is it doing day-in, day-out carrying out military operations on Palestinian territory? Will we call that out as well?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are 7 million Palestinian who have been estranged from their homes for 70 years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are 7 million of them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should not get into a league table of suffering.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am listening.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Israelis blow up EU stuff all of the time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It gives Israel impunity.
