RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As we move towards the close of the debate on this Bill, it is important to recall how we got here and what this was all about. In this debate, and over the course of the past three years, all sides have tried to put their spin on what it was all about, and that spinning continues with people trying to put forward a particular interpretation of the facts. The most ironic, almost laughable, spin that has been put on it are attempts by the Government and Fianna Fáil to say that what is being achieved with this Bill today is somehow to their credit. That is laughable because, although this Bill very deliberately leaves a back door open to the reintroduction of water charges, at another level it is a victory not for any political party and most certainly not for Fine Gael or Fianna Fáil but for the mass movement of people power against the water charges, a mass movement of peaceful civil disobedience in refusing to pay an unjust charge and then mass mobilisation on the streets on an unprecedented level which forced a historic climbdown by Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. The people certainly know this but it is important to remember, as the Bill moves through its Final Stages, that both Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have been committed for a long time to trying to introduce water charges. Fianna Fáil, when it was in government, wanted to introduce a water charge of €400 a year and it had a PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, report detailing how it was going to introduce water charges. Fine Gael then came in after it and that was the third attempt during the past 20 to 25 years by the political establishment to bring in water charges. Austerity and the troika programme was the excuse and the proof that it was just an excuse was that they had tried to bring water charges in during the 1990s but they were defeated by a mass movement of boycott, civil disobedience and peaceful resistance on the streets. Also, back in the 1980s attempts to bring in water charges were similarly defeated by a mass movement of peaceful resistance, ironically at the time it included leading figures such as the former Tánaiste, Eamon Gilmore, who then subsequently went over to the other side and tried to justify the introduction of water charges when his party was in government with Fine Gael. However, the people who remained consistent on this were the ordinary working people who fought it in the 1980s, fought it again in the 1990s and fought it again this time around and triumphed against the combined efforts of the two major political parties, with considerable support from those in the media and so on which seemed to think there was something barbarian or philistine about the opposition to water charges, when in fact that opposition was absolutely justified opposition to a regressive tax imposed on the less well off in our society and which was linked to a very well worked out and concerted agenda to privatise water resources, regardless of whatever the Government tries to claim now.It is not just a theoretical supposition that the introduction of water charges and the establishment of Irish Water were a stepping stone to privatisation. Privatisation commenced immediately when Irish Water was set up. Look at the people who were involved. Denis O'Brien, now implicated in the Paradise - or parasite - Papers of tax evasion, got the contract to put in the water meters, which was worth nearly €1 billion, in shady circumstances. I call that privatisation and very shady privatisation. All the usual suspects of consultancy firms and accountancy firms, many of which are now also implicated in the parasite papers for assisting, and continuing to assist, the wealthy in Irish society to stow their money away in offshore tax havens, were also involved in Irish Water. They got massive consultancy contracts to set up Irish Water. Irish Water was a honey pot for wealthy, greedy private interests. Much of its management operations, design and so on, when it was set up and now, were contracted out to private firms. As soon as Irish Water was set up, it was being hollowed out. While notionally it was in public ownership, in reality it was in the hands of private interests, whether private consultant, private contractors or big tycoons like Denis O'Brien and other big firms.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Denis O'Brien.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what was going on. It was only because of the mass movement of resistance on the streets that the plan was scuppered. In so far as anybody played a role in here, it was only those who participated in the Right2Water campaign. I am proud that some of the political forces in the Dáil were involved in that. Some of the early organising meetings of Right2Water took place here when we met the trade unions and set out a plan to establish a mass movement. That mass movement would have been nothing were it not for the mass involvement of ordinary people boycotting the charges, opposing the installation of meters, moving onto the streets in unprecedented numbers and shaking the political establishment. The lesson of all of that is that people power can bring massive change. We often hear about the need to be in political power and in office to bring change. It is a common truism that if one stays in Opposition, one can achieve nothing. The truth is the big political achievements that have taken place over the past six or seven years have not been achieved by those in power. They have been achieved against the resistance of those in power by ordinary people on the streets fighting for change. That did not just include the campaign to defeat domestic water charges. It was preceded by the campaign to stop the agreed plan of Fine Gael and the Labour Party, and before that of Fianna Fáil, to sell off the harvesting rights to Coillte. That was also defeated by a mass movement of resistance. They wanted to sell the water and the forests and were frustrated in their attempts because of the-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Labour Party agreed. It signed up in the troika agreement to sell off the forests. I remember former Deputy Rabbitte, when he was Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, standing up in here the day after the demonstration that we organised in Avondale Forest where the week before he had said that sale was going ahead and the day after he admitted that the demonstration changed his mind and forced an about-turn in policy. That is the truth. The Labour Party had signed up to it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am. I am simply making the point-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----that the reason we have got here is because of people power and the resistance of ordinary people to the attempts of the political establishment in this country, including the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil who wanted to sell off our natural resources and then have them sold back to us at a cost, whether it was water or trees. In case the Government is under any illusions as a result of the back door it has left in this legislation to try to reintroduce the charges at a future point, the resistance will be very quick to remobilise if the Government attempts to reintroduce the charges. The attitude the Government has taken to the amendments we tabled is telling. The central justification the Government had for the charges all along was its concern to deal with the decrepit water infrastructure in the country and to promote water conservation measures, but actually there is nothing substantial or serious in that regard in the Bill. The Government has refused to accept amendments that have tried to bring serious conservation measures into the Bill, such as the water conservation grant and regulations around building that would ensure water harvesting equipment is standard in all new-build houses. That is something the Government has resisted. If it was serious about water conservation, those are the sorts of measures it would introduce and it would own up to the fact that the reason the water infrastructure is in a mess is because the Government slashed the capital investment programme to water infrastructure during the austerity years. Even now with the Irish Water business plan the Minister referred to, it is still way short of what is necessary to address the huge infrastructural deficit in water services. We need to double the level of investment in water infrastructure rehabilitation if we are going to address the massive leakage out of the system, but there is no sign of that from this Government. We have won a battle but the war is not over because the Government has left a back door open. Any credit on this issue goes to the people on the streets who fought this battle over recent years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would also say we need to speak out about what is going on in Spain. It is an affront to any notion of democracy that people, whatever one may think of them, who simply organised a vote for people to cast ballots on an issue that concerned them and their right to self-determination, a right that is accepted and enshrined in international law, could now be imprisoned and face very heavy sentences on charges of so-called sedition and rebellion. It is extraordinary. Simply saying that we accept the constitutional set-up of the Spanish state is not good enough in the face of that. On that basis, the people of Catalonia simply do not have a right to self-determination because the rest of Spain is not going to vote for the right of the people of Catalonia to self-determine - that is just not going to happen. It makes a joke, frankly, of self-determination if anyone expects that to happen. In the Taoiseach's discussions on Digital Europe, to what extent is he now concerned that Europe and the European Commissioner are looking into a possible second instance of Irish state aid to Apple in terms of the intangible allowances which led to a massive write-off of tax liability during the period 2014-2015, where allowances jumped, benefiting a very small number of companies? In one year, allowances jumped from €33 billion to €66 million, and it was Apple and a few other companies which benefited.This extraordinary jump followed the then Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, meeting the CEO of Apple at the beginning of that year. Following that, these changes were made by Deputy Noonan, conferring enormous benefits on Apple. If that does not stink of collusion in state aid to benefit certain companies, I do not know what does.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am amazed at the minimalist approach to the question of what is happening in Catalonia. This is a crisis that potentially not only strips Spain of any kind of democratic legitimacy, but in the failure of the European Union to speak about it, as Deputy Martin pointed out, it potentially strips Europe very significantly of its legitimacy, or what is left of its legitimacy, as a champion of democracy and human rights. Europe has signed up to the principle of self-determination. I stress that in international law, self-determination is not something that can be denied by a bigger state. The whole point of self-determination is that it can be exercised by minority groups if they tick certain boxes. Catalonia ticks those boxes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. One must at least engage with the issue and to say nothing about it is extraordinary. There has also been a minimalist response on digital Europe. The Taoiseach stated this was discussed, but what was the content of the discussion? Intellectual property and intangible assets are the main mechanism through which the most wealthy corporations in the world are dodging tax. It would amaze me if that was not discussed in the context of digital Europe as it will most certainly be discussed in Europe over the next few weeks and prior to the next European Council. At least at a rhetorical level, Europe is expressing deep concern about our implication in all of this. Whatever may be said about our role, Apple is involved in massive tax avoidance. The Government might say it is nothing to do with us and we are transparent etc., but nobody else thinks that. With the Paradise Papers we have the latest piece of evidence and there is the possibility of an investigation about state aid following the budgetary changes made by the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, in 2014.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister may have read the article, and has probably been made aware by Coillte itself, that it recently announced that it would be looking at 25 of its land parcels with a view to developing large-scale industrial wind farms in partnership with the private sector. Does the Minister not think this is another example of Coillte departing from its core function, which is to be the guardian, protector and promoter of Ireland's forest estate? Does he not think that it should concentrate on that? This measure will almost certainly involve cutting down trees on those sites rather than growing them, which is what Coillte is supposed to do. It is just another example of the back-door commercialisation and semi-privatisation of Coillte, when it should be concerning itself with Ireland's forest estate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First of all, the 6,000 ha which the Minister is talking about is a massive undershoot on what is necessary in order for us to reach our target, which keeps shifting out in any event, but which is currently to move from a pathetic 11% rate of forest cover to 17%. In deference to my Sinn Féin colleague, I stress that we do not want to see the expansion of the industrial sitka spruce type of afforestation but rather the development of native broadleaf species, particularly in uplands. I suspect that these are precisely the areas where these very controversial industrial wind farms will be developed. Major questions lie over these farms in terms of the contribution they will make to net carbon reduction in real terms. On the other hand, we know that native broadleaf forests contribute in a measurable way to net carbon reduction through acting as carbon sinks. We also know that they enhance biodiversity and, critically, help mitigate flooding downstream. In Wales, big projects are going on lands which would not be considered suitable for industrial or commercial forestry. Native broadleaf species are being grown on the uplands for their biodiversity benefits, for their carbon sink benefits, but also because they mitigate flooding. It has made a tangible difference downstream in terms of mitigating flooding. Why is Coillte not doing that instead of building more industrial wind farms?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Putting up these big wind turbines involves pouring masses of concrete for the bases. There are very real questions about whether there is a tangible net benefit in terms of CO2 reduction when the transport costs of bringing concrete up, building roads up to the top of these mountains to put up these wind farms, and so on are taken into account. That is opposed to growing trees, which does not have all those downside consequences in terms of climate mitigation but has all the upsides from every single point of view. Coillte is not delivering. It is an absolute scandal. The Minister is right to refer to this, but we should be fighting it. It is an absolute scandal that the State forestry company cannot engage in afforestation because of flipping EU state aid rules. It is a shocker. We should be screaming from the rooftops about how mad that is. This is against a background of Europe setting these targets and telling us to be serious about CO2 reduction, carbon sinks and so on while at the same time preventing our State forestry company from doing forestry, thereby forcing it into doing other things such as linking up with the private sector in the back-door privatisation of valuable State forest and land assets.
