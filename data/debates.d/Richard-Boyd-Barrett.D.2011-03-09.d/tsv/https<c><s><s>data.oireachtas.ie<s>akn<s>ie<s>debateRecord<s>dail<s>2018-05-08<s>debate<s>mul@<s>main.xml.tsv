RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Whatever about the technical judgment and whether this issue can be raised by way of an amendment, we object to it and we expressed dissatisfaction with the decisions that were made following the meeting last week of different parties. Our delegate, Deputy Bríd Smith, indicated that she was unhappy that the course that was proposed to deal with cervical-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point is that we think those matters, the plan of action set out by the Government, should be discussed and scrutinised in this House. We are certainly not happy with it. I want to register that last week in the all-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health we asked Mr. Tony O'Brien direct questions about figures on the accuracy and detection of smear tests in the different labs. It was first said that the results could not be given to us. Then it was said the results would be referred to as A, B and C. Finally, Mr. O'Brien said that we would be given the figures. We still have not seen them. The Government is saying that will all be dealt with by the scoping inquiry and the commission of investigation-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but there are certain facts that should be in the public domain now because Mr. Tony O'Brien told us he would give them to us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He has not given them to us and that is why we want a debate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not happy with the Order because these questions are not being answered.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Regina Doherty, announced over the weekend that she intended to launch a campaign on the issue of bogus self-employment. That is welcome, although is somewhat late in the day, given that people have been protesting about this issue for years. Will the Minister's campaign include other forms of precarious and insecure employment? Today 100 film workers, possibly more, protested outside the offices of the Ministers for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Employment Affairs and Social Protection. I was there with them. It was the latest in a series of protests they have held. They claim there is rampant abuse of workers' rights in the film industry and are particularly angry that conditions attached to the €70 million per year grant of public money that goes into the film industry are not being met. The money is supposed to be attached to a condition of quality employment, which does not exist in reality. The protesters say there is blacklisting and insecure employment and that people are refused further employment in the industry if they raise issues of health and safety, overtime or excessive hours.There is no policing whatsoever of these public moneys and the precarious conditions under which many workers in this industry are suffering. Will they be included in this campaign? They have requested several meetings with Ministers on these issues and have been refused those meetings. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The problem is they do not know by whom they are employed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are these questions grouped?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We cannot have any further delay on this. It is compounding the already multiple injustices of the current housing crisis. Every single week, working people come into my office - I am sure it is happening everywhere else - who are being cut off housing lists. They may have been on those lists for ten years or 15 years. Then they are just gone because they do a bit of overtime or get a slight pay increase. They are cut off the list. That is not acceptable. Now, they are not even on a list where they will not get a house. They have no housing support available. It is not just that they will be stuck in rented accommodation. In my area, they cannot get the rented accommodation. They cannot afford it. It means working people - bus drivers and people on average wages - are being forced into homelessness and simultaneously off the housing list, or not being allowed on the housing list in the first place. Two months is just not good enough. What is the Minister of State going to do for the family that came into me this week, that - because there was a bit of overtime - has lost ten years on the housing list? The decision was fought and the council said it would put the family back on the list but the ten years were lost. That was because of a bit of overtime. This is bonkers. It is completely unfair. For years, social housing was about ordinary working people who could not afford mortgages or could not afford the private rented sector. They are now being excluded in large numbers and thrown off housing lists. What is the Minister of State going to do about it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is absolutely true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Minister of State is telling me that he can fix the case I mentioned, I will be very happy. I am telling the Minister of State that a person who did some overtime was taken off the list, and then after appealing and fighting the decision the family was told the appeal was not going to be accepted but they could reapply. Once that was done, the family lost their ten years on the list and they are back at the bottom of the list because of the overtime. That is completely unacceptable. If the Minister of State can sort that out, I would be very happy. I had a case where a working person has refused a €10,000 a year increase in pay from their employer because they would be off the housing list if they took it. Housing in my constituency would be completely unaffordable to that person. That person is actually refusing pay increases. The limits have not increased since 2011. It is ridiculous. Wages are rising at the moment, but they are not rising to a level where people can afford to buy a house. However, they are rising to the extent that people are now above the permitted limits. The housing list is being culled of people who have no other alternatives. It makes a mockery of social mix, because what is happening is that people who traditionally benefited from council housing are being taken off the list, meaning that only people on the very lowest incomes are eligible for social housing. Where is the social mix in that? These limits have to be raised urgently, and the Minister of State has to do something about people who are removed from the list because of small increases.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am telling the Minister that it is the case
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister of State doubting that it could happen?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not working in my area. Rents are so far ahead of the limits that if one is told to get HAP, one might as well pack one's bags for the hub, albeit there is a queue for that as well. The Minister must answer the question for the people who come to me who have rung 50 places, which is no exaggeration. I tell people now to take note of the number of places they have called. They may have called 80. They face eviction or are in a hub and they are ringing, ringing and ringing. Within the limits or slightly above them, there is nothing. They cannot find anywhere. The number of HAP tenancies secured by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has plummeted. What does the Minister say to the person who finally finds a place which will take HAP but where the uplift required is beyond what the local authority is willing to give? People cannot find anything else. It is obvious from going on daft.ie or myhome.ie that this is the case. What does the Minister suggest for that person? Unless he or she gets the uplift, he or she is homeless.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are being refused.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is my time reduced because I am giving two minutes-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thought I had seven.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Drip, drip, drip go the revelations adding to the scandal around the cervical smear issue, which gives us a glimpse into the dysfunction in the HSE that needs to be radically addressed. This motion deals with all aspects of this problem and proposes Sláintecare and moving towards a single-tier universal health service as the answer. I agree with that and support the motion but I really want to focus, as have others, on the CervicalCheck scandal and what that tells us about the problems we face in delivering a health service that is actually adequate for the needs of the people who depend on it. The way in which these revelations are drip dripping out is beyond outrageous at this point. It makes this scandal worse. It is extraordinary that the Minister gave Tony O'Brien permission to take up a job when the health service is in the state it is in. It is beyond comprehension. I do not care whether it was five hours or five minutes per month, although it is a bit to hard to credit when he was going to get €65,000 and €180,000 of stock options in a private US company for it. He is doing this while the health service is falling apart and the Minister gave him permission to do it last summer. I find that extraordinary. The Minister should explain how he thought this was appropriate when everybody in the country has known for several years that the health service is in meltdown. How could the Minister think that the head of the health service could do a nixer on the side? It is beyond belief. Mr. O'Brien then adds insult to injury by saying he will not turn up for a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health or the Committee of Public Accounts this week to explain himself.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is now because people are screaming for him to turn up but we were informed earlier today that he was not going to turn up. As a result of a question I asked today in the exchange with the State Claims Agency we finally revealed something that we could not drag out of the Minister, the Taoiseach or the HSE for the past week. I asked if there was a difference between the accuracy and the quality of the screening that we got because of the outsourcing to US companies. We could not get the information or the detail. Then I asked a question today and it only occurred to me today. Nobody else had asked the question, which is a simple question to a representative of the State Claims Agency. Were the ten outstanding legal cases only taken against the US companies? He revealed that it was only against US labs. No cases were taken against the Coombe. Cases were taken only against outsourced, privatised US labs. That tells us something. That tells us that the outsourcing was the problem. Why is it only them? We certainly know that the outsourcing cost us in terms of public health and transparency because the State Claims Agency stated that under no circumstances would it try to gag anybody. It was CPL that tried to gag people because profit came first for CPL. That meant trying to shut Vicky Phelan up. If it had succeeded in shutting Vicky Phelan up - thankfully for her bravery it did not - what would the consequences have been? This would not have come out and we would not have forced the crisis which now means we might address the issue and get to the bottom of what the hell was going on. The representatives of the State Claims Agency told us today that if it had been in-house, it would never have been an issue; it would never have tried to gag anybody. However, a private for-profit company wants to gag people because it might impact on its profits. While I am not saying we should not have a scoping exercise, I am saying we do not need it to draw a simple conclusion: we should stop outsourcing to US labs which try to gag people and are the only ones against which claims are now being made. Why are no claims being made against the Coombe? It is because the Coombe had a better detection rate than these private companies. The outsourcing was the problem.
