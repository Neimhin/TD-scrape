RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. Breslin and Dr. Holohan for all the work they have done. Nobody has doubts about that. Dr. Holohan said he has a concern about health workers. The infection rate among healthcare workers is very high - Dr. Holohan said it is 31%. Why is it so much higher among Irish healthcare workers than it is in other jurisdictions? It is one of the highest. Why is that the case? What advice did the HSE get on healthcare workers? I have been asking about this since the second week of March. According to the NPHET minutes the team got advice twice from the expert advisory group, on 7 March and 10 March, relating to healthcare workers. On 16 March I asked what those advices were and I still have not received an answer. I have asked repeatedly to see the advice, recommendations and minutes from the expert advisory group. This is terribly important given the high level of infection among our healthcare workers. To bring Dr. Holohan up to speed on the position, and I do not understand this, an agency nurse who was recruited by a Dublin hospital two weeks ago has tested positive for the coronavirus in recent days. She was not tested when entering that hospital, where there are many elderly people.I do not understand this. I would like to see the advice that was given by the expert advisory group in March about healthcare workers and I would like an explanation on why we have such a high infection rate among healthcare workers. How on earth can we have a situation where healthcare workers are coming in to work with vulnerable people two months into this crisis when we know there is a problem with healthcare workers' infection rate and that they are not being tested before they start work with elderly people? We then discover it two weeks later. Are healthcare workers who go to visit the elderly in their homes being tested before they do that work? Are there regular tests of healthcare workers when they are working to make sure they are not infected? I would appreciate answers to those questions. Could we please see the advice and minutes of the expert advisory group, for which I have been asking for two months?

The results are promising. I understand there are apheresis machines for the extraction of blood plasma in St. James's Hospital and that 500 people who have recovered from Covid-19 have offered to make donations, but those machines are not being used to extract that blood plasma. I would like to know what is happening there.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Reid rightly praised the healthcare workers earlier. We all praise our heroic healthcare workers. How does that correctly given praise tally with the decision to recruit healthcare workers and nurses who volunteered to answer the call from Ireland through temporary agency contracts provided by for-profit groups such as CPL Resources? Those contracts are the worst of all possible contracts. Under them, the company will not make any payment for a day on which an employee does not attend for work. This appears in these contracts under the heading "Sick pay". I mentioned earlier a nurse who, two weeks ago, was recruited, via CPL, to a Dublin hospital. She has since tested positive for Covid-19 and will not be paid under her contract. Is that how to treat our heroic nurses, particularly when we need permanent increases in healthcare worker, nurse and staff capacity? Who made the decision to recruit people via temporary agency contracts rather than directly through the HSE? The nurse to whom I refer has to self-isolate in City West. When she asked how to get to City West, she was told to get a taxi. When she asked if the taxi driver would have PPE, and know that his or her passenger was Covid-19 positive, she received no real response. That is not how we need to treat our healthcare workers. What I am saying has important ramifications when we consider that the number of people on trolleys has risen to 114. We have been talking here about people being in the same room for two hours. There are 114 people in hospitals today who are in close proximity to each other and who will be waiting for hours for healthcare to be provided to them. Is it not the case that this is contrary to public health guidance and that there should be zero tolerance for people on trolleys in emergency departments? The only way to address that is by rapidly increasing the level of permanent staffing within and other capacities of our health service, and not via temporary agency contracts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope all of those people will be made permanent. Does Mr. Reid agree that having people waiting on trolleys in emergency departments is incompatible with the public health guidance on social distancing and has to be addressed, and that there has to be a zero tolerance attitude towards it?
