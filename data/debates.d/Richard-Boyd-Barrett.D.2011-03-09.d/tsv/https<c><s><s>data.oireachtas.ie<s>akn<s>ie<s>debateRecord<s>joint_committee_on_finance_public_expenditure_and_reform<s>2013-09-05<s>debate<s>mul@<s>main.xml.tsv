RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about legal proceedings?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. Masding and his team for coming in but as time is short, I will be quick. I have one positive statement, not because I want to be negative but rather because our job, as others have noted, is to represent constituents in the problems they raise. These figures are positive and helpful and I wish the other banks had responded as quickly. I will go further in saying the banks have a way to go beyond the responsiveness they have shown in discussions with this committee. The evidence I have coming to me from constituents is that not all deeds are matching the words, although I hope the bank will carry through the commitment to be fair to customers, taking on board what has been said here. The witness has indicated the bank wants to engage with customers and if it does engage, it will do its best to come up with a fair solution. That is not happening with the cases coming to me. I have a typical example and although I will not name the persons in question, there is a working couple watching who want an answer. They have taken a massive hit on their income and therefore cannot make the original payments. They are in negative equity, etc., and have been part of a merry-go-round of temporary solutions, moratoriums and so on; they are up the wall about the issue. The woman is now pregnant and will have to take maternity leave, leaving them in even more difficulty. She has written several letters to the bank asking for a meeting to discuss something more than a short-term solution but she has not even got a response to that. She has received computer-generated letters telling her she can have another moratorium but she does not want this. She wants to sit down with people from the bank and work out a long-term solution. She wants to decide if it is best for her to engage in voluntary surrender or if there is a long-term solution to keep her in the home. During the summer, when Mr. Masding was away, I directly contacted his office and the letter sent by this person-----

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not mention names.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Those people still have not got a meeting. Will the witness explain what is going on, as somebody is begging the bank for a meeting in order to formulate a long-term solution but it is not forthcoming?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome that and I will certainly take up Mr. Masding's offer. I hope he recognises that this indicates, as others have noted, that there is a problem in not engaging on the part of the banks. There has been much talk this week about strategic defaulters and people not engaging but there is clear evidence of people wanting to engage but not getting the response they should get from the banks. I would like the issue to improve. The next matter relates to long-term solutions, so I ask about split mortgages. Could this be contrasted with a new product mentioned by Ulster Bank, and will the witnesses comment on a possible comparison? This is the split mortgage versus the economic concession. When many people I deal with hear about split mortgages, they do not like the idea of having to pay one part of the split for 25 years-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chairman could give me the chance to ask my question. At the end of the process these people would be left with a huge debt that would have to be paid off before selling the house. What is the difference between that and the economic concession and is the economic concession possibly a better deal?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. Bertók. I cannot see him at the moment but I will try to talk to his disembodied voice. I am new and trying to navigate my way around the parameters of the debate on the issue. It might be useful for us to see some contrasts between how various countries deal with some of the issues of how one balances different competing imperatives. Broadly speaking, I am in favour of the fullest possible transparency when it comes to influencing decision making of Government, local authorities, State bodies and in particular commercial interests. One has that imperative, but at a grassroots level, following on from the previous speaker, at a local constituency level if we were to register every time constituents engaged with public officials in order to influence them it would be so burdensome that no constituent would ever do it and no public representative would do anything else other than fill out forms. I understand the distinction Mr. Bertók made between a public representative who is representing a specific commercial interest and one who is just representing constituents. There are many grey areas.To take one issue as an example, many small businesses are in serious trouble in this country and a lot of local representatives might say, on foot of representations, that we need to do something about parking charges, rates and rents, not because they are acting in the interest of a specific business but because they are looking for solutions for what is a macro-economic problem. However, they might be spurred on to do that because of particular representations by local small business. There is a great deal of difference between that and a multinational corporation sidling up to a Minister and saying, "Put this into legislation for us" or sidling up to an MP or a TD, as they are here, and saying, "Vote for this particular piece of legislation". What would Mr. Bertók have to say about those difficulties and could he comment on the way different countries have taken contrasting approaches to getting that balance right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. Bertók for that. In a way he is throwing the ball back to us to work out these complexities, which is fair enough, but I thank him for setting out the parameters. What I understand him to say is to proceed incrementally and start with the high risk. That seems to be the general approach, and not to be too burdensome. Mr. Bertók mentioned, and my limited knowledge tells me this would be the case in the United States, that some of what we might consider the high risk groups, namely, big, well-resourced commercial interests potentially can side-step lobbying regulation by using not-for-profit fronts. Is that something that is recognised in lobbying legislation? Is it something different states have attempted to deal with by trying to bring those groups that pretend to be not-for-profit but are actually acting in the interests of particular commercial interests into the scope of the legislation?
