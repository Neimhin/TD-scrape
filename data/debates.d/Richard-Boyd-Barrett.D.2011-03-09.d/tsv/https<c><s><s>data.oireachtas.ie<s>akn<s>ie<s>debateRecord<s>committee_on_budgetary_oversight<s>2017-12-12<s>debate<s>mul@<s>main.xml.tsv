RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The estimates of what a revaluation might look like are based on a review in 2015. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This week the Central Statistics Office, CSO, estimated property prices in Dublin have increased since 2013, the year of the original valuation, by 86%. The Thornhill review is based on a rise in property prices of 26% nationally and 41% in Dublin. The CSO, however, stated the increase is actually 86%, more than double the valuation on which Thornhill operated. If the latter increase is the case, it would be fair to say that the overwhelming majority of people will see a significant increase in their property tax. Given the current spectacular rises in property prices in Dublin, many householders might be jumping nearly three valuation bands. Is that a fair comment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even as it stands, based on 2015 prices which in Dublin were less than half what they are now, 52% of households saw a jump of either one band or two. It would be safe to say that, if the CSO figures are correct, property prices have jumped to the extent that the overwhelming majority - we already had a majority in 2015 - will jump at least one band, if not two and, potentially, three. Is that fair to say?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Department of Finance suggesting that Revenue should update its estimates of the potential impact of property tax increases based on current property valuations?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How long would working out projections and estimates take?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What proportion of payments are deferred?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does an exemption mean the householder is not required to pay at all?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the number of deferrals fairly steady since the tax came in or is it increasing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the number of deferrals increasing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are most of those deferrals to do with an inability to pay?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Up to 95,000 deferrals-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Rather, it is 62,000 and that figure is rising. Their incomes are too low for them to be able to pay that tax. How much, on average, do they owe? What is the cumulative figure of what they might owe?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are no figures on how much they might owe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would be useful to get a breakdown of how much could be owed both in totality and aggregate and what the average figures in terms of liability might be. Has any analysis been done or would it be possible to do an analysis when Revenue is estimating a revaluation of the impact that might have, how much the increases in the tax would be, how many people would move from one band to another and so on to cross-check that against people's income? Revenue has figures on people's income. Such analysis would help inform us of the benefit, or otherwise, of a tax such as this one. Is it disproportionate in its impact and to what extent is it hitting people on different incomes?  As an opponent of the LPT, I believe it is regressive and will hit those with lower incomes hard and disproportionately but regardless of that being my view, it might be useful in any estimates or revaluation process to examine the impact on different income levels of a certain level of property price increase and revaluation based on those property price levels. Is that possible?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I suggest to the Chairman that such a proposal would be a good idea. Regardless of what one might think of the LPT, that would be useful information for us to have and we could recommend that.
