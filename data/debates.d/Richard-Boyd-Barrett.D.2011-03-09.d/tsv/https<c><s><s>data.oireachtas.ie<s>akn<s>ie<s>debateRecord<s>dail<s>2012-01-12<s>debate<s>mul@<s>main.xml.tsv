RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There were many cruel and senseless measures announced in the December budget, almost all of which were directed at or disproportionately hit the disadvantaged.  However, the threat of swingeing cuts to DEIS schemes which provide a life-line for some of our most vulnerable young people is surely one of the cruelest and most senseless measures considered by the Government.The Minister is aware - if he is not, he should be - that most of the people in the prisons suffered disadvantage or had special needs and literacy or numeracy problems which were not identified during previous darker times in the country.  They were lost to society and their futures wasted.  To cut teacher numbers and support to DEIS schemes which have given a life-life and an opportunity to young vulnerable and disadvantaged people to flourish, develop and contribute to society is obscene.  It is a step back into a darker age, from which most people thought we had escaped.  The Government is stealing the future of a huge number of our young, most vulnerable people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the cuts proceed, more people will end up in prison and on the streets and immense damage will be done to the social fabric of the country.  I do not understand how the Minister does not choke on phrases such as "liberate through education" and "children first" when robbing the resources that are necessary to put children first.  The Labour Party should be ashamed of itself.  Those affected in DEIS schools should come out onto the streets on the 19th of this month and protest outside Leinster House to show their anger at the cuts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I need a lot more than that to say what I have to say.  It is pleasant to begin by welcoming the basic aspiration of this legislation, which is to ensure that the rights and entitlements of agency workers should be equivalent to those who are directly employed.  That is a very laudable and long overdue measure.  In that context, I am disappointed at the reservations or outright opposition of Deputy Calleary from Fianna Fáil, who spoke about the dangers such measures represent for competitiveness in the current economic environment.  Frankly, I am amazed how economic buzzwords such as competitiveness and flexibility always seem to be more important for certain schools of thought than the rights of workers.  It just defies comprehension.While I want to make a number of specific points about this Bill and how well or otherwise it discharges its basic aspiration to give equal rights to agency workers, it is important to respond to Deputy Calleary on a general point.  From the point of view of workers and trade unionists, the use of agency workers - not the agency workers themselves - has in many cases been a dagger pointed at the heart of workers' rights in this country and right across Europe.  They have been used to undermine basic rights and conditions that workers have won and fought for over decades and, in my opinion, they have been used consciously by certain unscrupulous employers and some governments deliberately to weaken, divide and undermine the trade union movement and its role in trying to represent the best interests and rights of workers.  Anything that moves to address that problem and ensure that agency workers are not used to undermine existing wages and conditions should be welcomed.The idolisers of flexibility and competitiveness, such as Deputy Calleary, who seem to think that those things are so important, might just consider a few macroeconomic facts about our economy and the global economy in recent years.  There has been a fetish for competitiveness and flexibility which has led to the undermining of workers' rights and the idea of a permanent, safe and secure job.  The use of agency workers has played a very considerable part in trying to undermine that notion, as if there was something wrong with the idea we should have a permanent, safe and secure job.  Is that not what we should strive for?  Is that not what people like Connolly and Larkin fought for?  Was the trade union movement not built in order to get away from a situation where workers were disposable objects, hired and fired at will by unscrupulous employers?  Is that not what 1913 was all about?  In recent years, some people want to go back to those dark days, and agency workers have been used to undermine the rights and entitlements that workers have won over the years.  To my mind, that defies comprehension, but even in macroeconomic terms it has been a disaster.  Economists and the political establishment need to understand that.  The ratcheting down of wages, which happened systematically in this economy as a share of national wealth, has had disastrous economic consequences.  It is worth spelling them out, because this is rarely commented upon in the big debates about the economy.During the period of the boom in this country, the share of national wealth going to wages and salaries was reduced by 10%.  That led to a direct correlated increase in the share going to profits, shares and bonuses.  There was a reduction in the take of workers as part of the national cake, and an increase in profits going to the wealthy, shareholders, employers and so on.  The result of this was that demand had to be sustained in the economy through the extension of credit by the banks.  Banks extended credit to people whose wages were not high enough in order to fuel demand for property, retail and so on.  The demand was being fuelled on the never-never and was part of creating the bubble that crashed the economy.  The people who tried to push down wages and conditions and increase their profits helped create the conditions for the bubble which have backfired on them and led to the economic crash.It is cutting off one's nose to spite one's face for short-term gain to think that by depressing workers wages and salaries one is somehow gaining.On an international scale this fetish with competitiveness, flexibility and driving down wages and conditions has played a very substantial part in the financialisation of the global economy which played such a key part in causing the current economic crisis.  Since the late 1970s in the hunt for profits, because profits were falling from the early 1970s onwards in the manufacturing industry and other areas, there has been a move towards pushing down wages and conditions, financialising the economy as companies try to keep up their profits, and pouring money into financial speculation and into all these obscure, weird, wonderful and ultimately very dangerous financial tools that were developed for making short-term profit.  This is what companies did with their extra share of profits as they drove down the wages and conditions of workers.  Simultaneously, they were depressing the buying power of ordinary workers to buy the goods and services that were being produced in the real economy.People need to understand that the underlying reason for the systemic nature of the current global economic crisis is not only the individual greed of bankers and speculators but is precisely because of the fetish sustained over 20 or 30 years to drive down the share of wealth that goes to wages and salaries in favour of shares and bonuses which end up sloshing around in the financial markets destabilising the global economy, the European economy and the Irish economy.  This is an important macro-economic point to make.  Deputy Calleary is utterly wrong in his thinking, morally and economically.The aspiration of the legislation is very good.  Section 6 states that the basic working and employment conditions to which an agency worker is entitled shall be the same as the basic working and employment conditions to which a comparable employee is entitled.  This is excellent and it will remove the danger that can be represented by the misuse and abuse of agency workers undermining existing wages and conditions and can mean a levelling up for the rights and entitlements of agency workers themselves.  If Deputy Heydon is concerned about the excessive costs of the use of agency workers in the health service - and he is absolutely right - the way to deal with this is not by introducing this type of legislation but to directly employ them.  If this Bill leads to a decision by the HSE and other bodies in the public sector to directly employ more people because it is better value for money, not to mention far better for the workers involved, it would be a very good thing indeed.However, there is a very big problem with the legislation which comes in section 6(2) following the very laudable aspiration I outlined.  It states:This section shall not, in so far only as it relates to pay, apply to an agency worker employed by an employment agency under a permanent contract of employment, provided that, in respect of the period between assignments and subject to Part 3 of the Act of 2000 and any registered employment agreement or any order under the Industrial Relations Act 1946, he or she is paid by the employment agency an amount equal to not less than half of the pay to which he or she was entitled in respect of his or her most recent assignment.This is the Swedish derogation and effectively undermines the entire point of the legislation.  It means it is allowed to pay less to agency workers, such as nurses in the health service, if they are employed permanently in a health division of an agency.  An agency can employ them and pay them less than a nurse would be paid by a hospital.  In the periods when the nurse or other employee is not assigned to a particular company or a body such as a hospital, the agency is required to pay only 50% of what the employee receives when working in the company or hospital.  What that person receives for working in a hospital can be less than an ordinary nurse receives for doing the same job.  I use a nurse as an example but it could be any employee.  In other words, agencies and employers can get around this by the agency permanently employing people and contracting them at a lower wages and conditions and paying them half this when they are not on assignment.  I put it to the Minister that if he is serious about giving effect to the central aspiration and objective of the legislation, which is to give equal rights to agency workers and full-time employees, this subsection should be deleted because it is a major loophole and way out which will undermine and subvert the central aspiration of the legislation.Section 7 allows for sectoral derogations.  There are considerable conditions and qualifications for this, all of which are generally good.  There cannot be a derogation from section 6 which contains the central objective of the legislation without there being collective agreements between representatives of the employees and employers and this must be registered with the Labour Court also.  So far so good, but the question is raised as to how to define a representative of the workers.  In this case, it is required that the union or representative body must represent 90% of the agency workforce.  It is practically impossible given the nature of agency workers for a union to have 90% membership in the agency itself.  It is entirely plausible that 90% of the workers of the company, body or organisation contracting the agency workers could be represented by a union but not the agency itself.  Putting these types of restrictions on the ability of unions to represent workers in this sector and requiring high levels of representation in the agencies themselves is unrealisable practically for the unions and therefore leads to the possibility of abuse.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, it refers to union representation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am working off notes from Unite trade union so I will have to examine it, but according to section 7 the Labour Court shall not approve a collective agreement unless in the opinion of the court the representative body is sufficiently representative of agency workers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but it mentions agency workers.  Unite states that the proportion being considered is 90%.  Even if it is less than 90% it will be very difficult for unions to have a high level of representation among agency workers because unions tend to organise in the workplace in the organisation or body and not among the agency workers.  How can they be organised?  It would be extremely difficult to do so.  This is a major problem which needs to be dealt with.There is also the question of comparators.  If the job for which somebody is being contracted has an obvious comparator within a company or organisation contracting the employees, there can be a fairly easy direct comparison.  If such a position does not exist in the company, there must be a kind of hypothetical comparison, which can be problematic as there can be a difficulty in defining the comparison.  There is a particular difficulty as there is a requirement in the directive for three types of comparability, as the comparable employee and agency worker must do the same work under the same or similar conditions, the work done must be of the same or similar nature, and the work must be equal to or greater in value than that of the comparable worker, having regard to skill, physical or mental requirements.  In equality legislation only one of those criteria must be met.  As a result, the comparison may not be broadly defined, leading to the possibility of employers undermining the ability of the agency worker to make a reasonable comparison between the work he or she does against a person doing similar work.  That issue must be considered.Section 22 concerns penalisation of employers who abuse agency workers.  I hope what is contained in the section is a mistake or a printing error and if it is not, there should be an explanation.  Section 22(2) states:If a penalisation of an employee, in contravention of subsection (1), constitutes a dismissal of the employee within the meaning of the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007, relief may not be granted to the employee in respect of that penalisation both under Schedule 2 and under those Acts.If somebody is dismissed in contravention of subsection (1), it appears relief may not be granted.  I assume this is a mistake but if it is not, the Minister might explain the reasoning behind it.There is a question of training and the need to include an element in the Bill which would give some right to agency workers to access training courses that may be available to full-time and directly employed staff.  There may not be the possibility of precisely the same rights to courses if a person is employed on a short-term basis but there should be some provision for training in employment.The key issue is the so-called Swedish derogation.  It should be deleted because if it remains, it would fundamentally undermine the entire point of the legislation and provide a way for agencies or employers to get around the central purpose of this legislation, which is to ensure equal rights for agency workers and those with direct employment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I referred to section 6(2).
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My point relates to section 6(2) and concerns the Swedish derogation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about section 6(2)?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I referred to section 6(2).
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In his reply the Minister used the future tense which means the expenses have not been repaid.  Will the Minister clarify this?  When I brought this issue to the attention of the Minister in September, the report was that Mr. Nagle had committed to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise.  The director in question had committed to pay back the money, which we should remind ourselves were claims made for expenses for travelling from Dubai to board meetings for Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company.  In that year he claimed €10,250 as against, for example, the CEO who claimed only €3,000 and a small amount claimed by another board director.  In September it was stated he would pay it back but now the Minister is stating it would be close to a year before he does so.  I find this extraordinary.  While I am at it-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The reason this is important is because these same directors and the chairman the Minister mentioned are trying to impose between pay cuts of between 20% and 30% on workers earning a fraction of what they do.  They have also forcibly made redundant five harbour police, with whom they are also involved in a dispute because they made a mistake and overpaid them and are now seeking the money back.  There is much anger and grievance because the same people making these decisions are overclaiming for expenses and not paying them back.Will the Minister confirm what precisely is the salary of the CEO of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company?  According to my figures, in 2010 he was paid €168,000 per year in total.  There was one recent monthly payment detailing how he received €14,000 per month, which would add up to €168,000.  Will the Minister confirm if, in addition, he gets pension contributions amounting to €42,000 and PRSI contributions amounting to €18,000 per year paid?  That would put the total cost of the CEO at €228,000 per year.  That is pretty awful when workers are being forced  from their jobs in the harbour and others are being asked for pay cuts of between 20% and 30%.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am talking about the CEO.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They guys giving them the axe are being paid €168,000 per year.
