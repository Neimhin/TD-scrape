RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are too many aspects to count in this Government's failure to deal with the cost-of-living crisis. Possibly, the worst of them all is the really catastrophic failure of the Government to deal with the housing crisis that is gripping this country. It is a housing "disaster", as Fr. Peter McVerry rightly put it. That failure means that we now have more than 10,300 families, including more than 3,000 children, who are homeless. There are 120,000 families and households waiting on various housing lists. We also have the vast majority of young and middle-aged working people who simply cannot afford the housing costs they face. Today we have had further evidence, in a report produced by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, that this housing crisis is inflicting incredible hardship on people now, being unable to pay the rents being charged and being unable to purchase homes. Moreover, the ESRI is now warning that the current generation of young workers and middle-aged workers are going to be put in a far worse position when they reach pension age than the generations before them. Even though the Government says it is in favour of home ownership, such are the house prices now that huge numbers of people will never ever be able to own their own home. The Government's own housing needs assessment for my area suggests that of the new households to be formed from now on, nobody in my area will be able to afford the house prices. Nobody. This means people will be prey to and trapped in a rental market when they become pensioners. When their income drops, they will be prey to the insecure possibility, even as pensioners, that they could be evicted. This all comes on top of another ESRI report from just one month ago that stated the number of households in need of support from the Government to provide them with accommodation has increased massively, while the actual level of support has dropped. Whereas 47% of people used to get social housing eligibility or support, this has dropped to 33%, which is a massive stealth cut in housing support made available by the Government. Since last December the Government has sat on a report about raising the income threshold and has refused, despite promises, to give us the outcome of that report. What is the Government going to do in response to the ESRI reports? The ESRI is a Government-funded body. Will the Government listen to it? Will the Government immediately raise income thresholds for social housing support?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Government finally bring in some rent controls to control rents so they are affordable? Will the Government start to deliver the social and affordable housing that means people who are working and struggling can afford a secure and affordable roof over their head?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why has the Government not announced the details of the review on the income eligibility thresholds for social housing and social housing support, despite a promise that this would be done before the summer recess? I will tell the House why. It is because the Government is terrified of what it will show about social housing need in this country and the cost to the State. The LDA has been in existence for four years with not one single social or affordable house delivered. I repeat, it is not one single house from the LDA. The first one that will be delivered in my area is not due until 2024. Average house prices in Dublin are €509,000. One would need a salary of €150,000 per year in order to get a mortgage on a property like that. The Government's affordable housing schemes are linked to a discount on that absolutely obscene price. In my area, average house prices are €700,000. A whole future generation of young people and working people will never be able to own their own home and will be prey to obscene rents that are being charged of €2,000 and €2,200 per month.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They will never be able to save and they will never be able to aspire to owning their own home. The Government has failed them completely and it will not even give these people eligibility for social housing support. It is obscene.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Which has not delivered one house in four years - not one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The first house, six years later.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How much will the affordable homes cost in Shanganagh?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Buy the properties.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us have the debate before the summer recess.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Because of the Government’s failure to address the cost-of-living crisis, the Cost of Living Coalition will hold another protest outside Leinster House next Wednesday before the summer recess and a further protest before the budget on 24 September. If there were not already enough good reasons for those protests, the exceptional needs payment, which the Government has been trumpeting as the solution if people are in difficulties, provides another reason to protest. A senior citizen came to me yesterday. On foot of all the propaganda about the exceptional needs payment she went to the community welfare officer to replace a 15-year-old broken cooker which would cost about €350. The community welfare officer told her she needed to get an engineer's report to certify that the cooker was actually broken which would cost her about €100, if she could get one. That is outrageous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Watson Killiney Residents Association in my area had a SLAPP taken against it because it sought a judicial review against a decision by An Bord Pleanála to grant permission for a strategic housing development by Atlas GP Ltd., a developer owned by Pat Crean of Marlet Property Group. This information is in the public domain and has been widely reported. That case has been taken against eight members of the residents association in a precise attempt to intimidate them against their legal right to take a judicial review against a strategic housing development on the grounds that it breached a county development plan, did not have a proper environmental impact assessment, EIA, and screening and so on. These eight individuals include a woman who is 92 years of age and they had agreed to an initial development of 108 apartments. However, they took umbrage when a strategic housing development then jacked that up to 255 apartments, which is a legitimate concern. That is what these SLAPPs are about. They are widespread across the world and we see them in Ireland where big corporations and wealthy individuals use the money and resources they have at their disposal to try to intimidate communities, environmentalists, human rights activists and journalists from asking questions or challenging their interests. They have to be stopped so we support this directive but, as has been said, it only concerns cross-border issues so it does not help the residents in that situation or in some of the other examples that Deputy Ó Broin gave earlier. Therefore, we need domestic legislation, particularly when we have a Government that often gives out about communities, environmentalists or residents challenging planning decisions. We need domestic legislation to secure the rights of public participation for our citizens.
