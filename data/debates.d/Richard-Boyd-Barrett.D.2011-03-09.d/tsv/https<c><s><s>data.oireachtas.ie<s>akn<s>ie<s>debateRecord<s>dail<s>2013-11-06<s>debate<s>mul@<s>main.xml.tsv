RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I propose to share time with Deputy Finian McGrath. As the finance spokesperson for People Before Profit-United Left Alliance, it is a rather depressing task to have to respond to the Finance Bill, which is a classic case of putting profit before people. It is consistent with an economic line of thinking that has continued since before the economic crash, which always put profit before people. It has had devastating consequences for the economy, the European economy and the wider global economy, for hundreds of millions of citizens across the world and most certainly for the majority of ordinary citizens in this country, including working people, young people, pensioners, the less well-off and the disabled. These are all the people who continue to be the victims of a set of policy priorities that always put the interests of bankers, corporations and the super-wealthy ahead of the needs of society as a whole and the majority of citizens. Sadly, the Bill continues in that vein. The budget saw vicious attacks instigated against young people, pensioners, the sick and - disgracefully - the chronically ill. The other side of the coin was meted out in the so-called Social Welfare Bill, and the Finance Bill continues the policy of protecting and promoting the interests of the super-wealthy and big corporations at the expense of ordinary citizens. To cut a long story short, it is consistent with long-standing Fine Gael policy to hammer away at the social welfare state and replace it with a corporate welfare state. We will nurture, protect and insulate the wealthy and the corporations and pay for it with vicious, relentless attacks on ordinary citizens. All of this is justified by spin and claims by the Government to the effect that things are improving and that the people out there do not really understand that things are getting better, the economy is turning around, we now have growth and employment and, at the end of the path to recovery charted by the Government, we will exit the bailout. I put it to the Minister of State that it is a fantasy and a mirage at best, if not completely dishonest Government spin designed to cover up the reality of what the Government is doing to ordinary people. It goes without saying that for huge numbers of people, whatever facts and figures may be quoted, the situation is not improving. Six hundred and sixty-six million euro will be taken from the already battered health budget, affecting the least well-off. Has the Minister of State or the media considered the coincidence of that figure, €666 million? It is the mythical number of the beast in the Bible. I am not religious, but we know what it says in the Bible: "Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for the number is that of a man; and his number is six hundred and sixty-six." It is said that it will bring death, pestilence and apocalypse. Sadly, this Government is deploying that number against our health service and it will bring death and pestilence to our already battered health service. That is not rhetoric; it was confirmed by the heads of the hospitals today, the consultants who said that the Government's policies and attacks on the health service are threatening needless suffering and even death for health service users.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Equally, the Government's claims about growth and employment are utterly bogus. The reality of the fall in the live register figures is explained by two things, one of which is 40,000 people leaving the country every year. They are mostly young, educated people who do not need the so-called incentive of having their social welfare payments attacked. It is very clear that they have energy and dynamism. Why, if they did not have those qualities, would they be leaving the country? How much more energetic and dynamic could one be than to leave the country when there is no prospect of work? The State is failing to provide employment and education opportunities for young people and is forcing them out of the State. That is why there has been a marginal decrease in the number of people on the live register. They are being forced out of the country by the Government's policy of austerity. The other explanation for the fall in these figures is the massaging of the unemployment figures through the creation of bogus jobs and bogus schemes, such as JobBridge, the new Gateways project or the JobsPlus project. Frankly, all of these are a scandal because they are about creating essentially a pool of cheap labour bordering on slave labour which will certainly profit the big corporation which will get employees for virtually nothing. Those employees will in many cases earn less than the minimum wage for doing what should be real properly paid jobs. In the local authorities and in the retail sector, all these so-called internships are nothing more than free labour. Of course, that is something that Fine Gael would long have wanted, but it is utterly disgraceful that the Labour Party is a party to creating a pool of cheap labour to exploit the unemployed, particularly young people, to the benefit of the big corporations which are taking advantage of these schemes. Then, of course, there are the fantastical claims about the exit from the bailout which we all are supposed to celebrate. I met the troika last week. The troika confirmed something that I have stated time and again in the Dáil, that we are jumping out of the frying pan of the troika programme into the fire of the fiscal treaty terms. We will be subject to exactly the same financial and economic discipline - the demands for austerity on us inside the formal programme - when we move outside the formal programme because as soon as we exit the programme, we must move from a 3% deficit down to a 0.5% deficit and reduce a €200 billion debt, mostly incurred because we have bailed out the banks, by one twentieth every year until we have paid off that massive debt. It will utterly devastate the economy trying to pay off €100 billion worth of debt that is not ours for the next 23 years, because that is the timeframe. People need to understand what that means. It will involve €9 billion in interest next year, a sum the same size as the education budget. When the Government states it has no money to invest in jobs and we are bankrupt, what it forgets to tell people is it has enough money to pay €9 billion in interest to the bankers, bondholders and loan sharks in the financial markets and in the European Central Bank who helped bankrupt this country. That money, which will pour out, should be going into education, infrastructure and developing jobs, enterprise and industry that could get this country back on its feet. It is a scandal. The Government continues to wheel out nonsense claims about the improved debt situation. People do not even have an idea how bad the debt situation is. It is bad enough that it is 120% of GDP. As we all will be aware, GDP is not a good measure of this economy and GNP, which excludes the profits of the big multinationals, is. On that score, Ireland's debt-to-GNP ratio is 150%, and that does not even take into account private debt, such as all the distress of mortgage debt. We are in a cycle of debt and yet the Government remains committed to paying off the debts of others at the expense of the economy and the Irish people for decades to come. This Bill merely continues on the same line of pursuing that failed policy. Some of the latest victims in this Bill are one-parent families. The Taoiseach, on 2 October, stated that one commitment Fine Gael would stick to - one of the few - was not to increase basic income tax rates. What have they done? One-parent families will see at least a €1,600 a year increase in what they must pay, even after the so-called tweaking of this disgraceful attack on one-parent families. Make no mistake about it; this is an attack on the whole family. It is not only about the father or single parent who is not the primary carer. It is a 50% cut in the tax relief that is given to families if those families happen to be separated. That is what it means. In fact, the State now has an incentive for marriages to break up because if a couple stays together in a marriage and has children, it will receive €3,200 a year by way of a tax break but if a couple with children separates, half of that money will go. It is a direct attack on children and on families which, for whatever reason, happen to separate. It is disgraceful. The new ceilings, of €1,000 and €500 per child, for the tax break on medical insurance is another disgraceful attack. It was justified as a so-called attack on what the Minister called "gold-plated" health insurance but, in reality, will affect 90% of those who are forced to take out private health insurance because the public health system is in pieces. I hurt my arm playing football last week and I had to go up to St. James's Hospital.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I walked into the accident and emergency department, which was like Vietnam. When I went to the desk and asked how long it would be before seeing a doctor, I was told it would be at least 12 to 14 hours. There were people in there in pain, bleeding and suffering. The 12 or 14 hour waiting time was mid-week, at a relatively quiet time. God knows what it is like at busy times at the weekend. That is the state of the health service. That is what the Government is doing. That is why people are forced to take out private health insurance, not because they want to pay exorbitant health premiums but because they are terrified of the state of the public health system which the Government will butcher further again this year when more people will be forced to depend solely on that public system. It is a scandal. At the same time that the Minister is doing this, there is a number of sections - I do not even have time to go into the details of them but I will at Committee Stage - with more tax breaks for high earners, such as in section 16 for what are called "passive investors" in capital allowance tax breaks. There are more corporate tax breaks for the big corporations in the area of research and development. There are more tax breaks for participating institutions - banks which happen to be in NAMA. They are going to get another bailout. Incredibly, in his speech, the Minister justifies this by saying we need to give them more tax breaks so we do not have to bail them out. This is a bailout. It is another bailout for the banks that we bailed out to the tune of €64 billion. The Minister now is going to give them tax breaks on the losses they have incurred. It is shocking. Other breaks include capital gains tax incentives for investors in new assets and trading activities, and following last year, more tax breaks for those involved in speculation on the financial markets speculating in stocks and marketable securities. It is incredible when what we need is a financial transaction tax. The modest proposal of the European Commission is that we put 0.1% of a financial transaction tax on speculation in stocks, shares and derivatives which, the Commission estimates, would raise €500 million. The Government, worse than setting its face against doing that, gives them more tax breaks. It is extraordinary. It did so last year as well. Just so that the public will be aware, the Minister has also further elaborated the new property tax breaks that it gave under the so-called real estate investment trust, REIT, system. When property tax breaks and incentives fuelled the bubble and encouraged the developers in a frenzy of greed that has wrecked this economy, is it not unbelievable that Fine Gael is doing it again by giving more tax breaks to these guys? Meanwhile, there are 110,000 families on the social housing waiting list. The Minister has put a full stop to the provision of affordable social housing, yet again prioritising the developers and big business and bidding be damned to the ordinary people who need an affordable roof over their head.The gross irony of this situation is that for a very few months in 2008, when the economic crash hit this country and the global economy, there was a very short window when even people on the ideological spectrum of Fine Gael acknowledged that maybe there were some problems with the market and that maybe, even if we did not go as far as Karl Marx, we might at least look at John Maynard Keynes and a little bit of regulation of the markets. Instead, how long has it taken for Fine Gael to revert to type and let the market rip, regardless of the consequences for society and the economy? Then we have the repeated mantras that those of us who criticise this present no alternative, when the Government knows that this is absolute nonsense and that we do it repeatedly in here. What we need when the market has failed, when there has been a 70% drop in investment - which is what is needed for this economy to restart - is for the State to step in. We need public investment. Éamon de Valera was not a socialist by any means but even he understood that an economy on its knees in the 1920s and 1930s needed the State to drive investment. That is why he created ESB, Bord Gáis and all of the public enterprises which helped to bring this economy out of Third World status and develop it as a modern economy. That is what we need. How can we do that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputies will have their chance to speak. We can do that by putting a modest bit of tax on wealth, on the profits of the corporations and on the very high earners and using that to finance a public investment programme in infrastructure, in public services and in strategic enterprises. Fine Gael claims there is no money for that. They say there is no pot of gold, that the rich do not have any money. I ask if those opposite have read the Central Bank quarterly statistical report. They should read it. The Central Bank is not a bastion of socialism or radical thinking. The statistics show that between 2011 and 2012, the amount of financial and other assets in this country increased by €16 billion, from €440 billion to €460 billion, which equates to a 3.6% increase in household assets-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputies will have their chance. They should read the Central Bank report which shows that the financial assets of some people in this society have grown considerably. We know that people who have lost their jobs do not have those assets; we know that public sector workers who lost 20% of their pay do not have that; we know that young people do not have it; we know it has not gone into our public services. Therefore, who has this money? It is an extra €16 billion, according to the Central Bank. The very wealthy have it. One need only see the rents going up all over the city. The developers and property owners who are still standing are buying up all the property at cheap prices and rents are going through the roof. They are making money out of other people's misery. Profits have increased virtually every year except for 2008, particularly for the big corporations, and yet the Government refuses to force them to pay a little bit of extra tax. In the questions I put to the Department of Finance prior to the budget I asked what would happen if we imposed a reasonably substantial increase in income taxes on those earning over €100,000 a year, with three new bands of €100,000, €150,000 and €200,000. The Department's reply was that it would yield €1.1 billion. Would it have been better to hit people earning over €100,000 a year with €1.1 billion of extra tax rather than to hammer the old, the sick, the young and the vulnerable? Of course it would. There are alternatives. Let us nail that lie and ask the Government why it chooses to protect the rich over the poor.
