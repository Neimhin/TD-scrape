RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the Tánaiste shed any light on the bizarre comments made by the Taoiseach about how young working people are supposed to raise deposits and secure an affordable home to purchase? It is not an exaggeration to say that vast numbers of people are puzzled and infuriated about the Taoiseach's advice to go to the bank of mum and dad to deal with the impossible task of coming up with a deposit or finding affordable housing. In the 1970s a couple, one a nurse and the other a council worker, could probably pay a modest rent while saving a deposit for an affordable house. Today, even in the best case scenario, that is not possible for a couple living in Dublin. A teacher on €35,000 and a clerical worker in the council, on a starting salary of €23,000, who go to EBS would be allowed to borrow approximately €240,000. If they manage to save a deposit of €27,000 they could buy a house for €270,000. The problem is that the average rent for a one-bedroomed apartment is €1,200 per month so there is no chance they can save that deposit. Two public sector workers used to be able to put money aside but after pay cuts, pension levies, USC, property tax, waste charges, increases in motor tax and utility price hikes, they simply do not have the money, especially if they have three or four children. The bank of mum and dad does not exist. It is mythical except for a pampered few in this country. Even if a couple could get to the stage of having a deposit and a mortgage, where would they find a house for €270,000 in Dublin? The answer is "nowhere". Does the Tánaiste know how many houses were available in Dún Laoghaire for under €300,000 this week? There were seven. There was none under €200,000. The average house price in Dublin is €350,000 but in Dún Laoghaire it is €600,000. This also renders the affordable mortgage scheme completely useless for huge swathes of Dublin. Will Fine Gael get real? What planet are they living on? Can they give some better advice to struggling working people trying to get on the housing ladder than to go to the bank of mum and dad?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister needs to get real here. One has to be earning €75,000 to borrow €300,000, and houses cannot be bought in huge swathes of Dublin, as I have just pointed out, for that price. What about the vast majority of people who do not have €75,000 and who, in any event, even if they did have it, almost certainly could not find a house in Dublin for that price? The scheme does not offer them anything at all, except the illusion or fantasy that the bank of mum and dad will sort it out. The Tánaiste said that there is a particular onus on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to build on public land. There is a particular onus on the Tánaiste to explain why the Government sold off the Cherrywood site to an American property speculator, ensuring that the prices in what will be a new town with the potential to solve the housing crisis in the whole of south Dublin will now be totally unaffordable. He should also explain why the previous commitment that the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, would deliver 40% affordable housing on developments such as Cherrywood has now been abandoned. Will the Tánaiste reinstate that commitment? Will he define what affordability is? Tell me what is affordable and who can afford it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am talking about south Dublin, not the whole of Dublin.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have been asking for this debate since it was originally scheduled that the regulations be disposed of by the House without debate. I will not oppose these measures. Indeed, I do not know if we have the power to do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is an overriding need to get empty units back into use. I do not have a problem with the Irish Water side of things. On change of use, the overriding imperative is to get over-the-shop units into use. There are many such units in Dún Laoghaire. In fact, there are dozens of them and they could be used to provide much-needed accommodation. I appreciate the fact that officials from the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government contacted me to discuss this matter. However, I was not entirely satisfied with the answers I received about how we will ensure that the safety and building regulations and standards will be policed and guaranteed, and that there will be checks and enforcement to ensure that these buildings are up to standard. We know that there are plenty of landlords who are quite happy to allow people to exist in squalid, sometimes horrific, conditions, often in damp apartments. There are landlords who are very capable of allowing people to rent in these circumstances and we must have guarantees that this will not be allowed to happen and that this will be genuinely policed by local authorities, given the exceptional nature of waiving planning permission in this regard. Will the Minister of State give us assurances on this? What will we do when controversial planning applications are submitted? Take the current example of Bullock Harbour, where there was significant opposition to a completely inappropriate development. That opposition led to the submission of a second planning application, which included supposedly marine-related commercial units in an effort to neutralise opposition to excessive residential development. Is it the case that a developer could choose to not use those for commercial purposes and a year later say that they are being changed to residential even when this flies in the face of the reason for which planning permission was originally given? On antennae, the issues have already been raised about people's concerns. How can the real concerns that communities have on this matter be addressed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can we not get some answers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could we have a little flexibility?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was incorporeal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We agree.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need to hear these words of wisdom.
