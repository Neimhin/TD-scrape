RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is Mr. Layde aware of the shock people who have been on a housing waiting list for 12 or 15 years will feel when they discover that because they have been included in the HAP scheme they have been removed from the list?  People have a right to feel very angry and cheated when they are removed from a housing list on which they have been for 12 years and have no chance of getting a council house, although they believed for ten to 15 years that they would in the end.  Mr. Layde has countered, as has the Minister, by saying they can transfer.  Is it not correct that they can transfer but only on medical or overcrowding grounds and that if they do not qualify on these grounds, they will not be able to transfer?  They will be in private accommodation in a private landlord's private property, the Department will deem them to be housed and they will be off the list, unless they can qualify on medical or overcrowding grounds.  Is that not true?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The difference is that they will be off the housing waiting list.  A person on the list in DÃºn Laoghaire-Rathdown has a number and knows where he or she is on the list.  Although a person with a number between 300 and 500 is consigned to ten years of waiting, he or she knows that at the end of it he or she will rise up the list and receive a council house.  If a person is included in the HAP scheme, without being given any choice, he or she will be removed from the list and the ten years wait will be for nothing.  Is that not true?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not mean to be confrontational, but I have very little time.  I understand all of the points Mr. Layde has made.  I accept that the council having some obligation to tenants is better.  Let us call a spade a spade.  People who have been on the housing waiting list for years and who previously had an entitlement to a council house will be removed from the list and no longer have that entitlement.  Is that not a fact?  When will people be told this?  Will they be told when they are forced onto the HAP scheme?  Although Mr. Layde has said people will not be treated any less favourably than if they were on the list, the only grounds on which one can secure a transfer are medical and overcrowding.  Tens of thousands of families who previously had an expectation of being given a council house but who do not fit these criteria will not get a council house.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In a situation where rents are going through the roof and landlords are pulling out of RAS arrangements when the terms are up or even before, what on earth makes Mr. Layde think thousands of them will sign up to permanent or semi-permanent arrangements with local authorities at the lower rents the HAP will require?  Is that not a cloud cuckoo land fantasy?
