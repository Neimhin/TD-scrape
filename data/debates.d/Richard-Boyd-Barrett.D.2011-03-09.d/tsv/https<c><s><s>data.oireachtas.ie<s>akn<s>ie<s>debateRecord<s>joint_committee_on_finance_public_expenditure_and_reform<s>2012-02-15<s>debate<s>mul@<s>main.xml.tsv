RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the alternative troika for coming in and for giving an illuminating presentation.  I also thank them for much of the commentary and writing they have produced on this issue over the past while.  Each of them is focusing on the IRBC promissory notes and they are more or less dispensing with the rest of what I consider odious debt.  I will summarise what I think they are saying.  In the case of IRBC, we have fully nationalised the gambling debts of the former Anglo Irish Bank and its bondholders but this is the greatest problem we have and we should concentrate on that.  While it is the largest portion of the odious debt, is there a reason - taking the same moral standpoint that this is odious and we should do something about this - that we should not apply the same logic to the odious debts of Bank of Ireland, AIB and NAMA?  Given the scale of the banking fiasco and the property bubble, would it be more accurate to say the total cost is approximately â‚¬110 billion when NAMA is included?  Will the witnesses clarify the relationship with the NAMA debt?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can Professor Whelan name the figure for the cost of NAMA and the recapitalisation of the banks?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take that point but I do not quite agree with Professor Whelan in the sense that if we should play tough on the whole debt, what has happened in Greece shows that they will be forced to write down substantial amounts of debt.  They now want to do it on their terms and with conditions.  Nonetheless, is it not fair to say there is a game of chicken going on in that we do not know what the reaction would be if we played tough?That brings me to my second question on which I would like clarification.  If I understand Professor Whelan correctly he is saying we can make a technical argument on this to the Central Bank of Ireland but does it have the capacity, in terms of deferring, suspending or extending the debt, to do that without getting agreement from the European Central Bank?  I think Professor Whelan is saying there must be an agreed negotiation with the European Central Bank.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.  Is it not fair to say that the thinking behind the ECB saying "No" is the fear of contagion?  If we say it is 0.4% of the European money supply, which is nothing, and it spreads out across the entire eurozone, presumably the ECB's fear is that once we do that everybody will start doing it, and we could potentially have an inflationary problem if it is not matched with growth.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with the witness but I would go further in terms of the entire debt and say that we have to put it up to the ECB.  We can negotiate and offer it the technical possibilities but I believe its resistance is deep rooted.  That is partly due to the inflation aspect and partly due to the big states in Europe not wanting to recognise that they are part of this problem also.  If we do not get relief on this do the witnesses believe it is unsustainable for us at every level, especially given that growth is beginning to decrease?  It is unsustainable and we will need a second bailout and the more intense demands for austerity now being visited on Greece will likely begin to visit these shores.  They are fairly intense already but do the witnesses believe a second bailout will be required if we do not get relief on these notes or some aspect of the debt?  What will be the likely consequences of that in terms of more intense demands for austerity?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With a protest backing it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They just do not care, they know it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Higgins and I have made it clear that we would go much further in challenging the whole basis on which the economic system works and in repudiating the debt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely, but we think it should be a question that arises from the topic, so we defend the legitimacy of making the point.  I ask the witnesses to state clearly something that is more than implicit in what they are saying, that is, that whether we go for a more radical repudiation of the debt or for deferment, write-down or spreading out, the problem is not a technical but a political issue.  It is about political choices that are made by our Government and by the European authorities.  That is the nub of the question.  The witnesses are saying that if there was a will, there could be a technical solution that works within those parameters - or, in our view, a more radical solution - but actually, the problem is a political one.  The choice was made by our Government and the European authorities to put the burden on ordinary people when they do not deserve such a burden.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That would be me.
