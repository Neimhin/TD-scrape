RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Many issues will impact on the Dublin Bay South by-election. One that Brigid Purcell, the candidate for People Before Profit, has been campaigning on for some time and that we hope will feature relates to the commitment in the programme for Government to deal with the wastewater problems in Dublin Bay and the ongoing discharges of untreated sewage effluent, both from the water treatment plant at Ringsend, which is under capacity, and also from multiple locations around Dublin Bay, especially when it rains. There are many aspects to this but I want to ask about one which I did not know about. There is an ultraviolet treatment facility in Ringsend that reduces the microbiological effluent in the discharges into the bay, where one in five bathers are getting sick as a result of poor water quality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is only being switched on between June and September. Will the TÃ¡naiste or the Minister ask Irish Water to switch on the ultraviolet treatment of discharges into Dublin Bay for the entire year?
