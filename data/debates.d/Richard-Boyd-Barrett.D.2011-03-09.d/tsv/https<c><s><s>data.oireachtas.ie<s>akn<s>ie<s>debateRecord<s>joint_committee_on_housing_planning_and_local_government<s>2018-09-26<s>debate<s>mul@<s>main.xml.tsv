RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When we resume, it will be with those who went to vote. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for the report. There is a lot of interesting stuff in it, including tables, statistics and facts. Obviously, I welcome some of the recommendations the authors have made, particularly the fact they argue for the merits of social housing and the point that the AHBs do not have the capacity to deliver and that there is an excessive reliance on them. However, I have to take the authors up on a number of issues where I have a bone to pick, I am afraid. They seem to be using terms like "move away from income-related rent", and I have to say this is a significant problem for me. I do not buy the idea, although I am not even sure of the economics of paying for council houses and believe we need to look into it. A lot of this has to do with how long the cost is spread over.If we insist that it pays for itself within 30 years, we are going to have to charge high rents. It will pay for itself over a long time. There are all sorts of issues with maintenance, the exact calculation of how much rent comes back and the changes in the demographics of those in council housing and the consequent changes in the amount of rent coming back to local authorities. I ask the witnesses to comment on the failure to raise income thresholds, which is one of the big problems. They should be raised significantly to achieve the social mix about which the Government keeps talking. In some instances, the Government uses the social mix to justify the privatisation of public land. That is not the way to deal with the problem of council housing paying for itself, which has been mentioned by the witnesses, or to get the social mix. We should not abandon income-related rents. We should have a much broader mix of incomes in council housing. I would go further by asking why anybody who wants to live in a council house should not be able to do so. This is the case in many European countries. I ask the witnesses to comment on that. If we say that some people are eligible for council housing because of their income and other people have to go to the private market, surely that automatically creates a stigma. Why should we not provide, in line with the requirements of differential rent, that one can pay a fair proportion of one's income towards one's rent regardless of whether one has a low, medium or high income? That would be a fair system. If anyone were allowed to apply for council housing under such a system, we would get higher revenues from council housing, which would then cover some of the maintenance issues that have been mentioned. I ask the witnesses to comment on that. I always think context is important for framing a debate like this about the financial viability of council housing. Notwithstanding the important work the witnesses have done here, surely it is important for us to ask questions about the alternative that is being presented at the moment. I refer to the financing and economics of the social housing model that is being pursued at the moment under Rebuilding Ireland. Of the 137,000 social houses that are supposed to be delivered under Rebuilding Ireland, some 80,000 will come under the HAP scheme, some 4,000 will come under the rental accommodation scheme and some 10,000 will involve leasing. The vast majority of these social housing units will be sourced from the private sector and, therefore, will be vulnerable to whatever the private sector chooses to charge the local authority for them. While there may be problems with the economics of social housing, it is superior to the current approach in terms of the cost-to-value ratio for public money. Perhaps the witnesses will comment on that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I should also have mentioned that I disagree with Professor Norris on successive tenancies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there not a strong case for successive tenancies in the interests of maintaining the coherence of communities, rather than having communities turning over all the time?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would Professor Norris like to comment on successive tenancies?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What if it leads to the eviction of family members?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will follow on from what Deputy Ã“ Broin said with a point I made to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, today about Rebuilding Ireland. It is borne out in the DCC table, which was helpful with targets and completions under the various headings for social housing both for the past three years and the years projected ahead. The vast bulk of what we hope to deliver in social housing in Dublin is HAPs. The Government keeps saying we will wean ourselves off HAPs, but the councils' targets would suggest we are not weaning ourselves off but rather ramping up HAPs. That is current expenditure out from the council rather than capital expenditure upfront with rental revenue coming in over time. Does it bother the councils that their current expenditure, according to these targets, on money going out to the private sector in the form of HAPs and RAS, will rise even if the targets are met? It will cost the councils more, and they are vulnerable to whatever the private sector decides to charge them, particularly in terms of HAPs. One can argue that there might be a leasing arrangement over a longer time, but on HAPs and RAS the councils are prey to the markets. What do the witnesses think about that? Should we not move in the opposite direction? While HAPs might be a temporary necessity, over time we should wean ourselves off HAPs and see the direct provision of council housing increase and HAPs reduce. If we do not, apart from anything else it will cost us a lot. I ask that based on the DCC figures but it is a question for anybody.  When I look at the targets for HAPs, I wonder if the councils believe they can materialise. In Dublin city for 2017, the targets are 1,579 for homeless HAPs and 1,000 for general HAPs, while for 2018, the target for general HAPs is to go up to 4,000, with 1,000 for homeless HAPs. It is thereafter to be consistently 3,000 for general, and 1,000 for homeless. They almost seem like notional figures we are pulling out of our head to meet certain targets. Can we deliver on them? I do not want us to deliver because we should wean ourselves off HAPs, while ramping up the council housing construction. Even if we set that debate aside, is it realistic to imagine we will get them when the experience we are all getting is that it is hard for people to find HAPs with the current rent situation? Even the HAPs that are secured are not secure because HAP tenants are being evicted. There are probably more than are being evicted, but the tenancies are not secure. I would like to hear the witnesses' concerns about that. I note the voids restored by DCC are quite a high figure as well, while a high figure was rejected for voids.There has been much debate about this so could we clarify that those voids are also turnovers, if the witnesses know what I mean? They are not just houses that have been sitting there forever and there are 800 projected every year. If that is true, it implies there are 5,000 or 6,000 empty council units in Dublin City Council. That is obviously not the case. Is it not misleading to say these are voids restored by Dublin City Council? They are not voids and there is a difference between a real void, which sits there without justification for long periods, and of which there are definitely some, and properties that are turnovers because someone dies or a tenancy ends and the properties must be refurbished and so on? Is it not also fair to say that in those cases, the figures are even more misleading as sometimes voids may result from the fact we de-tenanted certain blocks to knock them down and replace them with fewer units than were in the original development? Is the category not just very misleading? There is a suggestion these are additional units that we can clock up as part of our targets for delivering on social housing. I am pulling my hair out trying to figure out why certain sites do not move. There is a ping-pong game going on between the Minister and the local authorities about whose fault it is that certain sites do not move. My pet theory is there is a battle ongoing over the economics of the development of these sites. The councils are being told that they if they want to develop a site for public and affordable housing, they must tell the Department how the project will wash its face, economically speaking. That leads to pressure either to sell a bit of the land to finance the public and social bit of the site or to have some involvement from the private sector. That delays things and tied to this is the debate about what is affordability and how that level is set. Is this part of the delay in getting these sites moving? It is very frustrating trying to figure it out. The elected representatives of local authorities are saying they want the site developed and public and affordable housing but nothing happens, with both the Department and the local authority giving different explanations for this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Kenny think it will be easy for the big tranche of transfers from rent allowance to the HAP to happen? In other words, does he think there will be resistance from landlords to the transfer?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask Mr. Kenny to, please, say that again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The council does not need to borrow to construct public housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	However, if a scheme involves affordable housing, the council must borrow to fund that construction.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That complicates matters, to put it bluntly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With the greatest of respect, I did not ask the Chairman.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am aware of the political views on this issue. I want to know if Mr. Kenny is stating that because the council must borrow money for affordable housing it is a more complicated process than building public housing, for which the Department provides the funding.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Consequently, it is more straightforward to get work on a site under way and houses completed if the development comprises 100% council housing because the local authority only needs to go to one source for funding.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is an ideological view.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that. That is an ideological issue. I find it very interesting that if one just builds council estates, one can get it done more quickly because it is a simpler process. To me, that says everything. May I ask Mr. Kenny or the other witnesses one further question? On Part V developments and the 10% we get from them, the delivery level is incredibly low. In 2017, approximately 388 units were delivered under Part V. I find that somewhat extraordinary. It either indicates that the vast majority of private building is in developments of fewer than ten units or that very little private development is taking place. I would like to hear the witnesses' opinions on that. Mr. Mel Reynolds has strongly argued that very little private development is taking place and that developers are receiving planning permission and doing all sorts but not actually building houses. He stated that local authorities should step in and ask for the 10% in land, rather than wait for the 10% of completed units that might never be delivered or might be delivered very slowly. What are the witnesses' views on that issue?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. Kenny. I also had a Part V question about taking the land upfront and the council building on it rather than waiting for completed units from the private sector.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The councils would do it quicker if the developers were sitting on it.
