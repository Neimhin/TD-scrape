RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I make a point?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to raise a point of procedure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is entirely reasonable that the Chairman wants to focus on the amendments and the sections of the Bill and wants to progress the meeting.  However, I have two points to make.  Some of these amendments will be more controversial-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As much from the Minister as from us, in fairness.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Chairman to consider the point-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am being very reasonable, am I not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My second point is that I think it is fair enough when considering taxation measures to talk about alternative taxation, the different taxation choices that are being made in the Finance Bill, without getting into detailed discussions about the merits of other taxes.  It is a reasonable point to make that making decisions on one tax policy as against others is relevant.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Any tax regime has to have a moral base.  I do not accept that we can waive fairness for some perceived pragmatic gain.  I do not know how, when people who are on lower incomes are battered with taxes and are struggling as a result, the Minister of State can justify people on extraordinarily high earnings getting further tax breaks.  Many people might also ask why these executives could not be sourced from inside the country.  Are there not people here who might take the jobs?  Is it the case that one executive coming here will result in a whole firm coming here?  There is not much evidence to back up what the Minister of State is saying and there is certainly not much fairness in these measures.  I do not think one can have one tax policy for the poor or for the struggling and another tax policy for the super-rich.  It is just not fair.  Therefore, I am against it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let me explain the logic behind what the Minister of State is arguing for.  This is a two-tier tax system - one system for the rich and shareholders in big corporations and another system for the little guy.  It was Donald Trump who said taxes are for the little person.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is not and there is no doubt he has benefited from these types of tax breaks.  However, a tax system must have a moral and ethical basis and this one does not have that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the face of it this seems to be a positive amendment section but I would like to fully understand what is proposed.  It seems to be a measure to impose penalties on principal contractors who make payments to subcontractors where those subcontractors, or the principal contractors themselves, are not fully tax compliant.  I very much welcome the measure.  This morning I was up very early, at 5.30 a.m. I was on a picket line in Lucan because a number of bricklayers are picketing a site where a school is being constructed by a principal and large contractor.  The bricklayers allege, and some of the stories are quite hair-raising, that across the construction industry the business model being pursued is one where principal contractors are knowingly engaged in situations where payments are being made to people who are purportedly subcontractors but in fact are not subcontractors at all.  The allegations need to be investigated.  Some of the allegations are hair-raising and there are claims people have been told to meet in pubs where they were handed brown envelopes stuffed full of cash but no proper payslips and Revenue documentation were involved.  There are allegations of people who sign on in the North coming across the Border to get paid cash for work done here.  If any of these allegations are true then the situation is very serious.  Building workers in the industry have made the allegation that such things are happening all over the place.  They argue that it is now the business model of some of the biggest contractors in the country and is the reason they are able to submit lower bids for public contracts.  If the allegations are even close to the truth then the situation is very serious.    It is against that background that I welcome the amendment which stipulates there should be penalties imposed if money is handed from a principal contractor to a subcontractor where there is not full compliance.  What exactly is happening?  How is compliance established?  What is the criteria around compliance?  Something can look okay on paper but in reality can be easy to get around.  I want the Minister of State to convince me that the legislation will do the job that it seems to set out to do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am chewing the cud.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I got some of that but I will have to study carefully what the Minister said and pass it on to people who are dealing with it at the coalface.  I am aware the public contract side of this has to do with other Departments but major concern was expressed about the Revenue side of it.  If the RCT1, if that is what it is called, holder who is the sub-contractor is not known to Revenue, the proportion of tax they should have paid will be paid by the principal contractor or a penalty will be applied.  Am I correct in that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That seems okay but the Minister might explain the stepping of the different percentages and why that might be higher or lower for one or the other.  What is the logic of that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Before the Minister comes back on that, the second issue about which a complaint was made is that when deciding whether somebody should be in the RCT1 system, and it is quite technical, as I understand it there are criteria as to whether they fit into the RCT1 category.  Many building workers are saying they do not fit into that category but they are being put into it by the principal contractors where certain criteria must be met in this respect such as having an office and probably a certain amount of equipment but one must actually be a subcontractor rather than simply be categorised as a subcontractor, which many of these building workers say they are not.  In effect, they are being employed by the principal contractor but the principal contractor does not want to admit he or she is employing them and pushes them into being categorised as subcontractors when they are not.  That is the contention.  How is the Department of Finance dealing with that or has the Minister of State any thoughts on how this problem could be dealt with?  The workers are saying that if anybody seriously looked into the individuals who are being categorised as a subcontractor under the RCT1 system, Revenue would very quickly discover that those people do not fit the criteria of being subcontractors.  It is in that grey area that a good deal of abuse is happening.  The allegation is that the principal contractors know exactly what they are doing in this regard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Less risky in what regard?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not suggesting there is.  The objective seems to be good but I want to know if it is strong enough and if it deals with some of the problems it is alleged exist in this area.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The effect of this section is that if a charity or eligible organisation is struck off the charity register, a person who made a donation to that charity in good faith and for which they received a tax break, prior to the charity being struck off, will still get the benefit of the tax break or write-off.  Something, someone or several people must have prompted the Minister to consider the inclusion of such a provision.  What prompted the Minister to include it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The thrust of the proposed amendment gets at something very important on which, apart from anything else, the public needs clarity.  We have had a range of estimates of what the actual real effective corporate tax rate is for companies in this country, and frankly the dizzying array of estimates could do nothing other than confuse people as to the reality.  The Minister of State in his response just now introduced a new figure of 7.7%.  We now have 2%-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is 7.7% for domestic companies.  This is another figure to add to the list.  We have 2%, 6.2%, 6.8%, 8%, 10.9%, and the figure of 14% was bandied about at one stage, which was truly mystifying.  Revenue's CTS1 statistics table on corporate tax tells its own story, and the suggestions that corporations pay anywhere close to 12.5% are exposed when one looks at the CTS1 table.  Revenue helpfully breaks down the tax cases in the corporate sector into categories of profitability, starting with bands from €1 to €25,000 and €25,000 to €50,000 all the way up to companies making profits of between €5 million and €10 million and more than €10 million.  The figure for those with a profit of more than €10 million is interesting.  Some time ago I asked whether we could have a further breakdown of the corporations with profits of more than €10 million, because in reality these are the multinationals.  I was told we could not have this further breakdown because the Department of Finance stated it might allow people to identify individual companies and we could not possibly do this.  This is pretty outrageous.  What we have available to us gives us a clue as to the answers Deputy Doherty seeks.  It shows 480 companies earn profits of more than €10 million per year, and these 480 companies earn €52 billion in pre-tax profits.  The slightly lower figure for total income and gains before deductions and charges is €50 billion.  A total of 480 companies have €50 billion of the profits and total corporate profits are €61 billion.  The vast majority of profits generated by the corporate sector are generated by 480 companies, all of which earn profits in excess of €10 million.  These 480 companies pay €3.3 billion in actual tax out of the €50 billion of total income and gains before deductions and charges.  This gives an effective rate for them of approximately 7.5%.  This figure includes companies at the lower end, which might not necessarily be multinationals, which earn €10 million or a little over €10 million in profits.  Within the smaller number of multinationals in this group, which almost certainly make much bigger profits, it is certainly indicated from this effective rate that the big multinationals are those paying approximately 6% or even less in actual tax on their total gains.  Down the table, the smaller companies making smaller profits are far more likely to be paying 9%, 10% or 11%.  Already the evidence available to us suggests domestic small and medium enterprises pay approximately 12.5% or, generally speaking, somewhere between 10% and 12%, but the big incredibly profitable multinationals pay 6% or 7%.  This is just not acceptable.  This relates a little to the discussion we had on SARP, but here we are not dealing with a few hundred thousand euro but billions of euros in forgone taxes which could be going to the Exchequer.  If these 480 companies, which make €50 billion and pay €3.3 billion in tax which works out at approximately 7%, were made pay 12.5% or even 10% or 11%, which is what most small and medium enterprises must pay, it would mean €2 billion or €3 billion extra in tax revenue for the Exchequer.  This is what is being forgone because of the tax treatment of these multinationals.  This must be investigated in a very serious way.  I suspect this is happening because of the way in which these companies are able to write off a number of matters under certain headings, allowances and deductions which themselves need to be scrutinised.  One of these is the royalties paid for patents, which brings us to the issue of the patents box and whether on its abolition the much trumpeted double Irish will, in fact, be replaced by another scheme through which the same companies will be able to avoid pretty much the same amount of taxes but in a slightly different way by speaking about patents and intellectual property rights.  They will be given until 2020, which is six years, to reconfigure their tax avoidance systems and funnel all of this through royalties and intellectual property charges or however it is written down to avoid paying tax.  This seems to be what is happening.  I do not see why the Government shows no willingness to look into this or to look into what is a two-tier tax system with regard to small and medium domestic enterprises as against the tax treatment of multinationals.  I am interested to hear what the Minister of State has to say about this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State says the Government is looking into it, taking it seriously and all the rest of it.  I accept that more work has been done on it.  One might argue that this has happened as a result of the big international movement in this area and the questioning, for the first time, of the consensus around low corporate tax rates by some people who have come to the Oireachtas.  The combination of those developments has forced some discussion and scrutiny of these arrangements.  I ask the committee to consider this proposal in the context of other measures that are being imposed on ordinary citizens at the moment.  Ordinary citizens are not given a six-year timeframe in which to readjust to possible tax changes and do not seem to get the benefit of the fairly privileged access to the Department of Finance and the Minister that seems to be enjoyed by the big corporations.  It has been suggested in reports that when the Minister, Deputy Bruton, was in the United States recently, the Government was busy telling these big multinationals not to worry and reassuring them that they will not have to pay much more tax.  The Government is giving the multinationals six years to adjust while this is phased in.  It intends to consult them all along the way.  Not only are these companies being given huge reassurance, but they are essentially being given advance notice to prepare themselves for any possible adverse effects of the changes in the corporate tax regime as well.  This contrasts with how ordinary citizens are treated when they are told "here is your water tax and your this, that and the other - pay it".  They are not given six years to assess how it might affect them.  Having mentioned that contrast, I would like to focus on the need to thrash out seriously at some stage all the headings under which €70 billion in gross profits comes down to €40 billion in taxable profits.  To me, that is a three-card trick.  The ordinary citizen does not get the sort of massive tax breaks enjoyed by those who claim tax breaks on the basis that they have kids, they have to put a roof over their heads, they need lawnmowers to mow their grass, or they have a car.  I know ordinary citizens get some tax breaks in these areas, but they do not manage to reduce their gross income by nearly half - I refer to their taxable income - by the time taxes begin to kick in.  The level of allowances and deductions being given to corporations enables an enormous sum of gross profits to be reduced to a taxable figure of €40 billion.  One cannot help feeling that this facilitates pretty significant tax avoidance.  Some of this revolves around things like company cars and extravagant management expenses which, to my mind, should not attract tax deductions.  Critically, it is clear from what is available to us from Revenue, and on the basis of an obvious and reasonably fair assumption that the companies making the bulk of the profits are the multinationals, that the key area in which this is happening is the area of intellectual property.  That is where it is happening.  We have whistleblowers and everybody.  All sorts of people have analysed it.  It is a fact that they are charging astronomical figures for the royalties for the right to use certain intellectual property.  They seem to adjust the charges or royalties they pay for that intellectual property conveniently to cover the vast amounts of profits they make so that those profits are then not taxable.To my mind, that is just a scam staring us in the face. When the Minister of State states that we have to be competitive with other countries making tax offerings to these companies, he cites Luxembourg, the Netherlands and the UK, which, frankly speaking, are all the tax renegades of the European Union. Do we have to compete with the tax renegades of the European Union? We have just discovered that some big Irish companies are going to Luxembourg to avoid tax. These are the people with which we are competing. Could we not compare our tax system with the tax models in the Scandinavian or central European countries rather than competing with the tax renegades of Europe?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not think the Minister is a fool.  However, the Government and the Minister have hidden the truth about the complicity of the Irish tax system in aggressive tax avoidance by major multinationals.  There can be no doubt about that.  A two-tiered approach to a taxation liability was underlying this.  In general, in the tax code, if a company was incorporated here it was liable to tax here.  However, that was not the case for these multinationals.  We allowed the situation to persist and pretended there was nothing we could do about it.  That is dishonest.  It is a dishonesty which flowed from the dogmatic and obsessive commitment of this Government, the main Opposition party and much of the political establishment in this country to doing whatever the multinationals want.  They were afraid to challenge them in any way for fear they might run away.  This cosy arrangement with the multinationals has persisted for quite a number of years.  It was finally challenged following the election of people to the Dáil who were willing to question it and we have now discovered the truth.  That put pressure on the Government to change things.  The problem is that the multinationals then get six years to find another way around paying tax.  This is completely unacceptable and extraordinary.  Many signals have been sent and assurances made.  That is how I read some of the comments made in the last couple of weeks on foot of the announcement about the abolition of the double Irish.  These were reassuring sounds from the Government to the multinationals.  They are not to worry as they will not have to pay any more.  They will have six years to work out how to deal with it and, in any event, the Government will work on a knowledge box on which the multinationals will have an input to ensure it does not hurt their interests.  It gives another meaning to the term "double Irish".  It is one law for the super wealthy multinationals and it is another law for the ordinary taxpayer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is the section that deals with it.  It is important to put down a marker and let the public know that multinationals that have been engaged in aggressive tax avoidance are going to be allowed to persist in that for another six years.  There are questions over whether the Government is working hand-in-glove with multinationals to ensure, after the six year-period expires, the successor regime will allow the aggressive tax avoidance to persist in a new way.  The Government has said or done very little to convince me that is not the case.  The commitment by this Government has been steadfast.  It, like previous Governments, has been reluctant to look under the rock that is our corporate tax system and see the worms and maggots there.  If the Government is serious about closing down this loophole which allows aggressive tax avoidance, I do not see why it does not do it this year or, at the latest, in January of next year.  Ordinary citizens are not getting six years to adjust to austerity taxes.  Why should these companies get it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They pay more tax than the multinationals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one final straightforward question.  Why give them six years?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Give them the certainty of paying a bit more tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point was made on budget night by a small number of Deputies and me that increasing the cost of tobacco is just another regressive hit at lower and middle income families who are already in difficulty.  We do not buy the argument that it is a health measure but that it is primarily about a Revenue raising grab which disproportionately hits the less well off.  I wish to record that opposition as I have done in previous years.  Deputy Joe Higgins and one or two other Deputies have made similar points.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Chair for his concern for my health.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am well aware that smoking is a very bad habit.  I know I should give it up but I am not entirely sure that is the purpose of this budgetary measure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I find it a little bizarre that the Minister seems to be saying this is largely coming from Europe.  If it is coming from there it is also bizarre policy on its part.  To exempt green fees from membership clubs, whatever about not-for-profit-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is in section 63.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am making the contrast.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am speaking about the amendment because I am contrasting the two.  To go beyond Irish dancing, my kids did breakdancing in a place in north Dublin which went out of business.  It was a brilliant school with hundreds of kids, but struggled because of the recession.  It did its best to stay above water.  I did not even consider the VAT issue.  Following from what the Minister stated, it would have been subject to VAT.  If it had obtained an exemption from VAT it probably would have made quite a difference to its prospects for survival.  At the time when it was on the brink of going out of business I brought representatives from the school to meet the former Minister, Deputy Deenihan, to see whether anything could be done to save it. It was evident, whatever about formal curricula, that this was healthy exercise. In terms of dance, it was innovative. It was as positive an activity as one could get children to do. It seems strange that Europe would say it will give a VAT exemption to member-owned golf club green fees but it will not give it to something like this or Irish dancing. It does not add up. I do not understand the logic of the policy. Member-owned golf clubs hardly qualify as a group that needs a particular exemption if, in other areas, like dance, the EU only allows exemptions if it categorises the activity as educational and it has a curriculum. How do these two activities compare?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hundreds.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would say they would have been above that annual total amount.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a matter of interest, if they did so, particularly in an area such as dance where there is innovation, change and development and which is not static, would they-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that 80% of the interest?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister seems to be giving a get out of jail card to people involved in deliberate tax avoidance.  If the boycott campaign against the water charges does not succeed in bringing about their abolition, in the next budget or the one after that will he adopt a similar attitude towards the penalties the Government plans to impose on water charges?  That would be consistent with the logic he is applying now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the same latitude be shown if people decide, as a protest against water charges, to boycott them for a year or so to see if they can secure the abolition of water charges?  If they do not succeed when two years have elapsed will the Minister say "Fair enough, we will not bother penalising you.  You had a crack at it but it did not work out so we are going to go soft on you to get you back in"?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is.  If he can direct Revenue then he can direct Irish Water.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a regressive tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It definitely is a regressive tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, it definitely is a regressive tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 93:93. In page 119, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:
Amendment of section 10(A) of Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012
92. The Finance (Local Property Tax) Act 2012 is amended in section 10(A) by substituting the following subsection for subsection (3)—"(3) Notwithstanding subsection (1) and (2) and subject to subsection (4), the Minister for the Environment Community and Local Government shall ensure in the making of regulations, that a residential property shall not, for the purposes of this Act, be regarded as a relevant residential property if a certificate has been issued in relation to it having a building condition assessment damage rating of 2, or a building condition assessment damage rating of 1 with progression; and has either been accepted by the Pyrite Remediation Board for remediation, or is in any area where the presence of pyrite has been established, regardless of whether a hardcore infill test has been carried out.".I am moving this amendment on behalf of Deputy Clare Daly.  Thankfully, pyrite is not something that affects my constituency but I am aware of the trauma many families have been put through because their houses are affected by it.  This amendment seeks an exemption from the local property tax on the basis that one's house is affected by pyrite.  Deputy Daly told me that the requirement on the homeowner to get a hardcore infill test is more costly than the exemption from the local property tax and she proposes, on behalf of families whose houses are affected by pyrite, that there should be a much lighter requirement on householders to prove their houses are affected by pyrite and that they should be exempted from the local property tax.  She told me the Department is aware of this and is supposed to be working on it.  I hope the Minister is positive in his response.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the new Chairman of the committee for his excellent chairing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank also all the officials for their work.  Notwithstanding the fact that we disagree on quite a number of issues, I thank the Minister for his succinct and sometimes witty defence of the Finance Bill.
