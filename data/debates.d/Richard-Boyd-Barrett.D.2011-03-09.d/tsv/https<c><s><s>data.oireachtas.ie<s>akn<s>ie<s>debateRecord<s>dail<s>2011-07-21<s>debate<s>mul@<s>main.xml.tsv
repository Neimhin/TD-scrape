RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Everybody deserves a break.  Whatever differences I have with the Members on the other side of the House, I recognise it has been a fairly intense few months in here and all of us have a difficult situation to deal with.  I do not doubt that Members have been working hard in their own way by their own lights in order to attempt to deal with the situation.Also, it is important to dispel the myth that politicians will all be swanning off for the next six or eight weeks on holidays.  They deserve a break and no doubt will take one, but many of them will be working for most of that time, either in their constituencies or on the issues that affect the country.That being said, however, there is a strong and legitimate case for keeping the Dáil convened for a few more days.  First, the issue of the European summit is a serious matter.  While there are some positive noises about what may happen there in terms of trying to deal with the debt crisis, there have been similar sounds before previous summits which turned out to be quite other than what people hoped and the contagion spread.  People are anxious and deserve to hear a full report and to have this House interrogate fully the outcome of that summit.In particular, one element of the Taoiseach's speech yesterday in terms of what might come out of that summit alarmed me greatly and if any such arrangement is put in place, it is certainly something that we need to discuss.  It is that if there was any talk of lengthening the maturities on loans and lowering interest rates, it may include a collateral arrangement where appropriate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just want to make a point.  That is a very serious question.  That means assets of the State would be used as collateral against changes in interest rates.  That is a serious business and we need to know if that is the case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Another reason is the issue of the JLCs and the uncertainty that faces those low-paid workers.Another reason is the Dáil owes it to a vulnerable section of society to clarify whether it will have the educational supports it needs come September.  Heading into the summer, parents of children with special needs who have been refused applications for special needs assistants need to know whether they will have them in the autumn.  There are 400 or so held over, but it is uncertain for many parents whether they will have them.  The Dáil has an obligation to the parents of the most vulnerable children in this country to clarify that situation before the summer break.Lastly, I have asked since the publication of the McCarthy report for some discussion in this House about what State assets may be on the chopping block for sale in order to pay off the bankers and bondholders and I have been referred constantly to the Chief Whip.  We have asked the Chief Whip in meeting after meeting to have this discussion and the Government consistently refuses to discuss the question of billions of euro in State assets that may be up for sale.  We should not adjourn the Dáil until that matter is discussed and clarified and the public gets a chance to know what may be up for sale to pay off bondholders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chairman told us yesterday he was going to be there.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the efforts to reform the Dáil.  Although I was not here before to know what it was like, we felt some frustration at the procedures and protocols when it came to making the Dáil a place that can really be responsive to the issues that confront the country and which are brought to us by the public.  I welcome the fact that the suggestions to bring in a stricter dress code were taken off the agenda, because people are overwhelmingly interested in political substance and not in style.There are several good things in these proposals.  Changing the Adjournment debates to topical debates and taking them in the middle of the day is a very positive proposal.  The extension of Dáil sitting time on Tuesday and Friday to allow Private Members' Bills is a very positive move.  There may be more required, but I welcome the fact that the Government sees this as the first part of a review of these procedures.  It is a welcome change that we can question ministerial answers, as they are sometimes unsatisfactory.  I should have a better knowledge of the standing orders, but it would be good if we moved away from completely scripted responses from the Government.  Frankly, it is often difficult to work out what people are saying when they are reading from scripts.More people should be in the Chamber for Ministers' questions.  That is a basic reform that would reflect the public's expectations, which is to see more people in here.  If we want to be heard, we should come in here.  That seems to be a very reasonable proposal.I would like to see some change in the Order of Business.  This is not a criticism of the Ceann Comhairle, who is simply operating according to existing standing orders.  I would like to see those standing orders loosened up a bit, not to make it a free-for-all, but to allow for very topical current issues to be raised at that point.People Before Profit and the Socialist Party are entitled to some party support, but we agree with the technical group that independents should have some support.  People like Deputy Murphy are doing great amounts of work, but they do not get the resources that political parties receive for doing that work.  It seems only fair and reasonable that they should get some support for that.Substantially reducing the amount of time allowed for questions to the Taoiseach in the Dáil is a retrograde step and I ask the Government to reconsider it.  Time should be allocated on two days, but if it is to be reduced to one day, why not make it as long as Ministers' questions?  These last an hour and a quarter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what we said.
