RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also object to the guillotine being imposed on this legislation. It is clear that the banks are not willing to engage in the sort of debt write-down that is necessary to deal with this suffocating burden of distressed mortgage debt. In that context, serious questions need to be asked and teased out about whether this legislation will achieve the aim of dealing with the problem of mortgage distress. For our part, we do not believe that allowing banks to have the sort of veto that this legislation gives them will result in the sort of relief that distressed mortgage-holders require. The Government Chief Whip is beginning to look a bit like Madame Defarge, with his predilection for guillotines coming down on important legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The guillotine should be lifted to allow for proper scrutiny of this most important legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The sale by Coillte this week of 1,000 acres of public land, bringing to 40,000 the number of acres of public forestry sold by the company in the past 20 years or thereabouts, indicates that our forest heritage is being sold from under our feet. I have asked repeatedly, in this context and in the context of the Government's stated commitment to sell off the harvesting rights of Coillte, when the forestry Bill will come before the House in order that Deputies can discuss in public what is happening to State forestry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Before I make my main points, I must correct the record. In a telling comment, Deputy Martin claimed Fianna Fáil was the first party to call for a referendum on the fiscal treaty. This is interesting, first because it is not true-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not true. Second, it indicates that even Fianna Fáil, notwithstanding its support for all the referendums, knows there are serious problems at the heart of the European project that are affecting people, and they are, amazingly, calling for a wealth tax, for which some of us have long been calling. This reveals a growing awareness among large numbers of people in this country and across Europe that these summits are not gatherings of political leaders to secure the interests of ordinary citizens or to deal with their concerns. At these gatherings, the representatives of the political elites of Europe meet to plot how they can protect the European financial system, corporate interests and the super-wealthy of Europe and shove the costs of the economic crisis down the throats of workers, the unemployed and the least well-off.While the European elite throws out a few token mentions of youth unemployment and growth, the key watchwords that were repeated again at the most recent summit, the real priorities that are emerging from these summits, are budgetary discipline, economic co-ordination and increased competitiveness, which translates into more austerity for ordinary people that is dictated centrally by Europe, along with further attacks on the pay and conditions of ordinary workers and the welfare systems to increase competitiveness, while putting more power into the hands of the European Central Bank, the policies of which, as Deputy Donnelly outlined, have worsened the situation of the European financial crash. To add to Deputy Donnelly's point, we bemoan the failure of the banks we bailed out to deal with the mortgage crisis, to lend to the SME sector or to behave in any way, as if they give a damn about what is happening to ordinary citizens in the economy, and the Taoiseach bemoans it, but he is moving towards giving more power to the institution that is dictating that policy to our banks. As soon as the crash hit at the end of 2008, the European Central Bank issued guidelines to the banks and to states demanding that even if banks were to be rescued with public funds, they must maintain profit maximisation as the key priority and should not be diverted into other social or macroeconomic goals. It was simple and clear. When Richie Boucher behaves like a belligerent thug at meetings of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, refusing to pay any attention to the interests of public representatives, it is because he is following ECB policy, which states profit maximisation is the only thing banks should care about. It is clearly the only thing they care about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The resulting costs are very clear in Irish society. Despite all the European of the year awards, the backslapping and hugs between leaders at these summits, the Taoiseach is delivering nothing in terms of debt relief and it is becoming increasingly clear that he is not even asking for debt write-downs. We are getting nothing to deal with the unemployment crisis. The Government's own medium-term fiscal framework tells us that even if the budget projections work out for the next two years, unemployment will only go from the current level of 14.8% to 13% by the end of 2015. That is what the unemployed can look forward to, a 2% reduction in unemployment by the end of 2015. In other words, there will be no end to the economic crisis and in the domestic economy growth will continue to fall. That is nothing to cheer about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have two questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Acting Chairman should not worry. I will not take as long as Deputy Martin did. The development of the banking union and supervision of the banks by the ECB is being presented as a sort of panacea to which we should look forward. Why is that being presented as some sort of positive development when the ECB, by any reasonable assessment of what has gone on, has an enormous responsibility for the failure of the banking system and the financial system in Europe? Many of its decisions have worsened that situation and its priorities seem to be entirely at odds with the concerns of ordinary citizens. Ordinary citizens and their public representatives, at least at a public level, are saying that we need jobs, economic growth and a path out of recession. The ECB's priorities are none of those things. They are about book-balancing, profit-maximisation for the banks, and insisting that public authorities should not interfere with banks when we need more interference judging by what has happened and is happening. Why is this being presented as some sort of positive development and what assurances can the Tánaiste give us that the ECB having this level of power over the banking system will improve the situation in any way? Approximately two weeks prior to the latest Council meeting, the biggest general strike in European history, if not in world history, took place. Much as the Government likes to blame me and certain people on the left for protest, it cannot blame this one on us. This was an unprecedented, co-ordinated, European-wide mobilisation of working people, of the less well-off of their civil society and trade union organisations saying this was not working for them. It is not dealing with unemployment or producing economic growth, but is impoverishing people and they want an end to these policies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our unions are planning on doing something early in the new year. What can the Tánaiste say to them? Is there anything coming out of this summit that offers them anything when the Government's medium-term fiscal outlook indicates that unemployment will go from 14.8% to 13% by the end of 2015? The promise is that we will get a reduction of less than two percentage points in unemployment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What does that offer us?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On behalf of the United Left Alliance, I wish to express our concern and disappointment. In general terms, we all want to achieve some relief for those in mortgage distress or who are otherwise stuck under the burden of significant personal indebtedness. There is a genuine desire across the House to do something about that, but it is disappointing that we have not gone a hell of a lot further in this legislation. In the amendments we tabled on Committee Stage - pretty much all of which were ruled out of order - we urged a model whereby the insolvency agency the Government intends to establish would have the power to impose fair settlements on banks. It is disappointing that the Government has not taken that road, as is the case in some other countries. The model the United Left Alliance considered was that which obtained in Norway. It appears as though Norway has many models Ireland could follow on a range of levels when it comes to managing the relationship between the State and private interests. However, the proposal was there would be much stronger legal imperatives completely safeguarding the family home, as well as an independent body that could impose a fair settlement and write-down, where needs be, on the financial institutions, that is, on the banks. This is what should and could have been done and I believe it is the only measure that will resolve this major problem. While legislation of this type to update and improve the law in this regard would be important at any stage, we are not just at any stage. We are at a stage at which the entire economy is suffocated with this stuff and where there is a serious question mark over whether it is possible to talk about anything approaching economic recovery unless this problem is dealt with comprehensively. The concern of the United Left Alliance, which has been expressed by other Deputies, is that will not be achieved with this legislation, because it does not go far enough and still leaves the whip hand with the banks. This is disappointing, particularly because I attended the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform to which Deputy Donnelly referred and I heard the Minister's response stating he is disappointed that an individual should display that attitude. However, it is clear that it is not an individual. While the chief executive officer of AIB was slightly more polite in the way he put it, he actually said more or less the same thing. The chief executive officer of Bank of Ireland, Mr. Boucher, was not terribly polite but he was doing what is logical from the point of view of a commercial entity that is a bank. If one is operating a bank on the commercial basis that such people perceive themselves to be operating it, then what they are doing is logical. It is not of great interest to them whether people are in distress or whether the economy is banjaxed because they do not give significant debt relief. That is not their concern, which is to maximise profits to restore their balance sheet. That is what they do. The question is whether Members will intervene with legislation and other powers to adjust their priorities in order that their priorities align themselves with the public interest to a greater extent. I refer to the interests of distressed mortgage holders, the economy and the public interest as a whole. In Members' conversations with them, it has been clear that they simply do not get that. They think their interests are the public interest. What emerged from the discussions is they think what is good for them is good for us. However, as it is apparent that what is good for them is not good for us, this message must be hammered into their heads in some way. On the issue of public interest directors, one point to emerge is Members must tell the public interest directors what to do. Members must hold them to account and must instruct them how to represent the public interest on the boards of banks and to go in to bat for the public interest on issues such as distressed mortgages. As I understand it, however, the Minister is stating that under this legislation, if the banks do not do a reasonable deal the threat of bankruptcy will be enough to push them to do so. However, as Deputy Donnelly has outlined, there is a very serious question mark when one has this eight-year period, rather than three years after which one can walk away. I would like this legislation to be stronger. I recognise that even with all its limitations and shortcomings - as I might perceive them - this still represents an improvement on the status quo, in which people have nothing and are in complete limbo. Consequently, it is not a case of voting against the legislation but I can tell the Minister that at this point, I consider the legislation to be inadequate and that it will not do the job. Members must register that fact with the Minister in some way and the logical way to so do is to vote against this particular amendment, which qualifies and seriously dilutes the threat of bankruptcy that a debtor can use to try to put pressure on the bank.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputy Halligan for tabling this motion and recognising in it the incalculable service which carers provide to our society and to some of the most vulnerable in it. I must say I am a bit bemused, and with no personal disrespect to the Minister of State, as to why the Minister of State with responsibility for small business is taking a motion on carers. One would have expected at the very least either the Minister herself, the Minister for Health or even a Minister of State at the Department of Health. Frankly, I do not understand why someone whose brief is very different from this is taking the issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a very telling comment-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----which in a way reinforces one of the main points I want to make. There is no economic rationale or logic to justify making life worse for carers and consequently making life worse for those for whom they care, some of the most vulnerable people in our society. There are no words anyone in the House can say to do justice to the heroic and selfless work done by carers. The working week, the working day and the working year never end for a carer; they are on call 24-seven. They may not be always working, but they are on call all of these hours. If any other worker in any profession had to work the hours with the level of intensity which carers have to do and be on call at that level to carry out the type of work and service they provide to the people they love and to our society and economy, they would be paid multiples of what carers receive. I say again nothing - no economic rationale, no talk of the troika and no talk of difficult decisions confronting the Government - can justify making life worse for those carers, and without question these cuts to the respite care grant and the absolutely unacceptable delays and refusals in terms of carer's allowance applications, delays which have trebled on the Government watch, are unconscionable and absolutely without justification. It is preposterous to speak about how generous the regime is. The generous ones are the carers. Nothing could be more generous or selfless than what they do for the people they care for and for our society and economy. They give back four or five times more to our economy than they take from it. The Minister of State should be down on his bended knees thanking them and not making life worse for them. People in the Government say rightly that money is not the issue for carers, and it certainly is not because they would not be doing it if it was given the amount they receive, but the Government states somehow this would be compensated by the review of services. Please do not make us laugh or insult the intelligence of the carers. These services are being cut. Only weeks ago I brought dozens of parents of children with severe intellectual disabilities into the Gallery to point out to the Tánaiste that respite care day services and 24-seven services have been slashed. He stated in that engagement that he would meet with the service provider, they will look at it and sort it out. They got nothing. Those services were slashed, end of story. The Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly has put through a total of €780 million worth of health cuts in the budget and we do not even know what exactly they will mean, but they will definitely mean further cutbacks in day and respite services. Do not give us the economic claptrap. There is no justification for this. Even a small bit of extra income tax on those earning more than €100,000, cutting the pay of some of the top CEOs in semi-State companies or a wealth tax would have covered this very easily. It is appalling and the Government should back off from it.
