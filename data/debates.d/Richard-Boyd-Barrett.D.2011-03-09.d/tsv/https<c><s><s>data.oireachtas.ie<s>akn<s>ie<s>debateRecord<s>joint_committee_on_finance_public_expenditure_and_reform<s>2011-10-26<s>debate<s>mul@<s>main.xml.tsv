RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The question pertains to debt and our attitude towards debt.  The Taoiseach and the Minister of State surprised me somewhat today by suggesting it was bad for Greece to get a 50% to 60% write-down of its debt.  I find that to be bizarre as it seems to make a point of principle about Ireland not wishing to go down that road.  Does the professor have a view on whether it would be a good idea for Ireland or anyone else who is faced with this debt burden to get a 50% or 60% write-down on debt?  I ask in particular because many people think it is not really our debt anyway but has been forced on us as a result of the behaviour of banks.  While I may be missing something, I find it difficult to understand how anyone looking at a debt issue could perceive a 50% or 60% write-down of debt as not being desirable.Second, on the issue of growth, I note the professor's handout suggests that everything depends on eurozone stability and so on.  I refer to the scenario in which growth begins to contract in Europe for whatever reason.  Many people, myself included, would argue strongly that the impact of further austerity measures of the sort seen in Greece being applied to, for example Italy or elsewhere in the eurozone, as a consequence of the need to recapitalise banks, can have no other effect but to contract growth across Europe.  Does the professor have an opinion on this?  Can austerity have any other impact, if it is generalised across Europe, other than contracting growth?  If this is the case, would this not choke off the single bright spark on the Irish horizon to which he has pointed, namely, the export-led growth that is taking place?  Europe is one of our key markets and if there is contraction in the European economy, we basically are banjaxed and it throws everything else out.Following on from this point, I refer to the professor's comments on the question of stimulus as an alternative to the austerity approach.  In reference to stimulus and public works programmes, he characterised fiscal stimulus measures by the State, in a manner often used by the Government when the suggestion is put to it, as the caricature of digging holes in the road for no purpose.  I put it to him that anyone who proposes fiscal stimulus would not argue for digging pointless holes in the road.  Filling in a few holes might be of more benefit but digging them appears somewhat pointless.  Most seriously, why would one argue against the merits of serious investment by the State in key strategic areas?  I refer to the development of infrastructure or strategic areas such as, for example, developing domestic sustainable power sources that would reduce our dependence on imported energy.  Given that Ireland has a high dependence on imported energy, would this not be a worthwhile, beneficial and profitable enterprise for the State to engage in and seriously crank up its investment?  One could go through other suggestions, such as developing the agrifood sector and many others one could list.  Would so doing not be better and would it not be beneficial from the perspective of growth?This is particularly pertinent because it is absolutely necessary for economic growth to have investment.  I do not know whether the professor disputes that and cannot discern how anyone could.  Is it not the case that what probably has been the major contributing factor to the recession in Ireland has been a collapse in investment?  The professor can probably provide better figures but having read the Central Bank quarterly report recently, there has been a catastrophic collapse in investment by approximately two thirds.  Those who have money to invest are not so doing.  As the State is giving its money to banks and bondholders, it has no money to invest.  If one does not invest, one simply will not achieve growth.  Consequently, we need to invest.Lastly, I refer to a subject that is rarely discussed.  The professor has stated that austerity measures are not things we want to be obliged to do and if one does too many of them, they will have a detrimental effect on the domestic economy.  However, it is pretty clear they are having such a detrimental effect.  A big problem is a lack of investment from those who have funds to invest and a lack of spending by those who have savings.  I note the reason most of those at the lower or middle end are not spending is not because they are saving but because they do not have any money.  In this context, would it not be reasonable to suggest that part of a policy of getting funds to invest back into the economy should be to tax those with assets and wealth who are not investing at present and who are not spending but who appear to have sufficient surplus money to effectively hoard it?  In a certain sense, such people have gone on strike in terms of spending or investing in the economy when that money is desperately needed.  Consequently, we should talk about taxing wealth.
