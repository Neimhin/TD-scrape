RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Minister to explain what he has just said about 2020 and 2021.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am part of the National Homeless & Housing Coalition which is involved in organising the protest next Wednesday, which I hope will see a large turnout of people who are fed up with this housing crisis and the way it is affecting them. I was involved in the set-up of that coalition about three years ago. It arose from absolute frustration at the way in which the crisis was continuing to get worse and how nothing the Government did seemed to do anything except make it even worse. It has continued to get worse since that point. I do not wish to speak too much about the past because we have to speak about the future and solve this problem but it does not give me a lot of confidence when the Minister makes statements such as nobody could have predicted in 2011 that this was going to happen. That frustrates the hell out of me and it suggests to me that the Minister and this Government have learned nothing because we did predict it and we said it very openly in the Dáil in 2011 when the Department produced a document explicitly saying that there would no longer be big capital public housing projects. Anybody who doubts that should Google the Department of Local Government and the Environment June 2011 housing policy and they will find it. I remember holding a briefing in Buswells Hotel where I had to try to explain to journalists who did not know anything about this stuff at that stage what the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, was - we did not have HAP then but we had RAS. I tried to explain to them that this statement meant that the Government was formally abandoning the direct construction of council housing in favour of outsourcing it to the private sector through RAS or a new similar scheme.I will send the Minister the press statement I sent out that week, where we warned that this policy would cause a housing crisis. One did not have to be a prophet to work this out, because even then there were 96,000 families on the housing list. It was obvious that if the local authorities did not build council houses, there would be more demand. Another point made by Members in the Dáil the following year was that the decision to allow NAMA to unload vast amounts of property to vulture funds was going to be a disaster. I really think the Minister should withdraw that statement and recognise that it was a mistake to make a formal decision to stop building council housing. Would he agree in retrospect, even if he did not see it at the time, although some Members warned about it, that it was a mistake for NAMA to flog off all those lands and assets, given that we now see a very significant portion of the people who bought those lands and property assets from NAMA, sitting on land, speculating and flipping land and ratcheting up rents and property prices through their activities? The reason it is important to make this point is that while the Minister now states that we are now going to ramp up the level of direct construction of council housing and so on, the proportion of social housing solutions in the Rebuilding Ireland plan that are dependent on the private sector still remains the overwhelming majority of those targets. Approximately 90,000 out of 137,000 houses in the Rebuilding Ireland plan will be RAS, HAP or houses for leasing. In what sense has the Government broken from the policy that was started in 2011, if that is what its plan is? Does the Minister have anything to say about the Irish Government Economic and Evaluation Service, IGEES, report from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform that is warning that not only will that not deliver secure social housing for people but will deliver very precarious housing from which people can be evicted and will cost the State an absolute fortune as the bill for housing under RAS and HAP to private landlords who we can see are jacking up rents month after month, gets bigger and bigger and becomes a massive hole in the public finances?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was not predicting any of that. Will the Minister please answer the questions I asked?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am talking about what was said about housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is not answering the question. Was it a mistake?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is talking down the clock.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked whether it was a mistake that NAMA flogged off all the property.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking the Minister whether it was a mistake for NAMA to flog off all the property.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough. I want to ask another question. Will the Minister outline the attitude of the Government to building council housing estates? I just mention in passing that Mr. Brendan Kenny of Dublin City Council said that there was no doubt that it was quicker to build just council estates than to have to do this mix that the Minister insists on, because one had to get the money from one place instead of having to go to borrow money as well for the private and affordable bits. Why does the Government have the attitude that one cannot just build a large council estate? Will the Minister explain that to me? If the Minister thinks there is a problem with building council estates, as we have in the past, is there a problem with building private estates, where there are loads of rich people all hanging out together? To me it is just blatant snobbery.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He did say quicker.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Correct.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the latest figures, there were 1,151 units built by the local authorities and approved housing bodies, AHBs, at the end of the second quarter and 1,181 acquisitions. In terms of build, the proportion of the output that is build, as against housing assistance payment, HAPs, rental allowance scheme, RAS, and leasing, is about 10%. Is that not a fairly miserable output in terms of direct build? Even if one includes the acquisitions, about 80% of the Minister's social housing output is still dependent on the private sector. It does not really give much credence to the suggestion that we are weaning ourselves off dependence on a private sector, particularly given that the private sector, as we see, is jacking up rents.That will clearly inflate the cost the State has to bear to pay for social housing that is dependent on this sector. The next issue relates to that and this is where it comes down to the human level. The Minister made the statement earlier that if the State is paying the rent of a person, his or her housing need is met. Does the Minister honestly believe that is a fair comment in respect of the many people who find themselves in HAP or RAS arrangements and who then discover the landlord is pulling out of them, which is happening regularly? Such people do not feel their housing need is being met because it is not; HAP is not secure. One could argue that RAS provides some security, although we have had extreme difficulty in my area because landlords pulled out of RAS arrangements and the council said a new arrangement could not be found. When somebody is in a precarious HAP arrangement and where there is plenty of evidence of landlords pulling out of them, how can the Minister make that statement? Is it not a bit of an insult to the people who find themselves evicted and then in hubs or emergency accommodation, having supposedly had their housing need met?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not much consolation for the people who find themselves in that difficult position. The Minister should not get me wrong. If HAP arrangements are found or if the options are provided when I have desperate people coming into my clinics, I ask them to seriously consider them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Whether they should take a HAP arrangement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a choice they have to make. They are thinking of their family.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If a family has been on a housing list for 15 years and is in a hub, and they are not willing to put themselves in a precarious position again, they have an entitlement to say it is not good enough. I do not encourage that as people must make those personal decisions that have an effect on their families. It is insulting to tell them that if they make a decision not to put themselves through a similar experience, there is no right or entitlement to do so. We will leave that pass. As long as there is a reliance on HAP, we will continue to have a significant minority of people who will find themselves in trouble again and again. That is indisputable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That debate will continue but as long as we rely on HAP, we will have problems. My next question relates to my earlier contribution. I will outline a concrete example, which is important. It relates to Cherrywood. That development could solve the housing crisis in the greater Dún Laoghaire area. At the weekend we had evidence it would not be able to do that because of the approach of the Minister and the Government over the past ten years. NAMA sold it to Hines, a supposed developer, and at the weekend that supposed developer announced it would sell 73 acres of the land. It has walked away with a fortune, although I do not know exactly how much that is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This was in the newspapers on Saturday.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fine, although it was in the newspapers on Saturday, so it is in the public domain. The company bought the Cherrywood land from NAMA at a low price and now it is being flogged, with no houses built. The company is walking away with a fortune and no houses have been built. Does it bother the Minister that land acquired from the State is being flipped and the company will walk away with a massive profit on a site we could use for public housing? Would that lead the Minister to conclude that perhaps the State should consider taking back the site? There is a miserable 10% that we hope to get so we might at least take our 10% upfront in land and build on it ourselves so we are not reliant on Hines or the next developer who buys it for speculation purposes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is in the public domain.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Cherrywood is a strategic development zone.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is my final question so perhaps I can get it out without interruption.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does it concern the Minister that this could happen to the strategic development zone and land previously in State ownership? It has such an importance for delivering housing. When that flipping of land occurs, does it prompt the Minister to think we cannot afford to wait to get the public housing we want on that land for whenever the next developer decides to build or not, given there is clear evidence of speculation on this land? Should we not take as much as we can get now and build ourselves, or God knows what will happen on the site? We might never get stuff or it might be drip-fed. It will certainly be way down the line if we are dependent on whoever fancies buying the land for whatever purpose.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not. I just do not want to depend on it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given to the private sector.
