RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like briefly to welcome the political students of Sallynoggin College of Further Education who have come to the Dáil today.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I suspect young people interested in politics hope to get from political representatives clarity and clear principles on important issues. I suggest to the Minister that when it comes to this so-called expert commission on water, what we are getting from this Government and Fianna Fáil is a monumental political fudge designed to save the blushes of Fine Gael and most particularly Fianna Fáil and leave the door open for the future reintroduction of water charges on the basis of this so-called excessive water charge. For the past two years, in unprecedented numbers, the people of this country, who have been assaulted with austerity and injustice, have taken to the streets and said they do not want household water charges - full stop. The one useful aspect of the commission's report is the confirmation of something we and the people on the streets have been saying, that Ireland does not have a problem of excessive household usage. In fact, we use 20% less water per household than Britain does, which has had charges and meters for many years. There is, therefore, no excuse or justification on the basis of water conservation for water charges. Irish people are conscientious in their use of household water. It is agriculture and industry that use the vast bulk of water, not households.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does this Government understand a simple thing called democracy and the will of the people, who have said they do not want domestic water charges? Does it understand that there is now no justification for domestic water charges? Does Fianna Fáil understand that people do not want water charges rolled up into another regressive tax by linking them with property tax? I do not know if Bertie Ahern suggested that idea to Fianna Fáil, but if he did, Fianna Fáil would want to think very seriously about rehabilitating him.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a clear mandate for this Dáil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When will the Government stop the delay and obfuscation and simply accept the democratic will and mandate of the people to get rid of household water charges, establish the right to water as a human right and pay for the urgently needed investment in our water infrastructure and conservation through progressive taxation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It should make companies like Cerberus, the property vultures and other corporate vultures pay their taxes instead of consistently screwing ordinary householders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Please do not insult the intelligence of the people who took to the streets over the past two years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The difference is they did their research a long time ago.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government never produced any research to back up false claims that these charges would somehow reduce household water usage and they were necessary to do so. I just quoted real research, facts and comparisons that have been confirmed by the water commission. We relayed them to the Government two years ago. We use 20% less water per household than Britain, which has water charges. Therefore, such charges do not reduce water usage. It is a simple fact arising from comparison. I suggest the Minister does his research. Will the Government now accept the will and intelligence of the people who have taken to the streets? They want conservation as much as the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Government wants an incentive for further conservation, why does it not introduce an actual conservation grant?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That grant should encourage people to put in water-saving devices. It has never done that. The Government is spoofing when it argues that it wants water conservation. It actually wants to impose a regressive and unfair tax on householders and the people will not be conned.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Minister does not know, the people will be on the streets in February again if the Government does not accept their will and intelligence in this matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no excessive usage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is only because of the trepidation that we feel.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Woodland League has informed me it is aware of information and evidence to suggest that farmers and others involved in forestry are cutting down trees too early, at 25 years rather than 35 to 50 years, which is best forestry practice. They are doing so because of market and price considerations rather than best forestry practice. This has very serious implications for our hopes and those of the Government that forestry will play an important role in carbon sequestration.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State's reply is extremely worrying. He repeats again and again about the market, prices, financial return and so on. I am not saying those things are unimportant but there was not a single mention of the role of forestry in dealing with climate change and to act as a sink for carbon. The Government has signed the Paris Agreement. It has made commitments and rhetorical references to the important, substantial role forestry will play in all of this, yet what we hear is that, for market reasons, trees are being cut down too young. That is what I am hearing. The Minister of State is reinforcing that market conditions are determining this. Best forestry practice is that trees grow for 35 to 50 years. If we do not, as the Council for Forest Research and Development, COFORD, suggested, have a minimum of 10,000 additional hectares of forestry a year, and currently we are at 6,000 hectares, our forest estate will be a net emitter of carbon dioxide rather than a sink. If trees are being cut down early, as they are, for market reasons, our forest estate will not be playing the role it urgently needs to play in carbon sequestration.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do I get another question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I get a supplementary question as well. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Moving to 8,000 ha still leaves us 2,000 ha short of what COFORD, the forestry research authority, has stated is the absolute minimum necessary for us to have real afforestation and for our forestry estate to be an effective carbon sink. The Brexit problem simply highlights the need for diversification away from single species and so on. That we are vulnerable in that area too-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there any consideration that market conditions are leading to us failing to deliver on our afforestation programme and its role in carbon mitigation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about new planting?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Behold the real schism in Irish politics, notwithstanding all the play acting. On the side of the landlords, developers and vulture funds, there are Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and on the other side there are people supporting this Bill, brought forward by Sinn Féin, as it would admit, as a minimum set of steps to do something about a rental emergency that is spiralling out of control. This is the major contributory factor to an unprecedented homelessness and housing crisis. The Government will not even support these minimal measures which will not even address the issue but would begin to offer some sort of certainty and level of control. It is unbelievable. From the Government and Fianna Fáil amendments we have this nonsense that we must not do anything that will affect the market. The best example, which I love, is that we need a "market-sensitive model". No, we do not. We do not need to be sensitive about developers and landlords making an absolute fortune from extortionate rents and, we should be clear, who have a vested interest in keeping rents high. Why would they want them lower? Deputies might argue that if we get supply, it might bring down the rent but it will not. At the point at which supply will begin to have a downward effect on rent, they will stop the supply. It is just like we know developers hoarded land in the past. The market and the developers will not deliver affordable rents. It is clear the Minister of State's Government does not want to deliver a position where anybody would have to pay no more than 20% or 30% of income on rent. We have not yet heard it mentioned. Currently, people are paying 60% or 70% of their income on rent in Dún Laoghaire. If the Government is not determined to achieve that position, it will not solve the crisis. It does not want to solve the crisis and the landlords who vote for the Government, even those populating some of these benches, do not have any interest in reducing the profitability of the private rented sector. If the Government were serious, it would have a social housing programme that would take all of those on the housing list into properties with council rents that are controlled and differential, based on people's ability to pay. In the private sector it would introduce rent controls and rent certainty. It is clear that whatever the Minister, Deputy Coveney, comes up with in a few weeks, it will not be rent control. That is clear, as the language is repeated that we must not upset the market or developers because we must get down on our knees to grovel to them. The idea is we must ensure they can make much money as that is the only way we can solve the problem. No, it is not. Those people made a lot of money in the last boom but it did not solve any of these problems or decrease rents. It did not reduce housing lists or make housing or accommodation more affordable. It will not do so this time either. The Government should just own up. It and Fianna Fáil represents the landlords so they should just admit it rather than offer the pretence they will do something when they refuse to accept the minimal proposals in this Bill to make some difference. Well done to the Secure Rents campaign for raising the matter but we will have to hit the streets to solve this problem as well.
