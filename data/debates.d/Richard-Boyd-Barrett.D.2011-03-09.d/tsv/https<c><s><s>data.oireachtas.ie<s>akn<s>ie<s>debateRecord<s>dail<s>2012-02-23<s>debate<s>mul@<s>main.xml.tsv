RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Everybody is delighted there has been some reversal of the cuts to DEIS schools.  It seems it is a victory for people power.  I wonder whether the Minister would agree that it is as a result of people protesting, and proving the efficacy of protesting, that there has been a reversal of these cuts which were targeted at the most vulnerable and disadvantaged schools.While that is a victory and an improvement, is it really acceptable that the cost will still be borne by the education system and school children's quality of education in general, particularly given that the schools that would suffer disproportionately from the reduction in the capitation grant funding will be precisely the disadvantaged schools, and they will be hit in another way?Of course, if one lives in a better-off area, if there are more well-off families who can afford bigger voluntary contributions, which they should not have to make in the first place as we should have a properly funded education system, at least there may be a little bit more of a buffer to make up the reductions in the grants.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it the reality that the Government will still hit the most disadvantaged students and schools in another way and this is only an indication of the need not to cut at education and at the children-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and the protest should lead the Government to think again on education cuts in general?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Needless to say, I do not accept the necessity for education cuts.  It is simply extraordinary that we will pay â‚¬3.1 billion out at the end of this month for an Anglo Irish Bank promissory note while the Government thinks it is okay to cut education.I do not see, particularly in education, how the Government - I take the point that the Minister is put within certain limits - does not recognise that this is cutting off its nose to spite its face.  If there is one area that should be critical, both in terms of its vulnerability because it is our children and its strategic importance in terms of our future capacity to develop economically and socially, it is education.  If one cuts, as the Government is doing, at the quality of education for all the students, and there simply cannot be any doubt that such will be the result of these education cuts, then the effect at every single level for the future of our society will be negative.It simply undermines any reason to believe we can find a path to recovery or a way out of this crisis if we are cutting precisely the areas which would bring us out of the crisis, namely, our young people and our education system.
