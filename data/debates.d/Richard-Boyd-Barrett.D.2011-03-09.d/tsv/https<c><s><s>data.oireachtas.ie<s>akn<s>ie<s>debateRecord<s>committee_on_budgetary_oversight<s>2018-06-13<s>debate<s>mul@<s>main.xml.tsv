Where does he think we are in the cycle? It is ten years since the last downturn. I think we are a lot closer to another downturn than people are projecting. Where does Mr. Coffey think we are in the cycle? Realistically, how much of a buffer can we create given what we know about cycles and their timeframes? Anything we can put together before the next downturn comes will be a drop in the ocean and piddling compared to the potential impact. From where does Mr. Coffey think the downturn he is assuming will happen at some point will originate? We know things about Brexit. It is a known unknown as it were, to use the American hawk's phrase-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, Donald Rumsfeld. It is a known unknown and we know what we have to do to guard against its potential impact, that is no hard borders and as little friction between ourselves and Britain as possible. At least we know what we have to do. What do we have to do to protect against the possible dangers of a downturn? From where are those dangers likely to come? To me, where we should gear ourselves up and where we should invest is dependent on where those risks are most likely to come. There is no doubt about demand for property and housing. We have a demand and we have got to meet that demand, and there are no two ways about it. Is Mr. Coffey worried about another speculative property bubble here and the fact that we are actually repeating the madness of the previous downturn, which largely resulted from property speculation? What is actually happening is that there is an awful lot of speculation and not a lot of building. That is a recipe for a repeat of the previous circumstances, particularly when one considers that the level of demand is objectively big but that, in effective terms, it is weak. People do not have the money to buy property. Are we facing into a possible property slowdown again?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In a way Mr. Coffey has hit the nail on the head. He is asking for a rational central scenario-type approach. The evidence is that is not actually how things work in this economy. Frankly, I think that it is fairly dramatic irrational movements of capital that decide when a downturn comes. We should behave rationally, but we know that capital does not behave rationally. What can we do to buffer ourselves against this? To my mind, the obvious thing to do is for us to be less vulnerable to sudden movements in capital, whether it is one foreign multinational pulling out or the property sector being completely controlled by a small number of players speculating and then deciding to flip the property. Should we not be spending our resources shifting things in that direction, rather than sticking it in a piggy bank, in the context of the areas where those dangers are likely to come from? Should we not ramp up investment to create a more sustainable economy as a buffer, rather putting resources in a piggy bank, which is like Peter and the dyke when a-----
