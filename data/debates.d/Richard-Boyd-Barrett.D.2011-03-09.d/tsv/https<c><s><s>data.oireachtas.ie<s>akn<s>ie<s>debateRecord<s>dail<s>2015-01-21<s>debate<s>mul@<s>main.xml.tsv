RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In recent weeks we have witnessed an unprecedented crisis in accident and emergency departments. At its height, 600 patients were on trolleys in hospitals. When the Minister was questioned about this issue last week, he boasted that the position had improved and that the numbers on trolleys had dropped again since that horrendous peak figure had been reached. I note that, according to Trolley Watch today, there are 431 patients on trolleys. How long will we lurch from crisis to crisis? When will the Minister get a handle on the issue?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Clearly there is some movement as a result of the crisis that arose last week but there are, as stated by the Minister, 357 people still on trolleys today. As I mentioned, yesterday there were 431 people on trolleys, some of them in wards, resulting in there being more people in wards than there should be. I note from the RTE headlines this morning reference to the fact that 4,000 nurses have resigned in the past three years, 5,000 in total have resigned over the past number of years and warning that 1,000 more are to leave in the next year. Also, some 5,000 beds in total have been taken out of the system and 2,000 beds are currently closed. It appears that the measures being taken are small in comparison with the scale of the problem, which gives little confidence that we are not going to continue to lurch from one crisis to another. As acknowledged by the Minister in his responses last week, the emergency measures being taken will lead to the cancellation of non-emergency surgery, which will affect waiting lists and result in other people in the health service suffering. Despite the emergency efforts to deal with the trolley crisis the situation is still out of control. Is it not time that the Minister listened to the nurses, who have now been forced to call for industrial action in the form of a work to rule early next month, that what is needed if we are to get a handle on this crisis is thousands more beds and thousands more nurses, significant extra resources and a reversal of the cuts that have been implemented?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was reading from the RTE headlines. The phrase "Lies, damned lies, and statistics" comes to mind.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. According to RTE, the figures it obtained from the HSE indicate that almost 11,000 nurses left the profession between 2010 and 2013 and 1,000 more are scheduled to retire this summer. Is the chaos in our health service the result of people being forced to work harder under the Haddington Road agreement, resulting in the huge culling of nurses from our hospitals, particularly our accident and emergency departments? Is it not the case that the reason nurses are flooding out of the system is because they are at their wits end and completely stressed because their incomes have been slashed, thousands of beds have been closed and billions of euro has been taken out of the health service? Nurses can no longer bear that because not enough resources, staff or beds are available in the system patients and staff are suffering. It is a disaster.
