RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to speak to our amendment. Let me say that, in spite of whatever allegations the Minister may throw at others, we are consistent in putting forward alternative proposals to raise revenue to provide for our objective to significantly increase expenditure in housing, health, education, and in other key infrastructures and services. We do so consistently every year. We have been consistent in saying that the universal social charge, USC, was an unfair austerity tax imposed on workers. It was particularly unfair, given that the Government trenchantly resists efforts to impose additional taxes, as it did during the austerity period, but it continues to be largely opposed to redistributing the tax burden in a fair way. The only discussion that ever seems to take place is a discussion about increasing or maybe occasionally slightly reducing the tax burden on the majority. Never do we talk about what we think is the elephant in the room. That is the gross inequality in the distribution of income and wealth in Irish society. If we were to have a policy objective of trying to redistribute income and wealth to move towards a more equal society, then it could be done. It could produce much revenue and it could result in a fairer society. In our view, never has that been more justified than in the context of Covid-19. Working people really demonstrated how important they are. It was the retail workers, public sector workers, transport workers, health workers, and many others who kept us going when society was shut down. They showed how important they are. They are very often the same workers who are hammered by the universal social charge and who are on much lower incomes. That contrasts with how net household wealth increased substantially in Irish society, even during the Covid-19 period. However, most of that wealth and income is concentrated in the top 10% or so of our society. We think that for all of those reasons it is justified to take radical measures to redistribute the tax burden and, through that, to redistribute wealth and income more generally. That is the logic of what we are doing. We are delighted that the Rural Independents Group has now adopted socialist policies in this regard-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Rural Independent Group's proposed amendment No. 2 is exactly the same amendment that we put forward for the past few years, so fair play to the Rural Independent Group in that regard. I would like to put this on record, and I said it during the budget. The total income that comes to PAYE workers, or to the 2.8 million workers who pay tax and USC, is €130 billion. Their total tax and USC contribution on that €130 billion is €27 billion. That is from the Department’s ready reckoner. Corporations’ total income is €203 billion and their total tax contribution is €11 billion. That is an extraordinary contrast, is it not? The corporations make €203 billion. That profit has gone up by approximately 172% in gross declared pre-tax profits since 2012. Therefore, the corporate sector makes about 70% to 80% more than workers in pre-tax income. It pays almost three times what 2.8 billion workers pay, who between them earn only €130 billion. That shows in a stark way that the workers get less and pay much more. The corporations, whose profits have gone through the roof, earn much more profits and pay much less tax. That is just unfair in our view and we will continue to highlight this. This particular amendment intersects with a number of other amendments that seek to address that, whether it is through wealth taxes, or a higher earners’ social charge to replace the universal social charge, which, for the record, we have always said should be abolished completely. We are for getting rid of the universal social charge completely and replacing it with higher bands of income tax on the highest earners with a higher income social charge. I think that is fair and justifiable. It is, in our view, the elephant in the room that is never really discussed or touched upon. On that basis, I intend to move my amendment and will be interested to hear what the Minister has to say. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The universal social charge was imposed in the context of austerity and it was a very severe additional tax burden imposed on working people. It remains, despite the fact the financial emergency has now passed. We have moved from a situation of virtual economic collapse to one of the fastest-growing economies in Europe and one in which, I repeat, profits have gone through the roof even in the context of a pandemic. We need to seriously look at the fairness and justice in that situation, something that was highlighted even more during the pandemic. Even the Government, as well as members of the Opposition, had to laud the contribution of workers who are often very on very low pay, relative to some of the very high earners in our country. In many ways they were disproportionately affected by the impact of the pandemic, either through the extraordinary work they had to do during it or through the fact they lost income because their sectors were shut down. Again, we know high earners were the least affected. They did okay. The profits of the corporations continue to rise. The Central Bank's quarterly figures, which I always find very useful, show net household wealth continued to go through the roof during that period. Mom and pop, to use Deputy Michael Healy-Rae's example, did not see an increase in what was in their purse. Yet the figures do not lie; there was a massive increase in household net wealth during that period. Who then was getting it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not just property prices, actually.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I read the Central Bank quarterly report. It tells you these things. The Central Bank quarterly report actually said there was a very significant rise in financial assets as well. This is because the rich can make money from money. They do this and did so during the pandemic. That is what happens when you have a certain amount of wealth. You make money just by virtue of having money. We are not talking about people's principal private residence in terms of making money. Yes, the value of that may increase-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----but for the record in our wealth tax we strip out the principal private residence for everybody-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and there are still absolutely vast amounts of money left beyond that. That is what we propose to increase. We are not talking about hitting the family home.We are talking about hitting the additional wealth people have beyond that. I am not quite sure what Deputy Nash is saying, but I am a bit surprised by it. Let us put it this way; the contribution of workers through tax and USC went through the roof, relatively speaking, after 2007. If I remember correctly, workers were paying approximately €13 billion in tax, pre-crash. It is now up to €27 billion. The big jump happened as a result of the USC, which has never been rolled back. We have, in effect, turned an emergency tax into a permanent tax. Every worker in this country will tell one how angry he or she is to see the little brackets around USC printed on their pay packet and the big lump of money taken out by it. I do not believe there is ever justification for the USC but, to my mind, there is no justification now given the fact we are out of the emergency used to justify it and workers are, proportionately speaking, making a much larger tax contribution than corporations or people at the very top who are so wealthy they can make money just from having money. That money continues to grow. The Minister is correct in his point about our high income social charge only replacing some of the universal social charge but, as I said in my introduction, the proposal we are making intersects with a number of other proposals we will come to in other amendments that will make up the difference. We are proposing, for example, new bands of income tax for those earning more than €100,000, €150,000, €200,000 and €250,000, which would raise approximately €3.8 billion. We would not only get the money the abolition of the universal social charge would lose us, but more when it is combined with the higher income social charge. It would probably get to the sort of figures the Minister mentioned when he asked what could be done to make it cost neutral. The sort of thing one would have to do is significantly increase the income tax contribution of those earning in excess of €100,000, €150,000 and so on.  By the way, it is again worth saying, and this is a point the Labour Party and others on the left should appreciate, that 20 or 30 years ago it was commonplace to have that level of taxation on higher incomes in the top couple of deciles. There were Labour Party leaders who talked about things such as taxing the rich until the pips squeaked. That was commonplace on the left, but it seems we have rowed back from it. The left should not row back from that, as is clear when one looks at people like Thomas Piketty who has studied these things. I know the Minister, fair play to him, has read Piketty so he knows how the accumulation and concentration of incomes and wealth have occurred since the onset of neoliberal economic orthodoxies. To my mind, it is just old-fashioned left-wing politics but it is justified now more than even when one sees the high concentrations of wealth, income and profits at the top compared with the burden working people are suffering from. When one thinks about our inability to retain and recruit workers across a number of key areas, whether it is in the health service, construction, education and all sorts of sectors, and talks to young people, they will say they are leaving in droves, and are considering leaving, because it is not worth their while living here. Their after-tax income just cannot allow them to live a decent life here whereas, if they go to Australia, Canada or elsewhere, they can. The income they will get in those countries will allow them to live a decent-quality life. We have to address that. Perhaps Deputy Nash, the Minister or others do not agree with my particular prescription but we need to start to look at this. That is the point about these amendments. We need to start to take seriously what is a legitimate and valid argument about wealth redistribution. I do not think we do that. We tend to operate on a budget-to-budget basis, tweaking this and reacting to this, that and the other thing, but we are not looking at a more strategic debate about how we redistribute wealth and income on a basis that will allow us to have a sustainable and equitable economy in the future. I will not delay the meeting any further.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 4:In page 10, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:“CHAPTER 3
Wealth Taxes

Reports
3. Within three months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before Dáil Éireann, on the amount of revenue that would be raised if he or she were to tax the top 5 per cent of households 2 per cent of their accumulated wealth less 1 million for a family home.”.Since this is part of the same package of tax proposals, we have largely had the outlines of the discussion. Deputy Nash referred to the value of wealth, what it is, who has it and so on. The Central Bank quarterly report for the end of 2021 shows that net-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This amendment is a proposal specifically for a wealth tax on the top 5% of households at a rate of 2% on their accumulated wealth while stripping out €1 million to account for the family home. We do not believe in taxing the family home because it is not the same as wealth that is additional to that, for example, multiple properties, large landholdings, large holdings of shares, large amounts of cash in the bank, etc. Those are two different types of wealth, particularly in a country where 70% of people own their own homes. I suspect that is where our approach to these matters differs from the Labour Party's, but we stand over it and do not believe that people should be punished for managing to own a family home, particularly where the State has failed so badly in the provision of social housing and the fear of homelessness or paying extortionate rents often drives people towards trying to purchase their own homes. They work hard and struggle to achieve that only to get landed with regressive further taxes on something that they have already paid for using income on which they have already paid a great deal of tax. That is our view. It is with this in mind that our proposal on a wealth tax comes about. At the end of the first quarter of 2021, net household wealth - that is after debts, liabilities and so on - was €883 billion, an increase of €89 billion in just one year. That was an extraordinary increase over 2020, which was the year of the pandemic. Tying into Deputy Nash's point, the €883 billion includes €400 billion in financial assets. That is a lot of financial assets. I do not have the exact figures in front of me, but the bottom 50% have only 1.4% of all the wealth whereas the top 10% have 53% of the wealth.It is self-evident when we are talking about that amount of wealth, 53%, which is €440 billion, in the hands of about 140,000 people. Our proposal, just so we are not accused of taxing the family home, is to strip out €1 million for those 140,000 people but we are still left with hundreds of billions of euro concentrated in the hands of that group. We are proposing a very modest 2% tax on the value of that wealth and assets. Frankly, they would not feel it but it would generate a lot of revenue. Wealth taxes are commonplace in many other jurisdictions. They were more commonplace 20 or 30 years ago and I think it is regressive that countries have moved away from wealth taxes, although some countries still have them and some have actually introduced them in the context of Covid as a sort of solidarity effort to try to redistribute some of the wealth and income. It is a reasonable thing to do. Our proposal goes slightly further than other proposals for wealth taxes that groups like the Think-tank for Action on Social Change, TASC, and the Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, have proposed over the years. Why would we not at least discuss the possibility of a wealth tax when it is done elsewhere? We can discuss the fairness of it and have a national debate about that inequality in the distribution of wealth and to what extent it could contribute a lot more money to the revenue for the public services that we all agree we need. I do not see why we would not want to have that debate. I do not apologise for pressing to have that debate every single year because, eventually, we will have that debate, in my opinion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have had the discussion and we differ, but it is simply not accurate to say that what we are proposing is regressive. It is just not accurate. We are very clear in what our proposal is, namely, this wealth tax will target the wealthiest 5%. By the way, we do not do year-on-year studies of this distribution but they were done by groups like TASC and, at one point, the CSO, which does not seem to do this on a regular basis, as it should. They both came up with figures that the top 10% had 53% of the wealth and the top 5% had about 37% of the wealth. We are proposing to design a wealth tax, or at least have a requirement arising out of this Bill that the Government would look into a serious study on how it could design a tax which would be directed at that group of people, excluding the family home. Is it impractical to do it, as the Minister suggests? Is it very difficult? We could answer those questions if we seriously looked at the matter but we do not want to look at the matter. What I do know is that the Central Bank has managed to produce figures on it, so somebody has some information about where the wealth is. Somebody has that because every single quarter the Central Bank produces its quarterly report and is able to tell us how much household wealth there is and how many liabilities there are. Also, at various times, although not constantly enough, in my opinion, we have had the CSO and groups like TASC do actual studies of the distribution of that wealth. By the way, their findings are largely in line with other global studies in the western world. There is a bit of difference here and there but, largely, that inequality in the distribution of wealth is fairly consistent around the western world. Piketty did a study of it, as the Minister knows very well because he has read the book.He knows that it is a very definite pattern of concentration of wealth that has accelerated over the past 20 to 30 years and we think that we should seriously look at it and study it. Then we can answer the question as to whether it would be too difficult to do it. I do not believe that. The argument is always made that it is too difficult to tax the rich but it is really easy to tax the workers and that is what we do. That is unfair and we should at least try to get the facts on it so that we can have an informed debate. It is simply inaccurate for the Minister to say that what we are proposing is regressive. The local property tax raises just over €500 million per year. What we are proposing would raise a hell of a lot more than that, multiples of it, from the people at the top. They might benefit by a small amount from the abolition of the property tax but what is the highest amount that multimillionaires in mansions pay in property tax? What is the highest amount being paid? It is around €1,000 per year. They might benefit by that amount but under our proposals, they will pay a hell of a lot more on the other side with a wealth tax, although it is still very affordable from their point of view. They would also, as per an amendment we will be discussing soon, pay an additional property tax on properties other than their principal private residence. Just for factual accuracy, we are not proposing something that is regressive.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have had the discussion and the Minister is essentially saying that we will scare the horses of investment. He is suggesting that the wealthy will fly out of the country if we tax them a bit more but that is an old argument that has been around forever. It is a justification for never trying to address the inequality in wealth and income. It is worth saying that the Government was put under pressure to raise the corporate tax rate to 15%. It has now done that and the world has not fallen apart. The spokespeople for some of the big multinationals that the Minister is worried might be frightened by all of this have often said that the tax regime here is not the main reason they are here and we should actually listen to that. They are here because we are part of the European market, we have an educated workforce, a certain level of political stability and so on. I do not agree with the idea that they are going to run away from the amount of profits they are making in this country, unless we do something very radical indeed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 5:In page 10, between lines 8 and 9, to insert the following:“CHAPTER 3Wealth Taxes
Reports
3. Within three months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay a report before Dáil Éireann, on the amount of revenue that would be raised if he or she were to abolish the current Local Property Tax and impose a new Non Principal Private Residence Tax on an incremental basis as follows:(a) a second home tax of €1000;(b) a 3 to 10 homes tax of €1500 per home; and(c) an over 10 homes tax of €2500 per home.”  I have frontloaded a lot of my amendments in order to get this stuff in at the beginning. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed. While I never really expected that the Minister would take on board the wealth tax or our more far-reaching proposals on corporate tax, this is one that should be considered. This amendment seeks to have a report prepared, and ultimately implemented, on getting rid of the tax on the family home and replacing it with a tax on multiple properties.This amendment makes a distinction, which the Government wilfully refuses to make when we discuss wealth because it wants to collapse the distinction between those who own family homes and people who own two, three, four, five, ten, 15, 20, 30, 50 or 100 properties. There is a world of difference between those two types of property owners. The family home, by and large, is not an asset to generate wealth for the people who live in it. It is a roof to put over their heads when access to housing is a concern for people, particularly when we are in the teeth of a housing crisis, although it always has been a concern for people. There is a distinction between that and people who rent out properties and profit from doing so. This amendment proposes a property tax that excludes the family home but imposes a €1,000 tax on a second home, €1,500 per home if one has three to ten homes and €2,500 per home if one has ten or more. When we consider the enormous rents being charged and the inflation in property values, to which Deputy Nash referred, which is part of the rise in household wealth - although it is also financial, something to which I pointed - that concentration of wealth where it has grown exponentially constitutes serious wealth for people who have two, five, ten, 15 or 20 homes. Those people are making money by virtue of the fact that they own many properties. We are proposing a very modest measure to remove the regressive burden on people who may have low incomes and are paying property tax on the value of their principal private residences and to replace it with a tax on second or further homes on an escalating basis depending on how much property one owns. According to our costing of this proposal based on the ready reckoner the Department provides, if implemented, it would raise the money to cover the loss in revenue on foot of the removal of the current property tax levied on family homes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We would be making some money for the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is an interesting admission by the Minister that if we imposed this tax on people who own multiple properties, they might pass it on to tenants. He is effectively admitting that his rent control measures will be completely ineffective. I happen to agree with him. The Government is trumpeting that it will limit rent increases to 2% or the rate of inflation, depending on which is lower. If the Minister’s proposals in that regard were to be effective, which I do not believe they will be, that would not be an issue. In the world that we would want to construct around the rental sector, we would introduce rental controls where that could not happen. Therefore, landlords would not be able to pass on the cost. We would reset rents at affordable levels through a rent authority that would set rents at an affordable level. That particular criticism does not concern us. We think the Minister can and should control rents given the extortionate cost of rents and the contribution they are making to the current housing crisis. I thank the Minister for giving the full costing in respect of our proposal. It demonstrates that implementing our proposal could raise approximately €150 million more than the yield from current local property tax.People need to know that we could remove the property tax on the family home and replace it with a tax on those who own multiple properties and by so doing we could generate more revenue and have a fairer situation as a result. That is preferable. People should know about the number of people who own multiple properties. Some 125,000 people in this country have two properties, 50,000 people have three to ten properties, and 3,000 people have more than ten properties. That is real wealth. The person who owns a second property is not necessarily stunningly wealthy but it is wealth beyond the principal private residence. One would not end up paying a lot more under our proposal because one would not be paying tax on the principal residence. One would pay €1,000 in tax on that second property but that is not punitive. It is fairer. If one had between three and ten properties one would pay €1,500 on each property and if one had more than ten properties one would pay €2,500 on each property. If one has more than ten properties one is seriously property rich and generating a lot of revenue from that property. It is a modest proposal but it would raise more than the Minister is able to raise with a tax that I and many others believe is unfair. That is the logic but I know the Minister does not agree.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Before Deputy Nash speaks to the amendment I want to point out that I have to rush off to do something but my amendment No. 9 on the special assignee relief programme, SARP, is coming up. Is there any way somebody could formally move it for me if I am not back?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would the Deputy formally move the amendment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy can speak on the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Mairéad Farrell could speak on the amendment when the end of the section is reached.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that, Chair. Trying to bilocate in here can be difficult at times. The amendment which I had hoped to move related to this section. It was amendment to look at the special assignee relief programme. This is one of the most egregious tax breaks that is given to some of the highest earners in this country. Many people are not aware of it but it really sticks in the craw of any ordinary worker who becomes of aware of the fact that there is a specially designed relief on income tax, which you only get if you earn more than €75,000 per year. The thought of that is in and of itself to me mind-boggling, that is, that there is a tax relief that you can only get if you earn approximately twice the average industrial wage. Included in that is the relief for paying fees for private schooling and for trips abroad, or home, in the case of foreign executives who are on these earnings. It is well worth saying that while the threshold for being eligible for special assignee tax relief is that one has to earn more than €75,000, the recipients of this relief earn, in many cases, a hell of a lot more than that. The Minister sent us some recent figures. I have figures from a reply to a parliamentary question that I asked earlier. The Minister might give us the updated figures. They are quite extraordinary. In 2016 there were 95 recipients of the relief who earned between €375,000 and €675,000. There were 26 recipients who earned between €670,000 and €1 million. For this year, if I remember the figures correctly, 50 people who earn in excess of €1 million will get this relief. Anybody who hears about this is gobsmacked. It is lucky for the Government that most people do not know about it. If they did, they would be enraged. People need to know about it, which is why I am keen it be highlighted as part of the debate on the Finance Bill. There should be a review of it and I hope at the end of that we would decide it is unconscionable and unjustifiable. The Minister will say that this brings executives in and Government policy is at least consistent in being all about executives and owners of some of the wealthiest multinational corporations in the world. They feel we would do anything for them. All the policy measures relating to them add up to the feeling that Ireland is a place that will do anything for them, even giving them tax reliefs on extraordinary salaries that no ordinary worker could dream of getting. This is an interesting contrast with the universal social charge. The Minister will say they pay that charge. I accept that they do, but the idea that 30% of their income over €75,000 up to €1 million would not be taxed is remarkable. Imagine what it would do for a lot of workers if they got relief at a threshold above, say, €20,000, such that 30% of their income would not be taxed. They would love it but, unfortunately, it is a privilege only given to people earning more than €75,000 or, in many cases, earning €675,000, €1 million or whatever. I do not think it is justifiable or necessary. When you are on that kind of money, do you need tax breaks additional to what everyone else is getting in order to come here? Those who do must be incredibly greedy if they are on that kind of money and want tax breaks additional to what other people get. It is important to highlight this matter and to appeal again to the Government to reconsider this grossly unjust tax relief for the highest earners.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I indicate my support for this amendment. People who were in multi-unit complexes where there were significant defects related to lack of proper compliance with building and fire safety controls, and who have had to pay large sums of money, should absolutely get some retrospective compensation for that fact. They, along with the people affected by mica and pyrite, are the victims of cowboy builders who were facilitated by the wild west approach to building development that existed in the Celtic tiger period. I pay tribute to Noel Manning, who was a slightly obsessive character on the issue of fire safety. He was an expert on it and used to knock down the doors of many Teachtaí Dála. He was always contacting us to point out the almost complete lack of proper fire breaks in buildings from that period in particular. I remember he took me out to I think, Belarmine, or one of those places on the northside to show me the lack of fire breaks. It was quite shocking when you saw how this stuff was allowed and that there were not proper controls on it or proper inspections. The people who bought in good faith ended up picking up the bill for it. It is outrageous and the Government and the authorities of the time, which allowed it to happen and quite consciously pushed a light-touch regulation policy in that area, are responsible. They should acknowledge that responsibility to people who suffered very significant financial hits as a result. These fire safety defects are consistent with those other issues of pyrite and mica and all those affected should get 100% redress. This at least would go some way to giving this cohort retrospective redress so I support the amendment and the thought behind it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even at the Maritime Area Planning Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Section 5 was opposed by Deputies Nash and Doherty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In fairness, a lot of the things are amendments but sometimes people will have genuine questions about sections.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed. It is legislative scrutiny.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to speak to section 16.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Apologies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The problem is that large numbers of Irish workers owe more money than they have. They do not have money to save. If the pension model that we have for the future is such that one third of workers contribute towards their own pensions, then two thirds will not. They cannot afford to because they are paying the USC, to name just one of many outgoings. If the pension model that the Government is depending on is one whereby it hopes to incentivise people to save for their pensions, that will not happen because large numbers of people do not have the income to do so. It will inevitably result in a situation where the more one earns, the more one benefits from the tax reliefs. If one's income is such that one benefits from the 40% relief, one will get an even greater benefit. Am I right in saying that the pensions earning limit is still €115,000?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People with fairly large earnings are benefiting substantially from the reliefs. To my mind, fairness requires a different model that addresses this situation where the bulk of the reliefs go to higher earners. Unlike some, I am not proposing standard rating because that would still hit workers in the middle. Something that we proposed was reducing the pensions earning limit from €115,000 to €60,000. According to our costings, this would generate €220 million, which could be used to benefit lower earners by increasing their pension entitlements. This matter needs to be examined. Am I correct in taking from what the Minister said that he does not quite know what the distribution of the pension reliefs across the various bands is? If so, it seems that this amendment is timely because it sets out that we need that information so that we can make an informed decision about how we structure pension-related reliefs or, more generally, come to a better and fairer model of funding pensions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 23:In page 20, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:“16. The Minister shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, prepare and lay before Dáil Éireann a report on the revenue gained from increasing corporation tax to 25 per cent for corporations with over €800,000 in profits and in closing loopholes that exist that allow corporations to hugely reduce their rate of tax.”.We had some discussion on this matter earlier. Deputy Barry can speak to his own amendment, as his is a slightly different take on it than People Before Profit's, but our amendments are considering the same area. I think that there is a drafting error in my amendment, as it refers to the Finance Act 2021. I am sure that is meant to read "Finance Act 2022". We will redraft it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The translation from-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Exactly. The Government has, under pressure, had to move towards a higher nominal rate of corporate tax.It fought hard to minimise the extent of any increase as part of the OECD and G20 process for raising corporate tax, particularly railing against the idea that there might be any latitude to go beyond 15%. I do not agree with the Government's position on that because I think it is immoral that corporations pay a lower rate of tax than workers who work on the floor within those very corporations or workers generally. The working population pays at least 20% tax in total, if not quite a considerable amount more, on their income. The average is probably somewhere between 20% and 30%. Corporations are paying a hell of a lot less. It is not just the nominal rate. While I welcome the increase to 15%, I think it should go higher. The headline rate should be at least what a worker is paying on average. That is only fair. Notwithstanding that debate, I am also concerned it is all immaterial if there is such a range of reliefs, deductions and allowances from which corporations can benefit and exploit that the actual amount of tax corporations pay is considerably less than that. We discussed some of this earlier but it is worth responding to some of the Minister's earlier comments about the difference between the figures for gross profits of corporations and taxable profits. Taxable profits allow the Government to say there is an effective rate of approximately 10.3%. I think that was the figure the Minister mentioned. The Government can say that because corporations can go from €203 billion in pre-tax gross trading profits to approximately €100 billion. I am looking for the figures now, although I quoted them earlier. That happens through the use of a series of allowances, deductions and reliefs. In our budget submission, we highlighted some of the main headings under which this is done and they are detailed in a document Revenue produces every year, Costs of Tax Expenditures (Credits, Allowances and Reliefs). Some of the main headings under which corporations can write down their taxable profits are "capital allowances", "intragroup transactions", "company reconstructions and amalgamations", "losses, including capital allowances, brought forward", "group relief", "research and development", "tax credit" and "knowledge development box", to name some of the big ones. The ones I find most interesting are the intragroup transactions and the capital allowances. Those are the biggest. They are staggering. They are described accurately in Revenue documents and tables as "costs to the Exchequer". Intragroup transactions, as a cost to the Exchequer, amounted to €16 billion. It is an absolutely stunning figure. We do not have a capital allowances figure for 2019, although the Minister may have that figure and I would be interested to know if he does. For 2018, the cost to the Exchequer of capital allowances was €9 billion. That is quite extraordinary. Taken together, those two costs to the Exchequer alone amount to €25 billion. It also means that multiples of that profit was not taxed. How it that happening? If it is an intragroup transaction, that gives us a fair clue. That is how one subsidiary of a big multinational gets a Revenue figure, its pre-tax gross trading profits, which might be €1 billion, and says it does not have €1 billion of profit because it owes €900 million to a subsidiary of the corporation for the use of intellectual property. It does not then have €1 billion of profits to tax, it has only €100 million. What is actually a profit generated from sales by that company then becomes a cost which they can claim against their taxable profit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is no problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To me, that is tax avoidance and it is big multinational corporations essentially writing their own tax bill. The Government facilitates that. It has been battled in courts and all the rest of it but at least some people in the EU Commission believed we were giving tax rulings to certain companies in order to allow this kind of thing to happen. It is scandalous. Our argument is that the headline rates, whether 12.5%, 15% or, as we would favour, at least 20%, must be effective and levied on gross trading profits. Reliefs would only kick in after those corporations have to pay, as an absolute requirement, a minimum amount of tax on the profits they generate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do not often get a chance to debate these issues. We do not make any apologies about using the opportunity in the Finance Bill and the budget to do so. It is entirely legitimate. While I am not satisfied that the 15% rate that we have gone to is sufficient, it has happened because of pressure, to be clear. It was pressure from the few in this country who were willing to question the sacred cow of the 12.5% rate and from people around the world who are infuriated by the way in which these multinational corporations, in particular, are now so powerful that governments are terrified of them, and rob significant revenue from the poorer parts of the world. They are deeply unhappy with the allocation. The Minister said that we will lose revenue as a result of one of the pillars of the reallocation of revenues under the OECD process. He will also know that poorer countries are furious that they are still being short-changed by what has happened. They see it as being robbed. They are angry that a more thorough reform of the corporate tax regime did not come out of the OECD process. We make no apologies for continuously applying pressure regarding this matter. I am an internationalist. I make no apologies for trying to rebalance the taxation system so that the wealth that our society as a whole generates flows more to those working at the bottom than to Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates and whatever coterie of multi-billionaires controls these corporations and wealth. It has to happen and it will eventually happen. This is part of the process. The Minister's argument is that we would scare the horses and be on our own, then end up like Venezuela, that it would be a disaster, and that we would lose all the jobs in Leixlip. I value those jobs. I will say that again since sometimes I am accused of not valuing those jobs. I want to see those jobs but I do not want those companies to have us over a barrel or, as a result of the fear that governments have of them, to not pay their fair share of tax. I think the Minister was saying in his response that corporations pay a similar level of tax to lower income workers. I have two points about that, which I mentioned earlier. Workers in this country earn €130 billion and pay €27 billion in tax, which is approximately 20%. Roughly 20% of the income earned by 2.8 million workers goes in tax. Corporations have pre-tax profits of €203 billion and pay €11 billion in tax, which is 5.8%. Our argument is that the effective rate for corporations is 5.8%, which are earning much more, whereas ordinary workers earn approximately 20%, and it would be fair to make corporations to pay at least that level of tax. That would be good not just for this country but for the world. We have to start somewhere and we should start there. It is unsustainable to carry on with an economy that is so heavily skewed towards being controlled by these corporations. I have a final point about the value of these assets. The Minister pointed to an important debate, which we never have. This is one of the few opportunities that we have to address the value of intangible assets. I would like us to have that debate, so we table these amendments, because the matter needs to be scrutinised. If I said to Revenue that I wanted to claim as a relief against my tax liability, the fact that I am paying my mum for a really good idea that she gave me, which has helped me to be a more productive economic unit and to which I ascribed a value, Revenue would laugh me out of the room. If Revenue states that a certain amount of income tax should be paid based on income earned, it would laugh people out of the room if they said that they are paying their mum for a good idea that she had which made them more productive, and that it is an intangible asset, which is a cost that they will claim against their tax. That is what the multinationals are doing. They are laughing at us when they ascribe astronomical values to these intellectual property assets. I am not saying that they have no value but there needs to be a hell of a lot more scrutiny into how they are valued and whether they can be valued such that profits that were €200 billion then become €111 billion. There is a problem. They are exploiting these categories of tax relief. Everybody knows it but we are not really doing anything about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister telling me there is a tax rebate for that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Essentially, it is my mum.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Exactly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 24:In page 20, between lines 27 and 28, to insert the following:
"Reports
16. Before the publication of the Finance Act 2021, the Minister shall lay a report before Dáil Éireann, on the impact of the change of the corporate tax rate to 15 per cent, what the effective rate has been and if it has meant that the loopholes, exemptions and reliefs are not being exploited by corporations.".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On section 16 itself-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----can the Minister tell us how many vacant residential premises have come back into use as a result of this tax relief? I do not have any evidence to back it up, but there is a concern that it could perversely provide an incentive to leave a residential premises vacant for a period so that it is vacant long enough to avail of the tax relief. In order to benefit, it has to be vacant for a certain period of time. I am sure such a perverse outcome would not be intended, but if it were to take place, that would be a matter of concern. Can the Minister tell us anything about whether this has been in any way effective? Is there any reason for him to be concerned, or to investigate the possibility, that such a perverse use of the tax relief might be taking place? As a matter of interest, is there a cost for this particular relief? Can the Minister tell us how much it is costing, to give us some sense of a cost-benefit analysis of its effectiveness?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The amendment is to exclude data centres.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We want a report. We want to see how data centres benefit and how much additional revenue we would raise by excluding them from these accelerated capital allowances. That is in the context of our wider belief that it runs completely counter to our climate objectives for the Government to continue to facilitate the construction of data centres which are going to suck up enormous amounts of energy from the grid. Estimates vary from 30% to potentially much higher proportions of energy from the grid being eaten up by data centres which have enormous CO2 emissions. We do not think they should gain from these allowances. They should not be encouraged or incentivised in any way. We want to see a prohibition on the further construction of data centres because of the damage they are doing to the environment. That is the context in which we propose the amendment, and we seek that the Minister would look at reporting on the benefit revenue-wise of excluding them from the accelerated capital allowances in section 21.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Obviously our intent is to completely discourage the further construction of data centres. If I understand the Minister correctly, they do not benefit specifically because they are data centres, but as data centres they can benefit in terms of the equipment that they purchase as part of their establishment. That is pretty much what I think the Minister is saying and he does not know the extent to which they are benefiting from this relief. We want to try to prevent the further construction of data centres and do everything we can to discourage that due to the impact on climate and the energy grid. That is the reason we are doing it. I suspect the Minister does not agree with our objective.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate the explanation, but pardon me if what is happening here is still less than crystal clear. Transfer pricing rules are attempting to deal with some of the things we discussed earlier, such as the tax avoidance strategies we know companies engage in whereby there are multiple companies associated with each other within a particular group. The Minister is saying there are checks and balances, essentially, that this will not be used for tax avoidance and that if the Revenue Commissioners suspect any such thing they will ensure the companies are excluded from the expanded relief. The problem for us in trying to scrutinise this, which it is our responsibility to do, is to understand what sort of transactions we are talking about in slightly more understandable language, to put it bluntly. To what type of businesses does this relate? I know the Minister cannot name businesses, but what type of businesses or transactions does this involve? He referred to non-trading transactions. Can he give us an example of what type of non-trading transaction, if I understand it correctly, between associated companies was being unfairly caught up in the sweep of what are sort of anti-avoidance rules and measures, so that we can understand that what he is doing is not going to open unintended consequences from which companies can benefit or allow them to exploit the relief, if you like, or the extension of the relief? Can the Minister give us an understandable example of that type?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask that they also be circulated to non-members.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I believe that when the history books are written, what happened with the property and housing sector in this country after the crash, with the tax set-up and the political decision, as I see it, to invite investment vehicles into the country to "refloat" the Irish property sector, will turn out to be one of the greatest mistakes ever made in this State. It has contributed directly to the housing disaster we now face. It is bad enough that NAMA has got €40 billion in cash for the property it has sold and unloaded so far, mostly to these types of vehicles, from 2012 and 2013 onwards, when it should have used that property portfolio to provide affordable and public housing; what is worse is that we would not be in the mess we are in had it not done so. To add insult to injury, the investment vehicles are benefiting from all these tax reliefs, whereby they do not pay tax on rental income and do not pay capital gains tax. That is shocking beyond belief. It has contributed directly, not just from the point of view of morals or how shocking it is, to an utterly dysfunctional housing sector and to human misery in the form of the housing crisis. These entities did not come in to create a sustainable housing sector in Ireland. That is not why they came here and it is not what they have done. They came here to make money. That is what they have done, and they will not pay much tax for having done so. I think about how rents have gone up and how the value of property has gone up to a staggering level, all of which these property investment vehicles have benefited from to a staggering degree. Then, to add to that, these real estate investment trusts, real estate funds and so on have benefited from tax breaks. One thing I have always found particularly unacceptable, from the point of view of a member of the finance committee, is that we do not really know how much revenue is forgone in this regard. For the most part, when there are tax breaks and tax reliefs, we can ask the question how much tax is forgone, as we have done before. The Minister may give us new information, but I think I am right in saying we are not told - or told it cannot be calculated or something - how much tax has been forgone from the tax breaks on these entities' rental revenue and capital gains. It is pretty awful from a budgetary point of view and a finance point of view that we just do not know or are not given the figures or that the amount cannot be calculated, whatever the reason is. Therefore, to look into these figures, as these amendments propose to do, and assess their impact on the housing market and price dynamics is the very least we can do in order that we can have an informed debate on the advantages these entities enjoy. Obviously, the Government will say that these arrangements are beneficial, that we need these property investors and that somehow they are contributing, although it is totally lost on me how they are contributing in any shape or form to a sustainable housing sector. Maybe the Minister will be able change my mind. I doubt it. At the very least, we need to look into and scrutinise these matters.
