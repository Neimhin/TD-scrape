RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a result of the refusal of Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to raise the income thresholds for social housing, hundreds of housing applicants who are hard-working people are being thrown off the list. It is happening every week. I have some examples. Sinéad, who had been on the list for eight years, was thrown off it because she did three months of temporary overtime for a sick colleague. Lorraine was thrown off the list after 15 years because her husband was doing some extra hours at work. The stress broke up their relationship. Vanessa had been on the list for 15 years. She was reassessed just before she got a house and was thrown off the list, after 15 years waiting, and is now facing eviction from private rented accommodation. Orla was reassessed to include the income of her husband who did not live with her anymore. She was thrown off the list and lost credit for the years she had spent on it. This is going on every week. These are working people whose income is too low to pay excessive rents or buy on the open market and they are being culled from the list, week after week. The Minister has promised to do something about these income thresholds for two years and has done nothing.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last Tuesday, I was asked to go to an emergency meeting of parents of children in a crèche, the Magic Roundabout. They were already paying €1,100 in monthly crèche fees, which I find staggering. Those fees will go up to €1,250 a month while 20 of the parents will lose their kids’ places in the crèche. This is because Tusla told the crèche it needed to make changes, which it did. Tusla then came back and stated that because of the changes made, the floor space was reduced and it would have to get rid of 20 of the kids. This is in the middle of the term. It is unbelievable. This is against a background where 27 crèches are threatened with closure and parents are saying they have been left in the dark about these matters. Parents are flabbergasted, shocked and do not know what to do. In the case in question, the parents have asked for a meeting with the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, to discuss the matter. I must stress that if there were any health and safety or fire safety issues, these parents would be the first to say something must be done. What is not acceptable, however, is the sort of ham-fisted, box-ticking, blunt-instrument approach that appears to be taken by Tusla in terms of crèche facilities, compliance and so on. The big point the parents in this case made was how can one bring in a scheme for two years of free preschool care in the ECCE, early childhood care and education, scheme but not actually provide for the places, particularly considering the shockingly high levels of costs parents must endure. Will the Taoiseach comment on that? Judging from the attitude at the meeting, there is an explosion on the way on the issue of childcare costs and the lack of childcare places.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The programme for Government makes specific reference to implementing the national dementia strategy. As the Taoiseach is aware, there is major anxiety or fear about the fate of the St Joseph's dementia care facility in my constituency in Shankill. I brought up this issue last week when I sought a debate with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, on its fate. It is threatened with closure. It is the biggest and best and a model dementia care facility in the country. There are, however, real fears about its fate. It would be a disaster for dementia sufferers and their families if it were to close. That simply cannot happen. There have been some reassuring comments made by the Minister for Health, but it needs to be definitive. Critically, the fate of the facility turns on recognition by the Government and the HSE that the care provided for high-dependency dementia sufferers will be funded against the minimal level of funding coming from the HSE through the fair deal scheme. Can the Taoiseach tell us, in line with commitments given in this area in the programme for Government, that the gold standard in dementia care facilities in the country will be protected, that funding will be provided and that the anxiety suffered by dementia sufferers and their families will be ended? The sooner he makes a statement on the matter the better.
