RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is pie in the sky.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is at a snail's pace.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As someone who played schoolboy soccer for most of my teenage years, as well as Leinster senior soccer, I am well aware of the absolute disgust and revulsion of grassroots soccer players, clubs, supporters and parents at the scandal that has emerged in the FAI. The programme for Government makes a particular promise to improve oversight of spending programmes. Given the obvious incompetence, mismanagement and obscene salaries of Mr. Delaney and his clique in the FAI, the Government must take some responsibility for its failure to investigate what the dogs in the street knew. Those at the grassroots of soccer knew that there was something rotten at the heart of the FAI.I am looking at an email response from the Taoiseach, when he was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, which was sent to somebody on 24 March where he was asked by the emailer to investigate the internal affairs of the FAI. His response was that it was not appropriate for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to comment on the internal structures of a national sporting organisation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He batted off the request for an internal investigation. Is that not just the problem when the Government hands out money to these quangos, which are run like medieval corrupt fiefdoms, and pays no attention whatsoever to the goings-on in entities like the FAI? The grassroots of soccer are now threatened in a very severe way. Indeed, the FAI's very viability is under threat because of a failure in oversight.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Taoiseach saying that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has nothing to do with it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also raise the issue of childcare and the necessity of including it as part of the Citizens' Assembly deliberations on gender equality. To say there is a crisis in the affordability and provision of childcare would be a massive understatement. The average cost per week of childcare in this country is €186, but it is €246 in my area. That is completely unaffordable. It is the same as having a second mortgage. The lack of provision of available, affordable places is shocking. It is all very well announcing programmes such as the national childcare scheme, subsidies, or two years of free preschool year after year, but people cannot find places. More recently, small community crèches are suffering the consequences of the backlash against badly-run, often big corporate, childcare facilities. The numbers of places in such small crèches are being reduced and costs are going up to meet Tusla's compliance standards, which is pushing prices even further out of the realm of affordability. This is one of, if not the biggest, contributing factors to gender inequality in this country. What is the Government going to do to provide affordable, universally available and sufficient childcare places in this country?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the proudest things that this country ever did on the foreign policy stage was to implement a boycott against apartheid South Africa, prompted by the heroic actions of Dunnes Stores workers. That was done unilaterally. Nelson Mandela and many other leading fighters against apartheid made the point at the time that Ireland had made a unique contribution to bringing down the apartheid regime. Why does the Taoiseach hide behind the coat-tails of the EU and say that we can do nothing because we do not have qualified majority voting, when we took unilateral action against apartheid South Africa? Israel flouts international law through its treatment of and detention of children. Its criminal siege of Gaza has reduced Gaza to being a place that officially is uninhabitable by human beings. There has been flagrant and brazen annexation of Palestinian territory in contravention of international law. The right to self-determination for Palestinians has been officially cancelled by the Israeli Government. Only people who are Jewish in the land that is Israel or Palestine, whatever one wants to call it, have the right to self-determination. Human and international rights are just gone. This just goes on and on. Ethnic cleansing is a day-to-day reality for Palestinians. Why will the Taoiseach not take a leaf from the book of the Dunnes Stores strikers and what this country did in response to apartheid South Africa and support sanctions, including Senator Black's Control of Economic Activity (Occupied Territories) Bill? The Taoiseach should support, not block, that Bill and take a lead in calling for and imposing sanctions on the apartheid, racist, repressive and illegal activities of the Israeli state in respect of the Palestinian people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have raised with the Minister the plight of a crèche in my area where a significant number of parents faced a major hike in charges and some lost their places because of Tusla demands to change things in that crèche. Those parents are still asking to meet the Minister. I appreciate that she gave me a response recently but they are not happy with it. They are concerned not just about their plight but about the wider issue that has emerged that the highest childcare costs in this country, which are higher than in most of Europe, are in our area, and about the lack of places. They also do not accept Tusla’s contentions about the circumstances which led to 20 places effectively going in that facility.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Two parents working on the average industrial wage will get €20 a week towards the cost of childcare. The increase in the cost for the crèche I mentioned, because of Tusla’s requirements for that crèche, is greater than that. The cost is now up to about €1,200 a month, which is mind-boggling. On that specific issue the parents would like to meet the Minister because that crèche was registered for 70 children in 2016. Now the parents have been told in the middle of the year that is too many. That is a specific problem. They also want to discuss the wider issue of the cost which is not sustainable. The lack of places in our area is shocking. For example, as part of the planning permission for the huge residential development on the site of the old Dún Laoghaire golf club where there are thousands of new residences, there was to have been a major childcare facility. That never appeared. Crèches are full to capacity, too expensive and there are not enough places. We really need quite radical and urgent action to address that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister's acknowledgement of the issues. I will check if the people in question are availing fully of the subsidy-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will check that but, either way, the average cost in Dún Laoghaire Rathdown is off the Richter scale and I think the Minister would accept that point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need to address that but the national childcare scheme will barely scratch the surface-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed, there is nothing to stop the costs rising further as compliance requirements increase and the costs of same get passed on to parents, thus wiping out any benefit from the national childcare scheme. Costs are already unaffordable and there has been a failure to deliver new crèche places as part of major residential developments. The fact that those places were in the plans and were a condition of planning permission but were not provided is absolutely unacceptable. I ask the Minister to consider meeting this group of parents. They are not looking for a fight with her. They want to explain the issues to her from their point of view. They want her to understand the question of affordability, the specifics of their case and the problems more generally being faced in the entire south Dublin area. They would appreciate the chance to engage with her. I am sure that Deputies from other areas would want to make the same case but south Dublin has the highest costs and the biggest capacity problem in the country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister for that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have raised with the Minister the fate of the supervised playground on Library Road in Dún Laoghaire before, and seeing as I am on a roll with her, I hope that there is something that can be done to save the supervision at this playground which is due to terminate. This amenity has been there for decades and has served a disadvantaged community and many children and parents. The supervision and the funding for it is going to be withdrawn shortly before Christmas unless something happens urgently.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The playground will-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My apologies, Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will take her time as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The playground in question is in an area where very few people have front or back gardens. These are old terraced council houses. It is an area with a DEIS school and is a pocket of disadvantage in Dún Laoghaire. Many of the children who go there, from the ages of three and four up to 13, are children who would frankly not go to the other open playgrounds. There are a number of children with special needs. This is a community amenity and facility which caters for children with special needs in an area of disadvantage. It is not unique to have such a thing. I talked to Barnardos, for example, which runs such a facility in Waterford city. This is a good thing that works and is a glue for the community. It is very good for children. We often talk about early intervention and this is a form of it. The people who are there are trained and have Further Education and Training Awards Council, FETAC, qualifications.To remove the supervision would be retrograde and many of the children who go there will not return to it if there is no supervision.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are playing games.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Their names are Pauline and Jill. They have worked there for more than a decade. In Pauline's case it is probably about 20 years. Many of the children who go there now will not go anymore if the supervision is removed. Some agenda is operating here. I believe somebody else wants the building that they partly use, to be honest. That is what is happening and it is wrong and retrograde. Crosscare runs it and employs them and before that it was run by Catholic Youth Care, CYC. That indicates there is a childcare component to it. Why else would Crosscare have employed them for the last ten years? Now Crosscare is saying the children are too young for it because it deals with teenagers. The playground caters for children who are between three and 14 years old. It is retrograde that Crosscare is pulling out; I am disappointed with Crosscare. It is also retrograde that the council seems to think it should get rid of something that is working. The community and the children in the area will suffer consequences if the supervision is removed. I am seeking proactive intervention with the council, Crosscare or the ETB so we do not lose a good facility that works for the community.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Pauline and Jill.
