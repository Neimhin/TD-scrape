RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a raised this issue on a number of occasions with the Minister of State. Does she not recognise that the progress being made in this area is pathetic given that the census of population identified that there were 340,000 empty houses and having regard to the number of people on the housing waiting list, namely, some 100,000 families? It is unbelievable that so little progress has been made when the housing waiting list is longer than it has ever been and we have more empty housing units that we ever had in the State. The Minister of State does not seem to acknowledge that NAMA and the number of empty houses identified are not a panacea because there is a shortage of housing in areas such as Dublin and the surrounding areas of some of the bigger cities. There must be some direct building of social housing if we are to make even a dent in addressing the record length of the housing list. It is unacceptable. Some families in my area have been on the housing waiting list for 13 years. What proposals has the Government to reduce that waiting time to acceptable levels? Nobody should have to wait longer than two or three years on a housing list.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That has to be addressed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Basically the Minister is saying that there will be no change. The Government is failing to acknowledge and take action on what is an enormous crisis facing small and medium enterprises, which the Government itself constantly says will be the driving force and the motor behind our economic recovery. There are 4,000 family-owned businesses in this country employing around 90,000 which are on the line of survival now. Those businesses need a break. Commercial rates are a very serious burden on them. Different countries have different rates models. In Britain businesses are given rates holidays, while in Scotland a differential rates scheme has been introduced. Spain and Italy have models which are bands-based and the rates are related to turnover and profitability and to the notion of giving support to small businesses in town centres and so forth. I urge the Government to examine these models or to consider some model which distinguishes between small businesses and, for example, high street banks. Is it not ridiculous that Bank of Ireland, Ulster Bank or Tesco pays the same rate per square metre as a local butcher or florist? That is ridiculous and something should be done about it in order to give a break to the small businesses that the Minister says he supports.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I always have done.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	James Connolly was always on the side of workers and small businesses. It is the big businesses that are the problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We want to reduce the burden on small businesses and on low and middle income workers who, by the way, depend on each other. Who does the Minister think spends money in the small and medium-sized businesses on the high street?It is the corporations and the very wealthy, who can hoard their money offshore and avoid their taxes while making enormous profits, who should be made pay a bigger share in order to give relief to the ordinary consumers on the high street and the small and medium enterprises which are being crushed by the recession and by the rates and parking charges which they cannot sustain and which are crippling many small towns.  I welcome the fact that the Minister is willing to look at this matter. A motion calling for differential rates, proposed by People Before Profit, was passed by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council with the support of the Minister's party colleagues. The Minister should look at international models we could follow to give a break to small and medium enterprises.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The chairperson of the Dublin City Council finance committee and a number of other councillors have confirmed that there is no doubt that if the property tax is imposed on local authority housing in Dublin City Council, it will be passed on in the form of rent to local authority tenants. The same report was given by council officials in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council at pre-budget meetings and was, I believe, confirmed again at a meeting last night. We need clarity on the issue. If rent increases are to be imposed on local authority tenants, it makes a mockery of the claim that this is a property tax as the Minister suggested - it is not. It will mean an extra burden on people who do not own property. Can the Minister confirm that a special committee has been established between the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Finance and the County and City Managers Association? What is the status of discussions and deliberations among that group on this issue as to whether the full cost of the property tax will be imposed on local authority tenants' rents and what that burden is likely to be?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Make the big multinationals pay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was because they were poor.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Ceann Comhairle. I am sure the Taoiseach is acutely aware, and I suspect the Labour Party is even more acutely aware, that tens of thousands of workers and other citizens will be taking to the streets this weekend to oppose the crippling debt that has been imposed on their shoulders-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----the austerity the Government is meting out to them and to vent their fury at the broken promises of the Government and of the Labour Party in particular that it would all be different. I am sure the Taoiseach also is aware of the anger that now is building up among public sector front-line workers over the Government's plans to savage them even further in a so-called extension of the Croke Park deal. My question to the Taoiseach is to ask whether these circumstances and pressures explain the rather odd goings-on within the Government over the last few days. I refer to the way in which the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade travelled to Latin America and told European Union officials the Government is in jeopardy unless it gets a deal on the promissory notes issue and the way in which the Minister of State, Deputy White, stated on national television that there may be no Croke Park deal unless the Government gets a deal. Is this something of an elaborate charade on the part of the Government to create a bit of drama about whether we get a deal on the promissory notes issue to sweeten the bitter pill of the attacks the Government is planning on workers over the next number of months? Was the game not given away on this little charade by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Varadkar, when he stated that regardless of whether we get a deal, it will make no difference to the level of cuts or austerity that will be imposed in future budgets? Is it not the truth that the Government - and the Labour Party in particular - are treating Members to an elaborate charade to deflect attention away from the cuts the Government now seeks to impose yet again on public sector workers-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----by involving people in this drama of whether Ireland will get a deal on a promissory note when, as the Minister, Deputy Varadkar has indicated, deal or no deal, it makes no difference? Is it not the truth that the Government is not looking for a write-down of the debt, has agreed in principle to pay every cent and that whatever deal it gets will make no difference whatsoever to those who are being hammered and who the Government intends to hammer further with cuts and austerity?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If it is not an elaborate charade, will the Taoiseach confirm for the public that the deal being sought will still involve this State committing to paying every cent plus interest of the cost to bail out Anglo Irish Bank? Is that the deal? Is it only a question of spreading that payment over a longer period and paying more interest over the period? It suits the Government, and the Labour Party in particular, to "big up" the discussions prior to doing some kind of sham deal that will make no difference in order to draw us into a drama of asking whether there is a deal. If this is not a charade-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----will the Taoiseach comment on the Tánaiste's reported comments in Chile to the effect that the Government would be "in jeopardy" if it did not get a deal? Is that true? Is the coalition threatened with falling apart if there is no deal? The Deputies look very comfortable beside each other now and it does not look like the Government is in jeopardy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is this a way of softening public sector workers for the real agenda of the Government and the troika, which is to shove even more austerity down the throats of front-line public sector workers and other citizens in this country at the demand of the troika? If a meaningless deal can be presented as a way of sweetening the bitter pill, the Government will be able to spin its way out of the real agenda.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Anglo's way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Being on the streets would be more effective.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is fine to say we are concerned about the underlying causes and the problems faced by young people and less well-off communities in the North but fine words and noble aspirations must be matched with deeds and a serious analysis of why young working class people in the North, particularly in Protestant areas although there are very significant problems for young working class, less well-off people right across the North, feel so alienated and that alienation manifests itself in the way that it did in the explosion of sectarian violence. There will have to be a bit of soul searching by the political establishment in the North and by the political establishment generally as to why that happened. The Taoiseach said that the protests were largely spontaneous but there was some element of stoking it up by loyalist parliamentary groups initially. I suggest there was another significant factor, which the Taoiseach has not acknowledged but he should acknowledge, and our comrades in Sinn Féin should also acknowledge this. The Deputy First Minister's party, the DUP, and the Official Unionist Party put 40,000 leaflets around east Belfast and Protestant areas, stoking up the issue. This was a major contributory factor to an explosion of violence and anger among young people. I certainly do not believe it was a coincidence that was done at the same time when, for example, the Minister, Nelson McCausland, announced the plan to effectively privatise the Northern Ireland Housing Executive. That is pretty telling. If we remember back to the history of the most recent phase of violence in the late 1960s and early 1970s in the North, how did it begin? It began on the issue of housing, housing allocation and discrimination in the allocation of insufficient housing for the least well-off. Housing remains a massive problem in the North and now the Northern Ireland Executive is planning to privatise social housing, to outsource it, not in a dissimilar fashion to the way the Government is doing here with leases to property developers, except in the North it will be to housing associations and rents are likely to increase. In addition, there is a massive 25% youth unemployment and cuts have been imposed in hospital services and so on. These factors and deliberate stoking up of these issues along tribal lines helped focus youth alienation and anger felt by the less well-off sectors of society in the North along sectarian lines. In addition, the structures of the Northern Ireland political set up are a form of institutionalised sectarianism which guarantee that politics tends to be expressed in a sectarian fashion. The arrangements and quota systems in terms of balancing Nationalist and Unionist in the North are almost exactly the same as those that were set up by the French in the Lebanon in 1920s which led to decades of sectarian conflict there-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and we are seeing the same process in the North. Should we not point to those factors, that there is a problem with institutionalised sectarianism and that some of the so-called respectable political forces in the North encouraged and stoked up sectarianism and tribalism in order to deflect attention away from cuts and austerity they are imposing on the people of the North?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There were many young people involved.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the DUP's leaflets?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This series of questions has reopened the historical fault lines in Irish politics on the issue of the North. Notwithstanding those fault lines, the Taoiseach did not respond to the point that someone who is supposed to be on the respectable establishment wing of politics in the North, Peter Robinson's party and the Official Unionist Party, put out 40,000 leaflets stoking this crisis up and then panicked when chaos resulted with a damaging impact on business and tried to close it down again. They were responsible for whipping it up in the first place and they should be held accountable for that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why does the Taoiseach not acknowledge that and address the issue in discussions on how we learn the lessons of this? I do not put the comrades of Sinn Féin in the same category with regard to doing that sort of thing. I am not suggesting they are doing that, but where the underlying problems are unemployment, youth alienation, housing, health and all the stuff that is being done to working class people in the North, is it a useful response to talk about parity of esteem between communities or about flags and emblems? I do not think it is. It fuels sectarianism. We need to fight tooth and nail against the austerity measures that are causing that level of alienation. There is not parity of esteem, but parity of lack of esteem-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and competition between communities over who takes the biggest burden of cuts. That is a recipe for constant flare-ups in sectarian violence.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach is aware of the growing concern, criticism and outright outrage about the plans to dispose of the harvesting rights for Coillte. Is the forestry Bill going to deal with this issue? I understand negotiations are ongoing on the disposal of these harvesting rights.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are serious questions about value for money for the State. Is the Bill going to deal with this or will the Taoiseach allow for statements in the House on the plans surrounding the disposal of Coillte's harvesting rights?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tell that to IMPACT.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to share time with Deputy Mattie McGrath.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would not have been the greatest fan of the national lottery when it was first established and I do not generally subscribe to the idea of encouraging gambling habits as a way to finance the State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not the best way to finance the State. Studies recently done by lecturers in University College, Cork, have suggested that the national lottery is socially regressive as the least well-off play it most and pay the most, although they do not receive the same amount of benefit as expended on lottery tickets. The good causes which the lottery finances do not adequately compensate for the cost or expense of buying lottery tickets in working class areas and poorer sections of the community. We should consider this study as the lottery is now established, whether the idea was good, bad or indifferent, and it has become a means to fund or otherwise resource good causes of various kinds. There is no doubt that it has done that in many areas, including sports, community development, heritage, tourism and transport. It has undoubtedly provided significant benefit to all sorts of groups and good causes. We should nevertheless examine more closely the issue of where the money that is generated is being targeted. Although many people play the game, it is played more, with more money spent, by people with the least. We should be honest because to a certain extent the appeal is precisely to people who are struggling in the hope that a big win in the lottery might get them out of a life of struggle and toil, or just about being able to manage to pay the bills or the mortgage or look after the kids. The attraction is greater to the least well off, and the statistics and figures bear this out. If this is where most of the expenditure on tickets is coming from, most of the benefit for good causes should go back to those sections of society that are less well off. Given that the lottery is established and is probably here to stay, the Government's position is that nothing is changing with the lottery licence. It would have been put out to tender again and whoever offers the best deal will get it. There is no big change in that regard, although we will get a bonus of financing the children's hospital. We should be absolutely clear and we all want to see the children's hospital being built, and it should be funded as a matter of priority. To attach the two issues is not sufficient to justify a move to privatise a State asset for the benefit of people in the private sector.Ultimately, the losers will be the economy, society, the retailers who act as lottery sales agents and the players of the lottery who, as I noted, tend to be disproportionately centred in the less well-off sections of society. When the lottery was privatised in the United Kingdom, Camelot, one of the companies in the mix for our national lottery licence, won the contract and significantly increased the price of lottery tickets, to the point that it provoked a major boycott of the lottery. As a private company interested in profit, Camelot decided to jack up prices because it believed it had a captive market of people who wanted to play the lottery. As is the case with most private corporations, it also started to pay enormous amounts of money to its executives. In one year, Camelot set aside £8 million to pay bonuses to those at the top of the company. As is usually the case where there is a large cash cow, the corporate executives at the top milked the British lottery for everything it was worth. There is no reason to believe this will not occur under the new terms the Government is proposing for the award of the national lottery licence.  Significantly, the Government is proposing to allow for an annual profit line, whereas the current position is that An Post, a semi-State company, receives €2.7 million per annum for managing the national lottery. We know how much An Post receives under the licence, whereas under the new terms it will be possible to adjust the annual profit line. If the company awarded the licence makes such an adjustment, there is no doubt it will take a bigger slice of the cake, boost salaries for executives and apply pressure to increase the price of lottery tickets. These changes are inevitable if the licence is awarded to Camelot or another private corporate interest.  The Government has tried to argue that under its proposal it will not make any difference if An Post is awarded the national lottery licence or if it goes to Camelot or a similar company. There is, however, a big difference because as a semi-State company, the activities of the former in respect of how it runs and manages the lottery are subject to a much greater degree of control by the Government, Minister, elected representatives and members of the public than the activities of a fully private, for-profit corporation.  Retailers are another group that could potentially be affected by a new dynamic operating in the lottery if it is run by a company such as Camelot. As I noted, the national lottery sales agents are concerned that the 6% of sales they receive may no longer be guaranteed. In light of my concerns, I do not accept that it is a good idea to move towards what is effectively a full-scale privatisation of a State asset. The Government will, I am sure, argue that the sale of the national lottery will deliver upfront cash for the national children's hospital. The figures in the Bills digest provided by the Library and Research Service show there is no reason the children's hospital could not be financed through current contributions to good causes from the national lottery. In 2008, 2009, 2010 and 2011, the national lottery provided €267 million, €263 million, €243 million and €231 million, respectively, to good causes. For the past five or six years, therefore, it has consistently provided roughly €250 million to good causes. There is no reason to believe, given the consistency of these figures, that the national lottery will not continue to provide funding of this magnitude to good causes, especially given the potential for expansion through online sales and so forth. If it is certain that this sum will be generated for good causes every year, we could earmark €50 million per annum for five years to pay the estimated €250 million cost of the children's hospital. Why can we not do this and maintain the current arrangement under which the national lottery is run and managed by An Post? This option has the advantage of having a set management fee of only €2.7 million compared to the proposed moving profit line, which will benefit the likes of Camelot and other private interests.  We can secure a better deal by simply deciding to allocate €50 million of lottery revenue towards the cost of financing the children's hospital. The Government's argument that we need to go down the road of privatisation to finance the children's hospital does not stack up because this objective could be as easily achieved by maintaining the status quo. Choosing the latter would also allow the State to maintain more control of the national lottery and allay the concerns of retailers and the workforce of the national lottery. The latter is another significant group in this process and they are deeply worried about their future as a result of the move to award the contract to another entity. The Government does not need to proceed with its proposal. Its argument about the national children's hospital is a red herring because, as matters stand, the hospital could be built using national lottery funding. If the Minister of State was not aware of that, he is now because I have just told him that it could be achieved by allocating €50 million of the €250 million we are virtually guaranteed to receive every year to the hospital project for five years.  There is no need to dispose of this State asset. The national lottery workforce and An Post have done a good job and we can get a children's hospital without messing with a formula that has worked. The Government should not let its ideological inclination towards privatisation colour the fact that the current deal is fine. We do not need to go down this route to get a hospital or continue to finance the good causes funded by the national lottery.
