RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I refer to promised legislation on whistleblowers.  This morning a very brave young woman who is a mental health advocate in the HSE in St. Brendan's in Grangegorman and blew the whistle on the appalling treatment and conditions of mental health patients before and during Christmas - which received widespread coverage, was discussed in the House and shone a light on the conditions faced by mental health patients - was sacked by the HSE in what is clearly an act of retaliation.  When will whistleblowers legislation that is supposed to prevent this sort of disgraceful treatment of people who are doing their jobs as mental health advocates be brought forward?  Such people are blowing the whistle on the mistreatment of patients.  I ask the Tánaiste to take action on this matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the same theme, I was contacted by Scoil Bhríde in Glen, Edgeworthstown, County Longford, a three teacher school with 49 pupils.  It informs me that, as a result of the budget, it will lose a teacher if it does not increase numbers to 51.  It argues that it could meet this target by September but needs to be given some breathing space and an opportunity to do so as it will otherwise become unviable due to the loss of one teacher.  This is a reasonable plea.I disagree with all the cuts in the Department as there is no justification for any of them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not the case.  It is unconscionable to cut teacher numbers and rob our children of their education.  If we cannot deal with the general issue, can we at least give the schools concerned some breathing space?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have just come from a demonstration of between 3,000 and 6,000 DEIS school students, parents and teachers from across this city and the country.  They want the Minister to agree to a complete reversal on and taking off the table of all proposed cuts to resources for disadvantaged schools, whether DEIS band 1, DEIS band 2 or those with legacy posts.  The Minister knows from various reports that DEIS has been a success and a lifeline to disadvantaged communities.  They have already been hit by other austerity measures; they do not need these cuts.When I met the troika this week, it made it very clear that specific austerity measures are the Government's call while it just sets the parameters for the deficit.  The Government does have the choice to make cuts elsewhere.  There is no economic or moral logic in cutting education, particularly that of the least well-off.  Cutting back on our children's futures will mean we will pay economically and socially in the future.The Minister has the choice to tax the people at the top who have the money instead of hitting the most disadvantaged in our society.  I appeal to the Minister to give some solace to those who were demonstrating today and their children.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What I gathered from the troika was that the austerity details were hammered out by the Government and that all it is concerned about is the deficit.  I do not doubt it has a prejudice for privatisation and running down public sector numbers.  However, it said the targets were sufficient for it while the details could be changed by the Government.  Why does the Government believe it is preferable to hit at education provision and public services for the least well-off rather than tax those who can afford it, a move for which Members on this side of the House have been screaming for some time?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Any cuts to DEIS are completely unacceptable.  The Government needs to get out of the trenches to fight this unacceptable attack on education and our children.What is happening to DEIS band 2 given it is not referred to in the teacher staffing schedule for 2012-2013?  Does the Minister intend to do away with DEIS band 2?  Does he intend to press ahead with the cuts for learning support teachers under the general allocation model?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the case that cutting the funding to postgraduate grants is the sharp edge of the disastrous situation over which this Government has presided?  This will cut the education level of attainment at the highest level, which we need if this country has any chance of recovering.  The Government talks on a regular basis about how we need to make this country favourable for investment and export-led recovery but we are sending out the message that we will have fewer people qualified at the highest level.  The people who will not get the chance to reach that level of educational attainment will be those who do not have money.  It is always the people who do not have money who get hit.
