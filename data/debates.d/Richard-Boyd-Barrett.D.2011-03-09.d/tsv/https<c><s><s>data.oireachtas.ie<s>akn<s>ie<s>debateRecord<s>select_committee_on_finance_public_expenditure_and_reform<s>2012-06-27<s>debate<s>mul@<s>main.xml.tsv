RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we not covering Deputy Stephen Donnelly's amendment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Section 13 was being opposed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why was the amendment not called?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The United Left Alliance is opposing this section primarily because it refers to section 25.  There is a technical amendment consistent with our opposition to that section which deals with the extra contributions required from fire fighters, prison officers, members of the Garda and persons in similar categories who must retire earlier because of the nature of their job.  They are being required to make extra pension contributions under section 25.  This section refers to the same issue and on that basis we oppose it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Chairman to explain that ruling.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who regulates debt collection?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Central Bank does not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was just wondering if it was a role of the Central Bank because debt collection is, sadly, becoming big business.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To clarify, are debt collectors subject to these pension obligations?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that what a person contributes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the position now.  It is not the position with the new scheme.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do we not get to comment on the section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I indicated that I wanted to speak on it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister might be able to clarify that when we consider this section, as he has outlined it, with people making a monetarised contribution of one 80th-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.  The old scheme.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is my point.  Could the Minister clarify that the contribution level remains effectively the same but that it is no longer linked to what one gets at the end, which creates the possibility at least that it will be based on career average?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, because, for example, one does not know how fast one will move up the scale.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to tease out the issue so that we are absolutely clear.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We made general comments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I seek clarification on contributions by the Minister.  If, for example, one enters the public service with higher qualifications and goes in at a more senior level, that means one could enter at a high pay rate and then it would plateau quickly at a fairly high level but someone coming in at clerical officer level might have to work for many years to get to a similar level.  When the latter's career earnings are averaged out the pension rate will be dragged down by the fact that he or she started at a low level and was at a low level for a long time.  It strikes me that the opposite to what the Minister said is true; that the majority of public and civil servants who enter at fairly low levels will have their pension entitlement dragged down, whereas people who enter nearer the top of the scale will not suffer as badly from the switch to end-of-career figure to the career average.  That strikes me as a fairly obvious consequence.  Could the Minister explain why that is not the case?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister might correct me if I am wrong, but an important aspect of how the system works is that the amount one put in and the amount one gets out have a relationship to one another.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister said that in the current scheme one put in one 80th.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What does the Minister say to the charge made by some of those representing public sector workers that it is theoretically possible under the new scheme for one to put in more than one gets out?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not an understandable mistake given that it is called the pension levy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure people's fears in that regard would be allayed if the Minister were to inform us of when the pension levy would be removed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the Cabinet?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not want to labour the point but if somebody enters the public service at a senior level, for example, a county manager-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but they do not start as a clerical officer either.  The point is that they start on a fairly high salary and they finish on an even higher one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but the pension is based on a career average.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They enter at a high level, which most of those who are senior in the public service do.  They do not start at the bottom.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My last point is a separate one.  The amendment has been ruled out of order but I wish to discuss it in terms of the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to speak on the section as a whole.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to comment on the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I oppose this section because it includes the increase in the contribution rate for the people on these fast accrual schemes, namely, firefighters, prison officers, gardaí and members of the Army.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not worried about the TDs.  They should have their pay cut anyway.  I am talking about people who do serious, front line-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.  I pay the excess of my salary over the average industrial wage to People Before Profit, the United Left Alliance, the Socialist Workers Party and various campaigns.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is my salary-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and it is our party policy not to give that to the individual to benefit the individual but to pay it into campaigns and organisations that campaign on behalf of working people against the Minister's austerity measures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not finished making my point.  The Chairman allowed the Minister to go off on a tangent.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The SIPO has nothing to do with the salaries.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, of course, and they are within the limits.  However, the issue I raise is that because of the nature of the job done by these categories of public sector workers who have the right to retire early - firefighters, prison officers, gardaí and so on - they are already paying a higher contribution rate for the pensions they receive and, therefore, this is further penalising them with a higher contribution rate.  Is it not correct that they will be paying more to get less because they will also be subject to the career average provisions of the new scheme?  That is what they think anyway.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	After tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	After tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, it is about €6,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is €6,000 to People Before Profit, €6,000 to the Socialist Workers Party, money to the United Left Alliance, money to the campaign against household and water charges, and money to local community organisations.  That is all perfectly legitimate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Minister wants to have a closer examination he can look at my website which has accounts of where the salary goes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Very transparent.  I wish the rest of the Members would do the same.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister did not reply to the point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They were doing that already.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It will not be the euro anyway.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just the politicians and the judiciary.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are Secretaries General included?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Minister to repeat his question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of clarification, is that all of them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are firefighters subject to the cap?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I do not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just want to clarify who they are.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As with Deputy McDonald, I see the rationale behind removing the cap in so far as it does not penalise ordinary public or civil servants from making some extra contributions, particularly given the fact that they may be working longer.  They should be allowed to do that and not be penalised for doing so.  That seems entirely reasonable, but I question the way in which the Minister is doing it.  First, particular categories are not included and there is nothing in the legislation to prevent those categories getting large pensions.  I have mentioned two - Secretaries General and county managers, who are high earners in the public service.  In the case of Secretaries General, a group about whom there is a great deal of anger regarding large pension entitlements, if my understanding is correct, there is nothing in the legislation, as a result of removing the cap, that stops them walking away with enormous pensions.  I would appreciate if the Minister would return to me later on that point.I do not have a problem with the vast majority of public or civil servants having a decent pension.  I do not have a problem with somebody who is on a fairly low salary throughout most of their career getting a pension of more than 50% of their average pay if they were earning an average of €30,000 to €40,000 per annum.  Why should they not have more than that, based on their contributions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is reasonable.  On the other hand, it opens it for people who are on very high salaries to make large contributions towards the end and get tax breaks on them.  If I am correct, and the Minister can clarify the position, people who make large pension contributions are entitled to tax breaks.  It would be a way for people who are high earners essentially to avoid paying a certain amount of tax and walking away with a nice substantial pension.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	And county managers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let me clarify this point with the Minister.  Is he saying that, based on the fact that Secretaries General and similar high paid civil and public servants are not in a category that has fast accrual, they will not retire on a pension above 50% of final salary?  If that is the case, I begin to wonder at the possible arbitrariness of some of the grades that have been designated - for example, a person who is a member of the Labour Court.  Is that because the person is a judge?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A member of An Bord Pleanála is similarly analogous.  That is a reasonable point.Is the Minister saying that he does not think that those groups of highly paid people at the highest level in the public and Civil Service, or others that we may not have thought of, are not going to walk away with more than 50% of final salary as a pension?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In respect of the Minister's main objection to Deputy McDonald's cap of €60,000 on pension, I take the Minister's point that we do not know what that figure may mean in 20 years or 30 years time.  The advantage of setting a figure of €60,000 - in fact, I would go a bit lower, because who needs more than €50,000 when they retire - or whatever figure we choose, is that it has the advantage of being easily understood and not obscure from the public's point of view.  They may have difficulty with an obscure formula because it may be difficult to understand what it means.  The public is concerned about people, such as politicians and top level public or civil servants, walking away with massive pensions.  What is so difficult about naming a figure that is meaningful now, such as €50,000 or €60,000 and updating it periodically at budget time?  It could be based on inflation or just general appreciation of salaries and so on.  Would that not be easier for people to understand and more transparent in terms of setting a cap on the amount with which people could walk away?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We oppose this section, which relates to gardaí, firefighters, members of the Permanent Defence Force and prison officers and increases the contribution they are required to make, or the basis on which it is calculated.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are linked.  The objection the groups affected have articulated is that they are already, under the current scheme, paying a higher contribution.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This section will require them to make an even higher contribution.  Is that not correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The people who are affected currently make a higher contribution because they retire earlier.  Their point is that under the new scheme their contributions will be even greater with no extra benefit.  They are, in fact, losing out because they are also affected by the new career average provision and will have to work for longer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not say much more.  I ask the Minister not to mix up gardaí, firefighters, prison officers and soldiers with politicians.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, they are all in fast accrual schemes.  The critical difference is that there is a very good reason the people I refer to have to retire early.  It is because of the nature of their jobs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is of a different order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Politicians should take their chances, but these ordinary workers who do difficult jobs are being required to make a bigger contribution and get less for it.  It is on that basis that we oppose the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our concern is for the ordinary rank and file and for low and middle income earners in these categories and across the public service.  We want to protect their pension entitlements and not overburden them.  We have no difficulty with legislation that reduces the pension entitlements of people at the top of the Army, the Garda or anywhere else in the public or Civil Service.  We are concerned about the rank and file
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was ruled out of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The United Left Alliance is opposed to this section for a number of reasons.  The Minister has indicated that this whole scheme will save approximately 35% of the current-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It will save the State approximately 35%.  As we said earlier when we discussed the career average, it is difficult to see precisely where these savings will come from.  The switch to the consumer price index is one of the three main new elements of the pensions regime.  Obviously, the Minister thinks the State will have to pay less when a pension is linked to the consumer price index than it would have to if the pension was linked to the final salary of the recipient.  We oppose this approach for that reason alone.  The impact of the use of this system will not distinguish between higher paid civil servants and low and middle-income civil servants.  We would not subscribe to a reduction in the pension entitlements of low and middle-income civil servants.  As I see it, this is a mechanism that can be used to cut their pension entitlements.  In addition to that issue, the issue of the power that is being given to the Minister also arises.  Under the current scheme, if somebody in the relevant grade gets a pay increase, the pensioner automatically gets a proportionate increase in his or her pension.  There is no ministerial discretion - the pensioner gets the increase - and there is no time lag.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not linked to the pay increases that public sector workers get?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but that is a regular time interval.  This section of the Bill provides for something quite different.  Section 39(4) provides that "the Minister shall decide when any increase in pensions under this section is to be paid having regard to movements in the consumer price index, including the timing and the means by which any increase is paid".  That will give the Minister of the day enormous discretion to delay the payment of increases or, as the Minister has just indicated, not to pay them at all in what might be construed as exceptional circumstances.  Given that such circumstances are the norm rather than the exception in the current economic climate-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----that will give a future Minister a huge amount of flexibility to decide not to pay the increases to which pensioners will be entitled.  I find that very objectionable and problematic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the phrase the Minister used.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There was more certainty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the first place, the Minister seems to be asserting, on the one hand, that he will make these savings and that the switch to the CPI will allow him to do so and on the other, and in response to the point I made, he is trying to claim payment will be more generous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Those two propositions do not add up, do they?  On the one hand, we will make this massive saving, on the other, the outcome will be more generous, according to the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Presumably, the Minister did not introduce the measure in order to be more generous.  He is not seriously suggesting that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I say "spin"?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My point is that the two imperatives, the claim made by the Minister on the one hand, and the imperative to make 35% savings, which would be made by these measures, do not add up. It would be less advantageous to the pensioner.The Minister stated that the Minister for Finance could decide to be more generous to a particular class of pensioner.  Presumably, he means the Minister could distinguish between those who might need an increase more, and those who might be deemed to need it less, for whom it would be delayed.  That paints a picture of a very benign Minister.  However, the actual wording of the legislation gives the Minister total flexibility.  "Timing" can potentially equate to not paying the increase at all.  A Minister could say he or she was not paying the increase for five, ten, or fifteen years.  The wording in question allows total flexibility for the Minister to make the decision as to whether he or she will award the increase.  The Minister will decide when is the appropriate time or if it is appropriate.  That is the reality.  The excuse of an emergency or exceptional circumstances could be used at any point in order not to give people their entitlements in terms of pension increases.  That is as against the current system whereby they would have had some certainty about getting those increases.
