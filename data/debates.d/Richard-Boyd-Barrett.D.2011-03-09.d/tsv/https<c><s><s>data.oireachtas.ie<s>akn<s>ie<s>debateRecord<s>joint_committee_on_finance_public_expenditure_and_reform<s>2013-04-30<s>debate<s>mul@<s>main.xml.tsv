RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one very direct question for the Minister. The sale of State assets is not included in the Minister's update. How does the commitment to the troika to sell off €3 billion worth of State assets, some of which is to be used to pay down debts, figure in this arithmetic? Does it figure in this arithmetic? If so, when does the Minister have to sell these State assets? What is the timescale? Is it required this year? Is structural reform required, or is it simply a balance sheet amount of €3 billion, which the Minister can, if he wishes, get elsewhere? I tried to get a straight answer from the troika on this and could not get one, so I hope the Minister might go one better and tell us whether it is required under the stability programme that we sell these assets, or if it is simply required that we come up with €3 billion. In fact, it is €1.5 billion, given that the Minister says half the proceeds of the sale of State assets can be used for something else. Can we just come up with €1.5 billion elsewhere - for example, from the savings the Minister claims we have made as a result of the restructuring of the promissory note and the other debt deals - and therefore not sell State assets such as our forests? Could the Minister answer those questions and explain how the sale of State assets, the proceeds from them and so on fit into this arithmetic?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So it is open to us not to sell them but to meet the targets through whatever means we choose.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a rather perverse notion of success against a background of 14% unemployment and crippling austerity which is being imposed on ordinary people. One can balance books by making people suffer. To take an extreme example, if we wiped out whole sections of the population you could probably balance the books, but it would be on the basis of extreme suffering, so it is rather perverse. Surely the only criteria for success would be what the Minister is going to do to deal with the unemployment situation or to ease the level of suffering people are feeling. Examining the tables for unemployment, we are looking at the continuation of mass unemployment for the foreseeable future, with only very small reductions in the best case scenario. Is that not a pretty bleak outlook? Is the best case scenario not hopelessly optimistic? For example, the Minister says the baseline assumption is one in which a modest international recovery takes hold in the second half of this year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the Minister's basis for saying there will be a modest recovery when all the indicators from Europe are that the economy is contracting?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry, Chairman.
