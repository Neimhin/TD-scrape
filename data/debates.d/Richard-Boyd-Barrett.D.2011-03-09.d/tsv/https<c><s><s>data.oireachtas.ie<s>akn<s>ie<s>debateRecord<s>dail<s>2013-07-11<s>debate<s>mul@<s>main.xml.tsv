RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Then legislate for fatal foetal abnormalities.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a reasonable proposal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to share time with Deputies Stephen S. Donnelly and Catherine Murphy. Margaret Thatcher was often referred to as somebody who was not for turning, regardless of the impact of her disastrous experiments in neoliberal economics, which set the scene for much of the disaster that she caused, along with Ronald Reagan, which ultimately culminated in the madness that produced the global economic crash. It seems the Government parties have inherited that trait of being not for turning, even when it is increasingly clear that the approach they have adopted to deal with the economic crisis is not working. It is the Minister's job to talk it up and paint a rosy picture. It would be wonderful if one could be enthusiastic about the measures to which he points and say they are hopeful signs amidst the €28 billion worth of pain inflicted on the people since 2008, which he has acknowledged. Billions of euro in adjustments have been introduced by the Government since it came to power and billions of euro more are promised in forthcoming budgets. If there were hopeful signs, one could argue it had all been worthwhile, but the little glimmers to which the Minister has pointed are fast evaporating. As others have said, we are aware of the human consequences of this year's budget cuts on top of those that preceded them. The victims have been many, including pensioners, lone parents, families through child benefit cuts and those who look after the disabled and the vulnerable. The rent cap has not been mentioned and the disaster that has resulted in my area, with people being increasingly driven into homelessness week after week.By the way, if the Minister is looking for savings that would not cost anything, I have told him repeatedly that if we built some council houses and put into State coffers the rent revenues which currently go into the pockets of private landlords we could not only save money but would generate some employment and deal with the housing crisis. The Minister consistently ignores that plea.  Those are the human costs. At the macro level on which the Minister has concentrated I do not see how he can sustain his view that the plan is working and that he should not turn away from the path of austerity. He says the employment situation is stabilising; I put it to him that the tiny reduction in the level of unemployment can be explained for the most part by the very high levels of emigration
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am talking about the unemployment figures. As the Minister knows, much of that work is part-time, replacing jobs that in many cases had been full-time ones. It includes people going on education and training programmes, which I welcome. Are there real jobs for the hundreds of thousands out there, jobs that will generate economic growth and so on? At the beginning of this year there were the small signs of economic growth and recovery to which the Minister pointed but these have completely evaporated and we are back in recession territory. The European economy is in increasing trouble as austerity of the kind that was applied here is applied throughout the rest of Europe. It is not working. In conclusion I point at the two big elephants in the room. The servicing of our debt is costing us €8 billion this year. The Minister says his primary goal is to deal with the deficit. Will he not acknowledge the big problem? At the end of this year, although we will have a primary budget surplus we will still have a huge deficit because of interest on debt which is largely not ours. Then there is the fiscal treaty. The Minister says we are towards the end of the austerity path. Why does he not admit that afterwards we must reduce the deficit further by subscribing to the terms of the fiscal treaty? That means years more of austerity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Over the past few days we have indicated that some of us believe the Bill will not even achieve its stated intention, which is to protect women whose lives are at risk because of a physical threat or the threat of suicide. In the latter case, suicidal women will not go near this process because it is so restrictive and intrusive in its interrogation of women in a vulnerable position. It fails to bring clarity to cases where women's lives are threatened and how doctors should intervene in such cases. It has failed on that account, as we have pointed out. Even beyond that argument, in many ways the debate we have had does not focus on the biggest element of the abortion debate, which is the thousands of women who are not in extreme cases but who travel to Britain for abortions because they feel their health is at risk, they have been victims of rape or sexual abuse, or they become pregnant as a result of incest. Some feel their welfare and well-being is threatened by having to continue a pregnancy they do not want.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate your need and everybody else's need to get this over as quickly as possible.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, if the Ceann Comhairle reads amendment No. 84, he will see it refers to sexual abuse, risk to health-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and risk to well-being, and that is a fairly extraordinary intervention.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The amendment refers to a risk to a woman's health and well-being and pregnancy as a result of sexual abuse. We export that problem and that is deeply hypocritical. It is a reality for thousands of Irish women, and although we accept their right to travel abroad to seek terminations in those instances, we deny them the right to have them in this State. That is an hypocrisy which is unsustainable and needs to be addressed. The purpose of the amendments is to appeal to the Government to address an unsustainable scenario. That reality for women is not being addressed by the State because of its lack of political courage. There can be no other explanation for its refusal to address the untenable restrictions that exist in that regard. I refer to the eloquent and pertinent statements of the Minister for Justice and Equality in this regard. He put it better than anybody has when he said it was unacceptable that while men can receive whatever treatment they need to protect their health and well-being, women are denied that right. There is a qualification on the right of women to secure the medical services they need to ensure the protection of their health and well-being. This fundamental discrimination exists against women and there has been no commitment by the Government to address it. We are asking the Minister to address it, but he will respond that this cannot be done within the current constitutional framework. While I accept that, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport said on the radio earlier that the Bill should be referred to the Supreme Court, as it will be challenged anyway, which is a good point. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform said earlier that the Oireachtas passes laws and any law it passes should be assumed to be constitutional until it is struck down by the courts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If one puts those two observations together and if the Government was serious about addressing the denial to women of their rights to protect their health and well-being, it could at least put this forward as something to be considered, and it if it were struck down, as it probably would be, it could then give a commitment that a referendum would be held to deal with the matter. One of the unacceptable scenarios the amendment deals with in the context of women having the right to protect their health and well-being is that in which a woman is forced to go ahead with a pregnancy when the foetus is diagnosed with a fatal abnormality. How much more damaging to a woman's health and her sense of well-being could it be than to criminalise a woman who seeks to terminate a pregnancy in those appalling circumstances? This is another issue the Minister must address. The Government, despite consistent requests during the debate, has failed to give any assurance whatsoever that during its term it intends to address these issues. Even now at this stage, I appeal to the Minister to give us some commitment in that regard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry - on a point of order-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to make a point of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am trying to make a point of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, I do not know why the Ceann Comhairle is making that comment when I was speaking directly on this amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have several amendments in this grouping. There are many qualifications in the Bill which essentially embed mistrust in the clinical judgment and good faith of doctors. These are an unnecessary misplaced concession to those who are opposed to abortion in any circumstance in what should be a trust in doctors. To use a term the Minister used frequently on Committee State, these changes are entirely superfluous and there is no need for them. They are simply a concession to certain people who want to hold back and frustrate the purpose of this legislation which is to allow for a pregnancy to be terminated where there is a threat to the life of the woman. The term “in good faith” implies that if a doctor acted in any other way, other than in good faith, he or she would be struck off. They have to act in good faith; that is their professional obligation. Why does it need to be included in the Bill? It is a form of organised distrust embedded in the Bill to assuage a certain side in this debate. That is why our amendments propose to delete this unnecessary term. The Minister’s amendments are significant and, clearly, are to deal with a political problem, not with the substantive issue the Bill is supposed to be dealing with, namely, to allow for terminations where women's lives are at risk. In the original draft of the Bill the definition of “reasonable opinion” made reference to that opinion having to have due regard to the need to preserve the unborn human life as far as practicable as required by the Constitution. The Minister has deleted that reference and included it in the key sections which deal with granting women the right that they should have, namely, to have pregnancies terminated when their lives are threatened. This is not needed and it is gratuitous to insert it there. Worse than this, it is likely to lead to greater hesitation on the part of doctors where, instead of simply making the judgment that a woman’s life is at risk, they must look over their shoulder to qualify that assessment in case it infringes on the rights of the unborn human life when that right is already clearly established. That is dangerous for women and it is a political concession on the part of the Minister. If it is not, will he explain why he has put it in when it is already included in the earlier definitions and already established, constitutionally and legally? Why did it need to be taken out of the definitions section and inserted in the individual sections, if it was not a political concession which could have damaging consequences for protecting the lives of women?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do I have to move the amendment in my name?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One aspect of the case of Savita Halappanavar was doubt and hesitation about at what point there was a risk to life. If this legislation has a purpose, it is to clarify the position and remove the doubt or anything that contributes to hesitation on the part of doctors to intervene decisively to save a woman's life as soon as there is a real and substantial risk to her life. Part of the Supreme Court test which has been deliberately included to clarify the point in determining what is a real and substantial risk is that the risk has to be real and substantial; it does not have to be immediate or inevitable. That is a very important clarification which can give confidence to a doctor to intervene where he or she believes there is a risk. When we put forward this amendment on Committee Stage, the Minister used the word "superfluous". I point out that his previous amendment inserts in each individual section what was included in the definitions section, namely, the need to balance the right to a lawful termination in a situation where there is a real and substantial risk with a reminder to the doctor. The Minister has said we need to include it in every section because the doctor may not read the definitions section. It is a reminder to say he or she must protect the right to life of the unborn before he or she makes that intervention to protect the life of the woman. That, it appears, is not superfluous but our amendments are.  In considering how to vote on the Bill, as pro-choice Deputies, we want to see movement.We wanted to vote for the Bill but this is another example, if the amendments are not accepted, of how all of the concessions made during the course of the debate have been to one side, which wants to restrict as much as possible the intent of this Bill which is to protect the life of women. When we table amendments which seek to clarify for and give certainty to doctors on when and how they can intervene to the protect the life of a women, the Minister states they are superfluous. The Minister refuses to accept such amendments from us and shoots them down. That is an indication of a fudge which is problematic and can lead to the sort of hesitation which can be decisive in the case of women's lives when they are at risk. Maybe the Minister will prove me wrong and accept these amendments which are entirely reasonable and accord with the Supreme Court judgment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State referred to Deputy Kelleher's intervention, in which he pointed out that one was giving a right and taking it away. He and the Minister of State are absolutely right about that. The Minister, however, is possibly guilty of doing the same thing himself in the way that he has framed this legislation. We have already made the point about the obstacles being put in the way of women's accessing abortion because of the onerous terms under which they can get it in cases of suicidal intent, requiring three doctors, three on a review panel and so on. That gives the right and takes it away. Nobody is going to avail of that. Nobody is going to go through that system, they are going to go to England. This legislation could at least clarify the situation in cases such as the Savita case where clearly there was hesitation and uncertainty. That is the point of the Bill. We need to give that certainty. This Bill would achieve something if it achieved that. The Minister of State cites a difference of opinion in the Supreme Court in the discussion between the two judgments. I am not aware of the one to which he referred but he said it was a response to somebody else who believed----- I do not know why the Minister of State is shaking his head. I will just repeat the point, the test that was put down in the Supreme Court was that the real and substantial risk did not have to be immediate or inevitable. That was put in to clarify what a real and substantial risk is. That is why it was said. It was to clarify the risk. It was necessary to clarify it because it was unclear and that is the point. Words are slippery. The Minister of State knows that as a lawyer and we need clarification - it is not funny.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As an English graduate I know words are slippery.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a lawyer the Minister of State knows they are slippery. That is why the clarification is necessary. That is the point. If there was clarity we would not have needed the legislation in the first place. This provides that clarity and that is why that clarity was in the test.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 81:In page 10, after line 39, to insert the following:“Fatal foetal abnormality10. (1) It shall be lawful to carry out a medical procedure in respect of a pregnant woman in accordance with this section in the course of which, or as a result of which, a pregnancy is ended, where—(a) the medical procedure is carried out by an obstetrician at an appropriate institution, and(b) subject to section 19, two medical practitioners, having examined the pregnant woman, have jointly certified that the foetus in question has a fatal foetal abnormality.(2) Of the 2 medical practitioners referred to in subsection (1)(b)—(a) one shall be an obstetrician who practises as such at an appropriate institution, and(b) the other shall be a perinatologist who practises as such at an appropriate institution.(3) If practicable, at least one of the medical practitioners referred to in subsection (1)(b) shall, only with the pregnant woman’s agreement, consult with the woman’s general practitioner (if any) for the purposes of obtaining information in respect of the woman from that general practitioner that may assist the medical practitioners in their decision as to whether or not to make a section 10 certification in respect of the woman.(4) Subject to section 19, the certifying obstetrician shall—(a) forward, or cause to be forwarded, the section 10 certification to an appropriate institution, and(b) make such arrangements as may be necessary for the carrying out of the medical procedure to which the section 10 certification relates at the appropriate institution.”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These are self-explanatory.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 107: In page 12, line 30, to delete "in good faith".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 117:In page 13, line 6, after “shall” to insert “forthwith”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no justification whatsoever for criminalising abortion. I do not know what exactly is the Fine Gael Party political position. There are probably mixed views within the ranks on the issue. However, I always understood the Labour Party was a pro-choice party and that it believed, whatever about the legal and constitutional limitations, abortion was a valid choice for women and that they had such a right. It seems incomprehensible to me that a party that describes itself a pro-choice and believes abortion is a valid option for women in a range of circumstances could, at the same time, support the criminalisation of abortion and women who procure abortions or doctors who provide them with such a service. That is incomprehensible and it beggars belief it could even suggest this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is about criminalisation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, because I genuinely find it hard to believe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am genuinely shocked. On Committee Stage the Government was asked on a number of occasions whose idea this was. Again, whose idea was it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, the people of Ireland did not at any point express a desire for a 14 year prison sentence for women who procured abortions or for those who provided such a service. The only possible justification there could be for the criminalisation of abortion is, as Deputy Clare Daly mentioned, the practice of back-street abortions. That is the only justification. However, that is not a justification because to perform an abortion on a woman without her consent would be a most serious criminal offence and a grievous assault, resulting in grievous bodily harm and God knows what else. It is already a crime. Similarly, it is a crime for somebody who is not a qualified medical practitioner to carry out an abortion. Therefore, there is no necessity to include this provision in the Bill. The most obnoxious aspect of this provision is not even the chill factor which it will undoubtedly maintain for doctors in making decisions in the interests of women's health and lives. It will undoubtedly weigh on their minds that if they act outside these very unclear guidelines as to when, how and where they can intervene to protect a woman's life, they could be guilty of a criminal offence and subject to a penalty of 14 years in prison. That certainly will have a chilling effect. Setting aside even that, however, the most obnoxious aspect of this provision is the issue of stigma. The Minister knows what I am saying. Anybody who claims to be pro-choice and respects the fact that abortion is a valid choice for women in some or all circumstances knows that the question of stigma is a very serious consideration. This provision very clearly says something to the thousands of women who travel to Britain every year for abortions. They do so for all sorts of reasons - because they have been raped, because they have a pregnancy which involves a fatal foetal abnormality, because they are facing inevitable miscarriage, because their health is threatened or because they feel they are too poor, too old or too sick to have a baby. This provision says to these women that what they are engaging in is a form of criminal activity and that the people who are providing them with the service are criminals. The Government is maintaining that stigma which is so damaging to the psychological welfare of women. As the Minister knows, one of the major points made by the women involved in Terminations for Medical Reasons when they made their presentations to Members of this House was how horrible it was, faced as they were with a diagnosis of fatal foetal abnormality during the course of a wanted pregnancy and having to travel to Britain for an abortion, to know, in addition, that what they were doing was considered criminal in the State. This provision maintains that aura and stigma of criminality around what they and other women have done and will do in the future. I know the Minister does not believe for one minute that what women in that situation have done is criminal. In fact, I hope he does not believe for one minute that the thousands of women who travel every year to Britain are engaging in something that is criminal, yet the Bill says that to undergo that procedure in the State is a criminal act. The women who travel to Britain do not live in a parallel universe where they will have the procedure performed there, where it is not criminal and then come home without a full awareness that what they have done is deemed a criminal offence in this jurisdiction for which they could face a prison sentence of 14 years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Thank you, a Cheann Comhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point I am making is about criminalisation. I do not see what could be clearer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was just about to finish. I am, however, perfectly in order and do not see why the Ceann Comhairle had to cut across me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is in Standing Orders?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where have I engaged in repetition?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was making a point about stigma.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know the Government does not want to hear what I am saying.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government refuses to deal with this most important of issues. It is shameful that it would seek to maintain the criminalisation of women for doing something which is their right.
