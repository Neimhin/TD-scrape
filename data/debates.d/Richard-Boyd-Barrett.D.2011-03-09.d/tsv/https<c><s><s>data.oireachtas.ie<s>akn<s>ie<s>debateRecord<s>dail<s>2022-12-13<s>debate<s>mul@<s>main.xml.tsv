RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On Thursday, Jacqueline, a mother of two teenage children and wife to Richard, a man who has worked all his life - both of them are in their late 50s - rang me in tears to tell me they are going to be in court in the first week of February to face eviction from the home where they have lived all their lives. This is despite claims by the Government that it has brought in an eviction ban.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They have both written to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the Government going to do to protect people who have done absolutely nothing wrong from being evicted from their homes? Will it finally bring in an eviction ban that actually prevents people who have done nothing wrong from being thrown out of their homes like this family?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Nobody else did.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was just saying that nobody else stuck to the time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	She also wrote to him.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us see how we get on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I suggest we see how we get on because the two other groupings are shorter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	However, we should give extra time to this grouping.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On 9 April 2020, more than 1,000 Debenhams workers received an email telling them that they had lost their jobs. The researchers who are making a film about the Debenhams dispute have just uncovered evidence which suggests very strongly that the three vulture funds, and a consortium including Bank of Ireland, had orchestrated this liquidation precisely one year before, in order to get around Irish law where that consortium, including Bank of Ireland which I want to stress, loaded €200 million of debt onto Debenhams Ireland and the Norwegian branch, which branch was later released from this debt, so that the entire debt was loaded onto Debenhams. That debt, however, could not been enforced against Debenhams Ireland unless one year had passed. Exactly one year to the day after the debt was fixed, the 1,000 workers were sacked. Involved in this was a company headed up by somebody who is an ex-KPMG employee. KPMG was later appointed by Debenhams as the liquidators. This poses very serious questions about the orchestrated sacrifice of 1,000 jobs in Debenhams and raises questions about what the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment knew when it was notified by KPMG of the liquidation and of the tactical and cynical manipulation of, essentially, the Debenhams group to sacrifice 1,000 workers. I have sent the Taoiseach the material because I cannot go through it all here and I ask him very seriously to look into this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I sent the Taoiseach today the evidence that has been dug up by the researchers into the film that is being made about Debenhams which, by the way, will be shown in the Dublin Theatre Festival in February or March, but they would like some answers in advance of that in respect of who knew what and the role of KPMG, the Bank of Ireland and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in this whole matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did they-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A failure of oversight.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the interest of time, I will let my question go.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be clear about what I was saying about Debehams, the Debenhams group which had been taken over by three vulture funds including two banks, Barclays and Bank of Ireland, saddled a floating charge of €200 million on the Irish operation. That would have been clear to anyone who was looking at it and should have been clear to the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment when KPMG informed it of the liquidation. It did demonstrate that this was a cynical, tactical liquidation that was orchestrated precisely to the day a year in advance in order to ensure that 1,000 workers who had given decades of service to that company would lose their jobs and not get a cent because artificial debts were imposed on the company. An ex-employee of KPMG, which I remind the House, is the liquidator, was involved in this transaction that took place a year to the day before those workers received their notice. Had it been received anything less than one year the €200 million debt would not have been there. It could not have been done. It explicitly exploited a loophole in company law which the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment should have known about and which KPMG should have and I suspect know about. Did it tell the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment what was going on? These are the questions that need to be answered. I am asking the Taoiseach to look into them as he was the Taoiseach when all this happened for the sake of the 1,000 workers and others who could face a similar fate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People Before Profit’s no-confidence motion had nothing to do with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O’Brien, as an individual. It had nothing to do with cynicism and certainly was not a stunt. Rather, it was a desperate attempt to force the Government to acknowledge its housing policies are failing thousands upon thousands of real human beings in the most terrible way. It is about more than 3,000 children who are going to spend Christmas in emergency accommodation, some for the second, third or fourth time. It is about the fact that 100,000 families and individuals are on housing waiting lists in desperate circumstances, waiting a decade or sometimes up to 20 years for a secure, affordable roof over their heads. It is about the fact that thousands of people are facing the imminent prospect of being evicted from their homes even though the Government claimed it protected them. It is about the fact that four Dublin city councils did not add a single new council house to the public housing stock in the first half of this year, despite the fact that we are facing an unprecedented housing crisis. It is about the fact that the Government has failed to spend €750 million when facing this absolute catastrophe, affecting children, families and individuals, including workers, at the wrong end of this housing crisis. That is why we submitted our motion. Of course, to ensure we could not present our alternative proposals, which we have done time and again, the Government tabled its own motion. This means People Before Profit has but six and a half minutes to make its case. If our motion had been allowed, we would have had 40 minutes. Instead, we have the cacophony of people standing up to say how wonderful Government policy is and how well it is working. That is typical of the manipulation and spin that occur when dealing with an absolute catastrophe facing families. Let me give a couple of examples of those who really matter. Jacqueline and Richard, a couple in their 50s with two teenage children, rang me on Thursday bawling crying because they got a notice stating they will be in court in February, when there is supposed to be an eviction ban. They are to be thrown out of the house where they have lived all their lives. They are working people who have paid their taxes. Nothing the Government has done will protect them or provide them with a home. They are terrified they will be in a car. Jacqueline is terrified that Richard will literally not survive this. Our motion was also about a woman of 55 who is on dialysis for nine hours per day. She submitted an application for housing priority on medical grounds last November but the authorities are still looking for additional medical information, without which they will not process it. It is about a 73-year-old man with a spinal condition who is sleeping on his daughter’s couch. Despite his situation, the council is looking for more information about his health. It is about a 59-year-old man with Alzheimer’s disease who has been in seven different housing assistance payment tenancies in nine years although doctors have said specifically that he needs a secure, affordable place where he will not be moving around. That is what is going on. These things have been said time and again to the Minister. During the summer, we tabled a motion to reduce rents, just as we put forward Bills to do so. We introduced the right-to-housing Bill, a Bill to stop evictions where there is no fault or where people are being evicted on grounds of sale, use-it-or-use-it policies, and measures to establish a State construction company to accelerate the delivery of public housing on affordable land, but the Government voted against them all. Why? If we ponder the fact that Cairn Homes’ profit increased by 129% last year and Irish Residential Properties REIT, the biggest landlord in the country, is making a profit of 50% on every tenant, we will have some idea of what is really going on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Come on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not. I campaigned for it for 15 years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I must comment on my disappointment that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has left, given that the Government earlier, on the confidence motion, spent a lot of its time claiming rather disingenuously that members of the Opposition were not here. We will see to what extent anybody really bought that, but it was part of a concerted effort to prevent the real, substantial discussion as to what is actually happening in a key area of public investment to solve the housing crisis in this country, which is blighting the lives of so many people.The tabling of a confidence motion, when originally there was a no confidence motion, allowed the Government to dominate and to minimise the ability of the Opposition to put forward its case. That is part of the parliamentary game-playing that goes on in here. Then we have a debate which is dealing with substance around what is actually being spent by different Departments or what was not spent from what was supposed to be spent by Departments. This debate, helpfully for the Government, will be completely ignored by the media. There are virtually no Deputies here for the discussion on what was spent and not spent. However, when you examine the money that was spent and was not spent, you learn certain things that provide slightly more tangible evidence for the various claims and counter-claims that are being made about Government policy and particularly in the area of housing. There is a startling figure on carryover of expenditure which is money that was allocated to be spent but was not spent. By far the biggest figure, which does not tell the whole story, is that for the housing Department. It is €340 million that will be carried over to next year because it was not spent. It is part of a bigger figure of €700 million. The Minister of State may be able to illuminate this but I think the maximum carryover figure can only be 10% of the original allocation, so this is not the full picture of what was not spent because you are only allowed to carry over the maximum amount. However, €340 million is a huge amount and there was also other money that was not spent on housing. I would argue that much of the money we spent on housing was wasteful expenditure that does not help to deal with the housing crisis. It is a shocking fact that the Government cannot spend €700 million in the teeth of an absolutely extraordinary housing crisis. You can look at the figures and see this but, again, this is the material that does not really get out there. However, people, you might call them the nerds but they are very useful nerds, like Mr. Mel Reynolds the housing commentator puts figures together each year and the actual housing figures are quite telling. It explains why all this money was not spent. Mel Reynolds does not simply look at what the Government claims it will build or spend in terms of housing but at what is actually happening to the housing stock and where there is more public housing at the end of the year than there was at the beginning because that would actually tell you something. Here is a fact: in 2017 Dublin City Council had 24,990 local authority houses. Five years later, it had 24,722. That is minus 268 after all the money that was spent or not spent, and after all the claims that it was going to ramp up the investment in public housing, Dublin City Council has 268 fewer local authority houses than it had five years ago. It is quite extraordinary. Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has done slightly better. It gained 25 local authority houses in five years. Fingal County Council has gained 780. That sounds a lot better when you are dealing with a minus figure or 35 but when you are dealing with thousands and thousands of families on a housing list, that is pretty disastrous too. South Dublin County Council has 452 additional after five years in the epicentre of the housing crisis.  I have mentioned here before that the figure for additional local authority houses built by Dublin City Council in the first two quarters of this year was zero; Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council was zero; Fingal County Council was zero; and South Dublin County Council was zero. How does the Government manage to claim that it is going to deliver 9,000 social houses and a few thousand additional affordable houses when this is the actuality of what is happening? The total number of new local authority houses and approved housing body houses is 1,632 in the first six months of this year. How does it manage to claim that it is nearly or not far off meeting its targets? It has not spent the money and these are the actual figures. It is because it delivers the social houses that the State has not built itself by lease or by HAP tenancies. That is an enormous waste of money.  Take the biggest landlord in the country, IRES REIT. A recent study showed that it makes an average of 50% profit on every single tenant, on rents that are through the roof. A huge amount of that is being paid by the taxpayer in HAP, RAS and leasing payments to these landlords who are seeing absolutely extraordinary increases in their profits. You can say the same for Cairn Homes. Its profit margins jumped by 167% in the last year. It is the biggest owner of zoned building land in Dublin city. These are extraordinary profits but we end up paying for much of that because we will buy the affordable housing from them. That is why, of course, we voted against the Government’s Affordable Housing Bill because it explicitly linked the price of affordable housing to market prices. It said it would be benchmarked against market prices. There would be something of a discount but market prices that are manipulated upwards to astronomical levels by the likes of Cairn Homes where we have more than 70,000 planning permissions for apartments but only 5,000 apartments being delivered each year in the last number of years. These people drip-feed construction so that prices stay high, rents stay high and then the State, the tenant or the house buyers pay through the nose because these people are manipulating the entire situation. When it comes to the actual allocation for the State to do the cost-effective thing, which is to build its own housing on its own land and cut out the profit margins of the IRES REITs and Cairn Homes, there is a complete failure to deliver or to spend the money that was allocated to do that. The Government is the mouthpiece for these very same people and says that it is not because of all that we have a housing crisis. No, it is because someone objected somewhere to a housing development. We have tens of thousands of planning permissions that are not being commenced by these people, so what we will do is make it easier for the developers to get rezoned land or to get planning permission in order that they can get even more land assets and control even more of the market to rob even more money from tenants, house buyers and from the public purse in appropriation. It would make you sick.
