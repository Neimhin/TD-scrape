RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All of the private consultants have it already.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also want to hear the answer to that question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Taoiseach's commitments to a greater level of transparency and accountability, although we can debate what led to them. Some of us feel that the scandal of the consultants at Irish Water is what forced his hand on this, but whatever the reason, we are moving on with the commitment from the Taoiseach to open things up and to have more information in the public domain and on his and other Departments' websites. One of the issues that emerges from all of this, in the context of Irish Water and the recent discussions on the Estimates, which contain fairly significant sums for consultants, is that there is a gap in information concerning what is behind the headline payments to consultants. Let us take Irish Water as an example and the sum of €44 million-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a question. It is absolutely a question and I want the Taoiseach to answer it. What is behind that sum of €44 million? When one considers the level of scrutiny of other areas of public expenditure, including how much public servants are paid, their hourly rates, what the Taoiseach's salary is, what my salary is, what our expenses are and so forth, then the same level of detail should be provided, as a matter of course, on the remuneration for consultants who are paid out of the public purse. No issue of commercial sensitivity can insulate people who are in receipt of large amounts of public money from the requirement to provide detailed information as to their hourly rates, how many people they are employing and so forth. When one looks at the scale of the figures, one must conclude that they are being paid massive amounts of money.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The public are entitled to that information. Will the Taoiseach furnish us with that level of detail?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what I asked about. Can we know the hourly rate for the consultants?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Arising from the results of the referendum on the Seanad, any conclusion that does not conclude there is deep alienation and disaffection from the political system as a whole is not facing reality. It was not simply about the Seanad but was about politics and politicians in general. There is deep distrust of the lot of them - that is, of all of us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am. My point was on the conclusion one should draw from the Seanad result and how that should inform how we deal with the Seanad issue. While the Taoiseach may smirk all he likes, that is the level of anger that exists.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One point that has been clearly expressed in this Chamber and which is the subject of an absolute consensus across the wider public is that one cannot have a democratic institution in which all citizens do not have a say. There are finer points to that debate as to how one would make it universal and not merely a replica of this institution, and they must be discussed. However, everyone would expect a universal franchise and the Taoiseach should accept that. If he does not, he is not confronting the reality. The other issue concerns something the Taoiseach, if he intends to knock on doors in the next few months, will encounter absolutely everywhere. Can politicians, be they in the Seanad, the Dáil or anywhere else, be held accountable for the promises they make? Alternatively, must one wait for five years to hold them accountable? Most people believe this is not good enough. Therefore, Members should start to discuss what the citizens are discussing, namely, whether a mechanism can be put in place for recall or accountability between elections. Obviously, this would have to be without destabilising government altogether, which is what the Taoiseach will protest. However, can a mechanism be put in place whereby the public, in between elections, can have some say about policy matters or regarding their opinions if they believe politicians have not delivered on the promises they made? Were Members to have such a serious discussion and were they to make a serious effort to put in place mechanisms that responded to these concerns, they would be doing a good job for democracy in Ireland. In addition, by so doing they might also begin to restore some of the lost legitimacy and credibility of the political process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not mention protest.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should have a system of recall.
