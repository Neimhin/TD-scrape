RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the officials from the Department for a very good and interesting report. There is an awful lot of detail to look at but it is very helpful. It is a big reform to now have a document like this containing this much detail and telling us whether the allocation of money made in a budget has achieved what was set out as the rationale for that allocation. This is a lot more information than we used to have before these reports were introduced. They are also improving all of the time. Well done to the officials. There is so much in the report. It is kind of for each sectoral committee to study the section relevant to it and to then follow-up. However, there are a few things that strike me. The first relates to the Department of Transport. Is there a problem with the Department of Transport? There is absolutely no information on many of its key high-level metrics for 2019, 2020 and 2021. There are no figures on the number of rail stations with accessible bridge crossings, the number of stations with improved accessibility, the number of bus stations with Part M of the building regulations internal and external accessibility improvements, the number of bus stops, the number of wheelchair-accessible vehicles in the taxi fleet and so on. It is not just that there are no figures for this year, but that there are none for the last three years. We therefore do not really know whether the Department of Transport is spending money on the things it was supposed to spend it on and delivering the results it was supposed to deliver. That seems like a big issue. It is the only one I can see that is like that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It certainly is. There is a lot of campaigning going on around the area of access. I particularly note the great work of the disability campaigning group, Access for All. It would probably not be surprised at this, but it would be angry. I have been meeting that group for quite a few years. In a way, this is for the Department of Transport, Dublin Bus and Iarnród Éireann. This is an example of a body telling you it is working on improving accessibility while not managing to gather information on it. It has accepted that these are reasonable metrics but does not gather the information. Access for All gathers information as to the number of DART stations every week where people in wheelchairs cannot get on a train because the lifts are not working. The people gathering that information are volunteers and campaigners. There is a pretty big gap there that is worth highlighting. That is not the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform's fault.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There will be a massive improvement. We eagerly await that. On higher education, in the equality section of the report, there are metrics covering students with disabilities, Travellers and quite a number covering women in particular positions and so on, which are important metrics in terms of equality. I suggest one of the biggest issues in higher education in terms of equality is the major inequality in the difference between people from higher socioeconomic and people from lower socioeconomic backgrounds accessing university and higher education. We need to know we are improving in that or not as the case may be. As it is a major issue, there should be some metric that captures that and assesses whether decisions we make about grants, fees, outreach programmes or whatever it may be are delivering any change in terms of accessibility to higher education. I do not know if Mr. Kinnane would have any comment on that but that needs to be added in there.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept it is a work in progress but it would be important to include that area as it is a critical one in terms of equality because there is a gross inequality in that, as I think Mr. Kinnane will be aware and it has been widely discussed. Another aspect I would note in passing, which is more a matter for the committee to follow up on, is the number of lower-income households who have been provided with energy efficiency upgrades in the equality section. Overall, the numbers indicate we are not meeting the targets. However, it is useful information. These reports are brilliant in that sense but we are massively underperforming in meeting the targets. One might argue the targets are pretty modest in and of themselves and it is useful information to have but we are doing about 50% or 60% of what is targeted in terms of energy efficiency upgrades, particularly for those who need support with respect to the warmer homes scheme and so on. When metrics are set, who decides on them as to what is a good metric? I am interested in the metrics for the film industry. The metrics in terms of expenditure in that area are the number of feature films funded and the number of participants in training and development. Who came up with them? I frankly think they mask serious problems in that area. The number of feature films produced does not tell us everything we need to know about the development of our film industry. The number of people participating in courses does not tell us how many people are becoming qualified because in my view the answer to that question is none. There is not a proper training and accreditation qualification regime in the area of film despite much money being allocated to it. I am wondering who decides on the metric. On the face of it, one would think that looks good but on digging a little below the surface I would argue it is not so good. One element that sector should be asked about is its employees and people having some security in employment. Who decides on the metrics? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is key for them to identify changes or failures to meet targets. That is all I have to say. I thank the witnesses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I reiterate that point that it is a great piece of work. One of the things we are looking at in our committee is tax expenditure and all of this is direct expenditure, is it not? When you give the figures for expenditure under each departmental heading, it is the direct allocations and presumably does not take account of the expenditures. Do the witnesses think it would be plausible - it would certainly be good in my opinion - to also look at the tax expenditures under each of those departmental headings and to look at what they are delivering for us? This is obviously a major step forward in terms of seeing what we are trying to achieve with direct funding allocations. Now we can measure that. We have been discussing the fact that there is no real, or very little, measurement of tax expenditures even though they are supposed to achieve certain things as well. Is it a plausible that we could work towards this report, including that analysis as well?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a very brief supplementary question. I understand the demarcation lines but there is a certain sort of lack of "joined-up-ness" here. I will give an example from agriculture where we allocate a certain amount of direct funding to a particular programme while simultaneously there are tax expenditures that are trying to achieve certain things in agriculture but they are not looked at in the round or in terms of the agricultural sector as a whole because they are both trying to achieve things with public money in a particular sector but in two different ways. We have always tended to look at this stuff more and now we are looking at it in even more detail and with more analysis. We are starting to look at this other area but we are not as far down the road and have not joined the two arms yet. I take the point about the Department of Finance. This needs to be said to it as well. It seems there is a logic in seeing how all-of-government efforts and funding, whether it is through tax expenditure or direct expenditure, should be looked at in the round to see if we achieved what we were trying to achieve.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
