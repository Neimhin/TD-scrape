RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The situation in Catalonia, about which the Taoiseach was asked yesterday, continues to escalate. What conversations has he had, and what does he intend to have, with other European leaders about the escalating crisis? There was a narrative yesterday, partly echoed by the Taoiseach, involving the condemnation of violence in general and the need for dialogue. Judging from the unprecedented intervention of the Spanish King, it is absolutely clear that the Spanish state is totally intransigent. It is not interested in dialogue or mediation. The belief in Catalonia is that if the Catalonian people try to declare independence based on a 90% "Yes" vote in the referendum, there will be serious repression, more than we have seen to date. What is the attitude of the Taoiseach towards that? What attitude, if any, has he garnered from other European leaders about what appears to be an intransigent and brutal effort by the Spanish state to suppress people without any willingness to discuss a democratic move towards self-determination by the people of Catalonia? Do European leaders recognise how serious the situation is? It is the most serious political and constitutional crisis Western Europe has faced in some decades. Do the Taoiseach and other European leaders have a sense of urgency about the situation? What stance are the Taoiseach and other European leaders going to take on this situation? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Speaking of Ardnacrusha, that was a moment when the State made a radical decision which worked to build a hydro-electric energy station.Will the Minister be attending the Bonn climate conference and will he have to admit there that on the critical question of climate change, the Government is failing to take the kind of radical action necessary to avoid massive fines for the State's failure to meet emission targets, and to take seriously the move to transition to a low carbon economy that will protect our environment and help to protect the entire planet? Does he agree that we are failing disastrously in this regard? We are nowhere close to meeting our targets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has not answered the question in so far as it applies to Ireland and this State's ability to meet its targets, to take climate change seriously and do something about it. Does the Minister accept that we are failing disastrously? Carbon emissions are increasing. They have increased from 56 million tonnes of carbon during the 1990s to almost 60 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent now, so it is worsening. The EPA says Ireland faces significant fines and that we are nowhere near meeting our targets. We can forget about the 20% target, as it says we would be lucky to get as much as a 4%, 5% or 6% reduction in emissions. Friends of the Earth says that we are denial. It is clear what is happening. I raised the matter of forestry recently. We are pathetically underperforming in our afforestation programme. We are nowhere close to targets we had in the past. Our public transport is very expensive. We have some of the lowest levels of subsidy in Europe and there has been no serious reduction in car use because we are not doing anything to significantly reduce the cost of public transport and improve its quality. We are still awarding licences for gas and oil exploration. The renewable energy scheme appears focused on big corporations and is not available to small businesses and communities. Is it not the case that we are failing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister mentioned a number of things. Take the area of forestry. We are all aware of the carbon sink but I am not aware of any attempt to ramp that up. There has been talk about it but nothing has been done. There will be no increase in the current levels of investment or changes in policy. Why is it that we do not slash public transport fares? If we want to get people out of cars, we should slash fares. They are very expensive. Where is a big insulation programme being rolled out, one that is easy and affordable for people to reduce their energy use? Why are all the research and development tax credits going to multinational corporations instead of into universities to develop sustainable renewable energy sources?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The fact that, through the CSO, we have identified 180,000 empty residential units as well as perhaps over 25,000 above shop units, which could potentially be available for residential property, indicates the chronic failure of public policy in the face of an enormous housing and homelessness emergency. In so far as this Bill attempts to address one aspect of that, I welcome it and commend Fianna FÃ¡il, which is a rare enough thing for me to do, but it is right to identify it and seek to address it. However, the issue is whether the Bill actually addresses the problem. The proposers of the Bill have rightly and humbly acknowledged that it will have to be examined in detail. We need to look at many aspects of it and I would underline those points. We cannot have anything that leads us back to tenement style living, overcrowding, bedsits, shoddy quality, unsafe, hazardous or low quality accommodation which exploits the housing and homelessness emergency to degrade standards of accommodation for the people who need it. I do not suggest that is what the Bill intends to do - I know it is not - but we must be extremely careful that is not the consequence. We must also be extremely careful that the consequence is not profiteering in the other direction.Even if we free up these units as we must, if there are no conditions around it or if we do not have the right type of regime to do it, there is nothing to stop the private owners of those properties charging extortionate rents and contributing absolutely nothing to dealing with the housing and homelessness emergency. We could just facilitate them making a lot of extra money out of their property and not really helping in any way with the crisis. That does not help anything. While the target of this legislation is correct in stating we have to free up these units for people who desperately need housing or accommodation, and I agree and it is right that we should progress the Bill and discuss it very seriously, we need to remember that there are two aspects to our failure to do this to date. One is a failure in public policy and a failure of the State to intervene in the housing market, and the other is the fact the majority of vacant units of all sorts are in private hands, and the private market has shown no interest in making them available to people who need them because its primary interest is the value of the asset or the money that can be made off it. We need to bear that in mind when we are trying to come up with a regime that will free these up, that it should make them available and that it should not degrade the standards. Absolutely, fire safety cannot be sacrificed in this. This is absolutely critical. Even if Deputy Cowen says this will not degrade the current controls, let us remember the current controls are not actually being enforced anywhere. It is one thing to have legislation, but if we do not have people to enforce the legislation it is meaningless, and this could potentially become a licence for people to build substandard accommodation. This cannot be allowed to happen. Even if this does pass with all of these checks, there is no guarantee that the owners of those properties would still consider it viable from their point of view to make these properties available, and we need to consider local authorities getting hold of these vacant properties and putting the money in themselves to refurbish them rather than simply waiting for private owners to do so.
