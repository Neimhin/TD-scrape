RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Following directly on from that, is that not an argument for addressing the current housing crisis to a far greater extent than we are through direct public housing provision because that does not distort the tax base, as well as the fact that it provides cheaper and affordable housing for people? Even from a fiscal sustainability point of view is it not preferable?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Coffey expressed concern about stamp duty but that would not come into play in public housing provision.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My point is that they do not come into play in direct public housing provision.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So that anxiety would be significantly limited if the big shortfall in affordable housing provision was done directly by the State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Except that public housing is self-financing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask Mr. Coffey to consider this premise because I think it is very important. One of the biggest factors likely to contribute to overheating is the chronic under-provision of affordable housing. What happened previously is that we had an enormous property boom and the housing crisis was getting worse during that period, even before the crash. We were having record levels of output but it was directed at selling for a profit and the prices were unsustainable because people's incomes could not match them and they had to get themselves into a lot of debt. With public housing one does not have that problem so people do not incur big debts. There is a revenue stream that is self financing over an approximate period of 30 years. The other big advantage is that it keeps a lid on property prices generally and it stops the distortions developing even in the private market. Is that not a win-win?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is exactly my point. Currently, prices are already nearly back to peak levels whereas incomes are certainly not in terms of purchasing power so there is a problem. In many cases, people cannot buy at these prices and if they are going to buy, they are going to have to take on a lot of debt. That is a fiscal risk. It is not just a housing problem. It is also a fiscal risk surely if the social housing provision of the State relies, very significantly, on leasing and other arrangements with private sector providers that are charging the State very high prices.That is the case. Is that not a fiscal risk that the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, should be warning about? Should we not be concerned that there is an over-reliance on the private market to deliver affordable housing and that this liability could balloon massively if property prices continue in their current direction?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would just-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are a couple of other issues I wanted to raise. However, I would suggest that Mr. Coffey should look very closely at this issue from a fiscal point of view. Long before the housing crisis was publicly acknowledged, I warned Dr. John McHale that it was coming. He said he would look at it, but did not recognise it as a danger. A year later, everybody on this committee and the Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach recognised it as a danger. Here is something I think the IFAC should look at. Mr. Coffey should look at the reliance on private sector provision of social and affordable housing in the Government's housing plans under Rebuilding Ireland and the cost that will be incurred to the State. Out of a total of 130,000 proposed social housing units, between 60,000 and 70,000 are going to come from the private sector, through leasing arrangements or housing assistance payment, HAP, arrangements. The cost of that to the State is going to be vast. If we compare this cost with that of the direct provision of housing, we see that upfront capital costs would be bigger and long-term costs would be much less. We will have no control of that if the market continues according to current trends. The Irish Fiscal Advisory Council should look at that as a serious fiscal risk.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with Mr. Coffey. His point is absolutely right. Housing associations are involved in the rest of Europe. That is not what is happening in the Rebuilding Ireland plan. They have slightly changed the balance, essentially because of people protesting over the last year. However, the change is only very slight. Looking at the Rebuilding Ireland proposals, we see that the majority of delivery still depends on private sector providers. That is very alarming. I do not see how it will deliver affordable housing, but even if it happens, it will be a huge call on the public finances which will grow exponentially over the following years. I suggest that this should be looked into. I want to raise also Ireland's reliance on the corporate tax receipts from a very small number of multinational corporations, MNCs. The witnesses' warnings about Brexit could be added to this consideration. Do the witnesses not think that due to these considerations, we must radically reconfigure our economy? Another danger, which has not been mentioned, is climate change. The cost of not meeting our climate change targets is another potentially big financial call on public revenues. Would the witnesses not say that all three of those very serious risks mean that we have to reconfigure our economy radically? In that context, is it sensible for the IFAC to suggest that one of our buffers should be the rainy day fund rather than using revenues while we have them and putting them into strategic investment in key areas where we could diversify the economy on a more sustainable basis? The rainy day fund just creates a cash buffer, as it were, whereas strategic investment creates a buffer of sustainable investment in areas that would diversify the economy and make it less vulnerable in some of those areas, such as renewable energy, which would lessen the focus on MNCs, beef exports to Britain and so on. This is where we should now be thinking of investing whatever funds we have for this purpose.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I clearly think they are a risk. Am I out of time, Chair?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I clearly think they are a risk. However, is it not part of the IFAC's job to identify those risks? The witnesses have identified some risks. They say Brexit is a risk and they note the over-reliance on MNCs. Is it not the logical follow-on that we must diversify away from those areas? To diversify, we must invest and do so strategically, I would have thought. Why emphasise the rainy day fund over strategic investment in areas that would buffer us, to use Mr. Coffey's term, from risks that are clearly identifiable? The fines arising from climate change and the impact of climate change are not speculative ideas or guesswork. They are going to happen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I forgot to thank Mr. Coffey in my initial contribution. If I was being rapid with the questions, it was only because I was up against the clock.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know. I appreciate all the work. Mr. Coffey is coming in next year to talk about corporate tax, is he not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the report?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We asked Mr. Coffey before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach met but we did not get him in.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We were hoping to get Mr. Coffey in and thought we agreed that he was coming in next year. I hope he is coming in.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do not worry about the finance committee. This is the Committee on Budgetary Oversight.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Coffey identified that the knowledge development box, intangible assets, allowances and so on that were benefitting a small number of IT companies was not necessarily translating into higher levels of investment. Does he think that needs to be looked at? Developing and innovation is part of developing a sustainable economic model. If available public expenditure is going into a small number of companies and it is not translating into higher levels of investment, would Mr. Coffey think, as seems to be implied in his report, that we should be much more focused on that investment going into public universities or other areas which are likely to actually yield real economic activity and gains to the economy?
