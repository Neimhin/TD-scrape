RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are many disgraceful aspects to the Government's ideological determination to force local councils to privatise public land and hand it over to developers who helped bankrupt this country, but the aspect of this on which I would like the Taoiseach to comment is the price the State will pay. The Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Murphy, speaks of stripping councils of their powers. Has the Taoiseach looked at the price we will pay to the private developer to whom we have transferred land at O'Devaney Gardens, and the private developers to whom the Government plans to transfer hundreds of other sites, to buy the units back at market prices? I saw the guidelines issued by the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government which show that the top prices the State will pay can be up to €526,000 for a two bedroom house, €584,000 for a three bedroom house, €704,000 for a four bedroom house, €289,000 for a one bedroom apartment and €335,000 for a two bedroom apartment. Those are the figures in the guidelines issued to Dublin City Council by the Minister at the beginning of the year. Is the Taoiseach seriously suggesting that is good value for money for public land that the Government is handing over-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----to these developers who wrecked the country only ten years ago?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What action, if any, does the Taoiseach believe the EU should take in the face of the latest assault by the US-Israeli axis on the rights and lands of the Palestinian people? The decade-long assault on the Palestinian people by Israel has taken a worse turn since the coming to office of President Donald Trump, be it the recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel through moving the US Embassy or the support for the obnoxious nation state law, which grants only Jewish people the right to self-determination and denies it to Palestinians. The latest nasty twist is the statement by US Secretary of State, Mike Pompeo, that the illegal settlements on Palestinian land by Israeli settlers are not really illegal at all, which backs up the Netanyahu plan for what is effectively the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian land, which is land designated under international law for a Palestinian state, and the extension of the apartheid policies whereby once that land is annexed by settlers, walls and fences are built around it to deny it to Palestinians forever. At what point will the EU stand up, do something about this and take meaningful action to vindicate the rights of the long-suffering Palestinians?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the Palestinians?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the central demands of the young people who have led the fight for radical climate action is to keep fossil fuels in the ground. Scientists have indicated that we must keep 80% of known reserves in the ground if we are to have even a chance of not passing the tipping point as regards the climate overheating. The Government has tried to justify its decision to block People Before Profit's Planning and Development (Climate Measures) (Amendment) Bill 2019 by stating that gas is a transitional fuel. It has also used that rationale to justify promoting the liquid natural gas terminal at Shannon as one of the European projects of common interest. Does the Taoiseach have a comment on the fact that at the end of last week, the European Investment Bank, in contrast to the Government's approach to this matter, made a decision to stop financing all fossil fuel energy projects from 2021 including, importantly, those involving gas? It did so despite lobbying from a number of European Governments to the effect that a restriction on gas should not be imposed. The European Investment Bank is listening to the young people and the scientists and saying that we have to stop taking all fossil fuels out of the ground, stop exploring for them and stop building infrastructure, as the Government is proposing to do, to lock us into their use for years to come. Could the Government at least come up to the level of the European Investment Bank when it comes to seriously tackling climate change and fossil fuel use?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The European Investment Bank, EIB, however, does not believe that any more.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 2:In page 10, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:
"Report on special assignee relief programme
9. Within 6 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall produce a report on the implementation of the special assignee relief programme.".The Minister will be aware that I am a big critic of what I describe as tax loopholes that reduce the effective tax rate paid by big corporations on what are often significant profits and some of the best paid people working in this country. When I talk to constituents about these tax loopholes and reliefs, which they do not get but a small privileged group gets, the special assignee relief programme is the one that really irritates them. In terms of the total amount of money involved, it is not astronomical in the way that many of the big loopholes for the corporate sector are but it really gets them. It horrifies them to think that there is a tax break available only to people who earn more than €75,000. I am not easily shocked by the inequalities that exist in society because I have become so used to them but even I was shocked by the numbers of people who benefit from this relief. The earnings of these people are quite shocking. We discussed this matter at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight when we were given a table showing the figures. Unfortunately, I do not have all the figures with me but I was staggered that dozens of people in various categories, including those earning between €250,000 and €350,000, between €350,000 and €450,000, and even higher amounts, were getting this tax relief which is not available to ordinary workers. I do not know how the Minister can justify that. I do not believe that removing this relief for people earning salaries that are unimaginable to ordinary people would cause them to flood out of the country. I do not buy that proposition. This is a giveaway to already stunningly well paid people, one which lets them off paying their fair share of tax. We should get rid of this relief. However, Opposition Deputies cannot do so because any attempt to remove it would be ruled out of order because it involves money. It is important for the record to state our opposition to this relief. I am curious to hear how the Minister would justify it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point has been made and the Minister knows we disagree. There are many talented people who have left or who are leaving this country. We need those people in our construction sector, public services and a number of other areas where there are quite serious labour shortages. The reason many people do not return to Ireland is due to the fact that the cost of accommodation or that wages are just not high enough. Where is the incentive for those individuals? We are giving this incentive to people who must earn more than €75,000 per year, excluding bonuses, commissions, etc., that they also get. A person can only get this if he or she is massively well paid. Some of these people are so massively well paid it boggles the mind. One would wonder if anybody really deserves to be paid that much. Not only are these people paid massive amounts, but we are giving them a tax relief that no ordinary worker would ever hope or expect to get. Where is the incentive for the people who earn less than €75,000, particularly when we desperately need them? The Minister argues that we need these people and that this measure is justified in order to get them. What will he do to attract the people who would earn less €75,000? What incentive is being given to them? That inequity makes this totally unacceptable. No amount of argument about the benefit arising from this or that company to the country can justify that inequity. Any point that can be made by the Minister about the contribution those companies make to this country could equally be made about all the people who earn less than €75,000. Do those who earn less than €75,000 not make an equally important contribution to this country and its economy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 5:
In page 15, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:
“Report on key employee engagement programme
11. Within 6 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall produce a report on the implementation of the key employee engagement programme.”.I have very little to say on this amendment other than that it has not been a particularly effective scheme. There are better ways to support SMEs. If the idea is that when shares become valuable the Government gives tax breaks for those shares, that is doing it the wrong way around but it is not really working in any event in terms of the benefits that have arisen. This is the wrong way to encourage or promote small and medium enterprise and it suffers from some of the same flaws as other tax reliefs the Government provides on the basis of either high earnings or profit. The Minister is well aware of my opinions on those reliefs. It is on that basis we should rethink this and scrap this scheme but I will not labour point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will withdraw it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 13:In page 32, between lines 13 and 14, to insert the following:
"Report on wealth and higher incomes taxes
26. Within 6 months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall produce a report on establishing a wealth tax and increased taxes on high income earners with view to achieving a more equitable distribution of wealth and income.".Something most people do not know, because they do not feel it in their own lives, is just how incredibly wealthy this country is. Most people are struggling on their moderate or low earnings. They find it difficult to pay their bills and their rent, to pay for childcare and to put their children to school. Most people struggle.They would hope to imagine that the way in which the economic growth that they helped generate and is at record levels would equally benefit everyone who contributed to it. That is not what happens, though. They struggle when some others are getting very wealthy. Given that I must now move the debate's adjournment, we will take that point up again tomorrow.
