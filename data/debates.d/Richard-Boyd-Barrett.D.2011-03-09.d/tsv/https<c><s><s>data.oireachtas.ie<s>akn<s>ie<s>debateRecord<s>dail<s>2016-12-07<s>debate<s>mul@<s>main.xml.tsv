RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The latest twist in the lamentable saga of Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company involves the company sending a notice to the Genealogical Society of Ireland on 14 November telling it that it was to be evicted from its premises on Carlisle Pier. I will go into that in more detail. It is extraordinary that this rogue company acts as a law unto itself when due diligence was supposed to start in May 2015. We still do not have the results of that due diligence and this harbour company continues to act as a completely unaccountable law unto itself. When is the due diligence coming and when will the decision be made about the governance of Dún Laoghaire Harbour?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This saga of due diligence has gone on at length and the harbour company has not signed off on the draft referred to by the Minister. It seems to want to do everything to slow down and delay this process, and our examination of the workings of a totally dysfunctional entity that needs to be dissolved. I ask the Minister to directly intervene as the main shareholder to stay the plan to evict the Genealogical Society of Ireland, which is a hugely important community and national resource for heritage that in particular serves the elderly community which involves itself in the activities of the society. The society is a model of such societies and is linked in with an international network of genealogical societies, universities and so on. The eviction of the Genealogical Society of Ireland is just another instance of a company that has attempted to sell off parts of the harbour, that is talking about a harebrained plan for a "flotel", that wants to borrow €18 million to build a giant cruise berth that nobody wants and that is now planning to lease the old terminal building for ten years, all of which are contrary to the interests and aspirations of the people of Dún Laoghaire. The company continues to act as a law unto itself. When will this charade end and when will the public get back control of Dún Laoghaire Harbour? I ask the Minister to help the Genealogical Society of Ireland.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Genealogical Society of Ireland has written to me asking me to ask the Minister to intervene as the main shareholder. The situation is outrageous. This is a fantastic society and a huge resource and amenity for the local people that has links to all sorts of organisations nationally and internationally. It would be unconscionable if this harbour company was to evict it and I appeal to the Minister to intervene and make sure that does not happen. I appeal to him more generally because we cannot continue to allow this company to work up harebrained plans that nobody wants and to try to sell off and lease parts of the harbour when what the people want is a national maritime diaspora and sports amenity in the harbour which would be a huge boost to Dún Laoghaire, the Dublin region and the entire country, where groups like the Genealogical Society of Ireland could be housed and where we could have a huge heritage amenity. However, this will only happen if we seize control of the harbour from this dysfunctional quango.
