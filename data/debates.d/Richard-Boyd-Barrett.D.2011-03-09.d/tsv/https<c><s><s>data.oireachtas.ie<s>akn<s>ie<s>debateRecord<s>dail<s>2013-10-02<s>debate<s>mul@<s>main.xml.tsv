RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 10, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:"(a) the requirement that vehicle registration, licence and insurance be held in one name;".One of the major concerns with regard to this legislation is one of which the Minister of State is well aware, namely, the need to ensure that all taxi drivers are properly licensed and insured. The various organisations representing the industry have repeatedly called for action to deal with the problem of rogue drivers. It is generally accepted that there is a massive oversupply of taxis as a result of the completely uncontrolled deregulation of the industry overseen by a previous Government. It has led to an extremely difficult, if not disastrous, situation for taxi drivers. The very least they require is legal support for a regime which ensures that all drivers are properly qualified and licensed. The Minister of State indicated to me before the debate that he accepts the thrust of this amendment and assured me there is now a regulation in place to achieve the same end. The taxi drivers to whom I have spoken, however, have asked me to put it to him that this requirement should be set out clearly in the legislation for the avoidance of any ambiguity. Their strong preference for explicit legislative provision arises from the failure, certainly from their perspective, of regulation in the past. Even where regulations have been in place, the strong view among people in the industry is that they have not been enforced. A specific provision in the Bill, as set out in amendment No. 1, would offer an important assurance to legitimate drivers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister of State for his response. What would give the taxi drivers a greater degree of comfort and assurance is if the Minister of State can spell out how there will be proper enforcement. I take the point that the Minister of State is providing for this in secondary legislation and that the regulation is in place. However, the taxi drivers feel there is a long history of failed regulation and that, even now, the situation is unacceptable. I was talking to a taxi driver yesterday who mentioned the new app that allows people to identify whether a driver is properly registered. He is a representative for one of the taxi groups and on a regular basis he uses the app and finds three or four people who are not properly registered and licensed in the space of an hour or two on any given day. Is there anything the Minister of State can say to give greater assurance to taxi drivers that this is really going to happen?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 3:In page 15, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:“(c) where their other occupation is deemed to be full-time, will not be granted a licence to drive SPSV.”.I move this amendment on behalf of Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan. I note the Minister of State's Bill requires that those requesting a licence must give notice if they have other employment. I have spoken to representatives of taxi drivers and of the industry and they would like the legislation to go further. Their view is that full-time taxi drivers who are barely scraping a living as it is in a very difficult environment are then faced with a flood of people who are cherry-picking the good work at the weekend and at peak times.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is tricky. I accept that the Bill is a significant advance on what was an anarchic scenario, which was unfair to full-time taxi drivers and which the Government inherited. It was more than legal problems that led a previous Government to deregulation. An ideological bent was pursued, particularly by the Progressive Democrats Party, which Fianna Fáil went along with, where it decided it would just let the market rip. It was disastrous for taxi drivers. The lines of taxi drivers, the numbers of taxis, the frustrated drivers sitting on ranks for hours fighting for inadequate rank space unable to make a living and the terrifying spike among drivers all resulted from that ideological pursuit and the economic crash on top of that. I accept this is a genuine effort by the Minister of State to clean up the industry and regulate it in a way that should improve conditions for taxi drivers. However, they have good cause to say that where some full-time drivers can barely make a living and part-time drivers who have other full-time work can come in and cherry-pick the good work, something has to be done about that. It is not fair and the Bill does not go far enough in this regard. However, I am slightly queasy about pressing the amendment to a vote. I am not worried about legal considerations because many proposals are shot down on the basis that there will be legal problems but they can be fought in court. The issue relating to rural Ireland is important. The amendment does not cover it. It should provide that an applicant should not be given a licence if he has a full-time job except in certain specified circumstances where a need is identified. That is probably what it should say. In that circumstance, I cannot press it. However, the Minister of State has to go further on this but I do not know how that can be done.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Taxi drivers need to know that regulation will not only deal with the issues of proper licensing, registration, passenger safety, fly-by-nights and so on but deal specifically with the issue of double jobbing. Something has to be done about that because it is seriously unfair. I hope the Minister of State takes the issue on board and that he will work with industry representatives to come up with a formulation that can deal with double jobbing. Given the legitimate issue he has raised about rural areas, I will leave it at that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 4:In page 16, lines 17 and 18, to delete “(whether or not the licence holder has been convicted of an offence in relation to the contravention)”.The amendments relate to the potential unintended consequence of some aspects of regulation, which taxi drivers generally welcome. They want regulation and all the issues we have already discussed but they do not want full-time taxi drivers to become the unintended victims of the legislation. They are far more knowledgeable about the full details of the Bill than I. I have followed the issue for some years but I do not pretend to know every single detail outlined in the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The argument they have asked me to put is that the system through which one could lose one’s licence or have it suspended for a three-month period following the accumulation of eight demerits is potentially problematic for legitimate full-time taxi drivers. For example, the lack of rank space, of which the Minister of State is well aware, means that sometimes taxis have to queue up at the end of ranks and are not quite in the rank but there is nowhere else to go and that could potentially lead to demerits against them. Other relatively small issues could result in demerits for taxi drivers who are trying to do their job in good faith and drivers could find themselves suspended and have great difficulty in getting their licence back. Taxi drivers also expressed concern about car insurance during the period when their PSV licence is suspended for three months. The amendment seeks to delete a reference to the potential sanction of the suspension of a licence for taxi drivers whether a licence holder has been convicted of an offence relating to the contravention. It seems problematic if they have not been convicted. If they have, it is one thing, but it is a problem in the event of no conviction being made. That seems to suggest punitive action could be taken against taxi drivers for potentially trivial offences that could endanger their ability to make a living and sustain their job. I would welcome a comment from the Minister on that but I am inclined to press the amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that I cannot press amendment No. 5 because there are circumstances where suspension is legitimate, justified and necessary. Taxi drivers share that view. What legitimate full-time taxi drivers are worried about is finding themselves suspended and having difficulty getting back their licence. They submitted some questions to the NTA on the issue but the answer was not clearly spelled out. They asked how a driver would retrieve his or her licence if suspended after reaching eight points under the new system. The response from the NTA was that this could not conclusively be answered until the Taxi Regulation Bill is enacted. However, it replied it is understood that the current intention is that the licence would be automatically suspended for a prescribed period upon reaching the threshold of demerit points and would be automatically restored upon expiry of that prescribed suspension period. It stated, however, that the above position was subject to the conclusion of the Bill. Taxi drivers are worried about the uncertainty, in addition to the low threshold of eight points. What can the Minister of State say to clarify the situation and give some assurance that legitimate taxi drivers will not fall foul of the provision?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are all generally singing from the same hymn sheet on these matters and want to do the right thing. Drivers have told me that even legitimate drivers who are trying to play the game by the rules and want a proper, professional regulated industry believe it could be quite easy to reach eight demerits. The Minister of State made a point on ranks that was reasonable. Drivers have asked questions about what happens during the suspension period. The Minister of State has not reverted to us on that issue. Is the return of a licence automatic? How does one insure one’s car during the period of suspension? One may use one's car for normal driving. Taxi drivers are quite worried and want clarification and an assurance that legitimate drivers will not fall foul of the system. They are not entirely convinced that that is the case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 6:In page 22, line 29, after “disabilities” to insert the following:“by facilitating small public service vehicle licence holders affordable and sustainable opportunities to adapt and maintain their vehicles in order to fully cater to people with disabilities using their services”.I will press the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State is doing well, but there are many assurances that must follow on from it. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. We need to see whether words translate into action. That is what taxi drivers want to know. Let us hope they do translate. I fully accept that the legislation makes substantial progress, but I am questioning whether it will fully cover all bases. This issue is important in itself because we want to promote a public transport system that facilitates people with a disability. We want to do everything to assist in this regard. It is expensive for taxi drivers to adapt their vehicles to make them suitable for use by people with disabilities. This amendment seeks to acknowledge that fact and give assistance to taxi drivers to provide a service that can be used by people with disabilities. An issue raised with me last night makes this amendment even more important.It confirms the need for this amendment and also for action by the Minister. There may even be a requirement for regulations which go beyond this amendment. I raised with the Minister of State prior to the debate on this legislation the fact that it appears that organisations which have charitable status and are providing transport services for people with disabilities and the elderly are going way beyond their remit and essentially acting as companies competing with taxis for normal taxi business. They are undercutting normal taxis by using the benefit of grants and subsidies they receive from the Government to charge lower fares than taxi drivers would charge for the same service. That is a serious abuse and puts taxi drivers at a serious disadvantage.  There is one particular firm whose name I should probably not mention in the House but ---
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will give the Minister the details later but this particular firm is operating in north Dublin. I have some documents in front of me and I will cover up the logo before showing them to Members of the House. Essentially, these documents are price lists which directly compare the cost of their service per kilometre to the cost of a taxi. Taxi drivers have phoned this supposed charity for the disabled and asked for a taxi to bring a relative to a particular destination. They have been told there is no problem, that the car will arrive within five minutes. The firm is charging two thirds of what a normal taxi would charge for the same journey. That firm is getting Government money to do that, which is an unacceptable abuse that must be dealt with urgently. Taxi drivers are saying that if firms such as the one I mentioned are getting a subvention to provide services for the disabled and elderly, legitimately, then taxi drivers should also be given a subvention. One suggestion is that VRT might be refunded for cars that are specially adapted by taxi drivers so that they get some financial assistance for adapting their cars. In that way, the playing field would be more level. Beyond that, I would ask the Minister of State to urgently address the situation whereby supposedly charitable organisations are essentially undercutting those in the taxi industry. That is really not on and I hope the Minister of State will act urgently. I will be pressing the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State is doing well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome his commitments to take action in this area. However, given what he has just said, I cannot see any difficulty with his accepting this amendment. The provision rightly states “to promote access to and the availability and affordability of small public service vehicles by persons with disabilities”. Amendment No. 6 proposes to insert an explicit reference to the need to support and facilitate drivers to provide such a service. This support could include changing specifications but would have to involve some incentive, grant, or, as has been suggested, exemption from vehicle registration tax, VRT. I cannot see why the Minister will not accept my amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not see the problem the Minister has with accepting this amendment. It is not too prescriptive.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, I accept that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that, but this amendment has a legitimate point about supporting drivers who want to provide an accessible service. This is a reasonable amendment that does not run counter to what the Minister has said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I sympathise with the thrust of the amendment. As I indicated, the reason I did not press the issue of full-time taxi drivers is there is a legitimate point on rural areas where the scenario is different and the Minister of State accepts this point. In this context, I wish to raise another issue which points a little in the other direction. It does not counter what Deputy Denis Naughten stated, with which I agree and support, but there are suggestions, reports and anecdotal evidence that some transport services which benefit from the rural transport scheme use these supports to make incursions into urban areas. I do not know whether this is true. I have not seen the hard evidence, but I have heard reports that people operating services and competing with taxis in urban areas benefit from grants under the rural transport scheme. Will the Minister of State examine this issue and see whether there is evidence that this might be the case, which would obviously be an abuse of the supports and unfair to taxi drivers in urban areas? Setting this point aside, I believe Deputy Denis Naughten's amendment is reasonable with regard to other matters with which the Bill is trying to deal.
