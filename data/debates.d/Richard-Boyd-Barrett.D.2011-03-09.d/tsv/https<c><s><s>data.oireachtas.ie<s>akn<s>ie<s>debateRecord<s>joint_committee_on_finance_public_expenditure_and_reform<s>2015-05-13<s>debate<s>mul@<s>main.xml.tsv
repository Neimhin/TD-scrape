RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Comrade.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Mr. Masding and his team for the information and for participating in the meeting. I will pursue the same theme of mortgage arrears as I am dealing with people in that situation. Will the delegation remind me, because one gets dizzy from the number of banks that have come in here to outline different policies-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know what bank it is. I know who you are, Comrade Masding.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Permanent TSB does not do write-downs of the residual after people have given back their home. Is that right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am dealing with a case which involves a customer of the bank. The young couple are both working but earn low incomes. They have been hit by all the stuff that everyone has been hit by so they had to sell their house. They are renting, are on a council housing list, their second child is on the way, rents are increasing rapidly and they are struggling. They had to give back their house to the bank but it is still chasing them for the residual. They have had to give up their home and deserve the right to be able to get back on their feet. Even if the bank writes off the money they owe, the couple will continue to struggle. With the bank chasing them for the money, they are really struggling and are very worried and anxious. Can the bank not draw a line at that point and say, "These people are on a housing list, they have a low income, they are struggling and they have lost their home so we will leave it at that"? Why would the bank not just do so?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I presume there are quite a few such cases.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not mean to rush Mr. O'Sullivan. I understand he is trying to answer my question but I have a limited time to ask questions.Let us look at the scenario in which a family has filled out all of the financial statements and given up their home, which is a pretty big sacrifice. The bank knows that their income is very low and that they do not have anything to spare; they are in the private rental market now, with rents going through the roof, and they are on the council waiting list for housing. I do not see how the banks can justify chasing such people for the residual debt. If the bank thought that they were trying to pull a fast one and had evidence to that effect, that is a different matter, but I do not see the moral hazard involved in such cases. Surely they have paid their due in terms of-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have heard that answer and I will follow up on the individual case. I would hope that such a reasonable approach is being pursued.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to shift tack slightly now. The term "moral hazard" was deployed by both the Government and the banks when the mortgage crisis was at fever pitch a few years ago. At that time, some of us were saying that there should be an across the board write-down to market values and so on, but moral hazard was the argument deployed to counter that. Is the same principle applied when it comes to corporate loans and write-downs on big debts in the corporate sector? I ask the witnesses to tell us a little about that area because they will be fully aware that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough. I should have known that. Mr. Masding cannot really comment on that issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is fine. We will be dealing with that matter later. I wish to turn now to the cost of funding. The witnesses said that most of the funding for Permanent TSB comes from deposits, if I understood correctly. They said that 60% of its funding is from deposits and they cited that as one of the reasons for their difficulty in reducing the variable interest rate. Obviously, the witnesses cannot talk about individuals, but can they tell me how many deposit customers the bank has and what portion of those customers have big deposits of, say, more than €100,000, up to €1,000,000? I am curious about that, and it follows on from what Deputy Creed was saying-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the average interest rate for deposits?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The bank's average interest rate on variable mortgages is 4.36%. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The rate for a variable interest rate mortgage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is quite a big gap there in the context of the cost of mortgage interest-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is fair enough. I do not have time to drill into that further, but it still seems to me to be a significant gap. One could be forgiven for thinking there is a profiteering element to it, but we will look into that further at some future date. I wish to go back to the issue of arrears, if I may. Quite a high proportion of arrears solutions in banks have been in the area of arrears capitalisation. I have heard a few complaints from people who said they were being put under huge pressure to opt for arrears capitalisation when it did not really make any sense for them to do so. While the individuals would no longer be in arrears, the repayments would be even higher. Given that they had difficulty repaying lower amounts, the prospect of their being able to pay a larger amount on capitalised arrears seems crazy, but they are being put under pressure by financial institutions. I am not referring specifically to Permanent TSB here. Does Mr. Masding have any comment to make on that issue?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is no problem.
