RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank both contributors, who have described very accurately what we are facing and the folly of the line the Eurogroup has taken in dealing with the Greek crisis. Although Mr. McCarthy said we were different from the politicians, he suggested that for political reasons we must be careful about the use of strong language on either side and that loose language had been used. I suggest it is time for blunt language. Mr. Varoufakis said that when he made economic arguments, of the sort Mr. McCarthy has just put, in a measured way to the Eurogroup, he might as well have been singing the Swedish national anthem, and just got blank stares. They were not interested in the measured, objective economic arguments such as Mr. McCarthy has just reproduced, almost word for word, from the interview with Mr. Varoufakis published in the New Statesman. Almost any economist, left or right, looking at this is saying the same, that the judgments and policies made by the Eurogroup, headed by Mr. Sch√§uble, had nothing to do with sound economic management and was purely about politics. If it is not about sound economic judgment, we must ask what is it and what is motivating it. I would be interested in hearing Mr. McCarthy's opinion. We must be honest. If it is not about sound economic judgment, which it clearly is not, and it is about shoving something unsustainable from every point of view down the throats of the Greeks, we must speculate about the real motive. It is not about hyperbole. We must be honest. Greece was subjected to economic terrorism and political bullying for purely political reasons and our Government went along with it for purely political reasons. Mr. Varoufakis said the Irish, Spanish and Portuguese Governments were, to his surprise and disappointment, among the most energetic enemies of the Greeks during the negotiations because they were afraid of the political embarrassment that would result if they sided with the Greek Government in saying there had to be debt write-down and a lifting of the austerity. Was he not right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. McCarthy might add that no one will ever admit one was right even when they adopt one's position.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My criticism of Mr. Varoufakis and Mr. Tsipras is they have capitulated to the blackmail of the European Union.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would have prepared plan B for an exit because one could not go into a negotiation with these guys unless one had plan B. This plan B had to involve being willing to go out of the eurozone if they were not willing to be reasonable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Time is short. I accept Mr. McCarthy's point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept the point that it is difficult.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the interview with New Statesman Mr. Varoufakis stated he told Mr. Tsipras he advocated stating if they did not give Greece a reasonable deal they would impose a haircut on the ECB, take over the Greek Central Bank and issue their own currency. He had a plan B.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I very much accept what Mr. McCarthy states as it absolutely accords with my view. It is not only Mr. McCarthy, Mr. Varoufakis and the left, as Mr. Krugman and anybody looking at this, including the IMF, who state the thing is unsustainable and we will be back in crisis mode in a few months time. The crisis could escalate again this week. A few minutes ago I received a text stating many of the ministers in the Syriza Government have resigned and there is a general strike on the streets against the deal. We do not know what will happen. Mr. McCarthy has stated what the Greeks are being asked to accept is unsustainable and will not resolve the crisis, and we will be back here again. Therefore, do we not have an obligation at this stage to look at plan B? Otherwise, we are simply looking at a dire situation waiting to see what will happen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what is happening now.
