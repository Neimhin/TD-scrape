RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome Ms Feehily to the show trial. I will start with a simple question. Does Ms Feehily think she is being politically scapegoated for a tax that this Government decided to impose, but for which she is now taking the heat?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask Ms Feehily to clarify that. She has said that the shambles regarding the payment of the tax has arisen because the tax must be paid on or before 1 January. She has suggested that this has forced Revenue to do many of the things it has done, which have caused concern and anxiety. Whose decision was it that the tax should be payable on or before 1 January?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was a Government decision.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be clear, the decision that it should be paid on 1 January - which required Revenue to write to people in October of this year and to have deadlines in November and so on - was a decision of the Government, was it not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is in the legislation. Therefore, it appears the Office of the Revenue Commissioners has become the political scapegoat for the shambles that has arisen, when it was in fact a Government decision.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To me it is not a question of the whens, whos, whys, wherefores and so on. This just adds insult to injury. Many people will have to leave other bills unpaid in order to pay this tax and that is the issue for them. Now, adding insult to injury, they are in a position where they do not know how to pay it and are fearful they will have to pay it before they expected to have to pay it. Does Ms Feehily accept this is a cause of huge anxiety for them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are they saying they really want to pay the property tax?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When Government first gave the Revenue Commissioners the brief to collect the tax, was there significant discussion over the fact there had been a boycott of the household tax and whether Revenue's job was to find ways and means to ensure a greater level of compliance with the household tax? Is that the brief Revenue was given by the Government?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sure. I wish to mention three cases where Revenue has serious responsibility, although I believe the primary responsibility lies with the Government. A woman who came to my clinic had â‚¬61.75 taken from her wages in September and again in October. This was done without notification. She does not own a property. She spent three weeks trying to get through to Revenue, but has failed to get through. Another man in my constituency was charged half a year's tax for one house, but this year he was charged for a full year for two houses. He only owns one house. Third, a 27 year old, unemployed person on a community employment scheme who is not a property owner and who is currently homeless and sleeping on someone's couch, has had four weeks' property tax deducted from her unemployment benefit for a house in which she rented a bedroom when she was in college six years ago. These are awful errors on the part of the Revenue Commissioners. Can Ms Feehily explain these errors?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These are people who came to my clinic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, they came into my clinic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People spend weeks trying to get through to the Revenue Commissioners.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the first case, it was the dead husband of the woman who did not respond to the communication, because he had passed away. However, the payment was then deducted from her wages, despite the fact she does not own the house.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to correct the record of my third example. I went out to make a telephone call to confirm it. The third example is true. The person was unemployed, but is on a community employment scheme, so the money was deducted from the CE payment, but the person does not own a property.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a question that I am passing on directly from the Citizens' Information Board and several other groups. I was at a briefing given by the Citizens' Information Board, the National Adult Literacy Agency, which is the body that deals with literacy issues, and several other organisations. The request that came across from everyone - it was a direct question in the context of the local property tax - was for the use of plain English. Will the chairperson comment on that? These bodies said that the local property tax forms and the process were a perfect example of the problems caused by a lack of plain English and the fact that the request to pay tax was not framed in a comprehensible way.
