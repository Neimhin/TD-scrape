RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I met somebody from the Termination for Medical Reasons group yesterday. She asked me what the group can do to influence the Government to end the absolutely unacceptable and tragic situation that is being inflicted on many women in this country. I refer to cases in which a woman who is happy to be pregnant and hopes to give birth to a child discovers the terrible fact that the foetus is suffering from a fatal abnormality - a condition that is incompatible with life - and has no chance of survival. A woman in such circumstances is currently forced to continue with the pregnancy even though the child has no chance of survival, or go to Britain without support for an abortion and possibly have to leave her dead child there. I know of an appalling case in which a woman in these awful, tragic and unbelievable circumstances had to bring the child back in the boot of a car. Is the Taoiseach seriously telling this woman, who told me last night she has met several people in the past few months - since the legislation was passed - who have gone through the same terrible circumstances she has gone through, that he intends to do nothing at all to end these tragedies? If that is what he is saying, it is absolutely beyond belief and I appeal to him to reconsider. If he does not intend to reconsider his position, perhaps he can advise me of what we should say to these women. Did the Taoiseach discuss the issue of poverty, which church leaders have been raising, when he met them recently? In November of this year, the Archbishop of Dublin issued an appeal for basic foodstuffs because thousands of people are overwhelming the Crosscare food bank as they look for food. It was the first time since Archbishop Martin took up his position that he issued such an appeal on behalf of the food bank, which does not have enough food to meet the needs of hungry people from all sorts of sectors of society. In his speech in the Pro-Cathedral, the archbishop described how children are going to school hungry and are unable to learn as a result. He spoke about how university students are in dire straits. He said that these problems stem from the increases in unemployment and poverty that have resulted from the cuts associated with the policy of austerity. Did the archbishop raise these issues with the Taoiseach? Is he not ashamed, as the Taoiseach of this country, that church leaders are begging for food on behalf of the hungry people in our society? As we approach Christmas, this country will probably have more hungry people, more homeless people and more desperate people than at any time since the 1920s or 1930s. Is that not a matter of shame for the Government that it is presiding over this country at such a time? Should it not do something about it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These are medical conditions. There is no ambiguity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not likely - it is definite.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In cases of genetic abnormalities-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I am not wrong in what I am saying about fatal foetal abnormalities.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach does not know what he is talking about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is extraordinary.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach would want to check his facts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So would I.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In what is a very difficult and sensitive matter the Taoiseach needs to be informed of what he is talking about. There is no debate, dispute or controversy about Edwards syndrome, Patau syndrome or fatal foetal abnormalities. The view of doctors is conclusive, definitive and uncontested, that these conditions are incompatible with life. I know this among other things because I had a daughter who was born with one of these conditions. It is a very difficult thing to get one's head around, that a child who is born or is yet to be born has a condition that is incompatible with life, that the child has no chance of life and cannot live. There is no dispute. It is not similar to other conditions in which a child might or might not live. The child cannot live and the mother is informed that the child cannot live. Must she be forced to go through with a pregnancy when the child cannot live? If she decides she cannot do that, must she be forced to go to Britain to have an abortion, or will she be looked after, nurtured and protected here, in these most appalling circumstances where a wanted pregnancy cannot conclude with a life? The people who have been victims of this terrible situation are asking the Taoiseach, if necessary, to amend the Constitution to allow for terminations in these circumstances. I cannot believe the Taoiseach is seriously telling these women, and the many who will face the same situation every week because genetic abnormalities like this occur approximately in one in 10,000 pregnancies, that there is nothing he can do. Will the Taoiseach tell women who are in this appalling situation in years to come that there is nothing he can do? Will he tell them they are forced to go through this tragedy and that the State will do nothing for them? I cannot believe the Taoiseach is seriously saying that. If necessary he must amend the Constitution, although there is some legal opinion to the effect that it could be done within the current constitutional framework because we are not talking about the termination of a life that is viable. The Taoiseach should meet these women. If he does not understand the condition, he should meet the women and their doctors who know about it but he should offer them some hope.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no uncertainty.
