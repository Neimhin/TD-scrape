RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As other speakers noted, Mr. Fraser cannot discuss some of the issues that must be addressed. For this reason, we need to have before us Ministers and representatives of the large corporate players which are at the centre of the growing controversy around Ireland's purported status as a tax haven. Many of us believe this country is a tax haven and this view is widely held outside the country. I ask Mr. Fraser to respond to my questions in so far as he is able to do so, given the constraints within which he operates. Has the Clearing House Group discussed the allegations being made about Ireland being a tax haven or honey pot for corporate tax dodgers and speculators who view this country as the ideal place to avoid paying tax, make a fortune and make little or no contribution to the tax revenues of the State? Is it discussing the country's corporation tax regime, given that this issue is being widely discussed elsewhere in Europe and the United States? The only reference to this issue that I see in the minutes is a number of reiterations on the part of the Government that it will not, under any circumstances, consider reviewing the country's 12.5% corporation tax rate. Is that the extent of discussion of this matter? Hedge fund managers, bankers, corporate consultants and large accountancy firms are represented in the Clearing House Group.Are they commenting on and making proposals and recommendations on corporate tax policy and policy on the financial transaction tax and other tax issues relating to or that would impact on their sector? To what extent are these things being discussed either at the main group meeting or at the subgroup meetings? Ordinary people looking at it could easily draw the conclusion – I certainly draw the conclusion – that the reason corporate tax and the financial transaction tax is a red line issue for this Government, when almost nothing else is, is because of the incredibly unprecedented unique relationship that these bankers, hedge fund managers and corporate interests have with the highest political office in the land. That is the perception. Can Mr. Fraser tell us whether these issues are being discussed at length at the Clearing House Group meetings or the subgroup meetings?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is Mr. Fraser saying that the only discussion relating to these matters involves some representative of the Department of the Taoiseach saying we are not for moving on the 12.5% rate or we are not for introducing the financial transaction tax? Is he saying that is all that is said, that there is no further discussion about corporate tax and there are no opinions given by the representatives of the private sector about these matters in the run-up to the drawing up of budgets, for example?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It defies credibility that these hedge fund managers, bankers and financiers attend these meetings, that they have subgroups dealing with the areas of banking, tax and so on, and that they have nothing whatsoever to say about these matters in the run-up to budgets. Is that what Mr. Fraser is saying to us?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the aftermath of the financial crash that hit this country and the global economy, is there any discussion about the morality of some of the activities that go on at the International Financial Services Centre?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking whether they discuss the morality of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am saying there are many people who question the morality of some of the activities that go on in places like the Irish Financial Services Centre, including shadow banking, derivatives, futures and, essentially, financial speculation, given the role that they had in destabilising the global economy and indeed the role they continue to play in maintaining a high level of instability in the global economy. Is there any discussion about the need to regulate more tightly a sector which has done considerable damage to the international economy; which could potentially do further damage; and which could specifically make the Irish economy vulnerable to further shocks to the international financial system? If the Government strategy is to grow this sector, as Mr. Fraser maintains, is there any concern that putting so many eggs in the basket of expanding financial services could actually make the Irish economy rather vulnerable to further international financial shocks, or, for that matter, changes in corporate tax policy in places such as the United States?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Mr. Fraser not believe it would be appropriate to have people in the Clearing House Group who might have an eye to the dangers involved in this sector?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am beginning to wonder what the private sector representatives say at these meetings. The minutes seem to suggest they say virtually nothing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I refer to a point that was made earlier. It would appear from what Mr. Fraser has said that all the real discussions are being moved off to the side to these subgroups. Mr. Fraser does not seem to know as much about them and he is unsure whether there are written reports. He said he believes there are written reports but he is unsure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one final question. Mr. Fraser has accepted that the Clearing House Group represents high-level access for the financial services sector or the corporate sector to the Government. The statement of strategy for the Department declares that some of the Department's priorities and the Government's stated priorities are fairness, transparency and so on. Has there been any discussion within the Department about the fairness of giving this high level of access to the Department of the Taoiseach to the financial services industry but not a similar high level of access to, for example, the representatives of the disabled, the unemployed, low and middle-income workers or distressed mortgage holders?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there no discussion around the need for such access?
