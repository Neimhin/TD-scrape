RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister said he discussed the macroeconomic outlook with the troika.  The discussions are continuing until Thursday.  Is there any recognition on the part of the troika, given the deteriorating economic situation in Europe, the fact that this is the third quarter in a row with economic contraction across Europe and there has been a return of the debt crisis, that its austerity agenda is not working, either here or in Europe, and that alternative strategies need to be considered?  It was reported prior to the meeting that they would discuss in detail so-called labour activation measures.  In his discussions with the troika either at this meeting or at previous meetings, was the decision to cut the lone parent payment once a child reached the age of seven years considered a labour activation measure?  Lone parents maintain that the plan to cut off payments after the child has reached the age of seven years will, in fact, drive lone parents out of the workplace and into full dependency on social welfare.  Was this matter discussed with the troika?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can only comment that as the austerity agenda is rolled out across the rest of Europe, it is becoming increasingly clear that the damage done to the peripheral countries is now spreading to the core and is completely depressing the European economy in all parts.  It is disappointing if there is not some discussion about the implications.I specifically asked the Minister whether cuts directed at lone parents were discussed as so-called labour activation measures.  I refer to the cut in the lone parent allowance once a child has reached seven years.  Was this proposal conceived as a so-called labour activation measure?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The last round.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a dozen such cases on my desk.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As was mentioned earlier, today outside the Dáil the parents of special needs children who have had domiciliary care allowances cut were protesting as were lone parents who are threatened with a cut in the one parent family payment when their children reach the age of seven and who believe it will drive them out of work.  More generally, these protests are part of a growing revolt throughout Europe against the failed policies of austerity and cuts.  In recent weeks we have seen massive demonstrations and strikes against austerity in Spain, Italy and Portugal.  Now in France, Austria and the Netherlands governments are being rejected by the people because of their attempts to impose the failed and disastrous policy of austerity.The latest EUROSTAT purchasing managers index figures show bond yields increasing in Spain and Italy with stock markets panicking.  All of this indicates the agenda of austerity is not working and is strangling the European economy with debt.  Against this background why, for heaven's sake, is the Government promoting a treaty that will demand, in order to meet its targets, even more cuts and austerity being imposed on the people of the country?  If the Dutch economy, which is one of the strongest economies in Europe, is unwilling and unable to impose EU austerity targets and cuts, how on earth can our traumatised and damaged economy sustain the level of cuts and austerity that would be required to meet the targets of the fiscal treaty?Will the Taoiseach inform the House and the public how much precisely in terms of cuts will be required to meet the targets of the fiscal treaty if we exit the troika programme in 2015?  Estimates suggest it will require €6 billion at least to meet the deficit targets and in the region of €4.5 billion annually for a decade or more to reach the debt to GDP ratio targets.  This level of cuts will destroy our economy and society.  If the Taoiseach disagrees with this, will he tell us how much in cuts will be necessary to meet the targets if we endorse the treaty?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am traumatised by them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach is living in a different planet from the rest of us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is the Taoiseach speaking about confidence?  People are traumatised, blighted with mass unemployment and are being forced out of the country-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	----- and brutal cuts are being imposed on vulnerable sectors of our society.  The whole of Europe is rising up against this crazy austerity agenda.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the point.  Is there no recognition on the Taoiseach's part, as there is across Europe, that the austerity agenda is not working?  It is crippling growth.  The latest EUROSTAT figures indicate that the debt crisis has returned with a vengeance.  I specifically asked the Taoiseach if he could clarify for the House and the public what cuts will be necessary from 2015 onwards when we have exited the troika programme in order to meet the targets and requirements of the fiscal treaty, which requires us to cut our debt in half which, in turn, will require €4.5 billion in cuts annually for approximately 20 years and approximately €5 billion to €6 billion in cuts to meet the deficit targets after 2015.  If those figures are not correct, can the Taoiseach give us the correct ones?  Surely, the Taoiseach is not going to tell us that more brutal cuts and austerity will not be needed from 2015 onwards, which agenda is destroying the European economy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Was the Taoiseach there?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is rubbish.  It is not true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Answer the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Give us the figures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No figures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When it suits the Taoiseach, for rhetorical or political purposes, he talks about his commitment to democracy and his abhorrence of violence.  However, when money and business are at stake, his concern for them goes out the window.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach said but one sentence on human rights in China.  What did he discuss with the Chinese dictatorship?  Did he raise, for example, the fact that 500,000 Chinese people are in detention without trial?  Did he raise the fact that the Falun Gong, Christians, Tibetans, Uighurs and anybody dissenting politically against the Chinese regime, including poets and writers who criticise it, are ruthlessly dealt with and imprisoned?  China has one of the highest rates of execution and abuse of the death penalty.  Its trials are a joke for people who oppose the regime.  There is a brutal dictatorship in place.  Do morality, the commitment to democracy and concern for human rights go out the window when it comes to business, commerce and profit?  In the Taoiseach's entire speech, he devoted but one sentence to human rights.  What did he discuss?  Where is the morality in developing close relationships with the Chinese regime when it is a brutal dictatorship?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should withdraw the suggestion that I was involved in anything that could be described as violent activity in Galway.  That is not true, as was confirmed by David McCullagh from RTE, who was present on the occasion.  It is very dishonest -----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In regard to deploying this sort of dishonest tactic, did the Taoiseach discuss with the Chinese dictatorship tactics for dealing with protestors?  Does he know that recently the poet-activist, Zhu Yifu, was jailed for seven years for the terrible crime of inciting subversion of state power?  He faces seven years of incarceration because he wrote the following poem:It's time, people of China!  It's time.The Square belongs to everyone.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The poem continues:With your own two feetIt's time to head to the Square and make your choice.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking a question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did the Taoiseach discuss with the Chinese dictatorship the fact that it is imprisoning poets simply for suggesting that the Chinese might come out on Tiananmen Square to demand their rights to freedom and democracy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am the only person the Ceann Comhairle cut across.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was a question.  Did the Taoiseach discuss with the Chinese dictators the fact that they are putting poets in prison for calling for peaceful protests and demanding democracy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I always behave myself.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Since the original draft of the Bill issued, the Bill has been very substantially amended and rewritten and what we are now looking at is a different Bill.  It is not the same Bill as was debated in the Dáil last week.We are getting less than an hour - 7.54 p.m. to 8.45 p.m. - to discuss what is effectively a new Bill with considerable changes, such as the spreading out of social welfare benefits to part-time workers over five days rather than six, which will substantially affect people's incomes, as well as a series of other major changes.  It is not acceptable that what is effectively a new Bill should be discussed for less than an hour and that the Technical Group will not have a chance to speak on it at all.  We will not be able to make any comment on what is effectively a new Bill.  We want to protest in the strongest possible terms.  This is not acceptable, and more time must be allowed on Second Stage to discuss the Bill along with the raft of amendments that change it substantially.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a different Bill now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps our Whip can also speak-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With respect, this is an issue to do with-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there no way I can have a substitute?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I said earlier and as others have said, this is effectively a new Bill.  The idea that we are talking about a new Bill dealing with important matters for citizens of this country and for some of the most vulnerable sectors of society, which have been hit hard with austerity and cuts-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They include lone parents, part-time workers and others dependent on social welfare.  It is wrong that what is effectively a new Bill should receive less than one hour of discussion.  It raises the question of what the Government and the Minister were doing when an extension of what the Bill is dealing with comes in at the last minute.  It flies in the face of any commitment to serious accountability and democratic discussion on such an important Bill.What is unacceptable in that regard is that all of the groups will not even get the 15 minutes referred to because one section of this House, effectively one third of the Opposition parties, will not have the opportunity to speak at all on Second Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appeal to the Taoiseach to be fair, democratic and reasonable.  It is not right that one third of the Opposition is disenfranchised from discussing this changed Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I too reject this motion and the Bill.  I wish to correct the record of the House.  The Taoiseach said earlier today that the House would have ten hours of debate on Second Stage of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill but that is not correct because we had four hours' debate and at the last moment we are presented with a whole raft of amendments which substantially change the Bill and make it, effectively, a different Bill and a guillotine is imposed.  This makes a mockery of all the talk by this Government when it came into office of a new type of politics, new transparency and real political change.  While I was not a Member of this House at the time, I have been informed by Members who were here in the previous Dáil that the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, when in Opposition, would have been one of the first to complain about the imposition of a guillotine on important legislation.  It is ironic that 14 months on, she is now imposing such a guillotine when Deputies have not had proper time to scrutinise this raft of new amendments.  It defies any credibility to suggest that she has not had sufficient time between the December budget and now, to bring forward these amendments earlier or to include them in the main body of the Bill.The one amendment that everyone wanted to see in this Bill is the one amendment the Minister has not brought forward.  The one amendment we would have welcomed, even if late in the day, is the one she has refused to include, to delete section 4, and for her to give up on this disgraceful attempt to cut lone parent payments when children reach the age of seven years.  It is not just that seven is too young, as the Minister acknowledged last week, eight is too young, nine is too young, ten is too young, 11 is too young and 12 is too young.  There is room for discussion after that age but in many cases 13 and 14 is also too young an age at which to leave children on their own when their parents need to go out to work.  It is laughable.For a moment when I heard the Minister announce we were to have a Scandinavian model of child care, I thought all of our birthdays had come at once.  However, when I gave it more thought and I talked to a Swedish friend of mine who told me about Scandinavian health care, I suddenly realised that this statement had little meaning and was no more than a smokescreen to try to soften the blow of this disgraceful cut to lone parents' payments.  In Scandinavia, there is free child care, almost from birth, from the age of one right up to the age of 14.  It is state-of-the-art child care which is available to everyone.  The notion that the Minister will introduce such a model by December - much as I would like this to be achieved by December - is laughable against the background of brutal cuts being demanded under the EU-IMF programme and everything being cut.  I hope the Minister will prove me wrong but it defies credibility.  The only proposal before us, despite the words spoken last week, is the cut which will take immediate effect when the Bill is passed with the possibility that people may be obliged to leave their jobs.  The critical point is that a Government which states it wants labour activation measures is introducing a measure which will drive lone parents out of work and force them into greater dependency on social welfare.  Even at this late stage, I ask the Minister to withdraw the Bill, to accept our amendments to delete section 4.  Let us deliver the Scandinavian model of child care first before the Minister touches lone parents' payments.The jobseeker's benefit amendment is another attack on the low paid and which will disproportionately hit lone parents and women workers again.  It will mean a €20 to €30 a week cut in the earnings of part-time workers, the majority of whom are women and a very significant number of whom are lone parents.  What is the justification for this as it will be a disincentive for people to take up part-time work and may likely force more people out of employment and into dependency on social welfare?  It is another disgraceful move and that amendment should be removed also.
