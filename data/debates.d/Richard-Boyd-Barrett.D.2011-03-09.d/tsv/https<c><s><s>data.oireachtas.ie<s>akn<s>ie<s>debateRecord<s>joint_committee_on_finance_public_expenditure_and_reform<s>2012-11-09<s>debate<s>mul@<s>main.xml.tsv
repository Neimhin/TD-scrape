RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise for being late as I had to speak in the House.  I understand somebody asked about the property tax.  I understand the representatives are in favour of some type of property tax but want an income-related aspect to it.  I am strongly opposed to a property tax because it will hit the low and middle income people who are struggling.  How do the representatives envisage a fair system working?  Obviously much debate is taking place on the issue.  The most concrete suggestion from the Minister is that we could be looking at 0.25% of market value which in my constituency, where the average house value would be €200,000, is €500 per year.  If that came through, what would the representatives think of it?  Clearly, that would be an unbearable burden for large numbers of people and I do not see how anybody who is concerned about protecting people from poverty could justify that.  I am interested to hear the response on that issue.  I agree with the emphasis on shifting away from expenditure cuts to taxes.  What would be regarded as progressive taxes?  For example, do the witnesses think we should start to look at the issue of corporation tax?  I certainly do.  It is a sacred cow that cannot remain sacred any longer given the deep crisis and the huge burden that has been imposed on people at the low and middle end and their incapacity to take any more hits.  Will the people who are concerned about poverty, inequality and so forth begin to demand a debate on the issue of corporate taxes, financial transaction taxes, wealth taxes and so on?  Professor Sean Tierney mentioned an issue we need to debate, that is, the proposal for universal health insurance but one that would be provided through private health insurers in some shape or form.  I suspect I do not know half as much about it as the witnesses but I understand that in America, where the emphasis is on that, administration costs account for 40% of health expenditure.  That would appear to be a crazy way to go.  What alternative would the witnesses propose if they have concerns, as I have, in that area?  I certainly believe we should have a national health system and cut out the private insurers, the billing and the profit taking.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. McCafferty made an interesting point on the debt issue and I ask him to elaborate.  Suggesting that we should not prioritise debt interest payments over these things could lead one in a certain direction if that became the choice.  I would argue that probably is the choice when one considers the €9 billion of debt interest we need to pay next year.  How far would Mr. McCafferty take that logic?  For our part we would recommend repudiating if necessary.  Would Mr. McCafferty go that far?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is very politic of Mr. McCafferty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the groups for coming in and for all their work.  I could not agree more with the comments.  As far as I am concerned, there are two big issues in this country which are directly related - the banking crisis and the consequences of it.  They are two sides of the same coin.  Profiteering in the housing sector caused the crash and left us in this mess and we are in an incredible position of having hundreds of thousands of empty houses and a simultaneous unprecedented housing crisis.  It is beyond comprehension.  As the witnesses note, we are dependent on the private sector, which operates for profit and not to provide housing for those who need it.  If landlords cannot get the rents they want, they will not house people.  I am at the end of my wits with this issue as no issue is more common in the clinic than people in trouble with housing.  I am pulling my hair out about it.  Will the witnesses elaborate on the June policy shift referred to, as it seems to be the most retrograde move possible, with the exception of the positive facet of transferring rent supplement to local authorities?  I agree that the transfer makes sense and should mean that people will move to differential rent, allowing them to work, etc.  That is a positive development but from every other angle, moving away from the direct provision of social housing by the local authorities makes no sense.  I should stress that this is not a criticism of the voluntary housing associations, and it seems they do not have the capacity to fill the gap.  There is a role for voluntary housing associations but the gap must be filled by the State through local authorities and the direct provision of social housing.  Such action would go towards solving the housing crisis and ultimately produce a significant saving for the Exchequer by diminishing the amount going towards rent allowance.  Mr. Allen mentioned that some people may hold their nose ideologically on the rent issue.  I do not know if that was directed at me but I agree with his comments.  Not only should we leave the thresholds as they are but we should raise them, particularly in areas where they do not add up.  The idea that accommodation like a flat can be found in Dún Laoghaire or south Dublin for a single person for €425 is a joke that is driving people to homelessness.  We must raise those thresholds, although everybody agrees that would be unsustainable financially over the longer term, so we must be able to move away from that process-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is the NAMA issue.  I agree with Mr. Allen that we need new buildings as NAMA cannot fill the gap.  What is the opinion of the witnesses on the NAMA issue?  In my area, there is a sign indicating a "spirit of wonderful living" on the Stillorgan road.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The accommodation is empty.  There must be 500 apartments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are many single people or small families who could move into those apartments.  They should be taken over by the local authority or bought cheaply.  Will the witnesses comment on the NAMA issue?  Will the witnesses comment on the people who cannot even get rent allowance or who, as a result of a reduction in the caps, are being driven into homelessness?  What does it mean when a person is in the homelessness cycle, which seems to be dire?  In my area, people forced into being homeless because of cuts to rent caps have been told to go to Drumcondra to stay in a tacky hotel.  "Tacky" may be a nice word for some of the accommodation.  Will the witnesses comment on homelessness and emergency accommodation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did Mr. Allen say every day or every week?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That amounts to 1,200 extra per year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be very brief, partly because I must leave but also because I agree with everything the witnesses have said.  There is not a great deal to add.  On the tax issue, I probably read the report last year but we have discussed tax so much since then that perhaps Mr. Ginnell will remind me of his specific proposals to improve the tax situation.  Does he think we should begin to question the use of the term "broaden the tax base"?  I prefer the term "higher tax take" to "broaden the tax base".  There appears to be an interpretation of broadening the tax base whereby there are more taxes on the people at the bottom.  It becomes a justification for regressive taxation at the bottom rather than a tax system which would not quite narrow the base but the taxes would be loaded in a far more concentrated way on those who can afford them.  Should we dispense with that term and could the witness be more specific on the taxation area?  On the self-employed, this is an issue all of us should think about more.  It is something that arises in my clinics quite often but it has not been highlighted to the necessary extent.  How many people who were self-employed are now in trouble and what must be done for them?  Perhaps the witness could offer more detail of her suggestions in that area.  Finally, what are the witnesses' proposals regarding property tax and corporate tax?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The question about broadening the tax base.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are also being discouraged.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Self-employment by definition can often, particularly in current circumstances, mean a person is in and out of work.  Is the organisation experiencing difficulties in terms of self-employed people having to sign off when in work and sign off again when out of work?
