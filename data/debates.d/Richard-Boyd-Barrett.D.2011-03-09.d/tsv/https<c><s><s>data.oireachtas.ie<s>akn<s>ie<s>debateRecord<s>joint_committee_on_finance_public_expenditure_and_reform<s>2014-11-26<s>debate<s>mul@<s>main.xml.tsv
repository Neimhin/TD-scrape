RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The failure to manage the housing market and the property sector generally led us to the worst economic crisis in the history of the State.  I have been alarmed for some time about what is happening in the same area.  When Professor Honohan says his role is not to engage in social engineering, is it to keep an eye on this issue and ensure it does not affect the State’s economic and financial stability?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Central Bank have a responsibility to express concerns if developments in the housing market could lead us down the same road we have been down before or a similarly dangerous road?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with the Governor that at the heart of this is the problem of inflated property prices and people who do not really have the money to pay for property - a roof over their heads - except through the availability of credit.  As he points out, even after the fall in prices, property prices are still much higher than in the past.  Accordingly, we are in this conundrum that people need a roof over their heads but that the only way they can have one is by a dangerous extension of credit which they might not be able to sustain if their income becomes stressed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let me interrupt as I have very little time.  I hear this narrative, but I do not buy it all.  I am looking at the private rental sector and rents are astronomical.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I cannot remember a time in recent history when paying rent to a landlord was not much of a drag on people’s income as trying to pay a mortgage.  Does a person pay a load of money to a landlord which he or she cannot afford or does he or she take out a mortgage that he or she cannot possibly afford?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the point I am trying to get to.  What we are discussing is at the heart of the bubble and our housing crisis, and is a fundamental and systemic problem around the world.  It is at the root of the crash of the global economy, which is still very vulnerable to further crashes.  The conundrum is that people's incomes are not sufficient to meet the inflated price of accommodation, be it rented or owned.  The only way to square the circle is for banks to extend a dangerous level of credit and that is not sustainable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But that does not solve the problem of putting a roof over people's heads.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put it to Professor Honohan that to resolve this conundrum we must make housing affordable or give people the level of income that will allow them put a roof over their heads.  This could be done by controlling prices, increasing incomes or a combination of both.  If one of these things is not done the circle cannot be squared, which leads to this conundrum.  People feel excluded by the prudential 20% deposit issue but the Central Bank is afraid not to have the prudential buffer because the alternative path may lead to a credit bubble.  I suggest the circle cannot be squared.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry to interrupt but I would like to make the obvious point, as time is running out.  I do not buy the narrative Professor Honohan has laid out because when 300,000 people worked in construction in Ireland and the housing market saw unprecedented supply levels, prices continued to go through the roof.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I put an alternative scenario?  I think the problem in the housing market is the extraordinary concentration of ownership in a few hands.  Has the concentration of ownership intensified in recent years?  I suggest that, in recent years, as homes have been repossessed and people have found themselves unable to purchase homes, a greater concentration of ownership has occurred.  A small number of corporate investors are buying up properties.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	NAMA is mostly selling in job lots to corporate investors.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How can increasing the concentration of ownership of residential and other properties be anything but a recipe for disaster?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	God forbid they ran our housing sector.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Governor any figures on the greater level of concentration of property ownership?  I suggest that he should get those figures because they are important.  Greater concentration of ownership of property is an inevitable result of what has happened and it is very dangerous - it is a recipe for a repeat, on a bigger scale, of what we have already seen.  This greater concentration of ownership of property means the circle that people have been trying to square in recent weeks cannot be squared.  A small number of people control the market and, therefore, they control prices.  They will set prices at the level that suits them to make a lot of money.  People will either be priced out of the market or banks will be pressurised to extend more credit, which will send us back to the dangerous territory of lending money that should not be loaned.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would the Governor examine the issue of the concentration of ownership of property?  Perhaps he could come back to the committee on this as it is important to understand what is going on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does it relate to the distribution?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Governor has seen the Credit Suisse global wealth report.  It suggests that 20% of the €508 billion of net household wealth in Ireland is held by the top 1% in society.  It also states that the top 5% of society holds over 40% of net household wealth and the top 10% holds over 50%.  What does the Governor say of this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are they close to the truth?
