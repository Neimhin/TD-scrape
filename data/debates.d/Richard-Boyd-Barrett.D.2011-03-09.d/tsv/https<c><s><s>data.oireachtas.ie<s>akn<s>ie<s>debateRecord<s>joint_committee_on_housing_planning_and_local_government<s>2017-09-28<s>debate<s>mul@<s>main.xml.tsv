RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On LIHAF, in Cherrywood, the Minister gave a figure of, I think, 23,000 houses for €226 million.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not know how the Minister can give us accurate figures when, in Cherrywood, we do not know how much we are going to get for LIHAF funding. The council tells us that. Alarmingly, it could be as low as 75 units or, if it is spread across, it could be a €75,000 discount on average prices which are about €450,000. That is not affordable and it is no use. It is not a serious return. As Senator Boyhan said, Cherrywood will be one of the biggest developments in the State. It could solve Dún Laoghaire's housing problem but it is not going to do so as matters stand because we will get 800 social units of 8,000 altogether and there may be as little as 1% in affordable housing. The other big development is in Shanganagh. The council is currently only talking about 200 units on a site that could potentially have 536 units. Over a three or four-year period, we will get 1,000 social units against a housing list of 5,700. By the time those are delivered, the list will be longer. That is no good. What is the Minister going to do to increase the percentages of LIHAF and of social housing in Cherrywood? If he does not do those things, we will not solve the problem. There is currently no plan to do anything about that. What will happen to the NAMA land in Cherrywood? I presume it is part of the 20,000 planned units of which we will only get 2,000 for social housing. That is no good; it is not enough. Unless we ramp that up, we will not solve the crisis in our area. I suspect that Dún Laoghaire reflects what is happening in the rest of the country. Will the Minister tell me how he is going to increase the percentage and proportion of social and affordable housing? To nail a myth and get the Minister to confirm it, there is a notion that it is too costly for local authorities to maintain council houses. I looked at Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council's budget for this year. It gets €15 million in rent from all its social housing stock. The maintenance is €10 million, which means that it makes a 50% profit on its annual output.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The councils should be doing it. Will the Minister do anything about the thresholds for eligibility for social housing? They must be increased. The current situation is not fair because people who are marginally over the eligibility criteria are being thrown off the list. On the rental situation and the loopholes that are being exploited for the purpose of evictions, how soon will we get change or instructions to the RTB? I have told the Minister on a number of occasions-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are two instances at present whereby vulture funds are trying to evict people using these loopholes. Will the Minister issue instructions to the RTB not to allow those evictions to go ahead?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking the Minister to push-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not high enough.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not enough.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, after voting down our proposals in July for the whole project to be social.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What was not realistic about building council property on council land? Tell me what was unrealistic about it, Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Rubbish. That is absolute rubbish
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The numbers. It will wash its own face over the long term, as the Minister well knows, just as all council housing does. This is just playing politics while we have a disastrous situation in Dún Laoghaire.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Playing politics. That is what this is. This is too serious for games.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should abandon PPPs on public property. It is obvious that this approach takes longer because, rather than a council doing it itself or getting a contractor in to do it, public private partnership involves having to go through a tendering process, etc. That is why we are getting delays. We should stop. Another reason we get messes is because developers want to make money from PPPs. They do not enter into PPPs unless they are going to make money. That slows things down. I am tetchy and I do not appreciate the politicking. I will explain the record of the Shanganagh site since 2002, when it was given to the local authority. Along with my People before Profit colleagues, I have been agitating since that time for the development of the site, on which 530 council houses could be built. In July of this year, for the umpteenth time we proposed a motion calling for the entire site to be developed for public and affordable housing. Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil, the Labour Party and, tragically, Sinn Féin, voted against that motion. They were very embarrassed about that decision over the summer. Lo and behold, all of them, without engaging in any discussion with us, popped up with a plan in September to have 40% of the site developed for social housing, with the other 60% of it being developed for forms of affordable housing which will end up back in the private market. I do not accept that 60% of a public site should end up back on the private market in five or ten years. I will explain why. I am not just talking about people I know through politics. I am personally acquainted with a woman who is living with her eight children in an hotel. This week, the family is being pushed into its third HAP tenancy. I could tell similar stories about any week. I ask the Minister to imagine what it is like to be moved in and out from an hotel to a hostel with eight kids. This woman, who is crying every day, is being told to go and find a HAP tenancy that does not exist because she will not get a council house for many years. Another friend of mine, who has been in a car for eight weeks, is trying to prove to the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection that he is living in the car. This is what is going on. If I am tetchy about this issue, and if I resent politics being played with it, it is for the reasons I have given. It is not good enough that we are getting just 40% of a public site. It is not good enough that we are getting just 10% in Cherrywood, or just 1% in the case of the local infrastructure housing activation funding. When homeless people who are now joining the housing list ask me when I think they will get a council house, I have to tell them they are looking at ten or 15 years on the current figures. At the current rate of delivery, that is what we are looking at, even with the ramped-up plans. The construction of 1,000 houses on these sites over the next three or four years will not even keep pace with the current list, which is at 5,700. The person at the end of that list will be waiting 18 years. I am not exaggerating when I say there are people who have been on the list for 18 years. What solution is the Minister proposing? I suggest that there should be more public housing on public land. The Minister needs to get more off the private developers in sites like Cherrywood than the miserable 10%, or 1% in the case of the local infrastructure housing activation fund.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that, by the way. I will say that.
