RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry. In that case, I will raise another matter.The disability equality (miscellaneous provisions) Bill involves the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. It is on the legislative programme and is listed in the programme for Government. The Tánaiste can correct me if I am wrong, but I believe that she suggested that the Bill would be in the House before Christmas. However, I see no sign of it on next week's schedule. I do not know how it can be started before Christmas. What is happening and how soon can it begin?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will make this brief. Earlier it was essentially suggested that if we had spoken less in the debate on the Finance Bill last night, we would not have this problem. I object to that logic because we have a job - a solemn responsibility, I argue - to scrutinise legislation, in particular something as important as the Finance Bill. Any suggestion we should have hurried things up to avoid being here until 3 a.m. is not really appropriate. Given that the debate ran on until 3 a.m., much later than anybody would have anticipated in the discussion at the Business Committee, it was entirely reasonable when we were dealing with legislation dealing with as important and as complex matters as finance and tax to say, "Listen, we are not doing justice to this at this hour of the night." It is not fair to use strict procedural arguments when things ran on much later than anticipated or to suggest we should have rushed things in order that we would not be in this dilemma. Against that background, we get late notice of this motion which, by any stretch of the imagination, deals with a controversial issue. We got last minute notice of a change to deal with a highly controversial issue and most Deputies did not know until 11.40 a.m. In that context, it is perfectly legitimate to protest about the manner in which the motion has been taken.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I spoke with the Minister, Deputy Coveney, last week when he telephoned me. In that call the Minister suggested the outline of the committee, on the basis that there would be fair representation of all the Dáil groups and that there would be one Fianna Fáil and one Fine Gael representative from the Seanad and two others. On that basis I said that I would have to take the proposal back to our group but that it seemed reasonable. We would have to consider whether we would engage with this committee at all because, as the Minister knows, it was our opinion that the committee was not necessary and the Dáil should have decided the issue on the back of the election. However, given that the committee is happening, we want to participate in it and the Minister's proposal, as outlined on the telephone, seemed reasonable. Then, however, something else happened. It turned out that the Seanad would not decide the two other positions beyond the Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael representatives, it would be Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael who would decide those positions - and the balance of the committee - in some sort of back room negotiations that Fine Gael was obviously having with Fianna Fáil. That is when things began to go off the rails as far as we are concerned. Let us be clear that this means the Seanad representation on it changes the balance of the committee in favour of those who have associations with one of the two major parties. This is against the likely representation, if the Seanad itself had decided, of a choice of at least one of those other representatives to be from the camp who are opposed to water charges. This is why we think it looks like a stitch-up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That begs the question if it is a stitch-up. We want an open debate. We want this committee to decide its own plan of action, its own terms of reference and it should be selecting its own Chairman. The position holder should not be selected in a backroom deal between Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and it should not override the proper proportionality of representation that should come from the Seanad with regard to that committee. That is the point. On that basis I agree with Deputy Ó Broin's amendment. The Minister should accept that our arguments are reasonable and he should accept the amendment. Then we can get on with the business, which is what we all want to do, of setting up the committee, addressing the issues around water and moving on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Like Deputy Smith, I met Lillian and Jean. It immediately chimed with me because, just that week, another woman, Helen, came to my clinic. Her story adds another layer of complexity, injustice and discrimination to the story that Deputy Smith has so articulately presented that faces a whole cohort of mostly women. It illustrates the point well. Ms McLennon reached retirement age recently, having worked continuously from the late 1970s or early 1980s all the way through to her retirement age. She made the full 30 or 35 years of contributions and so on. Upon retirement, she expected that she would get the full pension, but instead of receiving the €230 weekly pension, she is receiving €188. I understand the reason for this is because she seems to have been hit on the treble in terms of a discrimination affecting this cohort of women of that age. She had worked part-time for only a few weeks, I think, in the late 1960s. She subsequently got married. Later, she was separated. At that time, if I understand this correctly, when a couple was married, only one person in the house could make PRSI contributions because the woman in the house was not seen as a full equal. Even though she was subsequently working, she was not making any PRSI contributions. During the period in which she was not working but was married, she was caught by the failure of the homemaker scheme to be retrospective for those years before 1994. She was caught by all of those things.Her yearly average is brought down because she worked in the late 1960s. Also, some of the work she did is not counted on foot of the fact that she was not able to make contributions because, if I understand it correctly, only one member of a married couple's contributions counted, namely, those of her husband. Consequently, despite the fact that she has done as much work and made as many contributions as other people who get the full pension entitlement, she gets approximately €40 a week less. That is an unacceptable injustice and a discrimination against her on the basis that she is a woman of a particular age. This is a major issue and an injustice. We are only beginning to see its impact as this cohort of women reach retirement age. Many more women will face this injustice in the coming years until that cohort works its way through to the 1986 threshold, when the homemaker's scheme kicks in and they will not be penalised. Whether it is by means of a combination of basing it on the total number of contributions someone makes, getting rid of the annual averaging, making the homemaker's scheme retrospective before 1986 and eliminating any possible discrimination in terms of women working prior to that date who were treated differently because they happened to be married or separated - I am not quite sure whether divorce was an option at the time - and whose work did not count because they were not liable to pay PRSI, whatever the Minister does, the discriminations to which I refer must be removed in order to ensure that there is equality for women like Helen and the many others who are likely to run afoul of this inequity in the coming years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will try to find it for the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	She may have worked in the public service.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I often get a sense of the surreal when I am in this Chamber because of the common disconnect between the assertions and statements of this Government and the reality, outside in the real world, to which those statements relate. On no issue is that feeling more acute than on the issue of Ireland's supposed military neutrality and the repeated assertions of the Minister of State at the Department of Defence, Deputy Paul Kehoe, and the Government about their commitment to military neutrality and peace as against the reality of what this country is doing on the question of war and militarism. In this context, the Government's commitment to military neutrality brings to mind George Orwell's famous references to doublespeak and Big Brother's slogans that "War is Peace", "Freedom is Slavery" and "Ignorance is Strength". I do not see how the Government could possibly contend that Irish Government policy, now or previously under Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael, adheres even to the principles set out in the Government's amendment to Sinn Féin's neutrality Bill. Article 29 is quoted in the amendment as affirming Ireland’s "devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation amongst nations founded on international justice and morality". Article 29.2 affirms Ireland’s "adherence to the principle of the pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination". Will the Minister of State please explain to me how those imperatives, set out in the Government amendment, tally with allowing Shannon Airport to be used in the context of US military action and the destruction and devastation it has inflicted in Afghanistan, Iraq, Yemen or Syria? How could any of those things be described as according with "devotion to the ideal of peace and friendly co-operation" or the "pacific settlement of international disputes by international arbitration or judicial determination"? That is not what they are doing. There is no international arbitration or judicial determination in the decision of the United States, as confirmed on 23 October, to use depleted uranium weapons in Syria. Do the Ministers condemn that? Do they abhor it? Does it concern them? Has it got anything whatsoever to do with international arbitration, judicial determination or the pacific settlement of international disputes? No, it has not. It involves using disgusting weapons of mass destruction to kill people, poison people, irradiate the environment in which they live and poison their water and their land, producing higher infant mortality rates and a disgusting spike in the levels of cancers and deformities among young children. Syria has been ravaged as a result of the recent war, as was Iraq. These are the same depleted uranium weapons used by the same US-led military coalition as in 2003 and the previous war to poison Iraq, leading to enormous, obscene rises in the level of infant deformation, disability and mortality. In the lowest estimates 250,000 people have been killed in Iraq and, in the highest estimates, 1 million have been killed, directly or indirectly, as a result of US military action.What the hell does that have to do with the imperatives the Minister of State claims to uphold? What does it have to do with what is happening in Iraq, where 5,000 US military personnel are working with Iraqi and Kurdish forces in trying to retake the city of Mosul, where the United Nations fears there will be an enormous humanitarian crisis which will result in 700,000 people fleeing the city? The UN camps can accommodate only 60,000. More destruction will be wreaked on Iraqi cities that have already been decimated as a result of the US-led war starting in 2003 with all of the spillover effects that have led to the destabilisation of Syria and the obscene destruction and killing that is taking place, in which the United States continues to participate. It recently killed 56 civilians in Manbij. What does it have to do with what they are doing in Yemen? It has just been announced that in October alone there were 1,400 cases of cholera in Yemen where a major outbreak was declared as a result of 18 months of war. The majority of health facilities and clean water supplies have been destroyed by the US-supported, Saudi-led coalition which is bombing the hell out of Yemen.  What does it have to do with the peaceful settlement of international disputes? It is just warmongering and wanton destruction of innocent civilians, causing millions to be displaced, using obscene weapons, and we are facilitating it at Shannon Airport. Any reasonable definition of neutrality, as the Hague Convention makes clear, does not allow for weapons of war to be moved through neutral states when used in that sort of military action. What is worse is that we have had a small number of troops under NATO command in Afghanistan in what was clearly a retaliatory war, led by the United States in response to the horrendous events of 11 September 2001. There have been 15 years of war which have destroyed society in Afghanistan which we have facilitated every inch of the way.  How can the Minister of State say we are upholding Ireland’s military neutrality or adhering to the principles he asserts? It is self-evident that are not and Orwellian to suggest we are. That is why we need this neutrality Bill to lock into the Constitution the bringing into effect of the principles the Minister of State says he is upholding in order that there would be no swivel room to allow him to shred military neutrality by implicating us in these wars, mass destruction and killing and supporting a major imperial power in its vicious, brutal, cruel and destructive military actions in the Middle East. It is even more the case with Mr. Trump who says: “We will spend what we need to rebuild our military. It is the cheapest investment we can make. We will develop, build and purchase the best equipment known to mankind. Our military dominance must be unquestioned.” That is his policy. Are we going to facilitate a state that has that attitude towards military dominance, a clearly expressed imperial perspective? If we are, it is an affront to any claim that we uphold military neutrality. If the Minister of State is serious about the principles he has included in his amendment, he has no choice but to support the Bill brought forward by Sinn Féin. Anything less would be hypocrisy and show him up as trying to fool the people, but they are not fooled.
