RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Barry. Black lives matter. Racism is not so much a virus as a poison deliberately administered. George Floyd was a victim of murderous, brutal and systemic racism that was deliberately stoked, encouraged and escalated by the billionaire Donald Trump, who uses racism deliberately, as even General James "Mad Dog" Mattis has admitted, to divide and rule, to deflect away from economic and social injustice and to set people against one another. Will the Taoiseach condemn Donald Trump for his use of racism and police brutality as a result of which George Floyd lost his life and of which millions of Americans and millions more across the world are victims? Will he match his words against racism by eliminating the racist injustice that is the direct provision system? It is an inhumane and degrading system that marks people of colour out as different, other and separate and, consequently, leads to encouraging that poison and racism. Will he accept that the failure to address systemic and ongoing inequality, poverty and injustice perpetuates the soil in which racism and the divide and rule tactics we have seen from Donald Trump continue to flourish? If he does not, his condemnation means nothing. In order to eliminate racism we need to eschew divide and rule tactics and address the horrors of poverty, unemployment and homelessness. If the Taoiseach condemns racism, does he also recognise his Government's failure to deal with those ingredients that continue to perpetuate the opportunity for that divide and rule poison to be used by cynical and dishonest leaders?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps a more accurate description of divide and rule tactics is the false claim the Taoiseach tried to make in order to boost his political ambitions by decrying the welfare cheats who cheat us all, rather than the bankers and property speculators who truly did cheat us all. Maybe the Taoiseach will address another group who are about to face an injustice at his hands and, indeed, have faced police harassment in recent days. I refer to the Debenhams workers who are currently standing outside Leinster House and have done so every week for several weeks. They were unceremoniously dumped on the scrap heap by a cynical company that is using the Covid-19 crisis as a cover for its sheer greed.These are workers who are fighting for decent redundancy terms and who want to be at work but, and this is critical, many of them are women part-time workers who are now on the Covid-19 payment. Of course, when we ask who are the working poor in this country, they are women part-time workers in the main. Are they now going to be the victims of the Taoiseach's plan to taper, cut and reduce the â‚¬350 pandemic payment? Rather than cut and attack the working poor again, why does he not address the employer - Debenhams - that treated these workers in such a cynical way?
