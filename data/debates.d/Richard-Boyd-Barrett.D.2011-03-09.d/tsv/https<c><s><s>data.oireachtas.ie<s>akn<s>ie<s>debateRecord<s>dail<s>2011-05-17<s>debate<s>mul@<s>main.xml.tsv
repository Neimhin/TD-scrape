RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We agree with the Minister of State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State is dead right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the disastrous failure of PPPs to deliver for St. Michael's Estate and Dominick St., has the Government decided to abandon that model when trying to progress regeneration?  I hope it has.  Will the Government consider moving to a direct labour approach to the regeneration of estates, refurbishment works for council estates and the construction of social housing?  This is a quicker way of doing it and is not vulnerable to the ups and downs demonstrated by PPPs that are dependent on private developers involved to make a quick buck.  Even with the tendering process, where it is outsourced, there are major delays.  There is a regeneration project in Dun Laoghaire, which took ten years because private developers——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——kept going out of business.  Why do we not employ some of the unemployed construction workers directly to do this regeneration work?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It took this long.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the seriousness with which the Minister of State is addressing this issue.  Houses that are boarded up for long periods represent a running sore in estates.  It is frustrating for unemployed construction workers to see these boarded up properties given that they are capable of making the necessary repairs.  Even some of the people on the housing lists would prefer to refit the houses themselves rather than let them rot.  If the figures about Limerick are accurate, can the Minister of State find out how houses are turned around in one week?  What is being done there that is different from the rest of the country?One of the reasons for the slow turnaround may be the requirement to tender for work.  It often takes forever simply to hire a builder.  If we gave local unemployed construction workers or even the people on the housing lists the opportunity, they could turn the houses around much faster.  Obviously proper standards must be applied but we should consider this alternative because the cumbersome tendering process is causing lengthy and unnecessary delays in many cases.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister of State's approach to this issue.  It is a positive day and we are hearing many positive comments.  I must pinch myself.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister of State's suggestion to bring both functions together in a one-stop-shop but the discretion community welfare officers have in sanctioning rent allowance is worrying.  The vast majority of CWOs are good, decent people but problem cases arise because they have discretion rather than being subject to clear guidelines about people's eligibility.  This matter needs to be examined.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure the Minister of State will agree it was a scandal that the previous Government oversaw an unprecedented property boom during which up to 90,000 houses were built annually but left a legacy of 50,000 people on local authority housing lists, which is an astonishing indictment of its performance.  Can he assure the House that the Government will not oversee an equally great scandal with up to 300,000 empty houses in the State while 50,000 people are on the housing list and that he will aggressively move to resolve this terrible anomaly, which could result in people being on the list for nine or ten years?Must we not aggressively attack this issue not only because of the obscenity of houses lying empty while people are on the housing list but also for sound financial reasons?  If the 50,000 people on the housing list were housed, it would save the State approximately €500 million in rent allowance payments annually and it would probably generate €360 million for the Exchequer in rent.  This would not even be fiscally neutral.  We would benefit if we housed the 50,000 people on the list.  While acknowledging the Minister of State's earlier comments, is there not a case for allocating suitable NAMA properties to social housing applicants and, where such properties are not suitable, to engage workers to construct social housing because that would create employment, provide housing and save the State money by generating a new revenue stream?  It is a "no brainer" to do this.  Does the Minister of State intend to move in that direction?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not clear about the Minister of State's reasons we cannot proceed in the manner I outlined.  I accept what he said about economic constraints but this is a financially positive move for the State.  We will save money if we invest in NAMA housing stock or build new social housing to house those on housing waiting lists.  Surely that is a safe bet in terms of capital investment.  We have money in the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  If we house people we will save on rent allowance payments and get revenue into the State through rental income.  There is no risk in doing that and it would get people back to work.  I do not understand why we would not do it.The leasing arrangements are crazy because they are throwing money away to the benefit of private developers.  Could the Minister of State guarantee that in so far as leasing arrangements are entered into, they will not be with developers who are bankrupt so that we are essentially keeping them in business when they are bankrupt?  It is one thing for a local authority to lease from NAMA because the money is coming back to us but it would be a crazy waste of money if we were to lease from a developer who is bankrupt and who would not still be in business were it not for the existence of a local authority lease.  I seek assurances in that regard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the Taoiseach's statement and the statements of many people in the media and elsewhere about the importance of the visits by the Queen and President Obama, the cost and the various issues that have arisen, I am surprised there will not be an opportunity for statements to be made in the House.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a genuine question.  There has not been enough debate.  Given the huge cost involved and the major impact it is having——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——are we not going to discuss it at any stage?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On another matter——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister should stop barracking.  I am asking a question.  Another matter I raised previously was whether we would have a chance to debate the McCarthy report on the sale of State assets.  The Taoiseach suggested that we discuss it with the Whips.  It was raised at the Whips' meeting but we were told there is no appetite to discuss the report and the sale of State assets.  Will we get a chance to discuss the report?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was for three minutes.
