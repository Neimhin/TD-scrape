RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the groups that has suffered the most and has experienced the greatest level of anxiety is people with special needs and their families. While the National Council for Special Education has produced a review regarding the allocation of resources, the unions, particularly the Irish National Teachers' Organisation, INTO, have indicated grave concern and said that without reversing the previous cuts of 15% in resource posts and the moratorium on posts of responsibility, even the positive elements included in this may not be able adequately to provide for special needs and protect the integrated education model, which is important for all primary school children.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not know if it is a circle which can be squared to say on the one hand that we had no choice but to make these cuts and on the other that we will protect the integrated model of education. Let us be clear that the integrated model of education is of critical importance for vulnerable students, including students with special needs, Travellers, and primary schoolchildren with language needs, as well as for the whole education system. The 15% cuts in resource teachers and the removal of language support teachers and support teachers for Traveller children have created serious pressure, added to which is the fact that 10,000 extra children are going into primary school every year. It poses very serious questions about whether that model can in fact be protected. Indeed, it would be useful if the Minister of State could provide a guarantee that there will be no further education cuts affecting the primary school sector and special needs supports in the coming budget. The Nevin Economic Research Institutue, NERI, said recently that these education cuts, particularly in primary education, were the most damaging socially and as regards the long-term economic future of our country. Can we get assurances in that regard?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The thing about fiscal restraint is that one can cut off one's nose to spite one's face. There is no more important example of that than in the area of education, particularly primary education. Providing the necessary resources for primary school children, particularly those who are vulnerable is vital for them and for the long-term economic future of the country. If one cuts off one's nose now, one will spite one's face in the future. We have the second-largest class sizes in Europe and have had substantial cuts in this area. I have not heard from the Minister of State an assurance that there will not be further cuts that will affect the primary school sector and special needs in the future budget. If the Minister of State could even provide commitments on that level, it would assure teachers and parents who are anxious about the detrimental impact of these sorts of cuts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are 10,000 more kids coming and the largest class sizes in Europe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Obviously, consultation is good, as is the idea of a model that is more flexible and responsive to need. However, given the oft-repeated phrase "finite resources", problems can emerge. One particular question raised by the INTO concerns the moratorium on posts of responsibility and posts involving special duties, given that schools may have a difficulty in getting what they need and making the case for what they need because of the moratorium. In fact, the INTO claims the recommendations will be unworkable without lifting the moratorium. I would like to hear what the Minister of State has to say about this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, it is. Multinationals will come in.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is as privatising as one can get.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach meet them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point has been well made, but I want to give an example and to hear the response of the Minister of State in regard to it. This concerns the agreement the Government made initially in the memorandum of understanding to sell off the harvesting rights of Coillte, which had been agreed with the troika.For a long time we tried to discover what the hell was going on, what analysis had been carried out of the plan to sell Coillte's harvesting rights and what the NTMA or NewERA, whichever was supposed to be responsible for the proposed sale, was doing. It was extremely difficult to obtain information and we were screaming for a debate. The only debate on the matter finally took place when we tabled a Private Members' motion. There was a huge external campaign to highlight why selling the harvesting rights of Coillte would be a major mistake and why what was proposed did not add up at any level. Ultimately, under pressure from that big civil society campaign, the Government changed its mind. Up until that point, however, there was nothing which required it to engage in a discussion on the decision, agreed with the troika, to sell off the harvesting rights. We had no right to demand that a matter of such huge import be debated in the House. To follow on from Deputy Pearse Doherty's point, this is a recent example of how we could not obtain a debate on a major proposal. As matters stand, if this or any future Government decides to dispose of State assets and gives instructions to the Ireland Strategic Investment Fund or the NTMA to facilitate it, we cannot force a debate on the issue. That should be the minimum requirement on the part of any Government in the disposal of State assets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State did not really respond about the experience in respect of Coillte as an example of what we are discussing. When the Government committed to sell off the harvesting rights of Coillte, NewERA was dealing with that area. NewERA had been charged with the responsibility for managing something that had been written into the troika agreement. The Government's policy was to go ahead with it up until the moment it decided, under public pressure, that was not going to do it. During that period we got responses to parliamentary questions, which the Government said we could ask. We asked the questions but we could get little information about what the hell NewERA was doing in terms of preparing for the sale of the harvesting rights of Coillte. If I remember correctly, at the time there were several references to commercial sensitivity put out as the cover for the non-answers about what was going on inside NewERA in terms of preparing for the sell-off of Coillte. The avenue of parliamentary questions, Leaders' Questions and so on was pursued. All these approaches were employed by the Opposition to try to get information but they yielded virtually nothing about what the hell NewERA was up to with regard to the detail of preparing the ground. As Deputy Doherty said, it was not that NewERA or the National Treasury Management Agency per se, with the approval of the Government or the Minister, could undertake the sale. Rather, NewERA was told to go about putting together the nuts and bolts of the sale, and we could get no information about what was going on. I think I understand correctly what Deputy Doherty is saying. If that sort of work is being undertaken by this body then we have the right to some say in it and it should be debated in the House. That would add necessary transparency to an important area.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the Minister of State give an answer? Is he not allowed to?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to contribute. I support this amendment. As Deputy Higgins outlined, it is fairly extraordinary that the areas of so-called expertise which are to be required for those appointed to the board of the National Treasury Management Agency are the same as those found among the circle of so-called experts in the areas of investment, finance and economics - precisely the cohort of people who failed to grasp what was happening in the economy. In many, if not most, cases they cheered on the property madness that pumped up the property bubble. They failed to see the crash coming and right up to the last minute they were talking about soft landings, denouncing people who were critical of what was going on as being insane or off the wall, and in various other ways vilifying the critics of what the so-called experts were doing. Then they made disastrous decisions about how to deal with the consequences of their own failures. Yet there do not seem to be any lessons learned about that experience. The same gang and categories of so-called expert are wheeled in. It is indicative of our approach, which is still very top-down and elitist, to how we deal with our economy and what is viewed as the purpose of it. The prevailing view seems to be that the people are there to serve the economy, with the economic experts as the ones who know about it, rather than the economy being there to serve the interests, objectives, aspirations and needs of the ordinary people.In all of these matters we start the wrong way around, and no lessons appear to have been learned about the consequences of doing this, even after the most devastating economic crash. I jest not when I say that the list should read: (a) the dogs in the street; (b) a granny; and (c) any worker in the building industry. We should also include the whole range of other categories of ordinary citizen who drew attention to the fact that what was happening was mad but who were not listened to because they were not considered to be experts, while the so-called experts thought what we were doing was right and did not foresee the crash right up to the last minute. There should be some acknowledgement of this in the make-up of the agency. I am serious when I suggest the inclusion in the list of the dogs in the street and, perhaps, every taxi driver, because it was they, in the context of some of the buildings that were being constructed and the sale prices being achieved for land and property, who knew that what was happening was crazy and was going to go bang. However, the opinions of ordinary people who could see what was obvious were not taken on board, and instead the so-called experts dictated and dominated the debate. Another group of people who should be seriously considered worthy of being on such boards is people who are actually experts in some of the key areas where investments are likely to be made. The Minister of State will be aware of my interest in the forestry issue. It took a huge campaign on the part of people much more knowledgeable than I about forestry to raise awareness of what was at stake in terms of the sale of the forests, because they understood how valuable a resource it is. Eventually, as a result of their knowledge, the Government was forced to change its mind and acknowledge how valuable the forests are and what a big mistake it would be to sell them off. One could say the same about housing and the people on housing lists, or those who represent them, or distressed mortgage holders. Given how central the issue of housing was and the marketing of housing as a commodity on which to make money, which was a disastrous approach, it is important that membership of boards is at least balanced and includes people who understand that the basic point of housing is to put a roof over the heads of human beings. It might be useful to at least balance the property experts with those people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State should read Animal Farm.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One group seriously omitted from the list is that of representatives of pensioners. It should not be forgotten by us in dealing with this legislation that what we are speaking about is the National Pensions Reserve Fund, which was set up to ensure we can meet our pension liabilities into the future. At the very least, representatives of pensioners, possibly elected representatives, should be included on this board to ensure oversight of decisions in regard to how funding from what is still effectively the National Pensions Reserve Fund is being spent, including what it is being invested in and whether it is being used to bail out banks or whatever the hell it is. The other points that have been made stand, but they are one group that absolutely should be represented.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some of us are against the sale of any State assets so obviously we are going to object to anything that facilitates that. Setting aside that point, when we were discussing this issue earlier the Minister of State said that the Minister has the power to do this anyway.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes but the point is that the authority to do this exists. I wish it did not. The Minister of State might argue that provision has been made for Irish Water to remain a public company. Some of us are dubious about that. We believe the Government has done that under public pressure. We are also dubious as to what extent this will remain the case or for that matter whether privatisation by stealth is already happening in that Irish Water can engage in outsourcing and so on. Setting aside all of those points, the point being made is that if the Minister who has the power to do so asks the NTMA to prepare the nuts and bolts of the sale of a State asset then he or she in making that call - which I wish he or she could not do - should at least be required to come before this House to debate the matter, during which time serious questions about the details of preparations for the project could be raised. I refer to the proposed sale of the harvesting rights of Coillte. During the year and a half between when the Government was committed to that sell-off and its reversal of that decision, which I welcomed, one of the issues of concern was the value for money that might or might not be achieved in that regard. The figure bandied around in respect of the amount for which the harvesting rights would be sold was €600 million. That is the figure that was referred to by some Ministers. People who are more knowledgeable than I in the area of forestry pointed out that in the context of the cost of timber per acre and so on this amounted to a give-away of the harvesting rights. On foot of being informed of this by people who are more knowledgeable than I in this area I repeatedly tabled parliamentary questions on the matter, including at various stages to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd, but I came up against a blank wall. I was told that the information was commercially sensitive and to release it would jeopardise the negotiations, all of which was nonsense as far as I am concerned. Despite that what we were speaking of was the sale of a valuable State asset I could not get information about it.  This provision would ensure that if a Minister makes this call he or she, prior to the NTMA commencing development of the project, would have to engage in a discussion on that decision in this House. That is a reasonable and fairly minimal requirement to ensure transparency, oversight and so on of a decision regarding the disposal of the people's assets. These are vital assets owned by the people.
