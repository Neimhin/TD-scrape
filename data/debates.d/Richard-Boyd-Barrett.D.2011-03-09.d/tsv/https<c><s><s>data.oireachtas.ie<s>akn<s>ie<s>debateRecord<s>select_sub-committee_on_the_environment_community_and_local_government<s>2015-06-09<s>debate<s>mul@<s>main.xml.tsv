RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 10:In page 6, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:
“Setting annual targets
5. (1) The Minister shall, by order, set the annual targets for each year in the periods mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (g) of subsection (2).(2) The Minister shall set the annual targets for each year—(a) in the period 2015-2022, no later than 31 October 2015,(b) in the period 2023-2027, no later than 31 October 2020,(c) in the period 2028-2032, no later than 31 October 2024,(d) in the period 2033-2037, no later than 31 October 2028,(e) in the period 2038-2042, no later than 31 October 2033,(f) in the period 2043-2047, no later than 31 October 2038,(g) in the period 2048-2050, no later than 31 October 2042.(3) The Minister shall, when setting annual targets, have regard to any advice they receive from the relevant body as to the cumulative amount of net emissions for the period 2015-2050 that is consistent with a reduction over that period of net emissions accounts which would allow the 2050 target to be met.(4) The Minister shall, when setting annual targets, also have regard to the following matters (the “target-setting criteria”)—(a) the objective of not exceeding the fair and safe emissions budget,(b) scientific knowledge about climate change,(c) technology relevant to climate change,(d) economic circumstances, in particular the likely impact of the target on—(i) the economy,(ii) the competitiveness of particular sectors of the Irish economy,(iii) small and medium-sized enterprises,(iv) jobs and employment opportunities,(e) fiscal circumstances, in particular the likely impact of the target on taxation, public spending and public borrowing,(f) social circumstances, in particular the likely impact of the target on those living in poorer or deprived communities,(g) the likely impact of the target on those living in remote rural communities and island communities,(h) energy policy, in particular the likely impact of the target on energy supplies, the renewable energy sector and the carbon and energy intensity of the economy,(i) environmental considerations and, in particular, the likely impact of the targets on biodiversity,(j) European and international law and policy relating to climate change.(5) If annual targets for a period are not set by the corresponding date mentioned in paragraphs (a) to (g) of subsection (2), the Minister shall set the annual targets as soon as reasonably practicable afterwards.(6) In this Act, the “fair and safe emissions budget” is the aggregate amount of net emissions for the period 2015-2050 recommended by the relevant body as being consistent with contributing appropriately to stabilisation of greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.”.The amendment relates to target setting which is at the heart of many of the amendments. We need to move beyond aspirations to specific, concrete and binding targets if we are to seriously address runaway climate change.The discussion was had to a significant extent on Second Stage and I am sure the Minister is well aware of the arguments that are being put forward, not just by Deputies here but also by just about every credible environmental NGO and scientist who takes seriously the issue of climate change and the disastrous consequences that are likely to ensue if we do not address it. The concern is that this Bill is long on tokenistic aspiration and very short on concrete measures and targets that are binding and that will force real action for dealing with climate change. That is the point and nothing I have heard from the Government side in the debate on Second Stage or to date adequately explains why the Department will not buy into targets. I think I speak for the majority of environmental NGOs when I say that such targets are imperative. I await the Minister's response to see if he has developed his arguments any further but we do not think that anything less than serious targets can address the issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we allowed to respond to the Minister?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I seek clarification from the Chair. If we push these to a vote now, is it the case that we cannot resubmit them on Report Stage?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We can press and withdraw.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I acknowledge that the Minister is saying that he is open to further amendments around these areas. However, I do not accept the choice that he is giving us or at least I do not think the stark choice he is giving us is the right way to look at this, particularly if we talk about exceeding targets, saying it could damage our economic recovery. It sees the argument put forward by people concerned about climate change, namely, the need for serious, binding and effective targets; a proper system of reporting on the meeting of those targets; ensuring that there is a strategy to achieve targets and real accountability in that area; and overshooting the targets that might be set by the EU as a threat to the economy. It is quite the opposite. If we do not address climate change, the threat not just to our economy but our society will be far greater in the medium to longer term so I do not think we should pose it in those terms. We need to break from that mindset. Even now, one could argue that flooding and the impact of climate change are already having a huge cost for the economy, the Exchequer and indeed for agriculture.Often we imagine we are defending agriculture against environmentalists when, in fact, that is the wrong way to look at it. If we do not address this issue, everyone in the entire economy will pay, including those involved in the farming sector. The logic behind the amendments is that we should be leaders in this area and should not engage in special pleading on behalf of particular sectors. We should not engage in special pleading with the European Union to duck out of targets in certain areas and argue that Ireland is a special case. We should be leaders in this regard because there is no more urgent and serious matter than runaway climate change and the need to address it. That is the logic behind the amendments. Obviously, given the restrictions on the amendments we can table in order that they will not be ruled out of order, to a large extent we are in the hands of the Minister. We can only make the arguments-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In reality, the amendments we would like to see could only be tabled by the Minister. We can make the arguments and table amendments on Committee and Report Stages to flag issues, but in reality, only he can table the amendments required. The amendments are a way of flagging the need to go much further than the Minister is willing to go in the Bill and move beyond tokenism and aspirations to actions that would be effective.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even if it is pushed to a vote?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chairman has more or less answered my query. It means that the amendment we voted on can be raised again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I had thought the same as the Chairman.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the open approach of the Minister at rhetorical level and the positive indications that he is willing to consider further amendments tabled by us, or himself, based on the discussions we have had. I am just catching up with the debate. I came in a little late because I was in the Dáil. The point I really want to make is that while we can all make very positive noises about the need to do something about this matter, we return to drift again. That is the fear. We do not have the luxury of returning to drift. There are a number of elements to be considered. When considering the next amendment, we will discuss the time allowed for the mitigation report and the procedures for reporting back. On the specific matter of targets, if we do not have them, there will be nothing to discipline us to prevent drift.Even with the best will in the world it will drift. If we are to get into the type of discussions mentioned by Deputy Fergus O'Dowd where we have to get down to the detail, rather than drift along in the hope that something is happening but really nothing is happening, there has to be a much tighter disciplinary framework which forces us at local authority and sectoral levels in terms of the timetable and the numbers to be achieved to do that. Then all the rest will follow - engaging with school students, forcing us to think about it at local authority level, forcing people in particular sectors of the economy to look at the detail as to whether every new house is built with solar panels. Are we going to look at local community energy co-operatives which utilise a mix of different renewable energies where there is a real focus and say that people have got to deliver? Let us have the discussion about wind and the different mix. I am sceptical about the industrial wind but let us have the discussion. Targets will force us to deliver; however, we do it, we have got to deliver. How many houses in one's area have been insulated in the past year? How many houses needing insulation across the country have been insulated? Without targets I do not see how this will happen, we will drift along with aspiration but little to tie us, or to say whether we have achieved anything. If there is not a target against which to match something, people can trot out numbers to say they achieved such and such in the past year. If there is not a target against which to test it, what does that really mean against what we have to achieve? The point about targets is that they force that discipline on us, from which the rest will follow. That is the argument. The rationale and the logic for it are simply irresistible if we are serious about delivering.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 11:In page 6, between lines 6 and 7, to insert the following:
“Advice before setting annual targets
6. (1) The Minister shall, before laying a draft of a statutory instrument containing an order under section 5(1)* before the Government, request advice from the relevant body.(2) The request for advice shall include requests for the relevant body’s views—(a) in the case of annual targets proposed for years in the period 2015-2020, as to whether those targets are consistent with a reduction over that period of net emissions accounts which would allow the interim target and the 2050 target to be met,(b) in the case of annual targets proposed for years in the period 2021-2050, as to whether those targets are consistent with a reduction over that period of net emissions accounts which would allow the 2050 target to be met,(c) in any case—(i) as to what annual targets are appropriate by reference to the target-setting criteria,(ii) as to the extent to which the annual targets should be met by taking action to reduce net emissions,(iii) as to the respective contributions towards meeting the annual targets and the domestic effort target that should be made—(I) by the traded sector of the economy,(II) by the other sectors of the economy,(iv) as to the respective contributions towards meeting the annual targets and the domestic effort target that should be made by—(I) energy efficiency,(II) energy generation,(III) land use,(IV) transport.(3) The Minister shall publish the advice requested under subsection (1) as soon as reasonably practicable after they receive it.(4) As soon as reasonably practicable after laying such a draft, the Minister shall publish a statement setting out in respect of the annual targets set by the order—(a) the reasons for setting those annual targets at those levels,(b) the extent to which those targets take account of the target-setting criteria.(5) If the order under section 5(1)* makes provision different from that recommended by the relevant body, the Minister shall publish a statement setting out the reasons why.(6) Advice requested under subsection (1) or a statement under subsection (4) or (5) may be published in such manner as the Minister considers appropriate.".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This amendment is proposing to ensure drift does not happen. This smacks of kicking an issue a considerable way down the road in a worrying way. If the Minister wants to make an argument that this takes a bit of time and there is some work to be done, he could plausibly make an argument for a year. The provision for two years is really crazy and there is no sense of urgency in saying we do not have to formulate a plan for two years. The Minister should consider this amendment as the process is too important to let it drag on for that long.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I accept that six months is probably tight, given that public consultation is required and essential to this. The strategic environmental assessment is also required. Nevertheless, two years is still too long, and I am not just saying that for the sake of making a political point. The Minister could achieve what needs to be done with the sense of urgency that is required while having the necessary consultation and complying with the required regulations sooner than that. I ask the Minister to consider this, as I will certainly try to do my homework between now and Report Stage. I will speak with people who know more than I do about how we can put this plan together and what timeframe is realistic. I am inclined to think a year would be reasonable, as it would have implicit urgency but it would give us the time to cover the bases mentioned by the Minister. I ask him to consider that before Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will withdraw the amendment for now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In doing that, we are putting trust in the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 13:In page 6, line 11, to delete "submit to the Government for approval" and substitute "submit to Dáil Éireann for approval".This is very important for many reasons.One of the reasons is that the issue of addressing climate change must become a matter that is at the right, front and centre of public consciousness. If it is something that is just discussed in committees and decisions are just made in ministerial offices, we will not have the necessary oversight, accountability and rigorous debate and scrutiny that is necessary. Furthermore, that does not send out a signal regarding how serious this matter is. Every year, we have a prolonged, detailed and public debate about the public economy. This debate on the budget is the most important debate we have. We have a long run-in to the budget, with many submissions and extended debate. For the best part of several weeks, the country is focused on the fine detail of the budget and how it affects different sectors of society. We have this because, "It's the economy, stupid". Even people who do not think about politics or what goes on here most of the time focus on this debate because they know it will impact on them. If we are serious about climate action and meeting targets, we must put that issue into a similar space. That culture change is necessary if we are to deal with the issue. I share the Minister's view, as I suspect many others interested in this issue and environmental groups do, that if we make this space, it could prove exciting, because it would allow us and the people to think about all the exciting changes, technology and changes in practices that could be beneficial, not just at the environmental level, but at an economic and social level also. That is the logic we need here, first, because we need accountability and transparency and, second, because we must push this issue into the centre stage of public debate and political life.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to press the amendment. I am not convinced by what the Minister has said and would be curious to hear what other Deputies have to say. I have made my argument and do not see the logic of the course suggested by the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is precisely as I said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is about pushing it to the front. Let us be honest, the issue is not central at the moment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to make one further point. I am trying to get my head around what the Minister has said and to understand the logic behind his opposition to this. If he believes this amendment dilutes in some way the requirement or compulsion on the Government, that is a legitimate concern. Perhaps he could clarify that. However, I do not believe the Government and the Dáil should be set off against one another. The legislation could compel the Dáil to pass this in order that there would have to be a mitigation plan and in order that the mitigation plan would have binding targets we must pass. However, the point in saying that it should go to the Dáil also and not just to the Government for approval is that the issue and responsibility for it should be front and centre of political and public life. The plan should become a big event and be interrogated in a public way. The arguments around the plan and different views on how best to put the plan together should be discussed and then the decision should be made on the plan. The requirement to have the plan, one that will be effective, is compulsory. There is no choice about that. The Government must present the plan to the Dáil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have rehearsed the argument so there is not a whole lot left for me to say. The Minister has said that we have European targets which are difficult to achieve and, therefore, Ireland does not need its own targets. In response, some of us are concerned that the Government is making a special plea to the European Union for exemptions to be applied in particular sectors. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. There is a bit of slippage. One will get off the hook if one argues that there is something exceptional about the Irish economy and, therefore, the targets in a particular area should be relaxed. If we insert targets in the Bill then there will be no getting around the requirement for all sectors to move in this direction, and no exceptions. In fact, the Government would be in breach of domestic law if it failed to comply with that requirement. Some people believe we have a crisis. Some of us believe there is an emergency hurtling down the tracks towards us. Therefore, we also believe targets should be stipulated in domestic law, that there should be no ways around this situation and no exceptions. We believe we should just grasp the nettle and be required to set targets in our own law which would rule out the possibility of exceptional deals or opt-outs at a European level.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As we have been over the argument, I will try not to repeat it. While we want to protect agriculture and the specific character of the economy and important sectors in it must be a consideration, in addition to what Deputy Mick Wallace has said on the matter, putting all one's eggs in one basket is dangerous, not just from an environmental point of view but from every point of view. We have made these mistakes before with disastrous consequences, for example, the property basket. It is a mistake to set off the absolute imperative to transform the economy to deal with climate change against the defence of a singular view of agricultural interest and Irish agriculture. We need to diversify in a very considerable way what we consider to be agriculture and not to have all of our eggs in one or two baskets. While we are throwing out good ideas, albeit slightly off the specific amendment, a simple measure a Government could take would be to have a scheme in the public service and the Civil Service whereby everybody would have the opportunity to move within them to work in any outlet near to where he or she lived. People would enthusiastically embrace it, given that it would improve their quality of life.It would also very significantly reduce needless transport for many people commuting from one part of the city to the other if there was an option for them to work in the public or Civil Service closer to home. That is a specific measure which the Minister could consider.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 17:In page 6, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following:“(e) specify the projected total national emissions for the period of the plan on the basis of all the policy measures specified in the plan.”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My position is the same. We have already had the discussion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 21:In page 8, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:“(j) the need to promote sustainable consumption and production,(k) the protection and promotion of public health,(l) other benefits likely to arise from the transition to a low carbon economy,(m) the protection of and restoration of biological diversity consistent with Ireland’s obligations under the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity 1992,(n) the importance of ensuring coherence with national policy on overseas development.”.In this amendment Deputy Catherine Murphy proposes to add to the requirements that must be met when the Government is preparing the national mitigation plan. The Bill sets out a number of requirement, but Deputy Catherine Murphy's amendment would make some good additions. She refers to the need to promote sustainable consumption and production; the protection of public health; other benefits that are likely to arise from the transition to a low carbon economy; the importance of biodiversity and the importance of ensuring coherence with national policy on overseas development. This clause would contribute to international solidarity on climate change and deal with how we might be contributing to climate change elsewhere.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister's response is reasonable. I will re-enter the amendment on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 22:In page 8, to delete lines 33 and 34 and substitute the following:“(10) A national mitigation plan shall be approved by a resolution in both Houses of the Oireachtas as soon may be after it is approved by the Government.”.In this amendment Deputy Murphy proposed that the national mitigation plan would be approved not only by the Dáil but by the Seanad as well. I made the argument that we want the national mitigation plan to be front and centre of public debate. We want all the public representatives at national level to be part of the discussion to advance the campaign to deal with climate change, and therefore it is logical that the Seanad would be included in signing off on it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We had an earlier discussion in the context of another proposal. I think the Minister could deal with his concern by amending the legislation to the effect that there would be a legal requirement on the Dáil and on the Seanad to pass a plan. If there were binding targets and even if the Government were resisting them, it would have to have debate and vote on the nature of the plan. In the debate on the content and component elements of the plan Members will put forward different perspectives, so it makes sense that prior to the adoption of a plan it would be debated in both Houses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 23:In page 8, after line 38, to insert the following:
“Progress towards targets
5. (1) The Minister shall in each year, beginning with the year 2016, request the relevant body to prepare a report setting out that body’s views on—(a) progress towards achievement of—(i) annual targets,(ii) the interim target,(iii) the 2050 target,(b) whether the annual targets, the interim target or the 2050 target are likely to be achieved,(c) any further effort which may be necessary to achieve annual targets, the interim target or the 2050 target.(2) No later than the end of the second year following a year for which an annual target has been set (a “target year”), the Minister shall request the relevant body to prepare a report setting out that body’s views on—(a) whether the annual target for the target year was met,(b) whether the domestic effort target was met in that target year,(c) the ways in which those targets were or were not met,(d) the action taken by the Minister to reduce net emissions during that year.(3) The Minister shall lay a response to the relevant body’s report under this section before the Houses of the Oireachtas as soon as reasonably practicable after they receive that body’s report.”.The same arguments apply to this amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the number of the amendment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the number of the amendment again?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some of these amendments are mine, some are Deputy Wallace's and some are Deputy Murphy's. I will formally move it, though.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I see.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 25:In page 12, to delete lines 11 to 15 and substitute the following:“(2) There shall stand established, on the establishment day, a body which shall be known, in the Irish language, as An Chomhairle Chomhairleach um Athrú Aeráide or, in the English language, as the Climate Change Advisory Council (in this Act referred to as the “Advisory Council”) to perform the functions assigned to it under this Act.”.This amendment is about the independence of the expert advisory council and it is a matter of extreme importance. I am trying to keep track of these amendments. Which one are we on now?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I get it now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a change of name. It should be changed to the climate change advisory council for the purposes of clarity and simplicity and maybe because the word "expert" jars a little in these matters. Experts have led us into a great deal of trouble in the past. It is a very subjective notion in any event.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is saying he is open to the idea.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will withdraw the amendment for now in the hope the Minister might-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 28:In page 12, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following: “(3) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act or of any other enactment, the members of the Advisory Council shall be independent in the performance of their functions under this Act.”.I appreciate that the Minister has taken on board our concerns, but, to add to what has been said, there must be real independence in this regard. There cannot be insiders, although I know the people about whom the Minister is talking are of high calibre. I am simply saying a great deal of pressure could be put on a body such this as time rolls on. It is a big job. Therefore, guaranteeing its independence is of critical importance.However, I welcome the fact the Minister is looking at it but we need to get that right. I will withdraw the amendment and will await the Minister's amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 34: In page 17, line 26, to delete “Expert”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 35:In page 17, line 29, to delete “18 months” and substitute “6 months”.The expert advisory council is supposed to conduct a review every 18 months to monitor progress in meeting objectives and securing the transition to a low carbon economy. The amendment proposes that 18 months after its establishment is too long a period before that review would be conducted and it proposes that the period should be six months instead. Like many of the amendments we have proposed the issue is one of moving things along faster than is being proposed in the Government's legislation. The logic of the amendment is fairly self-evident.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When we were discussing the period during which the Government would produce the mitigation plan, the Minister acknowledged that two years was a little long, but he made the argument that a period of six months would not allow enough time and that perhaps we might meet somewhere in the middle. I acknowledge that there is a lot of work involved, but 18 months seems to be a long time. I, therefore, ask the Minister to at least consider reducing the time period for the reasons stated by Deputy Mick Wallace in order to impose urgency and discipline on us while being reasonable about what would be regarded as practical. Even a 12 month period, instead of the 18 months proposed, would indicate seriousness on the part of the Government in terms of the urgency of the matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 36:In page 18, to delete lines 7 to 10 and substitute the following:	"(i) progress towards achievement of-	(I) annual targets,	(II) the interim target,	(III) the 2050 target, (ii) whether the annual targets, the interim target or the 2050 target are likely to be achieved, (iii) any further effort which may be necessary to achieve annual targets, the interim target or the 2050 target.".This is related to the earlier discussion about targets because it would require that the expert advisory council in its reviews would look at the question of interim targets, the 2050 targets, and meeting them. Obviously if there are no targets the Government is unlikely to be disposed towards supporting this. We have made the case as to why we believe the targets are necessary so I will not go over that ground. Amendment No. 37 is not just about meeting the annual targets but is trying to break down the targets into different areas which we need to focus in on and report on the progress that is being made in those different sectors so we are not talking in general but looking in detail at what progress is being made in those different areas. The sectors are outlined in the amendment. I think they are very reasonable proposals. They also give the additional right to the advisory council to make recommendations in the areas where it feels we are not making sufficient progress.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 37:In page 19, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:	"(f) when providing advice under subsection (1)(a), the Advisory Council shall express a view as to-	(ii) the respective contributions towards meeting the annual targets that should be made by-(g) when providing advice under this subsection, the Advisory Council may also express a view as to any other matter that body considers appropriate including, in particular, as to any sectors of the economy in which there are particular opportunities for contributions to be made towards meeting 	annual targets through reductions in emissions of greenhouse gases, (h) when providing advice under this subsection, the Advisory Council shall also express a view as to the cumulative amount of net emissions for the period 2010-2015 that is consistent with a reduction over that period of net emissions accounts which would allow the 2050 target to be met.". 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 38:In page 19, to delete lines 10 to 12 and substitute the following:"(8) Not more than 10 days after submitting a periodic review report to the Minister in accordance with this section, the Advisory Council shall publish the report by such means as the Agency may advise.".This amendment is self-explanatory. A periodic review report should be published not more than ten days after it is given to the Minister. As a member of the Joint Committee on Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform, I am aware that the fiscal advisory council reports are published and are very useful documents in terms of breaking down all the different elements of the economy. I do not know whether it is required under the legislation to do that. Having something like that produced and a requirement that it be published within a specific timeframe is a very useful exercise in accountability. That is the logic of the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the council has already prepared its report and given it to the Minister what is the problem about publishing it? The reason I mentioned the fiscal advisory council is that it has those reports and they come before the finance committee two or three times a year. If the Minister has already got the report it is possible to publish it soon afterwards. I do not see where the difficulty is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 40:In page 21, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:
"Guidance to Advisory Council
15. (1) The Advisory Council shall have regard to any guidance given by the Minister to it in relation to the exercise of its functions under this Act.	 (2) The Minister may not give the Advisory Council guidance as to the content of any advice or report.	 (3) The power to guide guidance under subsection (1) includes power to vary or revoke the guidance.".This amendment is about the Government not influencing the advisory council and ensuring its complete independence. That is the thinking behind it. While the advisory council should have regard to guidance given by the Minister, the Minister may not give any advice as to the content of any report to ensure the report is a completely independent exercise and that there is no political interference in it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is great when the Government helps the Opposition be the Opposition.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is absolutely right. We should switch seats.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 41:In page 22, between lines 30 and 31, to insert the following:
“Reports on annual targets
16. (1) The Minister shall lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report in respect of each year in the period 2015-2050 for which an annual target has been set (a “target year”).(2) The report shall state whether the annual target for the target year has been met. If the annual target has not been met, the report shall explain the reason for same.(3) The report shall also state whether the domestic effort target has been met in the target year to which the report relates.(4) If the domestic effort target has not been met, the report shall explain the reason for same. The report shall also contain the information mentioned in section 17.(5) The report under this section shall be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas no later than 31 October in the second year after the target year.”.The amendment proposes that there should be a report every year on meeting targets. We are back again to the issue of targets and the Minister and Government have made clear their view that targets should not be included, so we are going over the same old ground. However, the question of this becoming a central part of political debate and something we are required to discuss in the Dáil is important. Given that the mitigation plan, for example, only has to be produced every five years, there is quite a big time gap in between. That will not allow for adequate debate and focus on this critical issue. The logic behind the amendment is that we should be required to debate it at least once a year, as the budget is.
