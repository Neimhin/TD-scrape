RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We also asked about a debate on the new regulations. They are linked to the testing and tracing regime because if that was what it should be, we might not be in the situation of having to impose harsh new restrictions. The need for debate on this is doubly the case because the Business Committee also signed off on the schedule for the Covid committee. The CMO, NPHET, the HSE and the Minister for Health were supposed to come before the Covid committee, all to deal with precisely these matters. Now none of them is to come, we discover from the Chair. The Minister, Deputy Donnelly, has said he will not come because apparently the new restrictions are not his responsibility, incredibly, but rather a whole-of-government issue and, therefore, he does not need to answer questions.The HSE is not coming in for reasons to do with the winter plan not being ready, although there are many other things we need to talk to it about, and the acting Chief Medical Officer and representatives of NPHET are not coming in. These are things that were agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is very relevant. The restrictions being brought in are having a huge impact, yet there will be no discussion in the D치il and now, even though it was scheduled, there will be no discussion of those matters in the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response. It is unacceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point is that the sessions that were due to go ahead and that we agreed to go ahead with-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----were going to compensate, to some degree, for the lack of debate-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----on the regulations and the plans and the associated implications. Now, however, with a few hours' notice, we have been told that is not happening. We do not, therefore, get a debate in the D치il and we do not get to scrutinise these incredibly important matters in the Covid-19 committee. I ask the Taoiseach to comment on the fact that part of the justification, incredibly, given by the Minister for Health is that he is not responsible for these new restrictions. That is an unbelievable statement from the Minister for Health.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I brought the attention of the D치il to this matter and it still does not answer the question as to why the Minister for Health could not come in. The issue is not about the winter planning, which is a separate matter. There was no specific item about them coming in to deal with the winter plan. This plan has now become the excuse not to discuss the restrictions. The Minister disowns the restrictions. I would like to know, incidentally, who is responsible for these new regulations, if it is not the Minister for Health, and it is extraordinary when he then runs away from engagement with the Covid-19 committee in order that we cannot ask about these things. He is running away. The excuse we have been given is that the witnesses can come in the week after to discuss the winter plan. We want them to discuss the regulations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not believe the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, is working in the front-line services.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach is threatening to unravel the sense of social solidarity that did exist and that underpins the compliance and cohesion we need to deal with Covid-19 because if people do not understand the logic and the rationale behind measures they will lose faith in the public health effort. The Taoiseach doubled down on that mistake by then cutting into the economic supports for people precisely at the time they need them most. In terms of co-operation with the Opposition, I will register again my frustration and anger at the precisely opposite move by the Government to relegate a number of the party groups in here in terms of the speaking order and the accountability of the Taoiseach's Government on key issues. Again last week, repeatedly, we had the insult of Ministers gone from the Chamber before many of the party groups here had a chance to-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know, and I will keep making it because it is an insult and it seriously undermines accountability in that Ministers are not actually here to be held account by all of the party groups. It is a studied insult and contempt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not. Since I have made the same points on the other issues, I will not labour them. When I came in here this morning, I had no intention of calling a vote until I heard from the Chairman of the Covid committee that the Minister for Health, representatives of the HSE, the Chief Medical Officer and representatives of NPHET were not coming in. Our spokespeople were prepared for those sessions. They believed they were incredibly important because of the questions being asked. If the Taoiseach believes it is grandstanding to respond to the confusion and questions he knows are being asked, he is being dishonest with the public. The matter has nothing to do with that; it is about the fact that people are confused. If the Taoiseach wants to co-operate with the Opposition and bring the public with him, I suggest he take a different approach. That also relates to the issue of speaking order, which I will keep raising because it does not denote a Government that wants to bring this House or the public with it. The Taoiseach should think again. His backbenchers are losing any advantage they gained from his manipulation of the speaking order because they are now losing time on the Order of Business. I would think about that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We must make clear to Boris Johnson that the peace and stability of this island comes ahead of his reckless, race-to-the-bottom agenda for Britain and for the particular business interests he represents. It is a recklessness that has again summoned up the spectre of a possible return to a hard border and breaks agreements, international treaties, protocols and so on that were designed to ensure there would be no possibility of a return to a hard border. We must make absolutely clear to Mr. Johnson and his gurus, such as Mr. Cummings, that despite all their manipulations and recklessness that is just not going to happen and we will do whatever is necessary to prevent a hard border. It summons up in a serious way the need to start talking about a possible border poll. It is also clear and important that we send a message to the European Union that if things go badly and we face the possibility of a hard Brexit as a result of Boris Johnson's recklessness, we will not be used as a political pawn in the battle between the European Union and Mr. Johnson. We will not accept any diktat from Europe about protecting its market if that means the resurrection of the possibility of a hard border. Peace and stability on this island is more important than Johnson's dangerous agenda and it is more important than any market.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Unless the Taoiseach reinstates the eviction ban, he will be throwing thousands of renters to the wolves in the worst of all possible circumstances. We opposed the Government's decision to lift the eviction ban, which had been very successful, as we said it would be, in reducing the numbers going into homelessness. In removing that ban, the Taoiseach betrayed his previous support for the anti-evictions Bill my colleagues and I introduced in the last D치il and, in so doing, performed one of the first U-turns of this Government. Whatever about all that, in the current circumstances, where people's pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, is being cut, new restrictions are being imposed and fewer people are going to have the income necessary to pay rents, the possibility of people being made homeless is simply unacceptable. It is totally incompatible with protecting public health in the context of Covid-19. The Taoiseach must reinstate the eviction ban. Anything else would be utterly irresponsible and unjust.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach's decision to press ahead with the cuts to the PUP are a disgraceful and dangerous betrayal of thousands of working people who have lost jobs and incomes because of Government measures. The people who have been hit hardest by the pandemic are now being kicked while they are down. This is grossly unjust and a serious danger to the collective social solidarity that is absolutely critical to defeating Covid-19. If the Government loses the faith of the people and punishes those who have lost their jobs and income as a result of its restrictions, it will lose the dressing room. People will lose faith in the public health effort and it will unravel. It is grossly economically and financially unfair to those who lose their jobs and it threatens the public health effort. Does the Taoiseach not see this? Does he not see that the new restrictions with rising infection rates will mean more people are going to lose their jobs, some for the second time, and others will have no prospect of a return to their jobs? To cut their income is a knife in the back. Does the Taoiseach not see this?
