RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank all of the contributors. There is so much to think about and we are covering so much ground that it makes the head spin. The idea of targeted measures is a mantra that has been trotted out but we need to spell out what it means. I would not mind hearing a little more on what the witnesses think it means. If targeted measures were to mean, for example, having lots of means-tested payments and a massive administration deciding thresholds and who is entitled to this or that, it would not be a good way to do things. Is that what we mean? Do targeted measures mean we should not give loads more money to corporations that are making super-profits? The interesting thing about this crisis, which is inflicting huge misery on ordinary families who are facing bills and rents they cannot pay, is that some people are doing well and the economy is doing well. The reason corporate tax receipts are up is that corporate profits are at record levels. Some people are, therefore, doing very well. If targeted measures mean that we should not give further handouts to already super-profitable companies and already super-rich people, I am all for targeted measures. However, if it means that ordinary working people who, if we take all of the cost-of-living increases we have seen over the past year or two, are probably €4,000 or €5,000 less well off than they were a year ago in real terms just have to suck it up, then I am not for targeted measures because that would be unfair. It would also be economically and environmentally damaging.As somebody said to me in the corridor today, when the demand for solid fuel wood is going up, we are not very far away from people chopping down trees - this is not a joke - to get fuel for their homes, which is not very good for the environment. That is where things are going if people cannot afford to heat their homes. What do we mean by targeted? I believe that as a minimum in this budget, pensioners and people on social welfare have to get increases up to the level of inflation, that is, of around 10%. Anything less will be unconscionable because in other words, we would be saying they are going to be poorer this year through no fault of their own and that when the economy is growing and super profits are being made, they must accept they must be poorer. That is not acceptable. I want to understand what the council means by "targeted". Is it saying those sorts of people - pensioners, students and ordinary workers - will just have to soak it up to some degree or by "targeted", does it mean we should not give handouts to those who are super-profitable or super-rich? Unless we start to define what we mean by "targeted", we are talking nonsense. Regarding what we do with the bonanza corporate tax revenues, again, I want to understand exactly what the council is saying. If we say we are vulnerable in that regard because we are dependent on a small number of companies, as I agree we are, we are, however, facing an emergency, so it seems to me that we must use that revenue to address the emergency and protect people and get us from an unsustainable situation to a sustainable one, including in the medium term, as Professor McMahon was referring to, to have a sustainable economic plan. Is there anything wrong with saying we should be investing in areas that will help people now but also make us sustainable in the medium to long term? Housing is an obvious one. The current housing crisis is draining current Government revenue to a massive degree - by about €1 billion per year. Putting more money into building direct public and affordable housing would both help address an immediate crisis and make public finances more sustainable in the medium to long term. That is just one example. Given that we have labour and skills shortages all over the place, if we removed obstacles to people getting into further and higher education, that would be good now and in the medium to long term. If we invested in a sustainable form of forestry, that would create employment, help shore up the rural economy in a difficult situation and be a good long-term investment from an environmental point of view. Those are just three examples. If we made public transport free, it would be a cost-of-living measure that would help now and would also move us in a positive direction from an environmental point of view and build up our infrastructure. Could Mr. Barnes comment on that? Is this a reasonable perspective?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I ask one brief additional question? If we were strictly following the original rules around fiscal space and all the rest of it, how much fiscal space would be available in this budget?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would it be fair to say the space would be a lot larger than our guests are allowing for in terms of expenditure?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The cost-of-living crisis is the big issue facing us all. IBEC has referred to some businesses that are in trouble and has stated that without support, they could go to the wall. Dr. McDonnell from the Nevin Economic Research Institute is talking about the need for targeted measures for those who are most adversely impacted by the cost-of-living crisis. I think we should always refer to the cost-of-living and housing crisis, frankly, because the two crises are running directly in parallel and are dire in both cases. First, is it fair comment to state there are winners and losers in this situation? I seek the witnesses' opinion on that. We just have had the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and the ESRI before the committee and among other things, they reported on how corporate tax revenues - even I was stunned by this and I am aware of how profits have gone up in the corporate sector - have trebled over the past decade. I think it was IFAC that projected that corporate tax receipts for this year could be €20 billion. Therefore, somebody is making money. It is obviously not the IBEC members who are saying they could go to the wall but obviously somebody is making money out of all of this. We certainly know the energy companies are making a lot of money at the moment and some big corporations are making a lot of money. I suspect the pharmaceutical industry is making a lot of money. Some of those who are involved in property speculation and so on have to be making a lot of money. Is it fair to say there are some big winners out of all of this and then there are many people who are losers? How then do we address that? I do not think we should be giving hand-outs to super-profitable companies, for example, or to super-wealthy people. They do not need them and are potentially benefiting from the current situation. Equally, when we get onto the issue of targeting support, to use the much-used phrase and to which Dr. McDonnell and the Nevin Economic Research Institute have referred, where is the threshold? People are a little reluctant to say this. I asked IFAC this question. Where do we begin and end with targeting?I ask because sometimes it comes across as saying, "Well, we will help the absolute poorest", and we absolutely have to. It is vitally important that people who are already poor are not further impoverished or that more people are not driven into poverty. There is also a whole range of people - working people - who are taking a very severe hit. They may not be quite driven into poverty but they are seriously struggling. It is completely unjust if one takes as a reasonable estimate that they could be down €3,000, €4,000 or €5,000, in terms of the real value of their income, so they need help. Where is the threshold for targeted measures? I am interested in hearing how that can be done because, as policymakers, those are the decisions we have to make and sometimes the economists are a little bit reluctant. They say, "That is up to you guys". Those are the decisions we have to make. Should we be talking about redirecting or redistributing from the winners to the people who are losing in all of this? In broad terms, is that not the way to address the current crisis? If energy companies make super profits through nothing particular that they have done, some of those profits should be redirected to protecting those who are suffering as a result of this crisis, whether it is small business, working people, pensioners or whatever. I would like to hear the comments of the witnesses on that matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it the case that even before this crisis hit, the cost of living here in a number of areas mentioned was much higher than in the rest of Europe? I refer to childcare, housing, education and in a number of other areas, and that was pre-Ukraine and pre- the current round of the cost-of-living crisis. Why is that the case? Why do we have higher childcare costs than everywhere else? Why do we have higher rents and house prices? Why do we have the highest education fees compared to anywhere?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, unless the Chair is giving me more time.
