RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us talk about bin charges.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The witnesses are the good guys and they are pointing in the right direction in terms of what we need to do.  They are right in asking do we want to have an American-style tax structure or a European-style structure and the services that go with it.  It seems we want Berlin services with Boston taxes but I do not believe that works.  The witnesses are right in what they said and the points about debt sustainability and the need for investment are critical.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to set the scene for the points with which I disagree.  On the pensions issue, the witnesses have hit on something important.  They are right that 80% of the benefit going to 20% of the people is problematic and we need to deal with that but why would they not go a little further?  Some €2.5 billion is given in tax reliefs and most of that goes to the top 20%.  Why would they not go considerably further and argue - I think Vincent Browne argued this point a while ago - for eliminating almost all of that relief and have universal provision of the non-contributory pension at double its current level?  We could afford that if most of those reliefs were eliminated and the private pension system was phased out.  Why would the witnesses not take that more radical route?  On the property tax issue, the witnesses should rethink what they have proposed because they are the good guys but I believe they have got it totally wrong on this issue.  The rate they propose of 0.35% would amount to a property tax of €700 a year on a house valued at €200,000.  People who are not rich live in many areas Dublin where properties have high values and under that scenario they would have to pay €1,000 in property tax alone.  It is of no consolation that the payment of that tax would be deferred until further down the road and people would be accumulating debts.  That is an awful scenario.  The witnesses should rethink this proposal.  Some 70% or 80% of people own their own homes.  There is nothing wrong with that and the family home should not be considered as a form of wealth in the same sense as commodities and financial investments.  The witnesses' position reminds me of the joke about anarchists: Why do anarchists drink green tea?  They drink it because proper tea is theft.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of clarification regarding council houses, I am not clear on this in the context of the witness's position.  Is he suggesting-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was not made clear.  It is a serious question.  Mr. McDonnell said certain groups would be excluded but not all council houses.  He might clarify that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Including council houses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are all socialists now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How long do I have Chairman?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I address my questions to IBEC, the Irish Business and Employers Confederation, which talks about the need to stimulate the economy, with which I agree.  Will IBEC respond to me on the reasons the economy has collapsed?  What is the problem?  What has happened to our economy that there is no investment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a very interesting response, but I completely disagree with Mr. O'Brien.  His analysis is that the major reason is that the banks are not lending.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it because people are saving?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not agree with that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The witnesses talked about the need for stimulus.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why are the members of IBEC not investing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.  I will pass over because we have no time for a discussion on it but I fundamentally disagree with the points made by Mr. O'Brien.  I will address the question on the property tax to each of the witnesses.  Is there not a recognition on the part of all of the delegates that they accept this proposal?  I find it surprising that the unions would accept it rather than actively campaigning against it.  Significant numbers of union members will not be able to pay it.  I do not understand the reason.  The wealth tax has been mentioned, with which I agree.  There is a bit of a slippage between property and wealth tax.  Surely we on the left should be advocating for a wealth tax, which would include property over a certain value, but not the family home, and opt for a higher wealth tax and higher income taxes on people at the top level?  Why is the union making a concession on a tax that will be imposed on union members and will impose a very significant extra financial burden on them and is without question going to have a further dampening effect on the domestic economy, which IBEC should be concerned about?  If the figures for the property tax we are talking about are implemented - ranging from €400, €500, €600 and €700 a year on ordinary low and middle income households - it will have a crushing effect on demand in the economy
