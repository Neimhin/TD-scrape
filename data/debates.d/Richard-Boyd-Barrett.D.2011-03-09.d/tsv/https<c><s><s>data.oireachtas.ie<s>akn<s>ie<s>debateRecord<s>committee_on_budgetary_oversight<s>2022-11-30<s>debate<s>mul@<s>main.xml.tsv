RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, IFAC, for its contribution and reports, which are always interesting and informative. I would like to follow on from the last point because it seems to me that some to degree, all roads lead to the housing problem in this country. The witnesses mentioned the need to plan staffing for the health service, I could say the same about education and a number of other areas and it is often that very cohort of people, who have recently trained or qualified in these fields, who are the cohort I suspect are leaving this country at the moment, that is, the younger ones, precisely because it is too expensive to live here. They go to Australia or Canada or wherever, where accommodation is cheaper. We are facing a huge social crisis and it is causing a lot of suffering but it is a win-win if we solve it. One thing strikes me, although maybe the witnesses think it is simplistic. I get that their basic point is if we keep core spending at a level that does not contribute to inflation, that is okay. One-off measures to mitigate the impact on the vulnerable are fine so they are happy enough with that but do not increase core spending to a level that could potentially lead to inflation. Maybe I have not thought it all through but certainly something we have argued is that it would be a good use of the windfall revenues the State has at its disposal to massively increase its stock of housing. It could do so both through construction and through direct purchase of stock, because every single addition to the State's housing stock in terms of public housing or cost-rental affordable housing also reduces current expenditure on the other side. The State gets an asset which is revenue-generating and it reduces proportionately the amount of money it has to fork out each year in current expenditure for the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, housing assistance payment, HAP, and leasing arrangements. It also means the State will have a bit more control over the cost of housing. In other words, it can make more cheap housing available, which obviously benefits the groups we have just talked about, who might not leave if they have affordable housing here. Would that be a reasonable way to spend the windfall revenues? It would be much more ambitious, far-reaching expenditure in the here and now to dramatically expand the public housing stock through construction and through the purchase of stock particularly where there is a lot of talk about landlords exiting the market. The point I am making is that if the landlords decide they want to exit for whatever reason, the property does not have to exit if the State purchases it.From a fiscal point of view, would that be a prudent use of windfall revenues that are available that would not contribute to the concerns the council has about inflation, increasing indebtedness or whatever? It would actually help reduce those things because we would be less reliant on current expenditure to make up for the shortfall we have in public housing. Obviously, the members of the council do not have to endorse my policy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Unlike Deputy O'Donnell, I am not asking the council to proactively support the expenditure of windfall revenues on those things. I asked the question in order to find out whether the council members object to or thought it was fiscally reckless, as against their thinking it reckless to dramatically increase core expenditure we do not have the revenues to cover because some of those windfall revenues may not be reliable in the future. That is the council's essential argument, is it not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Logically, therefore, if some of the other problems we have in that regard relate to energy and timber costs, as we have discovered, then investment in trees might not be a bad idea either.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but it is okay in principle so long as the ongoing costs are not increasing, and they could potentially decrease. Another thing suggested to us as a simple measure, which would be one-off and could be done quite cheaply, is to insulate for free everybody's attics. It would be basic insulation. A major amount of energy is being lost just through people's roofs. We do not have to do deep retrofits to make a very big impact but we would dramatically reduce both people's bills and the overall use of energy. That would be quite cheap, relatively speaking, to do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. Mr. Barnes was saying we should not get into a wage-price spiral and to be careful about raising incomes to match inflation because then we could potentially be locking in expenditure that will fuel inflation and some of the price increases may be temporary and things come back down and so and so forth. Are council members worried about the other scenario, which is that if inflation stays at the sort of levels it is at now or even worsens, if it is greater than any compensatory measures like increases in income the Government provides through increases in wages, social welfare payments, pensions or whatever, that creates a danger of recession? Is that not equally problematic? Mr. Barnes indicated that he is slightly worried about consumer demand and so on. Is that not an equally big danger? Next year, as he acknowledged, people's incomes are going to be less in real terms. They are going to be losing out and surely that will have a knock-on impact on demand, that is, the amount of spending in the economy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It could potentially offer an opportunity to redistribute a little as well, could it not? One of the facts, surprisingly, that people are acknowledging now is that excess profits are being made in certain sectors of the economy, whereas other people are losing out because of rising energy costs. The latter is benefiting energy companies. It is now broadly accepted as an idea that we might even consider the wild left-wing idea of putting more taxes on the profits of these corporations to channel it back to those who are losing out. Such policies would not be fiscally irresponsible in the current situation. One might argue that guaranteeing that those who are less well-off on low and modest incomes do not see losses in real income is money well spent because, by and large, it goes back into the economy whereas excess super profits or a big growth in savings or wealth for the very, very rich do not necessarily feed back into the economy. Is that a reasonable proposition?
