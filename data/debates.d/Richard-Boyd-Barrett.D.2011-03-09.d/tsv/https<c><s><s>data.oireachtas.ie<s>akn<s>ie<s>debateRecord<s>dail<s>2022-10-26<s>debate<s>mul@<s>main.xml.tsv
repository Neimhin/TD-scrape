RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move:That Dáil Éireann:notes that:— Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland is failing to meet its hopelessly inadequate targets to increase the supply of social and affordable housing;— according to the Parliamentary Budget Office, the most accurate estimate for households with a housing need may be close to 122,000, when you include those on the waiting list and in receipt of the Housing Assistance Payment (HAP), the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS) and other housing support payments;— of the 4,100 affordable and Cost Rental homes promised for 2022, only 325 affordable and 234 Cost Rental homes have been delivered to end of Q2 2022;— of the 9,000 social homes promised for 2022, only 1,500 have been delivered at the midpoint in 2022;— homelessness figures have risen in the last year from 8,475 to a record 10,805 people in August, including 3,220 children;— according to the Government, 2,273 households could have faced eviction over the winter, but that could have been higher if we take into account those who received a termination of tenancy date that was prior to the emergency period as set out in the Residential Tenancies (Deferment of Termination Dates of Certain Tenancies) Bill 2022; and— according to the Economic and Social Research Institute, the proportion of households eligible for social housing or social housing supports, such as HAP, RAS and leasing, fell from 46.8 per cent in 2011 to 33.9 per cent by 2019, and this has undoubtedly fallen further over the last two years because of the failure of the Government to raise social housing income thresholds;further notes that:— the Government has committed to introducing an eviction ban from November 2022 to the end of March 2023;— many tenants who receive Notices of Termination on grounds of sale are in HAP, RAS or Rent Supplement properties, where the State is already paying the majority of the rent;— many others who receive Notices of Termination have incomes above the income thresholds for social housing or social housing supports, but are unable to find affordable rental properties or property to purchase;— according to Census 2022, there are 166,752 vacant homes, excluding holiday homes, across the State, of which 48,387 have been vacant for at least six years;— there are also an estimated 22,000 derelict sites across the State; and— sites with full planning permission for 80,000 homes are being held by developers and investors that are not being built on, and delivery of private housing is falling short of targets; andcalls on the Government to:— use the period of the five-month ban on evictions to pursue, by all means at its disposal, an increase in the provision of social and affordable homes, above the targets set by Housing for All - a New Housing Plan for Ireland;— introduce a "Use it or Lose it" scheme, whereby vacant and derelict properties and sites that are not activated within six months without reasonable excuse are acquired by the State, if necessary, by means of a compulsory purchase order, and such acquired properties and sites will be developed and made available for social and affordable housing;— ensure local authorities acquire HAP, RAS, Rent Supplement properties and other rental properties where the tenants are in receipt of a no-fault Notices of Termination on grounds of sale and where that acquisition would secure that home for the tenants;— ensure that local authorities embark on a pro-active programme of acquiring rental and developer properties that would be suitable for social and affordable housing, above the current Part V requirement;— increase income thresholds to ensure all households unable to afford private market rents and house prices are eligible for State housing supports;— impose tax measures to ensure that developers and corporate landlords do not profit from the foregoing acquisition programme; and— establish a State construction company and, in coordination with local authorities, speedily progress public housing projects, retrofitting and maintenance of public housing, thereby eliminating the long delays that arise from tendering and outsourcing processes, and the risk of public housing projects stalling or collapsing due to withdrawal or non-delivery of contractors or developers.I cannot believe that the senior Minister is not present for the debate on this motion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is just unbelievable. We are facing an unprecedented housing, homelessness, and accommodation crisis. Hundreds of thousands of people have been let down by the Government not providing the most basic thing, namely, a secure, affordable roof over the heads of individuals, families, and children. There are 122,000 households on the various housing lists. Almost 11,000 families, including 3,000 children, are in homeless accommodation. Thousands of Ukrainians, who have fled war and conflict and are in desperate situations, are being failed by the State and the Government not providing a basic thing, which is to have a roof over their heads. The motion points out that the answer to this crisis is staring us in the face. According to the census, there are 160,000 vacant properties in this country, 48,000 of which had been empty for the six years since the previous census. In addition, although we do not do a proper count of derelict properties, it is estimated that there are at least 20,000 derelict properties. The answer to the housing crisis, to the homelessness misery, and to the desperate situation of Ukrainians who need and deserve our assistance, is staring us in the face. It is for the State and the Government to take the necessary action to bring derelict properties into use to house all those who need a secure, affordable roof over their heads. We are proposing a number of measures that could begin to address the crisis because we do not want to just give out about the situation. The central solution, which we have not even included in the motion because we have put it out there so many times, as have others, is for the Government to dramatically ramp up construction of its own public and affordable housing on the abundant public land that is out there. To understand the scale of the Government's failure in this regard, I refer to my area, which is one of the areas worst affected by the housing crisis. Even if the targets are met in the Dún Laoghaire area, when the Housing for All plan concludes in 2026, more people being on the housing waiting list than there are now. That is how inadequate the plan is. As our motion sets out, the Government is failing spectacularly to meet its own targets for the delivery of social and affordable housing. The Government's target for 2022 is 9,000 social homes, but it had delivered only 1,500 halfway through the year. The Government promised 4,100 affordable and cost rental homes, but it has only delivered 325 affordable homes and 234 cost-rental homes halfway through the year. These are hopelessly inadequate targets. The ability of the Government to implement even its own targets is hopelessly inadequate. We acknowledge that, albeit belatedly and under massive pressure from the Opposition and as a result of the public outcry, the Government finally brought in an eviction ban. If you want to address an unprecedented homelessness crisis, the obvious thing to do is to prevent further people from being driven into homelessness, which the Government has allowed to happen on a spectacular level over recent years. In just one year, the number of people in homeless accommodation went from 8,400 to 10,800 because the Government allowed people to be evicted into homelessness. Looking at the situation in Tathony House, Dublin 8, you get an idea of the motivations behind people being driven into homelessness. The owner of the 35 properties is estimated to be making an income of €700,000 per year and is claiming financial hardship as a justification for evicting 35 households. That is absolutely disgusting. Even the eviction ban the Government brought in has a loophole such that any tenant who got a termination date before the introduction of the legislation could be evicted in the coming months, in the depths of winter, which is something the Government had better amend in the legislation that will come before the House this afternoon. I refer to immediate solutions. If we have 166,000 empty properties, of which 48,000 have been empty for six years, and 20,000 derelict properties, the answer is simply for the Government to take those properties under its control, refurbish them and use the necessary construction capacity to make them available as social and affordable housing. However, the Government refuses to do that. For four years, I have been pointing to an example of that in my area. Some 17 apartments at St. Helen's Court have been empty for two to three years and the landlord - a vulture fund - has been trying to evict the rest of the tenants for a number of years. The Government will still not take control of those properties. We maintain that there should be a use-it-or-lose-it provision. If a property is vacant for more than six months without good reason, the State should acquire it, by means of compulsory purchase order if necessary, in order to deliver social and affordable housing. Similarly, there are 80,000 sites with planning permission. In many cases, however, developers are sitting on those sites, drip-feeding housing and watching the value of their properties go up. In fact, the worse the housing crisis gets, the more money they make from the value of their properties. Such sites with planning permission should be taken over by the State in order to deliver social and affordable housing,. The Government should create a State construction company in order that we are not dependent on private developers to do it. We should do it directly ourselves.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank all those who contributed to this discussion. I am not going to get into the war of statistics that these debates often descend into although I am not saying statistics are unimportant. The Minister has to start with acknowledging the truth. When the Government says the number on housing lists has falling it is a misrepresentation of the reality. According to the Parliamentary Budget Office there are actually 122,000 households, if we take waiting lists where people are on HAP, RAS and leasing arrangements, that are not secure tenancies. The reduction in the numbers on the housing list is overwhelmingly because the Government failed to raise the income thresholds. People are taken off the list not because they no longer have a housing need, no longer need social housing support or are no longer in a position where they cannot pay the rents out there or afford the housing prices, but because their income goes slightly over the threshold. They are off the list, it makes the statistics look better and leaves their situation exactly the same. In fact, it makes their situation worse. I referred to the woman who, with her teenage son, has been in one bedroom in emergency accommodation for four years and is not even entitled to HAP support, never mind a council house, because she is over the threshold. There has been a deliberate policy of not raising those thresholds. I read it in the Government report. In fact, it was Byron Warren, a transition-year student who is in my office this week, who read the review the Government got last November and pointed out that people in Dublin are paying 60% of their income in rent. Huge numbers of those people are not entitled to any financial support whatsoever, whether HAP or social housing. Many of them have been cut off the list because the Government refused to raise the income threshold. At a time when more households than ever need social housing and social housing support, the proportion of people entitled to that support has been slashed from 48% to about 30%. That is the reality of the situation. The long-term solution is for us to build, on scale, public and affordable housing. We need at least 20,000 public and affordable houses a year. Setting that aside, there is stuff the Government could do now. The reason it does not do it goes back to the point made by Deputy Gino Kenny and others. We need to get something into our heads regarding the housing misery facing hundreds of thousands of families on housing waiting lists, unable to afford rents and so on, and now the desperate people fleeing from Ukraine. That misery is benefiting a certain group of people. In fact, the worse the crisis gets, the more valuable is the rental property of those who own it and the more valuable the lands of those who have planning permission but are sitting on that land. There are 80,000 such planning permissions and their value is clocking up the worse the housing crisis gets. That is the elephant in the room when it comes to the housing crisis. Unless we break our reliance on people who are profiting from the housing crisis, that is, the vulture funds, investors, speculators and property developers, we are not going to solve this crisis. Indeed, there are worrying indications that private builders are starting to slow down their delivery because they do not see it as profitable for them. Setting aside the bigger ideological debate, we propose some immediate solutions to this problem. First, it should be a case of use it or lose it. If you have a vacant property - there are 48,000 such that have been vacant since the last census and 160,000 in total - you should have six months to use it or, if there is no good reason for not doing so, you will lose it. Of course, there are good reasons in some cases but we must have a proactive policy of saying that if a property is vacant for six months or more, it will be taken over by the State and used to provide social and affordable housing if there is no good reason for not doing so. We need teams of people in every local authority who will go out and pursue those properties and ensure they are brought into use. We must rebuild the State's construction capacity. The Taoiseach is correct that we cannot rebuild it overnight, but he can stop the situation whereby property is being actively run down. The State and local authorities must start to take on apprentices again and begin to rebuild our direct construction capacity in order that we are not dependent on contractors and developers who, in many cases, are doing what was done in the case of the co-operative housing in Loughlinstown, of which the Taoiseach may be aware, whereby 45 properties are now frozen because the contractor pulled out. We need our own construction capacity to deal with that situation. In any situation, whether people are on HAP or RAS, leasing or, as in Tathony House in Dublin 8, where some of the people are over the threshold and are not getting RAS, HAP or leasing support, where a landlord is selling just to benefit from the high prices that can be commanded at the moment, the State must step in and buy the property. That is not happening and all sorts of excuses are being put up for why that is. St. Helen's Court still has not got over the line. There are 17 empty properties sitting there for three years when people, including children, are in homeless accommodation and so on. Then we come to income thresholds.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Government admit the truth about those who need housing support and raise the thresholds to ensure they are entitled to that support?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There has been a lot of criticism about the state of O'Connell Street. It is a complex problem but it is mostly emblematic of a failure of Government policy on multiple fronts. I want to make a very simple point when people give out about activities that are going on on O'Connell Street. There used to be three supervised public toilets in the O'Connell Street vicinity. Now there is none. Particularly for people who are homeless, as a result of another failure of the State, there is nowhere to go to the bathroom. It is a basic thing. During Covid we managed to introduce supervised public toilets throughout the city. As soon as Covid was gone they were taken away. That is not just true in O'Connell Street but it is true in my area and many other areas. We showed we could have supervised public toilets and it was good and beneficial, but we removed them immediately. Many of the public toilets near O'Connell Street are still there. They are just gated up because we do not put the resources into providing them. That is a basic elementary thing that we could do as well as the supervised injection centres. There are solutions that could make an immediate impact. Rather than demonising people or somehow giving the idea that O'Connell Street is a no-go area there are basic things that could be done by the local authority and the Government that would make a significant impact as well as improving the lot of people on O'Connell Street.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A few supervised public toilets would be good, though.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not if they are supervised.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not Hammerson.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not the problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach mentioned investment in culture and arts in the shared island programme. I draw his attention to something that was raised in testimony at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight about the Irish film industry by both Equity, which represents artists and performers, and representatives of crew, the people who work behind the camera, if you like. Both of them were testifying to the fact that, even though we have a lot of State money going into the live action film area, the contracts that performers here get are grossly inferior to those in the UK or in the North in terms of their access to royalties for the future use of their performances and their general pay and conditions. That is also true for crew. As I stated to the Taoiseach many times, we must ensure the public investment in this country to develop the film industry is closely tied to decent conditions for performers and crew.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For months and months, the taxi representative groups such as Tiománaí Tacsaí na hÉireann, the Taxi Alliance, the National Private Hire & Taxi Association, NPHTA, and the Irish Taxi Drivers Federation have been asking the Government to extend the arbitrary ten-year rule on vehicle licensing for taxi drivers to 15 years. A public consultation concluded on 12 October and the views of taxi drivers on this are beyond doubt. They want the extension from ten to 15 years for taxi drivers. Currently, they have to get rid of their vehicle after ten years. Virtually no electric vehicles are available and taxi drivers took a massive financial hit earlier during Covid. Six hundred drivers in January and February are going to have to leave the industry or get finance for a new vehicle they cannot really afford. They are asking that the results of that public consultation on the Government decision to give them the five-year extension on the vehicle licensing rule be announced now. They have been hearing it is not going to be until 18 November. These 600 drivers need to know now whether the Government is going to extend the ten-year rule, which is a ridiculous rule anyway. If a car passes the national car test, NCT, it is fit for the road, so why on earth do these people have to jump over an extra hurdle at a time when we need taxi drivers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If a vehicle passes the NCT, it passes the NCT.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government has been forced to introduce an eviction ban. Over the past four years, People Before Profit has brought in four different Bills proposing eviction bans. The Government has argued against them. It has dragged its heels and resisted. It put up every argument as to why it could not happen and why it was problematic constitutionally, but when sufficient pressure came on, it was forced to introduce it, but, as Deputy Murphy said, in the most minimalist fashion possible. One of the groups that will suffer as a result of the minimalist approach taken by the Government are people who have already received and past their termination date. Deputy Murphy gave one example and I will give another: a couple and their two children, whose termination date was last Friday week from a home the parents have lived in since they were born in the 1950s. The landlord has multiple properties. They are not suffering any financial hardship. One can only speculate as to why they are selling but I think it is fair to say that, given the number of landlords who are selling up and evicting people consequently, that it has something to do with the extortionately high level of house prices at the moment. Landlords are cashing in and they are doing that precisely on the Government's failure to deal with the housing crisis. Why do property prices go up? They go up because there is a shortage of housing. The worse the housing crisis gets, the more the property of landlords and large property owners is worth. That is the way it works. The more they can charge in rent, the higher the price they can command when they sell. When they think it has reached the peak, they sell and they do not care about the human wreckage they leave behind, in this case by evicting a working family with two children where the parents in this family have lived in the house since the 1950s, because they are cashing in and that is allowed. I pointed this out here last week. I was the first person in the Dáil to point out that the Government's eviction ban did not protect them. There was not a word in response to that from the Government. Even though it was flagged on several occasions, there was nothing in the Minister of State’s speech to explain why that gap has been left. There is simply no justification. Worse again, what will every single local authority housing section I know of tell anyone who is facing an eviction and has passed their termination date, given the authorities have virtually no emergency accommodation, if they have any at all, and no social housing to offer most of the people in that situation, and there is virtually no affordable housing? What does the State tell people to do in that situation? It tells them to overhold. It is an unspoken but all-pervasive policy. It is not just Deputy Murphy, I and other Deputies who tell people in these situations they have no choice and they will have to overhold but local authority housing departments are also telling them they have to overhold because those departments have nothing for them. However, the Government is not going to protect those people with this Bill. How can the Minister of State justify that? I just do not understand. We have tabled an amendment on this but, of course, the Government has guillotined the debate tonight so we probably will not reach it. In any event, our amendment was ruled out of order on the basis it represents a charge on the Exchequer to extend the eviction ban to those who have already passed the termination date. I was scratching my head when I heard that one. How is that a charge on the Exchequer? That was done during the Covid eviction ban which the Government was also forced into introducing after weeks and weeks of pressure. How is that a charge on the Exchequer? I would really like somebody to explain that to me. Therefore we cannot debate that amendment and vote on it tonight although we probably would never reach it because the Government has guillotined Committee Stage to 60 minutes. Families are terrified and have nowhere to go. They are all searching daft.ie, myhome.ie, ringing up the place finder section, which is in an equally despairing and hopeless situation, looking for rental properties, and there is no emergency accommodation available for them, but we are not going to protect them. It is flipping outrageous. The duration of the ban is also outrageous, given the situation. It will end at the end of March. Some of the protections may last until the summer but then we will have thousands of people facing eviction again. It has to be extended for a year at least, as again we are proposing in an amendment. Frankly, it should be extended for the duration of the emergency. The Dáil officially declared a housing emergency in 2018. Again, it was forced to do that because of the Raise the Roof protest when there were 10,000 people out on the streets. People Before Profit put forward a motion on behalf of the Raise the Roof campaign. Finally, after denying it for about five years, the Government conceded there was a housing emergency. If there is a housing emergency, there is no question that we are constitutionally protected in taking emergency measures. I do not buy for one minute the legal arguments the Government used to try to justify not doing that. We have done it before when the Government said we could not, and we are doing it again now. There is an emergency, declared by this House, and that gives the Government the legal constitutional basis on which to protect people from being driven into homelessness. Most disgustingly, every single child who is made homeless is going to be marked for life. The Government is lucky that in the case of the family I mentioned, they do not want to talk to the media because the parents are terrified their children will be humiliated in school. That is the situation of so many of these families and that is the situation the Government is putting them in. The mental health of children is being put on the rack because they are facing the humiliation of being made homeless. There should be absolute protection against that and it should last until we provide them with alternative, affordable and secure accommodation. Could we do that in the period of the duration of this eviction Bill? Not on the current policy trajectory of the Government, but would it be possible to make a significant impact over the duration of this eviction ban Bill? It would if the Government were willing to do certain things. First is that it would actually do something about vacant and derelict properties. For example, in my area, there is a building called Kelly’s Hotel. It is owned by the council. It has been empty for around 20 years. I do not know how many times I have brought it up in this Chamber or with the council. At one stage the council wanted to sell it. We kicked up enough of a fuss to stop that. Now it is just sitting there empty. It is perfectly suitable to house people in. Nothing happens. It just sits there. There are Ukrainian refugees desperate for accommodation. There are people 20 years on the housing list. There is no homeless accommodation available in the area. Kids and families are sent into hostels in town when they are going to school in Ballybrack, Sallynoggin or Shankill. It is flipping outrageous that the State itself is sitting on empty properties. I will mention Tathony House again because if the Government does not do something about that, then the same thing will happen there as happened in St. Helen’s Court. Landlords try to get around the Tyrrelstown amendment, but even if the RTB asserts they cannot do that, the tenants themselves are so stressed that they start to leave. They will be forced out because of the pressure, anxiety and stress. That landlord, with a €700,000 a year rent roll, is claiming he has the right to evict people on the grounds of financial hardship.Can you believe it? Can you believe the venality and greed of a landlord who would do that to people? Some of the tenants will leave and then the properties will be vacant. Then the landlord can do exactly what a vulture fund does. I refer to an Irish vulture fund. The landlord of Tathony House is an Irish landlord evicting people, one of our so-called own. When tenants leave, a landlord can sit on empty properties, as was done in the case of St Helen's Court for three years. There are 17 empty properties, and the State allows it to happen. It does not take them over. The Government currently gets 10% of most new private developments. It is a pathetic figure considering that house and rent prices are such that about 70% to 80% of people in the Dublin area could not afford them. The State is getting only 10% of new builds. All the rest will be rented or sold at prices that ordinary working people could not possibly afford. Why do we allow that to happen? Most of the developments in question are on sites that were previously in the ownership of NAMA and that the developers bought from that agency at a major discount. Often they make massive capital gains out of selling these properties. They do not even pay capital gains tax on them in many cases because of the tax loopholes they benefit from. To me, it is obvious what you do in that situation. You do what they do in Finland, for example. In Finland, 25% of any new development has to be social housing and 30% has to be affordable housing. Therefore, 55% of any new development has to be social and affordable housing. One might ask why, in the current situation in Ireland, anything less than 100% should not comprise social and affordable housing. In all seriousness, what is the point of building housing that is not affordable? There is none. The State and the buyer or renter get screwed for massive amounts of money. What is the point in that? The State should buy 100% of the developments. Admittedly, that would be at a cost but there is a way it can be got back. A windfall tax could be applied to the capital gains the people in question will make out of the sale. One could take the money back off them. They should not have got it in the first place. The greatest scandal ever in this State was the disposal of the NAMA property to them. They should not make a cent out of it. We should acquire 100% of the sites and tax the windfall gains made by the developers so we can get the money back. In this way, we would start to have a serious impact. If those who live in south Dublin drive down the N11 on their way to Wicklow or Arklow, they will see all the apartment complexes being built in the region, some of which are near completion. Currently, we are getting 10% of them. We should be getting at least what the Finnish get in Helsinki, namely, 55%. I would say it should be 100%. The State should buy the complexes and then it could solve the problem. Cherrywood, the biggest residential development in the history of the State, is on what was NAMA-owned land. As things stand, the beneficiaries will be foreign investors, including Dutch pension funds. They will rent at extortionate levels and sell at extortionate prices that nobody can afford. Now there is pressure on the banks to start lending money to people that they cannot really afford, with interest rates going up. Believe it or not, we are actually threatening to do what we did before 2008. There is an alternative. It is for the State to take the property back, buy it all out and deliver it all as affordable and social housing. We built the infrastructure with the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF. We have paid for the roads and parks with public money but private investors will reap the benefit. What we are doing is just insane. The solutions are in front of us if we are willing to take the necessary action. My last point, which I am making yet again, is on income thresholds. As our motion pointed out today, in 2008 some 48% of households were entitled to social housing or eligible to go on the social housing list. The ESRI points out that because of the Government's failure to increase the thresholds, that was down to 33% by the end of 2019. That means it is well below 30% now. This is happening when more households than ever need the support because house prices and rents have gone up. There has been a massive stealth cut to the proportion of households eligible for State support. You will not even get social housing because you will be on a list for 20 years, but at least you might get housing assistance payment, HAP, support as an interim, temporary measure. If you are over the threshold, you are goosed. The Government support is very clear about the reason for the delay in raising the thresholds. It states it has to ration social housing. The word "ration" appears on about 20 occasions. That is what it is down to. It is not down to justice or anything like that. Precisely when people need assistance more than ever in accessing housing, the proportion of eligible households has been dramatically cut. The reason the Government does not want to do what I suggest is because it does not want to acknowledge the scale of the problem. However, one does not solve a problem unless one acknowledges it and how many people actually need State support through the delivery of social and affordable housing and, at a minimum, financial assistance to secure housing they can afford.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 3, line 20, to delete “2023” and substitute “2024”. The eviction ban, or the deferment of termination dates for certain tenancies, to be more accurate, is a belated concession on the part of the Government to the long-standing demand of many of us here in the Opposition that it should ban no-fault evictions at least for the duration of the housing emergency. It should be noted that the Dáil declared an emergency in housing, again, in response to pressure, most notably the Raise the Roof demonstration that happened in 2018. A housing emergency was declared. That housing emergency is very much still with us. In fact, it has very considerably worsened, and the number of people being evicted into homelessness has increased. It is our view, therefore, that a ban on people being evicted into homelessness when they have done nothing wrong should last at least until the housing emergency is over. We think that is constitutionally sound. It is the fact of an emergency that deals with any concerns that there might be about the constitutionality of such an eviction ban. Just in the same way as unprecedented measures could be taken during the Covid emergency, the housing emergency is something all of us have accepted exists. Therefore, extraordinary measures are justified, in my view. I think any fair-minded person would say that the Constitution allows, in those circumstances, for action to be taken in the interests of the common good. This amendment is proposing that as an absolute minimum, the ban on evictions should be for at least a year. Indeed, we would say that beyond that it should be for the duration of any emergency, but for at least a year. Otherwise, we are going to be back to where we were before the ban in the summer, starting at the end of March 2023, at the end of the emergency period in this legislation. By June, any protections that it affords will be gone and evictions will restart. The Government has helpfully identified the numbers that might be homeless just during this emergency period, which is well over 2,000 people. That gives us an indication of the scale of the problem. We think the ban should be longer. We also think it should be more comprehensive. I do not even know whether we will get to most of the amendments in the time that is available to us. In fact, we will not get to most of them. When this legislation was published last week, we and others immediately pointed out that it does not afford the protection from the possibility of eviction to all those who deserve that protection. If you have already passed the date for the termination of your tenancy and you are overholding, this Bill will not protect you. To cite one example, and I am sure others will cite their examples, there is a working couple in my area with two children, who passed the date for the termination of their tenancy on grounds of sale last Friday week. They have nowhere to go from a house that the family has lived in since the 1950s. They were born in the house, yet they are being evicted by a landlord who has multiple properties and they have nowhere to go. They are trying everything. They are over the income threshold so the council is humming and hawing about the possibility of buying the tenancy. That is something that also needs to be addressed. Just because you are over the threshold does not mean you do not face the prospect of being homeless. The council should step in and secure this family's tenancy by buying that property. At the very least, families like that, who are overholding - and there are many of them - should be protected by this ban and they are not. I would like the Minister to respond to that and explain why that is the case. Before anybody whispers to the Minister that we cannot have retrospective legislation or something of that sort, I remind him that he did just that during the Covid eviction ban. Nobody could be evicted from their home, full stop. It was not a matter of a deferment of termination dates. Rather, nobody could be evicted. There is absolutely no fairness or reason not to protect people who are overholding. Most of the people who are overholding are doing so on the advice of the local housing department in any event. Those people go to the local housing department and say they are being evicted on grounds of sale having done nothing wrong. They ask for help and ask if there is social housing available, the answer to which is "No". They are told they are over the threshold or will be waiting 20 years. There is no emergency accommodation available. There is nowhere for such people to go. What does the council say? It advises tenants to overhold their tenancy. It happens informally but the Minister knows that is true. It is happening in every local authority housing department. Housing officials suggest that tenants overhold because something might become available in a few weeks or months. That is what happens. Those people should not be put in that position and the Bill should protect them. That protection should last the full duration of the housing emergency. The Government should use the intervening months to take the sort of measures that will mean we will not be hit with an avalanche of evictions next year. We have proposed many solutions to the Minister this evening. We have encouraged the Government to buy up developer property on a bigger scale than we are doing now. It should buy up properties where people are threatened with eviction. I know others want to come in so I will finish on the following point. People who are over the thresholds but are faced with the possibility of homelessness should also be protected. Local authorities should be willing to step in and buy the properties in question. They do not have to be eligible for social housing. Someone who is over the threshold should be eligible for cost rental or affordable housing and, therefore, public funds should be available to purchase those houses as well. That should be done to prevent more people ending up in homelessness or emergency situations. I hope the Minister will accept the amendment. Beyond that, I hope he will take up and respond to the points I have made about those who are not protected by this legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have to get onto the other amendments but the Minister did not really respond to the central argument. I heard the Irish Property Owners Association representatives humming and hawing on "Morning Ireland" when they were asked whether they were actually going to take legal action. They did not sound to me like they were going to take action because they do not have a very solid base for doing so. That is the truth. The association could not challenge the measures taken during the Covid pandemic and there is a very sound basis for such measures now. The Minister did not respond to this point but this House has declared an emergency. Is the Minister is now going to stand up and say that emergency is over? No serious person would because the housing emergency has got worse since everybody in this House, across the board, agreed that there was one. I do not believe anyone is suggesting the housing emergency has receded since this House said there was one. That is a basis on which to delimit property rights. Some people do not understand that this is provided for in the existing Constitution. Some want to bring such a provision into the Constitution but it is already there. I mention that for the sake of some of the social media trolls out there.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We all get trolled. The existing Constitution allows for a delimiting of the rights of private property holders in the interests of the common good. That is what we did during the Covid pandemic, what the Minister has done with his very limited rent controls and so on and what he is doing here. Given that this House has declared an emergency, there is a very sound basis for maintaining the ban on evictions until that emergency is over. That is constitutionally sound. I do not believe any judge would entertain an argument that this House does not have the right to declare an emergency and to say that emergency measures are therefore constitutionally justified. I will just say that. We can deal with this on section 2, but the Minister did not comment on the people who are not covered under the Bill. Perhaps we will get to that on section 2 but I am worried we will not get that far. I refer to the people who are overholding, those who are already past their termination date. Those people will not be protected which means they could potentially face being evicted over the winter period. People whose termination dates have passed are every bit as deserving of the protections the Minister has accepted should apply for this period as others but they are not protected and could therefore be evicted. That needs to be addressed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I heard the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister can say it again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the loopholes around ability to pay rent, the justification offered by the Minister for the emergency period - and it is the emergency period as defined by this legislation - surely exists as long as this House believes that it is an emergency. The Minister, however, has defined it as relating to the winter. Why is it limited from November to March if it is not to do with the winter? Clearly that is the basis on which the Minister has decided the period, which is completely arbitrary. We would like it for longer and for the duration of the emergency. Given that he has done that, it is clearly linked to the cost-of-living crisis in his mind, and rightly so. People are oppressed with extortionate cost-of-living increases and, therefore, somebody who might fall behind with the rent because he or she is having difficulty paying the extortionate increases in the cost of living, the cost of heating, and the cost of electricity, might be evicted. It is a different matter if it is wilful non-payment of rent but in the situation I describe it is somebody who is just falling behind in the payment of rent. The legislation should not allow for somebody to be evicted in those circumstances. On the overcrowding issues, again it is self-evident, as other Members have underlined. It makes even less sense to evict people who are in overcrowded circumstances. I am sure that they do not want to be in overcrowded circumstances but almost invariably people are in overcrowded situations because they cannot find anywhere else affordable to live. It hardly seems a reasonable option to then say, "I can evict you because there are too many of you in the house." So, this appears to be okay and they are not afford the protections of the legislation. Finally, for reasons I cannot understand my amendment No. 2 was ruled out of order. I asked and I am not sure if the Leas-Cheann Comhairle knows why either, frankly. I do not see how it could be a charge on the Exchequer. It was simply seeking to extend the protections of the Bill to those who have already been given termination dates. How that could be a charge on the Exchequer is beyond me. It is just a mystery. I do not understand how it has been ruled out of order, but could the Minister please answer the question? I have asked three times now. What is he going to do for people who have already passed their termination date and are overholding? Could he just answer the question? Is he going to do anything or is he going to allow a situation where people could be evicted who have passed the termination date and are overholding but have nowhere to go, and who have done nothing wrong? Deputy Callaghan has pointed out an example. There is the couple that I had mentioned with their kids in my constituency. They have lived in the house since the 1950s. They were born there. They have probably paid the value of that house twice or three times over, yet they are being evicted. They have done nothing wrong. On the next point, the Minister did not answer either. He looked as though he was going to answer, for a minute, and then he veered off into something else. They are a working family and, therefore, they are over the threshold for local authority housing. The council will not entertain them for emergency accommodation, and it is not that they want to go to emergency accommodation. The council will also not entertain them for social housing. When such a family is over the threshold, would they be entertained for the purchase of the house to prevent them going into homelessness? A purchase is what should happen. What could the Minister do for a couple like that? Why do the provisions of the Bill not protect them against eviction even for the limited period it is doing for others? I acknowledge that this may be beyond the scope of the Bill, but if we are going to use the intervening period to start buying houses, which we should do, can it not be limited just to people who are within the thresholds? Can it also be for people who are above the threshold if they have nowhere else to go?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The house is not like a mansion. It is terraced house. What does the Minister want me to say? It is a terraced house that is smaller than a lot of council houses, if that is what he is asking.
