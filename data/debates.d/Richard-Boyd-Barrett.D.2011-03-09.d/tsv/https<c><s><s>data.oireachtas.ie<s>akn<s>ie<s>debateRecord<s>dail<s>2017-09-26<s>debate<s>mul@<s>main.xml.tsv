RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Minister to answer the question both in respect of individual instances and the general principle. Should companies that get public contracts, that are then found to be in breach of the law and of fire safety standards and that fail to comply with the tax code be banned for ever from being awarded public contracts? I will go into a little more detail. Before the summer recess, I raised the issue of the refurbishment of Dolphin House and the failure in that instance to comply with the tax code. I have just left the meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills at which Western Building Systems-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. I will return to the issue of Western Building Systems.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On 5 July last, I pointed out in the House that workers had been working on a public contract for Purcell Construction, which is the developer, and Rapid Developments, the subcontractor. The workers were employed since April or May and still had not received payslips. Even after I raised the matter with the Minister, which was followed by a raid by the joint investigation unit, JIU - although that raid was a joke - the workers still have not received payslips. In August, they finally got a notification that they were PAYE workers as of 23 August, but there was no reference to the fact that there was no tax, registration or anything else since their employment began in April or May. This is a flagrant breach of the law, and this is a public contract. I have just returned from the meeting of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills at which Western Building Systems, which built six schools in flagrant breach of fire safety standards, was discussed. Another one that has not come into the public domain is Whitehall College of Further Education, also built during that period, in respect of which, I understand, legal action is being taken by the Office of Public Works over the company's failure to comply with proper standards. Are these companies seriously going to continue to be awarded public contracts? It is outrageous. In the case of the schools, children are being put at risk. The company signed off, fraudulently in my opinion, on fire safety in those buildings, which were then discovered to be defective on multiple occasions. Will those companies get further public contracts? I do not believe they should.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was a scripted answer telling us what we already know. I have given two examples of companies that received significant public contracts worth a great deal of money. There is proof in the case of Western Building Systems and strong evidence in the case of Purcell Construction and Rapid Developments, in the Dolphin's Barn development, that they are breaking the law. In the refurbishment at Dolphin's Barn they are breaking the law in terms of the tax code and conditions of employment for workers. It is still happening, even after a raid took place. The workers still have not received payslips and the employer is now trying to tell them that they were only employed on 23 August even though the workers can show pictures of cheques they received from this company back in May. This is breaking the law. When companies are found guilty of that will they continue to get public contracts or will the contracts be taken from them? Western Building Systems built schools and is building rapid-build houses in Poppintree - God knows what they are like in terms of fire safety. It was involved in construction at Temple Street hospital, as well as building extensions to Beaumont Hospital. The company has built all of these things and we have known for at least two years that it was in flagrant breach of fire safety standards. Will it get more public contracts?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State did not quote all of the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking if there will be sanctions against companies that are not in compliance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is important, when considering the issue of Brexit and what is happening in the European Union more generally, that we do not lose sight of the wood for the trees. We are always in danger of doing precisely that on a whole range of issues and certainly on the issue of Brexit. We will try to focus on issues that I fully accept are very important for the many who are affected and the economy. However, we look at them in a narrowly empirical and technical way instead of understanding that what we are faced with in Europe is a very serious political crisis, one which flows from an economic and social crisis in Europe as a whole. This fact was recognised to a certain extent at the time of the Brexit referendum when there was an acknowledgement that Europe should look to itself. It has since gone out the window, however, and we have entered a game of politics. Theresa May is playing politics, as is the European Union, and it is now all about the mood music. The question is whether Theresa May said something in Florence that was different from what she said in her previous speech, whether Michel Barnier's speech was slightly different from Guy Verhofstadt's speech or whether there has there been a slight change in tone. It is, therefore, a case of playing politics. Not only does it not make sense to have a hard border between North and South or east and west between this country and Britain, it does not make sense for anybody. It does not make sense for Britain or Europe to have tariff barriers between them and it does not make sense to have such barriers on the North-South axis. I am sufficiently optimistic to believe, notwithstanding the politics and politicking that is taking place, that even business interests understand that this is not a sensible proposition.  A previous speaker stated that consultancy firms are not getting a great take-up for advice on how to deal with Brexit. The point, however, is that we do not know what Brexit is because it will be decided by politics. We should, therefore, think a little about the deeper politics of the issue. As Deputy Paul Murphy stated, the deeper politics of it are becoming very alarming against the background of the election result in Germany at the weekend. In the bastion of stability and economic success, the model and anchor of the European Union, the fascists and Nazis have entered parliament, taking 13% of the vote and almost 100 seats. This is part of a wider wave of growth for openly fascist, neo-Nazi, far right nationalist political forces across Europe and beyond and it is a development that should worry us.  There are a number of ways to deal with this development. One is to bend to these forces and their vile, racist, Islamophobic rhetoric which tries to explain away economic and social problems by scapegoating vulnerable people and minority groups. I will give credit to the political establishment in Ireland on one point. Notwithstanding all of our differences, from the centre right to the radical left and pretty much everything in between - certainly in terms of those represented in the Oireachtas - we are a bright light in that none of us has bought into this racist nonsense. I am very glad of that and we must maintain that position and refuse to capitulate to this nonsense. We also need to go a little further and ask why this obnoxious stuff is rising. There is a direct correlation between the rise of racist, extreme right, nationalist forces in Britain, Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Sweden and any other country one wishes to name, and deprivation, unemployment and poverty. These are the common denominators that are all increasing as a result of the austerity policies pursued by the European Union and the Tories in Britain.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is exactly what is happening in Germany I am afraid. The areas where the far right has grown are the poorest parts of east Germany where services have been cut, unemployment is higher, de-industrialisation has taken place and jobs have been lost. That is where the far right grew. There are 14 million people unemployed in the eurozone and 18 million unemployed in the wider European Union, with the figure having increased by 100,000 in recent months. Across Europe, 27% of children are living in households classified as poor. More than one third of the populations in Bulgaria, Romania and Greece are suffering from social exclusion, while one in three Spaniards is living on an income of less than €8,000 per annum. I will not cite all the statistics. In Britain, the areas where the United Kingdom Independence Party, UKIP, and Brexit received a high proportion of the vote were those that had been devastated by Tory neoliberal and austerity policies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a fact. The problem is that if we do not recognise what people are feeling, they will look for nastier alternatives. If we state clearly, however, that the problems of inequality, poverty, deprivation and the growing gap between rich and poor need to be addressed and if we identify what policies created these problems in the first place, we can win over the allegiance of people who are alienated and disenfranchised and who, in desperation, look to far right forces. Only 33% of the people who voted for the Alternative für Deutschland - the Nazis - said they supported AFD policies, with 66% stating their vote was a kick against the establishment. Why did these voters want to kick against the establishment? Was it because the establishment is serving their interests so well or was it because it is letting them down badly while pretending everything is fine and Germany is a rock of stability and sense? It is not the case that people are stirred up by populists, as the German Government would suggest, but that they are experiencing real problems of alienation, anger, deprivation and high levels of unemployment. Unless we recognise that Europe has failed to deal with these problems, the frightening growth of far right, nationalist and, God help us, openly neo-Nazi forces will continue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not for sure.
