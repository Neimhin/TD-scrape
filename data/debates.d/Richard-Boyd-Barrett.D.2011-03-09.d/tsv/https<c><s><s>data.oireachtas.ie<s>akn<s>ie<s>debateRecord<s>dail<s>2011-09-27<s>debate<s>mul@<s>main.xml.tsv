RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was waiting for the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to finish.What the Constitution says is not really the issue or answer we are looking for.  While the Taoiseach may have the right to maintain Cabinet confidentiality regarding the activities of the Economic Management Council — I have asked questions on this several times — we are in a very grave financial and economic situation that is very fluid.  We and the public read daily about the next twist or turn in the economic and financial crisis in Europe and how it may have an impact on us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We wish to be able to question the Taoiseach on the ongoing deliberations of the Government because they are of such urgency and importance.  That is why we want the Taoiseach to open up the debate that is taking place among members of the Government on very important decisions that affect the economic and financial future of this country and its citizens.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	July was a long time ago.  A lot has happened since then.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The public.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	About another issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach said that Jean-Claude Trichet ruled out the possibility of bondholders taking some of the burden of a crisis they created.  Let us be clear; it is they, the bankers and others, who created it.  Did he explain why?  What is the rationale for saying that we cannot force bondholders, the financiers and the speculators, to bear the burden?  The Taoiseach can correct me if I am wrong, but from what he is saying it seems to me that the reason is because it might spread the contagion into the rest of Europe.  Is another way of putting that simply that what they are doing is defending the interests of German, French and British banks which are in fact responsible for the problem?  In one sense is it in our interests or in the interests of dealing with the crisis as it is not to acknowledge that they are partly to blame for it and that they must share the burden?  In these talks with either Jean-Claude Trichet, the eurozone leaders in general or the EU-IMF, I wonder if there is any discussion about the fact there is a serious body of opinion — not left-wing opinion but main stream opinion, including Joseph Stiglitz, Paul Krugman in The Irish Times today, and the UN Committee on Trade and Development — which is saying the overall policy of prioritising bailing out banks and bondholders has a big cost attached because it imposes austerity on ordinary people.  It is not just causing extreme suffering but is also strangling the real economy.  It is contracting demand and the entire package will fail because the measures being taken to prop up the bankers and bondholders are ensuring there cannot be economic growth or recovery.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The question is whether there is any debate.  Does the Taoiseach put that point to Trichet or the rest of them — that there is a serious body of opinion saying not just that it is unfair but that we are committing economic suicide?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In effect, is the ESM and the souped-up EFSM with corresponding or connected centralised economic governance criteria — the so-called six-pack — not a new treaty?  It will centralise economic policy as a condition of bailing out countries and give more control to unelected and unaccountable central European authorities to dictate economic policy to countries that are in these mechanisms.  The Taoiseach is not directly answering the question as to whether there is any discussion at all about these serious voices which are saying that the austerity strategy may not just be unfair, as many of us believe it is, but also counterproductive.  Is there any discussion of that or acknowledgement that these people might have a point?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is fiscal stimulus.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do not continue bailing out the bondholders, but stimulate the economy, which this strategy is failing to do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there any discussion at all on that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It will not work.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	She just wants to negotiate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also object to the guillotine being imposed on the Insurance (Amendment) Bill.  I spent an hour at a Department of Finance briefing this morning trying to get my head around the quagmire of the collapse of Quinn Insurance and this Bill is yet again a case of the ordinary policyholders having to bail out this failed entity which is tied up with Anglo Irish Bank bondholders and all the rest of it.  Policyholders will be forced to pay a significant levy for at least the next ten years or so.There is no provision in this Bill to go after the €200 million in personal wealth which Seán Quinn gave to his children, yet ordinary people will be carrying the can.  In that context, it is outrageous that something as important and as complex as this Bill should be rammed through the Dáil in such a short time without sufficient time for a debate and then to have a guillotine imposed on it.  I urge the Taoiseach to give proper time and not to impose a guillotine on this matter which has far-reaching consequences for many citizens.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That assumes there were no alternatives.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I oppose the motion.  The European Defence Agency, EDA, is about promoting the arms industry.  This is not appropriate for any state that is interested in promoting peace.  It is certainly not appropriate for a state that claims to be militarily neutral.  On any moral ground, we should have nothing to do with a body that was set up for the sole purpose of promoting, developing and expanding the arms industry.  Will the Minister or anyone justify the arms industry to me?  An obnoxious trade, it is concerned with developing ever more sophisticated means of killing people.  It is ironic that Members of the opposite side of the House and members of former Governments often get up on their high horses to denounce violence as being morally obnoxious while supporting Ireland's involvement in an agency whose sole purpose is to assist the companies that specialise in producing lethal weapons.It is an issue of great concern that the EDA's executive recently told the European Parliament that unmanned drones will be tested in Europe's civilian airspace by 2012.  Some of these will be bought from Israel, which has been testing them against Palestinians.  According to some estimates, these barbaric instruments have killed as many as 7,000 innocent Afghani men, women and children in horrific bombing raids on villages and towns.  It is beyond me why we would have anything to do with an agency or policy that promoted the use of such weapons.There is no question but that I will oppose the motion.  Will the Minister or anyone on the Government side justify support for the arms industry?  What is good about it?  What possible benefit does it have to humanity and the world?  When people are homeless and jobless and lack adequate health and education resources and when there is extraordinary poverty in the world, is it not obscene that Europe and Ireland want to promote an industry that takes resources from those areas humans need to survive and prosper and use them to develop industries designed to produce the means to destroy human life?  It is beyond me.I will oppose the motion strongly.  If the Government has any shred of moral sensibility or commitment to the notion of Ireland as a neutral country, we should stand out against the development and expansion of the EDA, which is nothing more than an agency to promote the interests of arms companies that profit from death.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the EDA sell arms on the global market?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister believe in arms sales?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I suspect that the Minister would agree that unemployment, particularly at the levels we are now witnessing, is unacceptable and that it must be everyone's priority to do something about it.  It is demoralising for people who were working and who want to work to find themselves dependent on social welfare and with no prospects of getting back to work.  They face the difficulty of meeting mortgage repayments, paying bills and trying to live a dignified existence, but they also face the demoralisation of not working.  Unemployment will create a social cost if we do not deal with the problem quickly.  We are all familiar with what mass unemployment over a long period led to in the 1980s, when serious damage was done to communities across this city and the entire country.  We all understand that and how urgent it is to deal with it.  Any talk of success, improvement, recovery or being on the right track means very little if we do not address that problem quickly.I am sure the Minister would also agree that getting people back to work has to be central to any sustainable economic strategy.  One cannot grow an economy with this number of people unemployed and dependent on social welfare, considering its cost to the Exchequer.The strategy employed by the Government, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund, if I understand it correctly, is the following.  We nurse the banks back to health.  We need them because, no matter how awful they were or how badly they misbehaved, without them we cannot get credit back into the economy.  We must accept this necessary evil of nursing them back to health.  We must cut costs in order to make ourselves competitive, grow exports and get ourselves out of the mess we are in.  That seems to be the strategy being articulated by the Government for dealing with the current economic crisis, but there is a major flaw in the logic of this strategy.It is apparent if one looks at the effect of the austerity strategy over the last couple of years.  Things have not got better.  They have got worse on all those fronts.  The focus on nursing the banks back to health has not produced a release of credit into the economy.  We can all see this.  No money is going from the banks into small businesses, despite our huge efforts to recapitalise the banks and nurse them back to health and the enormous austerity people have had to suffer to do this.Unemployment has not got better.  It has got worse.  There is no sign of significant economic growth.  There has been a small improvement in the export situation but, given the contraction in the rest of the economy, exports are too small a proportion of our economy to drag the country out of recession or to make up the ground necessary to get all those people back to work.The view that the current strategy is not working is not coming only from the Technical Group or from the left, or even the extreme left or whatever term is used to ridicule us.  The UN Conference on Trade and Development produced a report in the last couple of weeks.  It states:A shift from fiscal stimulus towards fiscal tightening is self-defeating, especially in the most developed economies which were severely hit by the financial crisis.  In such a situation a restricted fiscal policy may reduce GDP growth and fiscal revenues and is, therefore, counterproductive in terms of fiscal consolidation.It goes on to say that the fiscal imbalances were not a driving factor of the current crisis rather, they were a result of the crisis.  Getting the books balanced is not the issue because the books are unbalanced because of the financial crisis.  It further states that public bail-outs of financial institutions accounted for a large portion of the deficit, reflecting a conversion from private into public debt.The UN is saying that it was not profligacy in public spending that created the deficit rather, it was the taking on of the private debts of the bankers.  It states public opinion and policy makers should not trust again those institutions, including rating agencies, to judge what constitutes sound macro-economic policies and management of public finances.  The reduction in growth promoting fiscal expenditure may lead to a decline in future Government revenues that would be larger than the fiscal savings obtained by retrenchment, with negative consequences for long term fiscal and debt sustainability.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The UN states that, as an alternative, increases in spending on infrastructure, social transfers or targeted subsidies for private investors tend to be more effective in stimulating the economy because they directly lead to job creation, purchases and demand.The argument for stimulus and investment rather than austerity and a focus on bailing out the banks is being put forward by the UN.  It is also put forward in today's The Irish Times by Mr. Paul Krugman, one of the most prominent economists in the world.  I do not understand why the Government, EU authorities or IMF will not even debate this alternative strategy given the obvious failures of the strategy of austerity and bank bail-outs.The Minister may say that we have no choice because we are a small economy that is bankrupt and dependent on EU money and that even if the Government agreed with me or with this analysis of the UN there is nothing we can do about it.  I put it to the Minister that there is.  The Minister, Deputy Howlin, told us recently that our deficit is €15 billion.  He said that if we do not do what the EU tells us we will be left with a deficit of €15 billion.  The Minister accepted that the €15 billion includes the interest repayments on the loans, which on an annual basis is roughly about €4 billion or €5 billion, leaving a deficit of approximately €10 billion or €11 billion.  If one considers that our social welfare budget is approximately €21 billion, it would be reasonable to suggest that half of that results from people who are unemployed but do not want to be unemployed.  It is costing us €20,000 per person to keep people on the dole doing nothing when they want to work.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In other words, the €10 billion could be achieved if we put people back to work.  That is the reason we have a deficit.  I am not suggesting people should work for their dole payments.  Clearly, they must be given better wages than that but the extra money could be, for example, made up from the remaining €5 billion in the National Pensions Reserve Fund or by putting a small tax on the super wealthy.  If we combine this with the current social welfare budget we could put people back to work doing things such as developing the agri-food sector, sustainable energy, generic medicines and the vital infrastructure of the country.  Why can we not try that approach?
