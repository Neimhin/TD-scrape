RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am concerned about this. The Minister is well aware that I am critical of the various means by which very profitable corporations reduce their tax liability to the point where they are paying a fraction of the 12.5% headline corporation tax rate.While we are all in favour of research and development, I am very concerned at the massive gap between the net amount of tax paid versus the gross profits of, largely, the bigger corporations here. The tax tables that the Department of Finance provided to me make it clear that while small and medium-sized enterprises pay the 12.5% - there are not many ways out of it for them - there is an enormous gap between the gross profits and the taxable profits of the big corporations such that they end up paying a tiny fraction of the 12.5%. It is completely unacceptable that these companies and their high-powered accountants can use headings, such as research and development, group losses and trading losses from previous years, to reduce the level of taxable profits such that they end up paying next to nothing. In that context I worry about giving further opportunities to these corporations to reduce their tax liability. While I might be alone on this, I find it shocking that we have €70 billion of gross profits declared in this State and only €4 billion in tax, which represents 6.5%. Regardless of how one massages the figures and talks about accountancy standards, I do not accept it. I take the point the Minister made last night about closing off some of the tax loopholes that high-earners were using to reduce their effective tax rate. He pointed out that it was possible to increase the minimum effective tax rate notwithstanding that there are still ways for people to reduce their tax liability, some of which may be legitimate. Irrespective of all that, it is possible to say that there will be a minimum amount of tax that people will pay if they are high earners. Exactly the same principle should apply to corporations. Notwithstanding various incentives or tax breaks for particular activities, we should insist that they must pay a minimum amount before they start to benefit from tax breaks under any category. That is the least we could do when everybody else in the country is being hammered for increased tax and austerity in one shape or form. The corporations are getting away scot free and paying a fraction proportionately of what everybody else is paying. Against that background, I am not happy with this section and others we will discuss later. These issues need to be discussed, debated and interrogated. I reserve the right to table a Report Stage amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This section relates to interest payments by companies to non-residents. I ask the Minister to expand on the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister said there is no cost. Withholding tax just taxes interest payments as a matter of course and then any issues of double taxation can be sorted out later.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will let that one pass then.SECTION 23
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As hinted at by Deputy Pearse Doherty, there is nothing electoral about our perspective on this issue. Some of us believe in the concept of universal provision. We believe that is the fair and right way to go. While I accept that there have been populist and electoral moves by Fianna Fáil in the past, Fine Gael has done likewise. The quid pro quo for some of the nasty cuts introduced in the budget was a similarly populist and electoral move.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am speaking about the same issues as other speakers and the Chairman did not cut across them. He should be consistent.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chairman did not cut across anybody else when discussing these issues.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am allowed to speak to the same issues.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just be consistent.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking for fairness.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not getting it so far.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just stating the obvious.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I am just stating the obvious.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I am just stating the obvious. Some of us believe in the concept of universal provision. Before throwing stones about populism and being electoral, the Minister should look to Fine Gael and the initiative taken by it to cover its back in respect of the nastier cuts it directed towards people with discretionary medical cards or the elderly from whom they are being withdrawn.  On the universal social charge and where the tax burden falls, while the Minister has stated the Government's position, it is worth putting indicating that at a minimum people earning the minimum wage or less should not have to suffer the impact of the universal social charge which it should be remembered was the defining austerity tax introduced as a result of the crash and decision to bail out the banks. The idea that those on the minimum wage, a miserable wage for people on which to survive, should not be subject to this austerity tax is the minimum ask. Some of us would go a lot further. We proposed in our last two budget submissions that persons earning less than €60,000 be exempted from the USC and that those earning between €60,000 and €100,000 be liable to pay at only half the rate which, according to the Department, would cost in the region of €2 billion. We proposed that this cost be met by an increase in income tax rates on earnings over €100,000, €150,000 and €200,000. This proposal is dismissed pretty much out of hand by the Minister and the political establishment. I put it to him that such a proposal is fair. Tax collection should be about the fair distribution of income and resources. There is an ever growing gap between high and low earners and between the rich and the poor. It seems a progressive budget would seek to close this gap and redistribute wealth in a fair way, in part because this would be fair and also because it would be better for the economy. Numerous studies and analyses show that more equal societies function better.That is something the Minister does not seem to get. He is not acknowledging the point of a gap between rich and poor, with huge differentials between top and low earners. That is unfair and corrosive to society and social solidarity. Ultimately, there is a cost, and issues such as the universal social charge have worsened the position of the less well-off. There is also the matter of economic growth. Relieving the burden of taxation in the form of the universal social charge on low and middle income earners would have a far greater benefit for the economy than the approach which the Minister generally seems to favour of giving tax breaks to big corporations or high earners on the grounds that he believes this will incentivise investment. There is not much evidence that there is any success in this regard, and it is surely self-evident that if the income of those on low and middle incomes is increased, the multiplier effect would be far greater for the economy, as these people will spend the money in local shops and businesses. For the most part the money would not go outside the country or be used for speculative purposes; it will benefit the economy and generate demand, growth and employment. The Minister does not really seem to acknowledge or understand that in how the budgets are framed and persists with policies of trying to incentivise the rich and maintain the burden of austerity on low and middle income families. That is why the economy is not recovering and we are not getting the promised economic growth.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They have 44% of the wealth.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the rationale for this section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not ask for the memorandum; I asked for an explanation from the Minister. However, I thank the Chairman for his assistance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Minister to explain the rationale.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To cut a long story short, is it being done to encourage private investment in Irish Water?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not in favour of the measure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to express my concern about the matter and will possibly return to it on Report Stage. As the Minister will know, I am entirely against the setting up of Irish Water for privatisation. I do not favour any measure that encourages private investment in what is essentially the people's resource. The Government is moving fast towards privatisation but charging people for something that belongs to them anyway.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to come back in after the Deputy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a stepping stone to the marketisation of water, as far as I am concerned. I do not favour that development in any shape or form. It is the oldest trick in the book to mention water shortages. It has been used to justify the privatisation of every single asset, service and piece of infrastructure at local, national or international levels. The target is run down to the point where one can say that we need to do something which then justifies privatisation. We have a big problem. There has been successive failure by Governments since the foundation of the State because it was evident at the beginning of the 20th century that the water infrastructure was decrepit. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Governments repeatedly, for the whole history of the State, have failed to properly invest in the water infrastructure. In Ireland it rains heavily and buckets down from the sky so we need to build reservoirs and rehabilitate the decrepit water infrastructure. The Minister is setting up a company that will be at one remove from the State to charge us for water, to install water meters and get private contractors to give us water meters. The private contractors include companies owned by some of the wealthiest people in the country who received massive write-downs on loans the companies had with Anglo Irish Bank. It is not reservoirs or rehabilitated infrastructure but water meters that we will get which will enable the Government to charge people for something that they already own. It is an absolute scandal and is beyond belief. I oppose the provision because it is part of the architecture for Irish Water and an Irish public resource to be marketised.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is. They are half privatised already.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Most of the points have been made. My position on the scheme is similar to my position on home renovation measures in that I consider the objective of this scheme to be very good. If it works, it will be great and I can think of many places in Dublin city centre and Dún Laoghaire which fit into this category. Given the role property based tax incentives had in creating the bubble and crashing the economy, one must be very cautious. However, I take the Minister's word that the scheme will be implemented on a pilot basis and that we need to be careful. Deputy Doherty correctly identified some areas of concern that will need to be examined to ensure the scheme is not abused. This is a good initiative. The correct approach is to be experimental, rather than jumping in head first before we know exactly how it will play out.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I oppose the section. It amounts to yet another bailout for the banks. If there was a 50% restriction it is because the Government recognises, notwithstanding its decisions to endlessly bail out these financial institutions which have wrecked the economy, that the amount of the losses they incurred, because of their own actions, that could be written off against tax in future years should be restricted. Now we are saying that after everything they have done we are going to give them another bailout. It is extraordinary that we would even consider it. It is the public which is recapitalising the banks. That links into the wider question of our failure to achieve the stated objective of the Government, which is to get some help from the European Union in the retrospective recapitalisation of banks to lift that burden off us. It effectively entails writing down some of our liability for the debts of the financial institutions.That is what we should be doing. However, this measure means the public is yet again bailing out the banks. I find this unconscionable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has pointed to the fact that we effectively own AIB and have a substantial share in Bank of Ireland as part of the rationale for doing this. He implies it is in the public interest to do this and to create a level playing field for the banks in which we have a stake in the wider banking market. I would put it completely differently. These banks were making astronomical profits during the boom, but we got practically nothing from them because corporate tax here is so low. They then caused the economy to crash because of their greed and nefarious activities. We stepped in and pumped vast amounts into them, crippling our economy in the process. Now, we prepare to launch them back into the market so that when they become profitable again, we will get nothing from them. What we are doing is fattening up the golden goose for private investors to come and grab it. The only time we have a so-called "stake" in the banks is when it is on its knees and we are pumping money into it. There is no way to put this other than to say that this is a bailout for these institutions. The beneficiaries of it will be the private investors whom the Minister hopes will eventually come back into the market and take these banks off us. We get the banks when they are crippled, yet the same people who helped wreck our economy and the global economy will get them when we have fattened them up nicely again and reduced their tax liability. This is shocking. If it was the case that we would retain ownership in the long term and would derive some genuine benefit from putting them in a stronger position, I could understand the rationale. However, the Minister has stated clearly that his intention is to re-privatise these banks at the first opportunity. We have more or less done that with Bank of Ireland. The difference in attitude between AIB and Bank of Ireland when they have come in here to address issues of concern, such as how they deal with distressed mortgage holders, credit for the SME sector and all the other issues we try to put pressure on them to address, is very clear. The more privatised the bank is, the more its representatives completely ignore and disregard the concerns of the very people who bailed them out. AIB representatives are a little more polite in their demeanour because we have some influence over them. However, ultimately AIB will go down the same road that Bank of Ireland has already started on. We are just reducing their tax liability and leaving them, literally, laughing all the way to the bank when we have done all the hard work of bailing them out. This measure is just more of that and is completely unacceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Much of my objection is to how this frames a relationship with the banks in general, and the different rules that applied to banks, and for that matter, to corporations, because a more general aspect to this is the capacity of private corporations to bring forward losses from previous years. Many people here bought houses just to put a roof over their head at the top of the property bubble, largely created by the banks. They did not do this to make a profit, to gamble, to speculate. If they bought their house for €350,000 or €400,000 and it is now worth €100,000, can they get a write-off on their negative equity against tax liability for future years? They cannot but a bank that helped to bankrupt the country and made astronomical losses, which those very mortgage holders and people on low incomes, all those who have been the victims, bailed out. They provided the resources to give the banks that write-off on previous losses. Ordinary people do not get a write-off against previous losses. I do not accept that is fair. One question emerged as I listened to the discussion: is this a way of dealing with the possible crisis that our banks face when they are stress-tested again? Is that what this is really about? Is the Government worried, despite constant protestations that we have the best capitalised banks in Europe? Is the rationale for this to use these tax assets to ensure core tier 1 capital ratios? I thought we had fully capitalised banks so why precisely is that an imperative? Let us not forget that the Minister also told us that we would get retrospective recapitalisation of our banks because that was agreed at the meeting in June of last year. Why, if all that is true, we have fully capitalised banks we will get retrospective recapitalisation of them, is Joe soap yet again giving a handout to banks by way of their capacity to write off previous losses against future tax liability? Fairly soon these banks will be sailing off into the sunset again after we have paid for their crisis and will be paying for decades to come. The benefit of what the Minister is doing here will ultimately go to private shareholders. That is bordering on the obnoxious.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If only ordinary workers could get such a tax break we would be flying.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It goes to show that if one kicks up a bit of a fuss about something, it can produce some movement. As the Minister knows, I have been kicking up for some time about the scandalous situation where corporations which make vast profits every year in this country pay little or no tax. The provision is welcome in that context, but it is slightly alarming that the Minister has put off its implementation, in what seems essentially to be a case of giving the multinationals a chance to find other ways to avoid tax. In fact, the overriding policy not only of the Government but of all Governments in the history of the State seems be one of whatever we do, we must not annoy these people who do not like paying taxes. Will the Minister answer that point? Will the Minister report on discussions he has had with representatives of these companies in the context of this measure? The narrative in response to those few of us who have argued that corporations should pay a little more tax is essentially that the sky would fall on our heads and the economy would be ruined if we were to ask the people concerned to pay the tax they should be paying and thus make some level of fair contribution to the running of the economy and society. In so far as he had discussions and consultations with these parties, can the Minister tell us whether they are, in fact, claiming that the sky will fall on our heads if we make any move that might lead to their becoming properly tax liable?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	God forbid these companies might decide to pay a little more tax somewhere, perhaps even in Ireland. I know that would be unthinkable for them and perhaps for the Minister also.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am very glad that is starting to be said. It is a major sea change and well past time that it should happen. I will be pleasantly surprised if real action to move matters in that direction which matches the rhetoric to that which we have been treated is forthcoming. Let us hope we are moving in a positive direction. Members wanted representatives from the companies in question to come before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform. However, there were obstacles to us questioning them about the detail of what was involved. The Minister has stated no additional tax will accrue to the State as a result of the adoption of this measure because the profits involved were not really generated here. I would like to drill down into this. One way to do so would be to talk to the companies in questions, but to date, we have not been allowed to do so. Another way would be to quiz the Minister about it, but I do not know whether he fully understands what is involved. My understanding was that the companies involved sold advertising from here all over the world and that they then paid for the use of software and patents to these shelf companies which were incorporated in this country but which were not liable for tax here. The selling was being done from Ireland. Is the distinction between profits generated in Ireland and those generated elsewhere but channelled through this country actually real? A company operating in Ireland can sell goods or services all over the place, but that does not mean that the sales it makes from here should not be subject to tax. Such a company might be selling goods or services to some other location, but there is not doubt that it is selling them from here. Companies of this sort avoid their tax liabilities using the moneys generated to pay royalties for the use of patents. There is a need to examine this matter in its entirety. We should not allow the companies involved to find new ways to avoid paying the taxes they should be paying.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister is aware, I have challenged the Government consistently on this issue in the past year or two and the very least it could do is accede to a request to provide the analysis and assessment Deputy Doherty has suggested in order that we can have the hard evidence before us and the public. That would allow them make their own judgments on this issue. There is considerable slippage in terms of the gross profits made by companies, the idea of taxable profits and the actual profit made. I have not pulled this idea out of my head. I am putting my assertions on this issue to the Minister of State and other Ministers on the basis of information I got from the Department of Finance's CTS table 1 or 2 and from looking at EUROSTAT figures on corporation taxes paid in the various economies across Europe. It is clear that what is known in the EUROSTAT figures as the implicit rate, which is another term for effective rate, namely, the gross profits paid as against the actual amount of tax paid at the end, the latter as a percentage of the former, was 6.5%. That is according to those tables produced by EUROSTAT. The comparable figures for almost all other major European countries of implicit rates were much higher. The only exception to that was the Netherlands, which had an implicit rate similar to ours. That assessment of implicit rates paid in Ireland in comparison with implicit rates paid elsewhere in Europe must be examined. The Minister of State has said we apply normal accounting standards, that taxable profits and gross profits are different and that it is all above board, but what he fails to explain is the reason for the gap between the implicit rate in Ireland, according to EUROSTAT's figures, and the implicit rate in Britain, Germany, France, Sweden and so on. With the one exception of the Netherlands, why is the gap so big? I put it to the Minister that at the very least this must be investigated because, to put it mildly, it is suspicious. The CTS 1 and 2 tables on that the Minister provided me with show that the main beneficiaries of this enormous gap between gross profits and taxes paid are a few hundred companies at the highest end of the profit scale. What is interesting is that in the table the Minister produced for me in response to a question in which I asked him for the breakdown in deciles of the gross profits and the taxes paid, he provided that information until he got to the most profitable companies, which I believe numbered a few hundred. At that point he stopped giving me the information in deciles and stated that because there are so few companies involved at the top end, it would be breaching confidentiality to give me the information in deciles because I might be able to identify them. I do not accept that but we all know the identity of those companies. They are the big multinationals. I am certain the small and middle companies further down the table are paying 12.5% but it is the big companies that account for the majority of gross profits declared in this country that somehow manage through various measures to reduce their tax liability between gross profits and what they actually end up paying. That area must be seriously investigated because Ireland, along with the Dutch, the home of the Dutch sandwich and the double Irish, has this massive gap. That suggests something amiss with our corporation tax regime which is allowing these hugely profitable corporations to dodge their tax liability.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the fact that we are having this discussion. However, the point is that it needs to develop and get beyond the assertion of different positions which at present do not agree. There are different starting points, but I am glad the Minister of State wants more from them because I want more. I say upfront that these guys should pay more.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us be honest, every other group in Irish society has been scrutinised intensely over the past four or five years to extract more. Rightly or wrongly, that is what has happened. The same level of scrutiny needs to be applied to these corporations. Broadly speaking, the question I want answered, on which I got some information but which has not really been answered, relates to that big gap between the €70 billion total profits declared and the €4.2 billion total tax paid. There seems to be two points. The first is the move from the €70 billion total to the €40 billion taxable, and then from the €40 billion taxable to the €4.2 billion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to know how they write it off.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want each one of those categories examined. I want to see how it is enforced. I want to see the criteria through which they qualify for those allowances. I want to see if there are possible ways in which they are abusing those categories in order to reduce their tax liability. I want an explanation as to why what is known as the implicit rate in the EUROSTAT figures is considerably lower here than it is elsewhere in Europe. I was trying to access the EUROSTAT website to look at the latest version of this. In the tables of which I have a hard copy back in my office, the only two countries that have such a low implicit rate are Ireland and the Netherlands and there is a significant gap then between Ireland and other European countries. I refer not to headline rates here but to what EUROSTAT calls the implicit-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think they do. Those tables were extremely detailed. They showed GDP, amounts of tax paid, and everything. Those are extremely detailed tables. They showed corporate taxes paid. It had figures for these matters and it gave implicit rates. It was self-evident, unless it was an extraordinary co-incidence, that the €6.5 billion EUROSTAT had as an implicit rate for Ireland happened to coincide with the proportion of net tax paid as against total profits, which was €6.2 billion or €6.5 billion here as well. It seemed evident that is where they were getting the figure from. They had a low figure for Holland and the next nearest was 17%, which, I think, was for Germany and which is lower than its headline rate. Germany had an implicit rate. Britain had a much higher implicit rate, and one can go through the list after that. There were much higher implicit rates and that is what I want a proper explanation for. That is not an explanation the Minister of State can give here but it is something, along with all those headings through which the companies write down their tax liabilities, that needs to be analysed. That is the point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would be desirable to explain in the report, whose production I would welcome, the comparisons between the implicit rates in various countries in Europe. I do not fully understand-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State is saying the gap between the €70 billion and the €40 billion is explained by reference to the three outlined categories and that the write-offs are fully legitimate because they pertain to capital allowances or royalties, for example, and are in accordance with international standards. I do not understand how our implicit figure is so low compared with the implicit figures for all the other countries if we are all using the same standards and if every state is, roughly speaking, applying the same rules.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I believe we need to drill into that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with many of the Chairman's comments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We flew through section 36-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am allowed, within Standing Orders, to signal a matter for Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is relevant to this discussion, and that prompted me to think about it. I have concerns about real estate investment trusts similar to the ones expressed about this. I will return to that on Report Stage. I worry that we are going down that road. While they are at the bottom and it might be the real price, the people who have money are buying up at the bottom of the market and controlling the market. The REITs may contribute to this. I do not know the figures for the take-up of REITs. Another feature in Dublin and elsewhere is rents going through the roof. This is causing real problems and leading directly to homelessness. How are we going to deal with that? It would be the greatest irony in the world if, after an enormous boom and bust which crashed the economy, we end up back in the same situation we were in before it, where the same sorts of people control the housing and rental market, and if we in any way incentivise the same stuff to happen again. This is not a comprehensive answer to it but one thing that would help control and regulate it a little would be if we increased the direct provision of social housing to keep prices from inflating out of all control. I worry about any property-based tax incentives, that we could make all the same mistakes again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I signal a possible Report Stage amendment to section 42.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to make a point. I could not let that slip. If VAT is imposed on the-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It concerns the exemption currently applying to local authorities.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is to fend off the possibility that there may not be a level playing field in the provision of water or concerns about EU rules about competition-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I get that point. The Minister of State may be aware of one of the points I made earlier-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	EU competition rules require a level playing field once a body begins to charge for a service. If VAT is applied on one service and not on another, it could be considered unfair competition, and consequently full market rules could start to apply.This would lead inevitably to privatisation. Do I take it that the provision aims to fend off this possibility and is based on the Minister's admirable desire not to impose VAT on water?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If we did not do this, would the Government have the problem I mentioned?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That stopped.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The EU rules relate to revenue producing monopolies so it does not matter. If somebody else wanted to get into the market, for example, does the Government have to give them the same exemption?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let me ask my question in another way. If somebody else wanted to get into the market of supplying water, would the Government have to provide the same exemption for them under EU rules?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With all due respect, I am not interested in-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are in the EU and EU rules apply. If somebody were to enter, or wishes to enter into the market-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would EU rules not require the Government to do so?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister of State 100% sure of that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will let the matter lie.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not always. Watch this space.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be brief because I am shuttling in and out of the petitions committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister of State will know, I favour the financial transaction tax being imposed. The Government is resistant to the measure and often cites, when I make the point that the tax should be imposed, that we do not need it because we have the 1% levy. I am not satisfied with the counter-argument but it gives the game away to some extent and reveals the Government's real attitude towards an increased level of tax on gambling on the Stock Exchange, speculation and so on. The Government believes the way to deal with a lack of investment in the economy is to remove this paltry stamp duty on activities in the Stock Exchange. I do not believe that stock exchanges or casino capitalism is the way to finance an economy, industrial development and growth. The provision is just more of the type of stuff that destabilised the global economy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We disagree and there is no point in labouring the point. The area needs more tax because it is part of the architecture of casino capitalism. When we are dealing with an investment problem, which we all agree exists, the instinct is to deal with it through reducing the taxes on profits in the area of capital speculation, for want of a better word.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay, trading in stocks and shares, which is largely gambling. It involves people who have money trying to make money not by doing any work but by speculating on how they can make unearned profit. I fundamentally and philosophically do not agree with that. This area needs to be taxed more and it is a destabilising factor in the global economy. I oppose it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Doherty has made many of my points. Apart from the suffering and hardship the property tax will impose on people, particularly in its second year because the full amount will be payable, it will hit people very hard on top of the accumulation of all the austerity measures, income cuts and levies that have been imposed in recent years. Many people will be seriously affected. It is clear from my clinic every week that a huge and diverse swathe of ordinary citizens are experiencing a level of hardship and financial difficulty almost to breaking point. Life is getting rough for many people. This year there will be even greater levels of hardship. Apart from all that has been well argued and will become evident next year, two of the central arguments the Minister put forward to justify the property tax have been revealed as completely bogus. That is why I commend Deputy Doherty's imagination for managing to get this issue into the committee discussions. In terms of options for alternatives, two of the central arguments we heard at the time the issue was being debated, have been shown to be utter nonsense. One was that the money derived from the property tax would go into the provision of local services. People should pay it, it was a great idea and it would finance local services.However, we have discovered that is not true. The first year's take from the property tax went directly towards paying off the debt that was not ours and we have now discovered the second year's tax will go into the setting up of Irish Water, which will facilitate the charging of people for water. The other argument used at the time was that if only we had had a property tax, we would not have had the property bubble, would not have had all the speculation in property, and the excesses that led up to the crash would not have occurred. Now we are seeing a bubble beginning to develop again in property. Therefore, having property taxes has not stopped the beginning of a development of another bubble. Rents are beginning to rise and prices are rising in certain areas and it seems possible the whole merry-go-round of property speculation will start again. The property tax is not proving to be something that will stop that. I do not believe it will, because that was not the reason for it in the first place. The presence or absence of a property tax did not explain in any way the reason we had a bubble at all or why we had speculation in housing. That was to do with the marketing of housing and the greed of developers and bankers. The amendment is well put. I do not believe the Minister of State will respond positively to it, but this year we will see increasing evidence that the property tax is wrong at any time. Alternatives to it should be sought.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This debate has been well rehearsed, and the Minister of State will get the last word, in any event. We will leave here disagreeing. However, I think it is indicative of the way the Minister of State approaches this that he said people live in assets. The point is they do not live in an asset. Most people do not live in an asset. They live in a home, in a house. They purchased it as a home and do not perceive it as an asset in that sense. Putting a roof over their heads is a prerequisite for civilised and dignified existence and for enabling them to function in society. That is the reason people go to great lengths and struggle and pay for their whole lives to put a roof over their heads. People are bitter and angry that after doing all that, they are now asked to pay again. The Minister of State has said that people realise the property tax is the best route to take, but I do not think that has happened nor that he believes that. People felt ambushed by the fact the collection of the tax was handed over to the Revenue and thought there was no way to continue a boycott. There had been a substantial boycott, particularly in the first year when there was an overwhelming boycott. The Minister of State should not fool himself about that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We shall agree to disagree. I am too young to remember what was said when rates were abolished. I have been told that when they were abolished - there is no question but that it was a populist move - a commitment was made to the electorate that VAT increases that subsequently followed would cover that move. VAT increased afterwards and people felt they paid. However, since then many other taxes have been added. A commitment was made to people at the time that they would not be asked to pay again. The Minister of State did not respond to my point. He and all of his spokespeople said that we should pay this charge, even if we do not like it, because we need to fund local services. The fact is that the Government has not increased the funding for local services, but has cut it. For many of the services that we used to get from paying taxes, we now have to pay charges anyway. There are charges for parking, for going into hospitals, increased rates, future charges for water and so on. People genuinely ask "What the hell are we paying for, because we have to pay charges anyway?" That is legitimate anger at double taxation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
