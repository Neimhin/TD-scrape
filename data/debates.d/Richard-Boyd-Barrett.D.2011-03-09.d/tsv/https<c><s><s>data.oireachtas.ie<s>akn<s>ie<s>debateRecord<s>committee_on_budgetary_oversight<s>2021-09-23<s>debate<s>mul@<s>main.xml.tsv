RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am slightly amused by the fact that there are two versions of the Minister's speech and that the difference between them is that in one there is a reference to the famous statement by Charlie McCreevy that, "When I have it, I spend it", and the extreme damage that policy pursued by a Fianna Fáil Government did in creating the conditions for the economic collapse in 2008. I am curious why the Minister included that in the first version of his speech but then removed it. I wonder whether his Government is not guilty of making the same mistake, particularly in the area of the significant expenditures that are going out on housing assistance payment, the rental accommodation scheme and leasing arrangements to private property interests because of the failure of the State to directly invest in and construct its own social housing stock. As a result, we are currently in a situation, and will be for the foreseeable future as I read the plans of the Government, of approximately €1 billion, a figure that will probably rise every year, going out in those sorts of payments to private property developers. Is that not a very significant and poor example of spending money in a profligate way that we should avoid? We need to replace that expenditure with direct investment in our own social housing stock, where the rental revenue will come back to the State and it would be able to reinvest those funds in more social housing.  A figure being bandied around for Housing for All is that it will cost €4 billion a year. I ask the Minister to confirm whether that is accurate. In our discussions with the Parliamentary Budget Office, it pointed out that the direct Exchequer funding is significantly less than that and that the Government is essentially hoping that more than 50% of the spending that would be required to deliver the 330,000 houses by the end of the period covered by Housing for All will come from the private sector. I ask the Minister to clarify that point. I will put all my questions now because I do not want the Minister to talk down the clock.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just in case. I refer to the distinction between current and capital expenditure. It often seems like a sensible distinction to make but, when examined closely, is often a false distinction.For example, we have significant skills and qualified professional shortages in a whole range of areas - the health service, construction and engineering and many other areas. It seems to me that the way to address that would be to create additional places in colleges and universities, which would be current expenditure, by creating additional places and removing things like fees and other obstacles to people accessing higher and postgraduate education. That would be current expenditure, but it would be an investment in the future which would save us money down the line. I would make a similar point about our proposal that we should have things like free public transport. It would be additional current expenditure, but in the future it would save us on things like fines for carbon emissions and so on. Therefore, I question the merits of that distinction in many areas. I could quote others but I do not have time. Lastly, I pushed at this committee, as did other members, for the examination of tax expenditures, which the committee has agreed to examine. There is a huge shadow budget that we have every year that is not scrutinised in the same way as the direct expenditure budget. We are proposing that those tax expenditures should be examined in the same sort of way during the budget as direct expenditures. I would like the Minister to comment on that, because in my opinion many of those tax expenditures are essentially tax loopholes which allow big corporations to evade tax. To give the Minister one example, and perhaps he might comment on it, in the latest available figures for revenue, the cost of intra-group transactions, a tax relief, in 2019 was to the tune of €16 billion in lost revenue. I presume that is accruing to some of the big multinational corporations that use transfer pricing to avoid their tax obligations. That is €16 billion in just one category of tax relief. Should these things frankly not be closed down, or at the very least examined in a detailed way as part of the budgetary process?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First, I would like the Minister to comment on the intra-group transactions and the capital allowances, which are the two biggest categories of tax reliefs. To my mind, they are examples of aggressive tax avoidance by major multinationals. Tax relief in this category amounted to €16 billion in 2019, around €6 billion in capital allowances and, of course, there is the research and development tax relief. I should also mention in respect of climate that the Minister is going to increase the carbon tax once again. The ESRI has stated that that is regressive for people on lower incomes when they have little control over their ability to reduce their energy use because of, for example, the quality of their housing. Is that not the case? Is the ESRI not correct? Is it not the case that it is going to increase fuel poverty, particularly given that, for example, in most local authorities next year the retrofit plans for social housing are for only 1% of the housing stock, so many people will have no control over the heating they need to keep their houses warm, and the Minister is going to punish them with further increases in the carbon tax?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not have time to go into it in detail, but I wish to mention in passing, following on from Deputy Hourigan's point about the digital gaming sector, that I do agree that in terms of investment in film - I do not think there is such a problem with animation - or any of these areas, we need to link the funding even more strictly to proper conditions of employment, pension entitlements and so on. I appreciate that the Minister has responded to issues that I have raised in respect of the film sector, but I want to inform him that the major recipients of section 481 film tax relief continue to essentially deny their responsibility to employees from one production to another, and indeed, continue practices of blacklisting employees who raise those issues. Despite the efforts of the Minister in that regard, they are signing declarations about compliance but then continuing as they have acted in the past. Further measures need to be taken there. I wish to raise the issue of revenue raising. We are alone in the Dáil in asserting that we should increase the corporation tax rate and that it is immoral, essentially, that corporations in this country pay a lower proportion of their, in many cases, staggering profits in tax than the average worker does. How does the Minister sustain, on moral grounds, defending the very low levels of tax against attempts at an international level to bring in some reform? There is no excuse now that there is a big international move to increase the tax contribution of these multinationals. On that general theme, given that we face huge challenges and crises in climate, housing and the health service that will require additional expenditure, should the Minister be looking at additional sources of revenue in the coming budget, particularly from sectors that have made big profits, or employers' PRSI, which is some of the lowest levels anywhere in Europe in this country, or financial transaction taxes or wealth taxes? These are things that would not punish ordinary workers who sustained us through the pandemic, but would begin to redistribute the vast accumulations of profits and wealth that continue to accumulate at the top of our society. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps the Minister could answer on the issue of other sources of revenue in the area of wealth taxes or whatever in the budget.
