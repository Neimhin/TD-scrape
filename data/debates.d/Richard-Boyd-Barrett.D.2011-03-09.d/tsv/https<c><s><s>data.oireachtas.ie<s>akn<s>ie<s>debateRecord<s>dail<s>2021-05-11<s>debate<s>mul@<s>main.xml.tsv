RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also believe we need statements on what is happening in Jerusalem. The particular spark for this event is the fact the Israeli authorities, prompted by settlers, are seeking to evict 28 families from the Sheikh Jarrah area of Jerusalem. It is worth saying that these people are already double refugees in that they were driven from Haifa and villages and towns throughout Palestine in 1948. Eventually, they found some home in places such as Sheikh Jarrah with the assistance of UN constructed housing. Now illegal settlers, with the assistance of the Israeli State, are trying to drive them out. Horrendous brutality is being used by the Israeli police against Palestinians who want to protest against this. It is just not acceptable. There needs to be clear statements. We also need the Government to call for actual sanctions against Israel for its horrendous treatment of the Palestinians.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I object to the vote on the national marine planning framework happening at all until there has been proper scrutiny of that framework by the relevant committees. This week, the Government has aroused the ire of people in the context of letting vulture funds run amok in this country and wrecking the housing sector on land. Now, exactly the same thing-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----is planned for the offshore by the same types of interests wishing to profit from Ireland's offshore with what are deemed relevant projects. It is not acceptable that this framework would be voted through until we have real and proper scrutiny of some of the investment interests that have grabbed pieces of our offshore and until proper environmental and biodiversity impact assessments are carried out.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Late in the day as it is and hollow sounding as it is, will the Taoiseach's claim that housing is now the Government's priority lead to any actual change in the disastrous policy that has led us to the housing crisis we are experiencing? There seems to be a grudging acknowledgement of what an absolute disaster Fine Gael and Labour made by allowing these vulture funds to come in and take over the housing sector. Will the Taoiseach follow through on the growing awareness of what a disaster that was by not allowing those same interests into the public land bank via the Land Development Agency Bill 2021? As it is currently constituted, the latter would effectively let the fox into the henhouse. I refer to the fox that wrecked the private housing sector being let into the public land bank. Will the Taoiseach realise the mistakes of the past and ensure that these vultures and cuckoos do not get into the public land bank through the legislation in question and will he accept amendments to the Bill to that effect?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They will be looked after well enough.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also think it is beyond despicable that the Stardust families are not being given legal aid. The Taoiseach should address that as a matter of absolute urgency because the families have been through enough and do not need further obstacles put in the way of their pursuit of justice. I wish to raise a matter I have raised with the Taoiseach a number of times, that is, the plight of people training to be psychologists. We have unacceptable waiting lists in this country for mental health services. Thousands of children, teenagers and adults are on waiting lists for mental health services and they are often urgently in need of counselling and psychological treatment. I have met three times with psychology students, most of whom are young but some of whom are older and have gone into psychology later in life. The most extraordinary barriers are being put in front of those students attempting to get doctorates in psychology. They must work as assistant psychologists without pay. Posts have been advertised recently to that effect and those are not isolated examples because the practice is going on all the time. People are paying extortionate fees for an education and counselling psychology doctorate and receive no funding whatsoever. There are a tiny number of places available. Students are working on placement without pay. There are extraordinary barriers that mean large numbers of people cannot get through the system. When we have all these waiting lists and a mental health crisis that needs to be addressed, why is the Government not making it easy and supporting people who want to become psychologists in order to address the mental health crisis and waiting lists in this area?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Earlier, the Taoiseach said that what defined the European Union was that it is an institution based on the idea of rules-based international co-operation. He argued that the European Union is a bulwark against extremism. Let us test that proposition against the EU's relationship with Israel on the day that Israel is, once again, committing war crimes in Gaza. As we speak, it is launching missiles which have claimed the lives of 28 innocent people in Gaza in the last 24 hours, including ten children. One of the dead was due to marry the day after tomorrow. This is indiscriminate murder of civilians. As we speak, Benjamin Netanyahu is saying that he has no intention of stopping. What did the European Union do? We heard words of sympathy and condemnation but no action against war crimes by the rogue state of Israel. What preceded the current missile strikes against Gaza? If one believes the false narrative about what goes on between Israel and the Palestinians, one is encouraged to believe this is some intractable conflict between two sides that, for some reason, cannot get on with one another. That is not the truth about Israel. What preceded this latest flare-up was the attempt to evict and ethnically cleanse – let us use the correct term – 28 families from the Sheikh Jarrah area of Jerusalem in order to replace those Palestinian families with illegal Jewish settlers. It is an attempt to evict them, take their homes and put other people in those homes. It is worth stating that those families in that area are now going to be double refugees because they came to Sheikh Jarrah after being ethnically cleansed from Haifa and Jaffa in 1948. In the year the Israeli state was founded and in one of the most barbaric acts of ethnic cleansing seen in the 20th century, close to 1 million people were expelled by Zionist terror gangs from their homes and villages and driven to the West Bank. They were left to fend for themselves and it was only later that the United Nations helped them build refugee camps and new homes. Now, they are being evicted again contrary to law and international rules, which the EU is supposed to uphold. They are doing it again. During the holy month of Ramadan, Palestinians were blocked from going on to the Temple Mount in an orchestrated, premeditated military action by the Israel authorities in order to provoke the Palestinians while they continued the campaign of illegal settlements and ethnic cleansing. Annexation is much too nice a word for it. This is ethnic cleansing. What is happening in Gaza today is a crime against humanity. It is a crime against humanity that, on an ongoing, systematic and orchestrated basis, Israel continues to ethnically cleanse the Palestinians, as it has done since the beginning of the state in 1948. People need to understand that. In Ireland, more than ever, we should know of the need to show our affinity with the Palestinians and move beyond words of concern to action. I wonder whether people know that in 1936, the military governor of Jerusalem, Sir Ronald Storrs, explained what the plan was for the Israeli state, which was to be set up in 1948. He was the first military governor general since Pontius Pilate, sent in as part of the Sykes–Picot carve-up of the Middle East and the Balfour Declaration, which was to support the plan for the new state that Britain would support. How did he describe the Israeli state they were planning to build? He said that “we want to build a little loyal Jewish Ulster in a sea of potentially hostile Arabism”. Balfour, who had signed the declaration, and Herbert Samuel, another of the main figures, had been involved in Ireland in suppressing land protests in the late 19th century. Samuel interned 2,000 people after 1916 and oversaw the hanging of Roger Casement. He and Balfour went on to become senior figures in mandate Palestine, planning the establishment of the Israeli state, the partition of Palestine and the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians in order to create a loyal little Jewish Ulster amidst a sea of potential hostile Arabism. In other words, it was for the great powers to control the Middle East at the expense of the Palestinians and causing decades of conflict, division, murder, tyranny, the denial of democracy and all the horrors the Palestinians and people of the Middle East have had to suffer. Who is Israel’s biggest trading partner? It is the European Union. Last year, the EU and Israel did €31 billion worth of trade. All the weasel words and words of sympathy from European leaders, when they do nothing about the murderous criminal activity that Israel is engaged in, are hollow and the Taoiseach’s premise that the European Union is a rules-based international guardian is nonsense.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Sinn Féin for using its Private Members' time to raise this important issue. The Government has learned absolutely nothing from the disastrous mistakes that have led to the current housing crisis. The two mistakes were the disastrous decision to invite in the vulture funds, cuckoo funds and speculators, particularly in 2013 and 2014, and the simultaneous and equally disastrous decision by the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government to essentially stop the building of public housing directly by local authorities. Fianna Fáil started those mistakes when it set up NAMA and increasingly outsourced and cut back the provision of social housing. However, Fine Gael and the Labour Party turned a bad situation into a disaster in 2013-14 with the two decisions to stop building council housing and to bring in the vulture funds with tax incentives, etc. Those are the reasons. First, NAMA handed over more than €40 billion worth of land and property assets to these vultures, giving them significant control over the market. It gets worse, however, because these funds are now buying up new builds. We are now being told that despite the disastrous situation these vultures have created, we cannot do without them. You only need to google the profits of some of these entities - anybody can do it - to see what enormous fortunes they have made. The worse the housing crisis is, the more valuable their assets are, the more profits they make, the more rents they can charge, and the higher the prices of the properties they sell. It is a simple equation. While they control the market, they have no interest in solving the housing crisis. This is the simple truth the Government does not understand. Now the Government wants to compound this disastrous situation by not only allowing these funds to have control of the private housing sector but to open up the public land bank to them with the Land Development Agency Bill that will go through next week. I cannot ring the alarm bells enough for the public out there about what the Land Development Agency, LDA, is. This is letting the fox into the hen house to plunder all of the public land bank. The one thing that could dampen the market and counteract the influence of these people is for the State, on a large scale, to build its own stock of public and genuinely affordable housing. I see the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, nod and then I look at the figures for 2020. Last year, 269 council houses were built in the four local authority areas in Dublin where the crisis is most acute. The figures in Galway, Cork and so on are similarly pathetic.In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown the number is zero. Zero council houses were built. A few were provided by AHBs and most of the rest were provided through HAP or the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, that is, outsourced to these funds that are making a fortune. The result is situations like that faced by residents in St. Helen's Court in Dún Laoghaire, which has been going on for four years. The property was sold by NAMA to Apollo Global Management, represented by PwC. It was flipped on to Mill Street Projects Limited, which has made four attempts to evict the tenants. Some tenants have been driven out while others - ordinary working people - are accused of over-holding and are facing homelessness. The owners want to drive up the value of the property but what has the Government done to stop this? It has done nothing. What we need is to start building public and affordable housing on public land. We also need punitive taxes on vacant properties and vacant sites and rent controls. We need to stop the tax breaks for these vultures and to completely exclude them from the housing market. Were we to do those things, we could start to solve the housing disaster the Government's policies has created.
