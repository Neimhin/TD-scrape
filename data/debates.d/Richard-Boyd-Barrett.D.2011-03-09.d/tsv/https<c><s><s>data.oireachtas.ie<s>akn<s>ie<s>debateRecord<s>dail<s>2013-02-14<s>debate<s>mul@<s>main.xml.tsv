RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Chair give me a five minute warning?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Like a number of other speakers, I protest in the strongest terms about the fact that the debate has been guillotined.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a credible, consistent pattern from the Government that promised a democratic revolution-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and a new level of transparency in Irish politics-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As if the Government does not get enough time, it has to heckle Opposition speakers. Do you not get enough time?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not good enough now?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Show a bit of dignity for your office. There is a consistent pattern of the Government allowing Bills which are not unimportant - but which would not be the most important for the public or Members of the Opposition - to drag on for weeks on end. When it comes to important issues like the potential privatisation of water and the certainty of imposing charges however, the Government wants to impose guillotines to close off debate. It has been done again and again by the Government which promised a new type of politics. There is a reason it is being done with this particular Bill. The legislation gets to the heart of the agenda of the Government and the troika and the sinister desire to loot public resources and State enterprises under the cover of the current economic crisis. We have had consistent dishonesty from the Government side throughout the debate. There have been red herrings about how the Bill is about water conservation and improving the water infrastructure. These things are said to justify the necessity for water charges and the establishment of the new water company. It is all nonsense and deliberate deceit. We are discussing the establishment of this company, water metering across the country and the introduction of water charges because it was agreed with the troika. The reason we agree anything with the troika, including this proposal, is because this and the last Government decided that the country should pay any price to bail out banks and financial institutions here and in Europe. That is the only reason we are discussing this. That is why it is in the programme for Government. It is a commitment to which the Government is tied because it has continued with the programme of bailing out the banks just as the last Government did. Spare us, therefore, the drivel about concern for water conservation or improving the water infrastructure. I am a fan of the writer James Joyce, Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am making a point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Writing in his most famous novel Ulysses between 1914 and 1921, he complains about the failure of the authorities to rehabilitate the country's decrepit water infrastructure. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have been in power ever since and we have the same decrepit water infrastructure as we had when Joyce was writing about it at the beginning of the last century. Spare us the nonsense.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Spare us the nonsense of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael who have had the power to rehabilitate a water infrastructure which has been utterly decrepit for the last 70 years but have done nothing to the point that 50% of the water supply leaks out of our pipes and mains.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You guys are responsible for that and you did nothing about it. Now, under the auspices of the troika deal, the Government is moving to introduce charges and metering and to establish this company.The agenda is very simple because Fine Gael has had it for a long time. It tried to introduce water charges before and was defeated by mass public opposition. Its agenda is the same as that of the European Union and the IMF. Everywhere the IMF has gone it has demanded the privatisation of water services and the introduction of water charges and always the results have been the same, massively increased costs for ordinary citizens and a massive bonanza of profits for private corporations and multinational companies. That is the agenda being pursued - the privatisation of public resources for private profit. Once the Bill is passed, as sure as night follows day, our water resources will be on the road towards privatisation. I am not the only one saying this. I have been trumpeting this for a while and I hope the media will pick up on it. We will be required to privatise our water resources once the Government begins charging for them because EU law demands it. It is as simple as that. I see the Minister of State's officials shaking their heads. I will read from the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 106, which the Minister of State can read it afterwards: "Undertakings entrusted with the operation of services of general economic interest or having the character of a revenue-producing monopoly shall be subject to the rules contained in the Treaties, in particular to the rules on competition". That will be legally enforceable once we start to charge. Irish Water will be a "revenue-producing monopoly" subject to the rules of competition, which means any private corporation that wants to get into the market will have the legal right to a level playing field. We will have market competition in the water sector and privatisation will follow, just as it did once we began to charge for waste collection. Other private companies began to complain to local authorities that there had to be a level playing field and it led inexorably to privatisation, as those of us who opposed the introduction of bin charges said it would. Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil at the time denied it, saying it would not lead to privatisation and that actually charging would prevent privatisation. It did not, rather it led inexorably to privatisation and so will this. That is the real agenda and the troika, the IMF, and the European Commission are well aware of it. They want to plunder our water resources to the benefit of the same corporate interests that helped to bankrupt this country in the first place. The consequences of privatisation have been disastrous everywhere. A recent report by Corporate Accountability International, Shutting the Spigot on Private Water, the Case for the World Bank to Divest, points out that 34% of all water contracts market-wide entered between 2000 and 2010 have failed or are in distress, four times the failure rate of comparable infrastructural projects in the electric and transportation sectors. The report, published on the tenth anniversary of what I am glad to say was the failed attempt to privatise water services in Bolivia where it was defeated by a mass movement of the Bolivian people, goes on to state, "public investment in infrastructure has proven time and again to be the only viable means of delivering broad and equitable access to water". The UN world water report in 2006 noted something very important: "There is enough water for everyone". It added that water insufficiency was often due to "mismanagement, corruption, lack of appropriate institutions, bureaucratic inertia and a shortage of new investments in building human capacity and physical infrastructure". That is certainly right. In a country where it pours down day in and day out we have water shortages because of the gross failure of the political and State authorities to make the necessary investment in water infrastructure. There is no objective shortage of water, but private interests have it in their interest that people see it that way to justify charging for water. The Minister of State will say charging, which will lead to privatisation, will improve matters, but the experience has been terrible absolutely everywhere. In our nearest neighbour, Britain, the facts are clear. Margaret Thatcher privatised water services and prices increased dramatically year on year. Profits for the private corporations went through the roof. Companies exaggerated the level of investment they would make but failed to deliver that investment and instead used it to increase shareholder dividends. There was a massive concentration of ownership in the hands of multinationals, mostly American, French and British. There were executive pay bonanzas as the amount executives paid themselves went through the roof. Jobs were lost everywhere and disconnections of water supply increased. Public health deteriorated and the level of investment in water infrastructure fell overall, with the result that water quality deteriorated. Incredible droughts occurred in parts of Britain and public cynicism about the conservation of water reached all-time highs because people knew that private companies did not give a damn about conservation but cared only about profit. People were turned off the green agenda for water conservation because they knew that the only beneficiaries were the private companies. Private water companies have also been some of the biggest culprits in big pollution scandals; 205 major pollution occurrences in Britain were caused by private water companies. I do not have time to go through all the statistics, but they are shocking. After the first four years of privatisation prices increased by 50% and by a further 18% in the five years after that. Meanwhile profits went through the roof. The pre-tax profits of private water companies doubled in the first year of privatisation and rose by 142% in real terms over eight years. Between 1990-1 and 1997-8 the pre-tax profits of the ten water and sewerage companies rose by 140%, with sewerage and water prices rising respectively by 42% and 36%, a direct correlation between increased profits for the private companies and shareholders and increased prices for the poor domestic user of water. That is what has happened everywhere and the investment in infrastructure has not happened. In fact, the percentage of the British water system now considered to be completely substandard has increased since water services privatisation. The idea that involving the private sector will be in any way beneficial is rubbish. There is no evidence to back it up. It will be a profits bonanza because the private companies will have a captive market which needs water and the Government is going to help them legally to get money from people for a resource that is necessary for human life. The cross-over between the financial crisis in the State, Fine Gael's and the troika's privatisation agenda and the injustice facing ordinary citizens is exposed when we consider that one of the companies in the offing for water meter installation is owned by the billionaire Mr. Denis O'Brien who has bought out Siteserv.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not mention his name again. Anyway, we all know who it is. Siteserv will provide contracting services for Bord Gáis. When this company was taken over, it had €110 million written off a €150 million debt owed to Anglo Irish Bank when the bank was under State control. To my mind, that says it all about what is going on. The corporate vultures in this country and elsewhere in Europe know that if one gets hold of a water company, it is a money bonanza forever and a day. The same corporate interests which have grabbed control of our media and money-making services that ordinary people need are moving into water services because this is the first step in the privatisation of that infrastructure. Ordinary people will end up paying for this. Fine Gael has long supported the introduction of water charges and privatisation. It is sickening in the extreme that the Labour Party is now complicit in this agenda. I have a leaflet produced by the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, for his constituency in the early 1990s. It reads: “Water charges are just another tax on workers on top of PAYE, PRSI and levies”. How right he was. It goes on to boast about the fact that Democratic Left, under his leadership and others, had successfully defeated the agenda of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to introduce water charges. Some other lines are absolutely priceless. For example, he attacked the Fianna Fáil-Labour Party Government for demanding more from the PAYE taxpayer, while cutting mortgage interest relief, VHI relief and imposing a residential property tax. The leaflet then declares, “Now, they want to make us pay for water”. How right he was to condemn this and resist it, as people did successfully. How sickening it is that he is now a party to imposing that injustice on citizens who are in a far greater state of financial distress than when he wrote that leaflet. The only answer to this agenda of piling austerity measures and charges on ordinary citizens is for them to do what the people of Bolivia did. They must get out on the streets to resist and mobilise against this attempt to rifle our natural resources, whether it is water, forests which the Government is now planning to sell off, or our oil and gas given away to multinational corporations. These are the very tools that could be used to generate economic recovery and provide employment. However, they are being given away to profiteers and the country will pay a terrible price if the Government gets away with it. We will be resisting it every step of the way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is friendly with the Chinese dictators, but they are our enemies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the European treaties?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State is right in that regard.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will agree with him on that one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State is straying.
