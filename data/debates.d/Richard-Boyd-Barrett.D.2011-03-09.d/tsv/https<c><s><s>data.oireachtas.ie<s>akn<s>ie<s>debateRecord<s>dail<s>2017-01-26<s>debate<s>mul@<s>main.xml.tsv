RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not time to simply admit that the Minister, Deputy Coveney's Rebuilding Ireland plan is a total and abject failure that has failed utterly to deal with the escalating housing and homeless emergency? For over a year now, the Government has been talking about this plan as a panacea for the crisis yet day by day, the situation gets worse not better. Today we have highlighted that we have reached a shocking and unprecedented level of 7,100 people in emergency accommodation, including 2,500 children. The housing assistance payment limits, which the Government has put in place and which are a central pillar of its entire so-called solution to the housing crisis, are grossly inadequate for the extortionate rents that are now being charged. In my area and in the whole of south Dublin, there is one one-bedroom apartment within the limits.There are two two-bedroom residential units within the limits today. That comes against the background of an absolutely disastrous crisis. To add further insult to all of that, the Government has flogged or allowed to be sold via NAMA and the banks we bailed out vast amounts of property and building land where these companies, which make extortionate profits and pay no tax on them, can jack up rents and make people homeless. In my own area, just before Christmas, on 23 December, a vulture fund that bought an apartment block put up rents in the entire block by up to 175%. That was on the day the legislation was supposed to come into force. The vulture funds doing this are paying no tax. Last year, Cerberus had €77 million in profits but paid €1,900 in tax. Lone Star paid $34.6 million in dividends to shareholders abroad. The Government has allowed that to happen and its policy has actively facilitated it but now it plans to worsen the issue by selling two thirds of public land in key sites such as Shanganagh Castle in Shankill in my own area, the Oscar Traynor Road site and other publicly owned sites. It will sell virtually the whole of the Irish Glass Bottle site or Cherrywood via NAMA and we will only get 10% back on sites. Will the Minister stop this? Will he stop digging the hole that is causing such misery for people suffering from the housing crisis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Government change tack?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The facts speak for themselves. The number of people in homeless accommodation has increased by 91% in the past two years and 34% in the past year since this Government came to office. How the Minister can possibly claim it is working is beyond me. There is the issue of the disposal of sites like those on Oscar Traynor Road, Shanganagh in Shankill or the NAMA sites in Cherrywood and so on. If these are given to private developers, how will they be affordable? They will not. The Government has not defined affordable housing. Public housing is affordable but sites that previously would have seen 100% public housing will now only have one third with public housing, with the rest controlled by the private sector. They will control the rents or property prices, which will not be affordable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is true. It is a fact. What does the Minister say about the Irish Glass Bottle site? Only 10% of that site - a NAMA site for which this country paid a bitter price - will be social housing. Why is it not 100% social housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In my area there is talk about provision.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We had 290 extra so-called social units but there were only 74 real new units while 560 extra people joined the list. That means twice as many people joined the list as units provided.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have been hearing that for a long time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am returning to the issue of equal pay for equal work. As the Minister knows, members of the Association of Secondary Teachers in Ireland are balloting this month. Quite rightly, the association's central executive is recommending the rejection of the Government's proposals. The Government is continuing to refuse to commit to the simple principle of equal pay for equal work for which workers have been fighting since the 19th century. There used to be a pay gap on gender grounds. We now consider it completely unacceptable for women to be paid less than men for doing the same job. It somehow seems acceptable to this Government that young workers should be paid less for doing the exact same job in the exact same school on the basis that they are younger and started work after 2012. What does the Minister intend to do about it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With respect, the Minister's waffle is not an answer to my question about equal pay for equal work. Under the new proposals, a person who started teaching after 2011 will earn €6,000 less in his or her first year of teaching than somebody doing the same job who happened to come in before 2011. That figure will be €5,800 in the second and third years of teaching and €6,000 in the fourth year. This pattern will continue until the ninth year, when the pay gap will be €8,500. Service officers and ushers in the Oireachtas are affected by this. Those who came in after 2012 get 10% less than those who came in previously. People who are working in this building are being paid €2,500 less for doing exactly the same job. Does the Minister think that is acceptable? I do not. Will he commit to equal pay for equal work? Does the Minister agree it is ironic that the actions of teachers and gardaí who took industrial action and refused to accept the Lansdowne Road agreement have forced him to give an extra €1,000 to those inside the agreement, but he will not give this payment to those who actually fought to achieve it? Essentially, he is putting the Sword of Damocles over their heads.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The message the Government is sending when it issues this threat is "it is our way or the highway". I remind the House that no trade unionist ever had a ballot on the system of pay apartheid that was unilaterally imposed by the Government to deny young people equal pay for equal work. Given that new-entrant nurses are receiving 10% less pay than existing nurses, is the Minister surprised that the Government is unable to recruit nurses at a time when everybody acknowledges more nurses are needed? When that is considered alongside the mess in the health service, it is no wonder they do not want to work here. This problem is going to get worse as the need for public sector recruitment increases. Even more workers will join the teachers in being paid less when they come in. How are they supposed to afford a roof over their heads? The Minister is simply not addressing the issue of equality about which I asked him. The Government could make Apple pay its taxes to pay for this. That would be an alternative way of boosting the budget.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point is that we do not accept the Minister must rob Peter to pay Paul. Workers are entitled to pay restoration, even in excess of the proposed €1,000, but we do not accept that money should be taken from services to fund that. We are seeking a commitment that services which are starved of funding will not be hit as a result of this measure. The Minister likes to ask where else the money will come from. We are tired of telling him that his envelope is too small because he consistently resists our appeals to him to look elsewhere for additional revenue. Additional moneys could be found by making the vulture funds and companies like Apple pay their taxes, by introducing a financial transaction tax, and by obliging landlords and higher earners to pay more taxes. There is plenty of money to be had and it should be used to redistribute the wealth in this country in a fair way, which allows us both to fund public services and give public sector and other workers decent pay levels.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that literally or figuratively?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us be clear. I want to see pay restoration and a hell of a lot more of it. I was talking to some of the service officers in here and they are nearly crying as a result of some of the pay levels they have to put up with. They need this pay. What I do not like, which was implicit in what the Minister said, is that it is essentially one or the other - it is services that are cash starved or it is pay. We do not accept that. We want the details, which the Minister would expect of us, as Deputy Cullinane said. It is not just hypothetical. We have been laughed at and ridiculed by the Minister when we put forward other tax revenue-raising proposals. He said they were nonsense, that he wanted costings and that they would destroy the economy and so on. The Minister insists on detail and he is not prepared to provide any such detail. As a result, we are concerned that this is a case of robbing Peter to pay Paul. The Minister has an obligation to tell us from where the money is coming.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, is aware, Ardmore Studios is synonymous with the Irish film industry. It is, in effect, the birthplace of the Irish film industry as an industry. Since it opened in 1958, it has propelled Irish film making into the top flight of film making in the world.It has played host to some of the greatest actors in the world - Richard Burton, Fred Astaire, Mel Gibson and Ralph Fiennes. Some amazing films have been produced at Ardmore, winning a total of 14 Oscars and numerous BAFTAs, Emmys, Golden Globes, etc. From the point of view of the local area, Ardmore Studios are critical. They are responsible for 500 direct jobs and thousands of indirect jobs. I understand that 500 people attended a public meeting in Bray last night -unfortunately, I could not be present because the House was debating the Stardust tragedy - at which it was stated that the studios are responsible for up to 8,000 or 9,000 indirect jobs. The Minister will be aware, not only from the Wicklow and Bray area, that there are many tradespeople, creative individuals and those merely who only appear in productions as extras who are constantly working in Ardmore. Any threat or possibility that Ardmore Studios might cease to operate would simply be unacceptable. It would be the destruction of a central part of our film heritage and culture and, obviously, a massive economic blow to a large number of people and to a wide catchment area. I talked to some of the trade unionists involved, who welcomed the fact the Minister had engaged with them. What everybody wants to hear is that there will be a commitment that, one way or another, Ardmore Studios will be kept as a going concern and that whatever is necessary will be done to ensure that happens. Under no circumstances should we allow a situation whereby Ardmore might be bought by property speculators or whatever. The facility should be maintained. We should use initiatives at local level to ensure that the whole complex is zoned for film production only. The Government should also step in and take whatever action is necessary. Enterprise Ireland already has an obligation to ensure that the jobs and the industry are retained. Whatever other initiatives are necessary should be taken. A point made by the workers who spoke to me earlier is that in so far as subsidies are given to domestic film production companies, there is an absence of the obligations on such companies to use facilities such as Ardmore. If this were done, it might ensure that there is joined-up thinking across the film sector. A proposal of which the Minister will be aware is that relating to a possible buy-out by the workers. I am of the view that this would be the optimum solution, particularly as it would involve those with all the fantastic skills necessary for film production. Everybody I talk to in the film sector states that the technical skill level at Ardmore is second to none. A workers' buy-out, facilitated by the Government, would be another solution. I hope the Minister can give us words of comfort to the effect that Ardmore Studios will be retained in order that they might play a critical role in Ireland's film industry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At many levels, I welcome what the Minister says, but there are a few details I would like to hear to be more assured. First, there should be absolutely no consideration of the Government selling its stake in Ardmore. Critical to maintaining it is for the Government to retain that stake. The zoning itself is not sufficient protection because the facility could be bought, somebody could sit on it for a couple of years and if it is left derelict, the zoning could be changed further down the line. What we need now is intervention of a level sufficient to ensure that it continues as a working studio, whether that is a viable film-making concern taking over the private share that is being sold by Mr. Ossie Kilkenny and Mr. Paul McGuinness, facilitating a workers' buy-out as has been suggested or even full-scale nationalisation if that is necessary in order to sustain the facility. I would not want to put a figure on the facility's overall value but it was suggested at yesterday's meeting that the economic impact in one year of that studio - working at full capacity and in full production - is three or four times' the amount for which it might be sold. The value to the local area and the economy in terms of employment is several multiples of what we might have to pay for it if we decided to nationalise it, if that is necessary. What we need is a commitment that no option will be considered that will lead to its closure and that whatever action is necessary to ensure its survival will be taken by the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The workers have the expertise.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not asking for Enterprise Ireland.
