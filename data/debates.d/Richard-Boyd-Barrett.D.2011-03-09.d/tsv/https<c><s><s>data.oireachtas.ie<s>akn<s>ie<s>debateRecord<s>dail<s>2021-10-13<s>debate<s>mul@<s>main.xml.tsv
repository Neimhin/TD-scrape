RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Owen Keegan showed utter contempt for students and the crisis they face with accommodation costs. I put it to the Minister that the Government has not been far off in its contempt due to its failure to address the student poverty crisis and the cost of student accommodation. There are no measures whatsoever in the budget to deal with the extortionate cost of accommodation and the student accommodation crisis, and nothing about reducing the student contribution charge.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The student grants have not gone up for nearly a decade so the small patch-up we saw in the budget yesterday does not go anywhere near dealing with the cost of living and, in particular, the accommodation cost hikes we have seen. In three months alone this summer in Dublin there was a 5.6% rise in rents. That was on top of an almost 5% increase the year before. Average rents in Dublin are running at about €2,000 per month and then there is the issue of fees. The Union of Students in Ireland, ourselves and others have been asking the Minister to get rid of the student contribution charge. Whenever I meet students, whether they are undergraduates or postgraduates, they talk about the fees. People pay €15,000 to do psychology, allied health professional courses, PhDs and masters courses and then the bulk of students pay €3,000 a year. They asked the Minister to reduce the fees by even €1,000 but nothing was done. I put it to the Minister that with the cost of living increases, the fees and so on, student poverty has not been addressed in the budget in any way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government gave €63 million to KBC Bank Ireland and Ulster Bank yesterday as a goodbye present as they exit the Irish market, so I ask the Minister not to tell me about the €60 million, which is less than that, which the Government gave to students. Students will be outside Dublin City Council today and I will be speaking to them, as will other Members. You need only talk to students to determine why they are on the streets. The issue of student accommodation was not an acute crisis ten years ago the way it is now. The issue of fees is a major barrier to us dealing with some of the skills shortages we have in this country. Anybody who is trying to do a masters or postgraduate degree will tell the Minister they are crippled by fees and the student nurses are still not being paid for placement. Student poverty is a reality, and it is not just bad for the students but it is also bad for our society. This was not seriously addressed in the budget and there were a lot more giveaways for the banks, the special assignee relief programme and God knows what else than there were for students.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This morning, the Tánaiste said that most people in this country will be better off after yesterday's budget and the Taoiseach has more or less reiterated that myth. It is critical to puncture that myth and get across the truth about what happened in yesterday's budget. Using even the most elementary arithmetic, looking at the details of the budget will show that is not true. The Minister, Deputy Donohoe, pointed out that inflation is running at 3.7%. The Tánaiste actually got the figure wrong this morning and said it was less than 3%, but at least the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, knows what the rate of inflation is. Added to that are the carbon tax increases and the energy price hikes. I want to zone in on one particular group and I want to use examples from the Government's own budget documentation to show how it disgracefully let down renters in this country. Its claim that little adjustments to USC compensate for that is simply not true. I will use some of the examples because I actually bothered to read the Government's budget books. The booklet entitled, Tax Policy Changes, gives example 3 of Mairéad, who is single and works in the hospitality sector earning €30,000 a year. Given that Mairéad works in hospitality and is single, it is very likely she is a renter. The booklet also gives the example of Roan, who is self-employed earning €40,000 a year, and Nicole with one child. Very likely they are renters. How much of a break on the tax they pay has the Government given them? Mairéad got the grand total of 0.5% more. Roan and Nicole got 0.5%. They along with the majority of people in this country are earning average industrial wages or median wages but the inflation rate is 3.7%. The rise in the cost of living will wipe out by about five or six times what the Government has given to Mairéad, and Roan and Nicole. However, the situation for rent is even worse. Average rents in Dublin now are in fact higher than Deputy McDonald pointed out. The August Daft.ie report pointed out that average rents in Dublin are €2,200 in south County Dublin and just marginally under €2,000 in Dublin city. In the three months of the second quarter of this year, they increased by 5.7%, on top of 4.4% last year. Of course, many people in rented accommodation also have poor-quality, badly insulated homes and they have no control over energy price hikes. Is it not actually the truth that the Government has done nothing for Mairéad or for Roan, Nicole and their child? The vast majority of renters are seeing rents go through the roof and become completely unaffordable along with other costs they must bear like energy costs, carbon tax increases and so on. Is it not the truth that the Government has badly let them down?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have a different view about how to deal with rents than some of the other Opposition parties. We believe we should control rents, as is done in other countries, and set rents at affordable levels based on people's income and the size of the property, not refunds or things that will inflate the market, but actual rent controls. I go back to the example of Mairéad. Based on average Dublin rents, Mairéad is paying between €18,000 and €24,000 a year in rent after tax on her income of €30,000. It is similar for Roan and Nicole. How are they possibly supposed to manage that? How do the abysmal and derisory measures just referred to by the Taoiseach in any way deal with that? They simply do not, and for the Taoiseach to mention HAP is just unbelievable. The vast majority of people with HAP in Dublin are making top-up payments to landlords because the HAP limits are too low, so the landlords are creaming it with public money they are getting as part of these rents of between €1,800 and €2,200 per month. In addition, they are getting tax breaks on the rental revenue and capital gains they make on the property. That is while Mairéad, Roan, Nicole and their child, along with tens of thousands of other renters, are being absolutely screwed to the wall. There is not one word in the budget books about renters. There is not a single word.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are but it must be genuinely affordable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We opposed the selling of public lands.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There was lots of supply during the Celtic tiger.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Unaffordable supply is not useful to Roan and Nicole.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should have a referendum on it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will repeat a point that Deputy Barry made and I also made earlier. It is amazing there is not more scrutiny of the simple fact the Minister told us yesterday that inflation is running at 3.7% and yet, as I highlighted earlier, somebody who is on the average industrial wage of €40,000 a year is getting, as a result of the tax changes the Government has brought in, less than 0.5% in increased net income. That amounts to €115 for the entire year. That does not reach the threshold of national fiver day. If you do the maths, it works out as a little over €2 for somebody on average industrial earnings. For those on the median wage of approximately €30,000, the changes will mean an increase of 0.5%. That is against a background of multiple energy price hikes, which will amount to €500, €600, €700 or €800. Most working people will not get a fuel allowance at all but, for those who do, it will not nearly cover the costs. They will also be loaded with carbon tax. Many of them are also paying property tax increases. I will warn the Government that there is a lot of anger building as people are starting to receive bigger bills as they are put into higher valuation bands for the property tax and are facing increased bills on their own homes. The truth is the Government has cut people's incomes. That is what inflation does. Inflation is a way of taking back from working people. Price rises eat into people's incomes. They have less money for bills and rent, to buy things for their children and to bear the myriad costs that are rising. Of course, the most important of those costs is the cost of accommodation. There was absolutely no mention of renters anywhere in the budget speeches or on the budget books. There was no mention of the student accommodation crisis. I have just come from the student protest, where they are absolutely raging. There was no mention of the situation they are in. All they get is contempt from the chief executive of Dublin City Council about their plight. The Minister is nodding. Let us be clear, the proliferation of for-profit development all over this city, which is at the centre of this debacle, has been facilitated by successive governments involving or supported by Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and their coalition partners. This has been allowed. If you walk out the door of Leinster House, you will see hotel after hotel, aparthotels, co-living developments, strategic housing developments, you name it. All of them are totally unaffordable. Rents are extortionate. Tax breaks are available for these people to beat the band. The building and labour capacity that is necessary to deliver affordable student accommodation and public housing is being diverted. People are being ripped off by stealth in this budget with its failure to deal with those issues and when the cost of all of them is rising. I will add to the point about transport. I heard an anchor broadcaster say today that every Department got extra money. No, they did not. The Department of Transport saw a cut of 4%. That is a significant cut, but it is even worse when it is made by a Green Party Minister. Seriously? We need massive investment in public transport. We need it to be cheaper and more frequent. We need more public service routes but the public service obligation budget has been cut. I do not know if some of these figures are misprints but I am gobsmacked by them. You need to read the appendices of budgets. There are references to carbon reduction and public transport, for which last year's budget was €2.4 billion and this year's budget is €900 million. That is a dramatic reduction. There is another drop outlined in the section on climate leadership. Last year's budget was €218 million while this year's is €96 million. That is another major cut from a Green Party Minister and Government. It is absolutely shocking. The social housing eligibility threshold not being raised is an absolute disgrace, and even as we speak, I am dealing with families who have been thrown off the housing list even though they are in homeless accommodation with children because their income edged slightly over the threshold. That is also an absolute disgrace.
