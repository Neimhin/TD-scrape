RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a bit embarrassing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are times when debate in this House is surreal, and this is one of them. Apparently, we are just dreaming up the idea that there are moves in the EU to create a European army.This is a German-led EU battle group so what did Chancellor Angela Merkel say, as the German Head of State? She said, in front of the European Parliament at the beginning of this year: "We have to look at the vision of one day creating a real, true, European army." A couple of days before that, she signed an accord with Emmanuel Macron, also a supporter of an EU army, which said they wanted to create a common military culture as a step towards the creation of a European army. That is what the battle groups are about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Battle groups are about creating a common military culture as a step towards the creation of a European army. Various governments, including ours, seem to be willing to send troops into deadly and dangerous missions because they have just sent troops to Mali. Some of those supporting this battle group opposed that deployment to Mali - not Fianna FÃ¡il, of course - but we are clearly being pushed down a slippery slope by the Government towards involvement in an EU army. Why does the Government not pay our soldiers instead? Why will it not show us what is in the Public Service Pay Commission report instead of wasting money on this stuff and putting our troops in danger or involvement in a European military project? Why not pay the soldiers? Why not show us what is in the report? Why not pay the rangers who have just been sent to Mali the arbitration award that was granted in 2010, which the Government is refusing to pay? The Government does not respect, and will not pay, our soldiers, many of whom live in poverty, but the Government is quite happy to breach Ireland's neutrality, get them involved in an EU army and send them into dangerous missions in which we should not be involved such as those in Mali.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They have to be paid.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To pay them the arbitration award you owe them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Government have the capacity to pay them?
