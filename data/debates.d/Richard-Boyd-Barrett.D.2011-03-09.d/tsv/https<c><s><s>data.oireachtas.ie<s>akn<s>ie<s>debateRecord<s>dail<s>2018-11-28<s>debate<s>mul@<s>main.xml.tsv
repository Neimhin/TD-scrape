RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My question points to what I argue is a rapidly escalating crisis in almost every aspect of third level education.That crisis encompasses matters such as student poverty, the student accommodation crisis and the chronic underinvestment in third-level education generally. There has been an incredible 50% drop in investment per student since 2008. This crisis will bite very badly at every level and will cause hardship among many students unless we address it by means of significant increases in investment and assistance for students experiencing accommodation problems, poverty, difficulties paying fees and so on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It sounds good until we look at the facts. With regard to access, 90% of students in Donnybrook attend university but 16% of students in Darndale do so. This reflects the fact there are so many different barriers to access. The cost of living per annum while studying at third level is €12,000, which is a big expense. We have some of the highest registration fees anywhere in Europe and accommodation costs increased 11.5% in the first quarter of 2018 alone. Ms Michelle Byrne, vice president of the Union of Students in Ireland, USI, spoke at a meeting we held during the week and she told me an incredible story that she says is typical. She related how a young postgraduate student is travelling every day from Cork to Dublin and back again to attend her third-level institution because she cannot afford student accommodation. At Dublin City University, student accommodation providers tried to increase rents by 27%. The Irish Universities Association has pointed out that we now have one of the lowest levels of investment per student anywhere in Europe and, as already stated, that investment has dropped 50% since 2008. There was only a 1% overall increase in the recent budget, which is not good enough.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There has been a proliferation of private developments of student accommodation. This accommodation costs an absolute fortune. It is a complete waste of time because people are just making money out of a student accommodation crisis. We need purpose-built low-cost student accommodation on or near campuses. That needs significant investment. I will make a simple point on overall investment in third-level education. We give €700 million in research and development tax credits, mostly to big multinationals in this country. That money should be redirected to our universities and third-level education. Instead of giving money to Apple and Google through tax breaks for so-called research and development, it should go to our universities in order to offset the chronic underinvestment to which I refer. This crisis is taking a serious toll on students. We have the fourth highest rate of youth suicide in the world. The USI report indicates an absolutely massive demand for counselling services in universities, with tens of thousands of students needing counselling and a large number reporting burnout or an inability to carry on because of the stress they are being put under on all fronts, including in the context of costs, accommodation, overcrowding, etc. There is a serious problem and we need a hell of a lot more investment and support to address the crisis.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also wish to speak about the different experiences that people will face as Christmas approaches. As the Christmas lights go up, it should be a time of excitement, happiness and joy, particularly for children and families. In truth, it will be a tale of two very different Christmases, depending on where one is positioned in Irish society and, in particular, whether one has a roof over one's head. Imagine the situation faced by Elaine and her three children, for example, who visited my office in the past few weeks and who are about to be evicted, having exhausted all appeals through the Residential Tenancies Board and with nowhere to go. Another family with three children, who would rather not have their names mentioned, face eviction before Christmas, while the father of yet another family, who visited me this week and who are living in emergency accommodation in Wicklow, must take his children to three different schools in south Dublin, sit in the car all day waiting for them to finish school and then drive back to Wicklow every day. Other families are experiencing their second or even third Christmas in emergency accommodation. It is shameful that people are being evicted in the midst of this situation and that children must go through a second or third Christmas like this. For others, however, it will be a bumper Christmas. I wish to draw the Taoiseach's attention to this property supplement from a newspaper which states: "Strong residential investment deals. Over 1,600 apartments sold. Total value €610 million." The vast majority of these, of which approximately four are in my area, are NAMA properties that were sold or are being sold to real estate investment trusts, REITs, or wealth asset management companies. The average price is approximately €380,000. The most recent one to be sold in Dún Laoghaire, comprising 214 apartments, cost €95 million at an average price of €440,000 per unit. The article helpfully goes on to state how that block will generate approximately €5 million in rental revenue for the new purchasers. These properties are being sold by NAMA. They are publicly owned and they are being sold to Kennedy Wilson, REITs and other wealth asset management companies which in some cases, to add insult to injury, will then lease them back to local authorities at extortionate prices, boasting about the amount of profit they are making. At the same time, families will suffer a miserable Christmas in emergency accommodation or face eviction. We face a large demonstration on Saturday which will call for an end to evictions into homelessness. Should the Government not take emergency measures to ensure no kids or families are evicted as Christmas approaches? Will it do anything to stop NAMA selling thousands of properties that could be used to provide secure, affordable, permanent homes for these families who are suffering trauma and hardship as Christmas approaches?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For those who face eviction before Christmas, those words are not much consolation. If the Taoiseach recognises this as an emergency, why does he not save those children and families the trauma and hardship they face by immediately instigating emergency legislation that states they will not be evicted and that there will be no evictions while this emergency continues, particularly not in the winter months or facing into Christmas? In other European states, it is against the law to evict people at this time of year, but that will happen here. It infuriates me when the Taoiseach talks about supply. He did not answer the central question about the article, which is evidence of the supply. Public property is being flogged off to vulture funds. Some 700 of the properties are in my area, Dún Laoghaire, and they would resolve the emergency homelessness crisis there. In Lucan and Santry there are hundreds of apartments that we had in our hands and that could be used to house those families who are in the hubs and who face eviction but we are flogging the apartments off. In the docklands, rents of €3,300 a month will then be charged and will go to Kennedy Wilson, an American vulture fund. Why does the Taoiseach allow that to happen? Why does he allow public property be sold to people who charge extortionate rents and evict people who cannot pay them, when that property could be used to house the families who are in the hubs, on the waiting lists and facing eviction? It is a scandal.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The ones being sold are empty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is ridiculous semantics.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, I would like clarification. If amendment No. 5 is agreed, do amendments Nos. 6 to 9, inclusive, fall? Is this correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not want to make accusations but it is a bit of a sleight of hand. We will all vote for the same amendment to remove the criminalisation clause but the way the amendments have been grouped means that by doing so we cannot move the subsequent amendments that would at least mitigate the worst effects of the decision the Minister has made.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough but that is the effect and it is unfortunate. The points have largely been made but the fact of the matter is that doctors seeking to ensure the health and welfare of women in pregnancy situations will now be labouring under an anxiety and fear that if they do certain things they may be guilty of a criminal offence and subject potentially to a 14-year prison sentence. To my mind this is patently unacceptable. It is a throwback and concession to the viewpoint of those who were defeated in the referendum, where the people made a very clear decision they do not believe that women making a decision to have an abortion should be guilty of a criminal offence and that women should have the right to do it. The Minister is retaining a criminal offence and that chill effect of a potential prison sentence.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry, not for the woman but for the doctor. The doctor will be labouring under that anxiety. It is not an acceptable situation if doctors in these difficult, often crisis driven situations, are wondering whether they are guilty of a criminal offence and outside the law if they do this. We know where this has led us in the past. It has potentially disastrous consequences. I really think the Minister has got to reconsider this. As other speakers have said, this is the most important issue before us in terms of the amendments and I really think the Minister should reconsider.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not see how the Minister could argue that the provisions of amendment No. 12 could limit a future review. It is just insisting that certain important indicators of whether women who need abortion services are gaining access to them are met. We are trying to ensure that women who need abortion services have genuine access to them. If over the next three years we discover that, for example, women who need abortion services and should have them are still travelling to Britain, it would be an indication that the legislation had failed and needed to be examined to ensure that additional hardship was not being put on Irish women. Similarly on the issue of Northern Ireland and the recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly, which have not been fully followed through on in this legislation, all of these issues should be examined to ascertain whether the legislation has had its desired effect in guaranteeing the welfare and health of pregnant women and their right to access abortion services. I do not see why the Minister would have a problem with amendment No. 12 and he should accept it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Chairman-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I listened to the Minister's arguments against amendment No. 12. Obviously we agree with his amendment to reduce the review period to three years. If we do not pass amendment No. 12, very important information will not necessarily be collected to inform us whether women are being left outside this legislation in terms of their access to healthcare. Deputy Donnelly said that in three years the Dáil can input into what we want included in the review. In three years' time it will be too late to gather the information we need to start gathering from the moment the legislation passes. We need to start to collate the information immediately the legislation is implemented and the services are established, to establish whether the legislation and the services are achieving what we want them to achieve. Unless the Minister can tell us right now that he is guaranteeing us that all this information will be gathered - I do not really see how he could really do that - why would he not want it in the legislation that we are now committing that this information will be gathered? It should be the responsibility of the HSE and the various people involved in providing the services to log information as to whether, for example, significant numbers of women are finding it difficult to access the services, whether there are barriers, whether women from the North who need the services are able to access them and all of the other possible issues largely related to access and the effectiveness of the legislation. Unless the Minister gives us some other commitment, which he has not done at the moment, we need a commitment that information will be gathered. To wait for three years will be too late. We need the information from the word "go".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These data.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I directly disagree with the previous point. I and many other Deputies in the House canvassed throughout the campaign for weeks and not once in the thousands of doors upon which we knocked did the issue of the three-day waiting period come up. The issue raised was always the substantial one, the issue of whether there were circumstances in which it was justified to have a termination or whether people believe women had the right to choose. On the finer detail we are discussing around the three-day waiting period, not once did I hear that come up. I am not saying that because it suits me to say it. I am telling the Minister as a statement of fact that I never heard it discussed in the course of the campaign. I do not believe that particular point had any bearing whatsoever on the votes that were cast. I do not believe for one second that to question this and to propose amendments that would delete this three-day waiting period is somehow flying in the face of the democratic decision that was made by people. It is paternalistic. A woman might go to the doctor uncertain and she might say she wants to talk it through and think about it or she might say she has thought about it and wants the abortion. The idea that the State will enforce a three-day wait on a woman in that difficult circumstance, whatever her thoughts might be about it, is paternalistic and wrong, and I do not see any justification for it. Deputy Harty asked a very good question of the Minister, namely, could he please explain what the rationale for it is? I cannot understand the rationale for it. I do not believe there is any evidence that it serves any useful purpose and I do think it is a concession to people who are essentially trying to deter women from having abortions. I am very happy to support the idea that we remove that completely and I do not see any problem with that. However, if that does not happen, and I suspect it will not, although I would be interested to hear what the Minister has to say in terms of trying to explain his support for enforcing this three-day wait, and if he is going to persist, then he has an obligation to seriously consider the other amendments. What is his answer if that three-day waiting period takes the woman over the 12 weeks? That would very wrong and very unfair to women if that were the case. I do not believe it can be justified. The Minister certainly needs to answer that question about what happens in that dilemma and if he cannot answer it, he has no choice but to support amendment No. 34. Similarly, regarding amendment No. 33, all the obvious practical difficulties have already been presented to the Minister. I do not think there are good answers, we know there are difficulties in getting GP appointments and that money, geographic location, disability or difficult personal circumstances for the woman involved can be an issue. They are all real practical problems and impediments that will create barriers for women in a difficult and vulnerable situation where they do not need barriers, obstacles and further difficulties heaped upon them. If the Minister insists on the three-day period, he has an obligation to consider the issue of it being from the point at which contact is made with the doctor and the appointment is made rather than insisting otherwise because, effectively, then, it becomes not a 72-hour period but quite considerably longer than that in many circumstances, and that is unfair.
