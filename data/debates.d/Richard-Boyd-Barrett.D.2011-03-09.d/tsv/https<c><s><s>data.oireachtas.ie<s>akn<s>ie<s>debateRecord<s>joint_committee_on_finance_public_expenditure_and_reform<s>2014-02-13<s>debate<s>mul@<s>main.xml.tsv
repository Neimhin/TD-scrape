RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will pick up on that issue in the context of the G20 and the Minister's ongoing engagement with the OECD. It should be a matter of deep concern for any Minister responsible for finance that we have approximately eight different estimates of the effective corporate tax rate in this country, varying from the rather fantastic figure of 14% - referred to briefly by the Taoiseach - down to a figure which the Minister does not take seriously of 2.2%, which was produced by an eminent Trinity professor. It is worth saying that the professor is not on the radical fringe of political thought.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. As I pointed out to the Minister before, and which he ridiculed, in between there is a Central Statistics Office and EUROSTAT figure. It was confirmed by Mr. Seamus Coffey yesterday at the finance committee meeting. It is somewhere between 6.3% and 6.4%. I am glad I have some backup for that figure, which has been ridiculed fairly regularly by the Minister. I am in the middle or somewhat mainstream in terms of the figure I am touting as the effective rate. Whether we take the fantastic 14% figure or what the Minister considers as fantastic at 2.2%, or even somewhere in the middle with a rate of 6%, 8% or 10%, it remains a serious issue that we cannot get any kind of agreement or consensus on what is the corporate tax. We are at the centre of an international controversy with the issue and there are billions of euro at stake in terms of potential tax revenue. Considering this ourselves and through engagement with European partners, the OECD and so on, how will the issue be clarified? How can we resolve the controversy so we can come to something like an agreed methodology for assessing the effective corporate tax rate in this country?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At least we are on some common ground because these are the precise figures in which I am interested. These are hard facts and not a fictional ceramic company that would be atypical of companies at the centre of the issue. The pre-tax or gross profits in the Central Statistics Office figures do not indicate €40 billion but rather €69 billion. That is approximately €70 billion. How we go from €70 billion pre-tax to €40 billion-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----assessable is a pretty big jump. The Minister has indicated in the past that this concerns standard accounting practice, reliefs and so forth. There must be a very serious discussion about that. It is a pretty big jump, as far as I am concerned, and we need to drill down into the matter. We need to examine what measures have been included in Finance Bills over the past ten to 20 years that have got us to this point. Frankly, we must consider the justice of this. That level of a gap between the gross income of a family or household and assessable income does not exist. Deputies earn €70,000 in theory, although in my case I earn €36,000 as we give back the remainder-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a hypothetical "I".Let us say somebody earns €70,000 per year, but only €35,000 or €40,000 is assessable. A sum of €30,000 is taken out of the equation because it is not assessable. That would be wonderful. Many families here would be delighted with that, but that is not what happens. Why does it happen in the corporate sector? No doubt, the Minister will say it is because it is making all sorts of investments and so forth. However, according to the CSO figures the Minister mentions, approximately 600 firms account for the vast bulk of the profits. I worked out that the ones that earn over €10 million in profits per year, and they account for almost three-quarters of all the gross profits per year, make an average of €103 million in profit each year. That is a great deal of money. When one compares the gross figure and how much they actually pay, it is approximately 6.3%. I believe they can afford to pay a little more. Why not impose a minimum effective rate on them so they pay a little more, given that everybody else is being screwed to the wall?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are nothing like the tax credits we are discussing here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am simply pointing out that if one calculates the effective rates for personal income taxation in the same way as the effective rates for corporations, particularly the ones in the top bracket that are making €10 million in profit per year, which is the majority of them, there is a big difference between the tax credits that the ordinary worker gets and those the corporations get. That is at least part of the answer to the question about our effective corporate tax rates-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister not think that we should have an open debate in which the public can compare and contrast the regime for corporate tax with the regime for personal income tax?
