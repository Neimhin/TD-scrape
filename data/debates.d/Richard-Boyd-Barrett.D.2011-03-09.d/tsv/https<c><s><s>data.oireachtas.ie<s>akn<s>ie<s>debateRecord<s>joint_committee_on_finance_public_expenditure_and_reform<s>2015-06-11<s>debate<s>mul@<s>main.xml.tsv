RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Irish Fiscal Advisory Council for its latest report and for its work on the anatomy of the economy. To cut a long story short, my interpretation of what the IFAC is saying is that the Government has been playing by the rules to date but all of a sudden it has stopped playing by the rules and the figures for its projections beyond 2015 do not add up. Is that what the IFAC is saying? The Government is now including projections for tax buoyancy and growth, which it cannot reasonably deduce from the figures? Is IFAC saying that it is a pre-election stunt by the Government?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there any sanction for that? What can happen now in that regard?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Professor McHale say it is beyond doubt or close to being beyond doubt that the Government's figures do not add up and that in reality the figures will end up outside the targets post the election?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am very much for sustainable growth. I strongly fear that what we are looking at is a pre-election giveaway without much concern for the rules that previously were apparently sacrosanct for this Government and were the justification for just about every nastiness they inflicted on us. Having said that I want to ask questions about the metrics and measures that the IFAC is using. Are we constrained by what is actually a useful measure? That is a slightly separate point that I will deal with later. I want to be clear about what IFAC is saying about how the Government is diverging from rules that it previously adhered to and told us we had to adhere to and which puts us in danger of going outside the fiscal targets. Am I correct that the three areas the Government is not taking into account in its projections are demographic pressures, that its growth projections are tenuous and will somebody remind me of the third area?The third one is tax buoyancy. Are those the three areas?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Shifting the goalposts from the Government's point of view is fairly evident to people, but worth underlining as we enter into the election. There is a more serious argument for saying that we do not have to overshoot the targets. In fact, I was at a presentation given by Michael Taft earlier on an alternative fiscal framework for a progressive alternative economic policy. He said there is absolutely no reason we should try to get to a surplus by 2018, as the Government plans, and that we could do it by 2020 with lesser adjustments. That would give us considerably more space to spend and invest. What does the council say to that? The other interesting point Mr. Taft made was on the structural deficit as a useful metric and early warning system against possible return to boom and bust. If one looks at the structural deficit for Ireland before the crash, it did not tell one anything about the possibility that a crash was coming. In fact, one would think that everything was rosy in the garden. He says it is a useless measure of whether something bad is about to happen. One thing I have signalled to the witnesses that I therefore consider very worrying and which none of the metrics have picked up was at the centre of the last crash. I refer to property and what is happening there. Housing is a disaster that is going to get worse very quickly, not just from the point of view of those who need it but from the macro point of view. The cost of accommodation is going through the roof, which has all sorts of knock-on effects. Should we not be jumping up and down and screaming alarms, so to speak, over that fact? Lastly, the council has a section on the statistical treatment of Irish Water in its report. Can the witnesses summarise it briefly? As I understand it, the council is saying that because of the huge subsidy that has been given to Irish Water and because the charges have been set so low, it cannot possibly cover its costs. It will have to subsidise it with the â‚¬100 and all this kind of stuff. One effect is that the capital investment programme is not much. It also affects our deficit. Those subsidies increase our deficit. Is it fair to say, judging from this, that for Irish Water to stop having an impact on our deficit and to cover its own costs, domestic charges would have to increase dramatically?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thought they knew nothing about what was going on in Irish Water.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have two quick questions.Many people would say that cheap money from Europe contributed significantly to the reckless lending and over-lending into particular sectors that helped to crash our economy. The low interest rates that were favoured to try to move along the economy of central Europe - the core of Europe - were completely unsuitable for us. Are we seeing the same pattern emerging again, with very cheap money being produced essentially to try to lift the stagnant core of Europe off the ground? If so, it has the potential to wreak exactly the same havoc again in economies like ours. That is my first question. I will come back in with a second question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to make a second and final point. We want to protect against a cycle of boom and bust. I agree with Dr. O'Sullivan's point that part of that is about having sustainable revenue streams. I would not be quite as harsh on the fiscal council as Deputy Paul Murphy has been. I have got to know its members better - that is why.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I put it to the witnesses that the problem is that it is very difficult to say what is sustainable and what will not be affected by all sorts of external and cyclical factors, many of which are out of our control. Housing, which is a particular bugbear of mine, is an example of that. Obviously, property tax is a revenue source based on property. We are now seeing how volatile property is. I will not get into that argument now. When I was speaking to a rural Deputy recently, he told me that developers down the country are sitting and waiting at the moment because property prices in the countryside are low. They could apply to get money from the banks to build, but they will not do so because there is no profit in it for them. They are going to wait and the banks are going to wait. The banks would not give them the money now anyway, for exactly the same reason. These developers are going to wait until property prices go through the roof. They are waiting for the crisis to get worse from the point of view of people on the ground, and arguably from the point of view of the economy as a whole. If we cannot house people, we cannot do much else. If we do not have basic things like housing, it is going to be a real problem for our economy, never mind for the people. Is it not the case that State intervention is the only way to address that? I suggest the only way to protect itself against that sort of volatility is for the State to have adequate stock, or to intervene when the market is failing by providing what the market is not willing to provide? That argument could be extended into a number of areas. If the State does not have a significant stake in the economy, we are just sitting back waiting for the next storm to hit us. If we are talking about protecting against boom and bust, we must realise the only way to do that is to provide for a greater level of State control over the economy. That is necessary to ensure we are not subject to whatever storm is coming down the road.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is of immediate consequence in the case of housing.
