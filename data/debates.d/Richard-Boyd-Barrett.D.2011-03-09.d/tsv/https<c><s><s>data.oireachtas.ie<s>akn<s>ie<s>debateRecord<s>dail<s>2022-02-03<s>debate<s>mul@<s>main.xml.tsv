RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Without a shadow of a doubt, the most high-profile redundancy that took place during the Covid-19 period, to which this Redundancy Payments (Amendment) Bill is a response, was the Debenhams redundancy. Why does this Bill not involve trying to do something to compensate the Debenhams workers for the failure and inadequacy of legislation to protect against the sort of strategic liquidation that Debenhams engaged in with devastating consequences for the Debenhams workers? I met with the Debenhams workers yesterday and it was interesting just to refresh my own memory of the circumstances. Where is the Government's response to what happened to them? Where is the change in the law on redundancy to prevent that kind of strategic liquidation where workers are denied the redundancy entitlements they should get? Of course, the Minister of State will know and recall that the workers had an agreement that they would receive two weeks' statutory pay plus two weeks' salary for each year of service. They did not get that. They fought an incredible battle for more than a year on the picket lines. As they reminded me yesterday, some of the women had never been on a picket line in their lives. For more than a year, from early morning until late at night, sometimes literally around the clock, in a loading bay at the back of the Ilac Centre in the case of the Henry Street branch and at Debenhams stores across the country, more than 1,000 women were forced to engage in that action because of the law. I have some questions in that regard, as do the workers. As I and the workers understand it, when someone is made redundant there is supposed to be a staged process of notice, which I think runs for a period of between 30 and 90 days, depending on the particular situation. None of this happened in the case of Debenhams. In early April 2020, the workers received an email from the CEO of Debenhams in which he informed them that they should ignore media speculation about possible redundancies, they should not worry, there was no problem and their jobs were safe. One week later, the same CEO sent an email telling the workers their jobs were gone. They never heard from the company again. The workers have a question. It is not an allegation; they want clarification on the facts. As they understand it, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has to be notified about such large collective redundancies. I know the Minister of State may not be able to answer the question now, but the workers would like an answer as to when, during that period, the Department was first notified of the redundancies and what the response of the Government was. They would very much appreciate a response to that question and I think they are owed it. Furthermore, how was it that Debenhams could do that when there was a statutory process around it, which seemed to be utterly disregarded?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am because it is a redundancy payments Bill. It relates to Covid redundancies. The Debenhams redundancy was a Covid redundancy, where people lost their jobs in the middle of the emergency. The workers lost everything. They did not get any of their entitlements. I am asking whether this Bill addresses that. That is the question. Does the Bill address it? If not, why not? I think the Minister of State needs to understand what happened and needs to tell us what he knows because we cannot prevent this from happening again unless we get answers these questions. That must be done so that there is a legislative response and we have an opportunity to table amendments on the next Stage that could address the deficiencies - if there are such, and it would seem to me that there are - in respect of what happened in the Debenhams case. The other question is how, in this circumstance, could a company that goes into liquidation then move €50 million out of the Debenhams online business, Debenhams.ie, which is clearly part of the Debenhams consortium and which is directly linked to the stores and so on? What is it about the law that would allow that to happen? How can that happen? What are we going to do to stop it happening, so that the just redundancy entitlement that the workers should have is not stolen from them, through what are essentially accountancy tricks, by the company moving assets that should be available for the redundancy payment? What are we going to do about the fact the Debenhams consortium was able to load the Irish company with a whole series of debts that it did not have and which properly belonged to the British company? It loaded those debts on to further remove, as it were, assets that might have been available to pay the redundancy for the workers. These sorts of loopholes can be exploited and there is a sharp practice that follows from it from companies in order to avoid paying workers their just entitlement. It should be noted that all that value that Debenhams.ie built up and all those assets were essentially assets that were created through the labour, hard work and decency of good workers who were loved by the customers of Debenhams. All of that goodwill that Debenhams had, and which gave it its value, was robbed from the workers through accountancy tricks. What are we doing to prevent that happening so that workers get their just redundancy and the State and the taxpayer are not on the hook for the sharp practice of companies engaging in what clearly looks like and is, in my view and that of the workers, a strategic liquidation? The workers have issued an invitation to the Minister of State. They are making a documentary about this historic struggle of women workers, which has inspired workers the length and breadth of the country in their determination to fight the injustice they face. They are asking that the Minister of State participate in the documentary they are making. Perhaps he will consider that. The workers will probably send him a written invitation to participate. Everybody at the time, including the Government and the Opposition, accepted that a great wrong had been done. The case that was always made by the Government was that its hands were tied because the law is the law. What are we going to do to ensure this never happens again and that workers robbed of their redundancy entitlements will have them guaranteed? What we are going to do to ensure we have the laws in place to prevent the absolutely appalling and disgusting behaviour that Debenhams engaged in from ever happening again? I am keen to hear the Minister of State's response to those points, as are, more importantly, the Debenhams workers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy. People are facing additional costs to heat their homes. The estimates vary but €800 over the year is a reasonable estimate by bonkers.ie. Against that background, €100 is pathetic and insulting. It is a drop in the ocean and will not cut it. It is good the Government seems to be acknowledging that more needs to be done, as others have said. We made the point during the debate on the budget that a €5 increase and failure to expand eligibility for the fuel allowance were just not good enough. When the scheme was first announced towards the end of the year, we were very clear in saying it was pathetic and was not enough. The Government did not understand that people were literally choosing between food and heating their homes, or between paying the rent and heating their homes. People are being hammered in every direction. A payment of €100 against that background is utterly pathetic and insulting. The Government will need to do much more now. The one piece of advice I strongly urge the Government not to take is the shocking suggestion that came from Deputy Cowen a few moments ago. How wrong can somebody be? Deputy Cowen must be out of his mind to suggest the answer to the current spiral in energy costs is to privatise the ESB. That is the last thing we need to do. In fact, the decision to move the ESB away from being a not-for-profit entity to being essentially a commercial entity, even though it is publicly owned, was the beginning of the onward and relentless drive upwards in the cost of electricity and energy. Privatisation is the problem. The commodification of energy supply and distribution has been a total disaster. This is the key point we need to make. Some people present inflation or a rising cost of living as if it is like the weather and it is just that the weather has changed. We need to take measures, maybe short-term measures or maybe slightly longer term measures, to deal with change in the weather. Inflation is not a change in the weather. Inflation is one group of people robbing another group of people. We really need to get that into our heads. The ESB last year made €363 million in operating profit and that was low compared with the previous year when it made €616 million in operating profits and paid out €81 million in dividends. When the pockets of working people are looted with shocking increases in the price of electricity or gas or heating oil, somebody else is making money. That is true on a global scale and it is true domestically in this country. Shell is crowing about its quarterly profits. Shell's quarterly global sales, mostly of gas, were €6.4 billion, a dramatic increase. It pointed out that 2020 was a bit of a tough year for it, but it is all over now and it is enjoying a bonanza. In just three months it has made €6.4 billion. Those who buy shares in Shell, as I am sure plenty of rich people in this country do, or those who have shares in any of these privatised energy companies, including some of the ones that will or are producing wind energy, are doing fine. People who are private or public tenants have absolutely no control whatsoever over the level of insulation in their homes and, as a result, the amount of energy they need to heat them. Many social housing or private tenants are screwed and crucified. A disproportionate number of the hundreds of thousands of low-paid workers or people in receipt of disability or other social welfare benefits are being absolutely crucified just to keep themselves warm. On top of that, they have to pay rent. All of that is going into somebody else's pocket. The decision to cut back supplies globally during the Covid pandemic was done to keep up profits. It is as simple as that. It was not done based on people's energy needs, but rather to maintain profits and so that companies could keep paying dividends to people who can afford to put their extra wealth into buying shares in large corporations. That is the reality of the situation. Inflation is not caused by weather or a natural phenomenon; rather, it is one group of people using a crisis to loot the pockets of the people who can least afford it. Our starting point has to be that recognition, and that then dictates what sorts of short- and long-term measures the Government takes. In the short term, we need to control the price of energy, electricity and heating. We need to introduce price caps, just as in order to control the spiralling cost of rent we need to introduce rent controls. Anything less will not cut it. If we leave it to the market, these people will continue to ensure their profits are high, whether from energy and electricity or the rents and wealth they generate. We need controls so that the basic things that people need to survive are affordable for ordinary people. Anything less is not good enough. Nobody else in the House seems to want to talk about this stuff. We have pointed out that under the Consumer Protection Act, the Government has the power to declare an emergency regarding the cost of energy and impose maximum unit price costs. Why will the Government not do that? My God, the Government was pouring billions into large corporations to keep them propped up during the Covid pandemic, but it seems we cannot introduce the same kinds of emergency measures to control the price of energy and electricity in companies that, I repeat, are making lots of profit and could well absorb that. That is what should happen, in particular when those companies are publicly owned. My God, the Government should not make a bad situation worse and pour fuel on the fire – sorry for the pun – by privatising these entities and driving them further in the direction of profit rather than ensuring that we provide for the energy needs of people in this country. God Almighty, it is absolutely shameful. I have never been a fan of Fianna Fáil, but at least at one point it constructed Ardnacrusha, established the ESB and so on and created an energy company-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fine Gael is claiming the credit for that. Apologies. Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil - it does not make much difference in truth. It is the same to us. The idea was to have a State company, rather than leaving it to the private market to produce energy. A publicly owned company was created which operated on a not-for-profit basis. That is what needs to be done. We also need to extend eligibility for the fuel allowance to the many pensioners and low-paid workers who are being absolutely crucified by energy costs. We need to dramatically reduce, or withdraw, carbon taxes. Why are tenants or low-paid workers who cannot afford, through their own resources, to retrofit their homes being punished for what other people are doing? Why are they being punished more than people who have the money to retrofit their homes? Those who have the money, as wealthy people do, can mitigate the cost of energy price hikes. It is the working people, the poor, the less well-off and public and private tenants who are being absolutely crucified by this and do not have the resources to do anything about it. The Government should reduce the level of VAT, as the Spanish have done, and the PSO levies. Plenty of measures could be taken to deal with this. We also need to address the income inequalities which are being exacerbated by the inflation crisis, not just the 5.7% or 4.4% projected for next year because they are averages. Inflation is disproportionately higher for people who have to spend a larger proportion of their income on rent or keeping a roof over their head. We need to provide wage increases to working people. I met a group of private security workers, a group we have not talked about much in the past while. They provide security in hospitals and on public transport. They work in all sorts of public and private buildings. They are earning €11.65 per hour. How is somebody supposed to live on that? They cannot get a miserable pay increase to bring them up to €12.05 per hour because of some employment regulation order, ERO, thing. Wages should be increased to a decent living wage like €15 per hour. Everybody should be given increases that at least match the rate of inflation so that they can cope with the increased cost of living being imposed on them.  As well as the energy side of things, we have to deal with the biggest cost for most people, which is putting a roof over their heads. That means introducing rent controls and not relying on the market to deliver housing supply, something it is proving to be completely incapable of doing. We need to deliver the scale of public affordable housing we need, which profit-hungry private property investors are not willing or able to do.
