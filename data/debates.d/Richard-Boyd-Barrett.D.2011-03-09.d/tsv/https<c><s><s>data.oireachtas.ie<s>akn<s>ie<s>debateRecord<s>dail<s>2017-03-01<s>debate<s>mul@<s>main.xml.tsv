RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government does not even know how many private swimming pools there are.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Cabinet committee on health is worth anything at all, it should be concerned, as a priority, with the extreme suffering of people in this country who need urgent medical help. Has the committee discussed the situation of Sarah-Ann Mitchell and the promise made three weeks ago by the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, to meet her mother, Karen? Sarah-Ann is suffering from scoliosis and her situation is deteriorating while she awaits an operation. Karen is now wondering whether the Government has simply decided to ignore her daughter's situation and her own plea that the Government not only help Sarah-Ann but go further by introducing a preventative programme of screening to avoid the same happening to other children in the future. Another case of extreme suffering is that of Ms Vera Twomey and her daughter, Ava. Yesterday the Taoiseach misinformed the Dáil that no application had been submitted for the use of a medicinal cannabis product to alleviate Ava's suffering. That is not true, as I have double checked with Ms Twomey to confirm. An Irish-registered doctor submitted the application, which is what the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, told us on 15 November was necessary to be done. Furthermore, the paediatric neurologists who are treating Ava wrote in support of that application, stating their opinion that the product being sought is alleviating Ava's suffering. Why has the Taoiseach moved the goalposts in this regard and why is he playing politics with Ava Barry's very serious condition? Why is he playing politics in terms of progressing the legislation which is clearly necessary given the chill factor that is preventing medical practitioners in this country from prescribing health products that could alleviate the suffering of people like Ava? All this is down to the refusal to lift the ban on those products. Will the Taoiseach ensure the Minister for Health issues a licence for Ava Barry to avail of the product her doctors have requested? Will he, in addition, allow Deputy Gino Kenny's Bill to go to Committee Stage?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I most certainly am not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do so at the request of the parents whose children are suffering.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister promised action would be taken three weeks ago.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The goalposts have been changed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what the Minister of State told us in November.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The application was submitted by an Irish-registered doctor, which is what the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, told us last November is required.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the sub-committee discussed the contributory State pension? In 2012, when Deputy Burton was a Minister in the previous Government she made changes to the contributory pension scheme. At the time we were told the new system was fairer and would reward those with more contributions but in reality it has turned out to be a massive rip off with 36,000 pensioners - the number is rising all the time - 22,000 of whom are women, who have lost out very significantly in their pension entitlements. The loss is between €19 and €30 a week. They are devastated to find that out when they reach pension age. To add insult to injury, many contributory pensioners – again mostly women - also experience a further hit. If they brought up their family prior to 1994, and took time out of work, they are affected by the averaging system and lose even more of their pension. That is completely unacceptable. What I want to know is whether the sub-committee has discussed the matter and if it is the intention to reverse the unfair and draconian cuts that affect pensioners, in particular women?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The shame and obscenity of child and family poverty, deprivation and now homelessness has increased dramatically and consistently in the years since Fine Gael has been in government. One way the Minister can try to address that is to give resources to pupils in disadvantaged schools but the criteria for allocating DEIS status are not doing that for schools in my area. Even where schools have DEIS status, they are not getting the resources they need to give decent conditions for the teaching of pupils in these deprived and disadvantaged areas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Gaelscoil Phádraig, in Loughlinstown, was refused DEIS status on its application. This is in an area where every other school in the area has DEIS status because it is an area of high disadvantage. The Minister's criteria are not fit for purpose in judging these matters. For example, because they take into account where the children live, children who are living in emergency accommodation - homeless children - but who happen to be living in emergency accommodation in Blackrock are not considered to be disadvantaged because the criteria do not take into account that they are in homeless accommodation. If someone is in homeless accommodation, it does not matter whether they are in Blackrock, Ballyfermot or Ballymun. They are homeless and disadvantaged and the school that has such children deserves DEIS status. Gaelscoil Phádraig has been given the run-around for two decades. It is in prefabs for the past decade. It was promised a school a decade ago. It never got it, and now it has been refused DEIS status. The Minister would want to get his criteria together. This particular school deserves DEIS status as well as a new school building.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Minister to review the decision on Gaelscoil Phádraig. It is in a disadvantaged area which nobody would doubt. The children in the school suffer disadvantage and have been shafted for 20 years. Even schools with DEIS status are not being resourced properly. The Holy Family school in Dunedin Park in Monkstown Farm applied for permission to undertake a summer works programme to put a fire alarm system in place and carry out emergency heating works. It was also looking to replace a water tank which was 50 years old, almost certainly unsafe and situated over a boiler. It received half of the money it needed to do all of these things; therefore, it cannot do them. It received half of the money it needed for the cheapest quote it could get. If even schools with DEIS status do not receive the resources they need, we have a problem. The school was also refused extra teachers to improve the pupil-teacher ratio. Will the Minister consider the Holy Family school in Dunedin Park and Gaelscoil Phádraig in Loughlinstown because they are in seriously disadvantaged areas and have been given a very raw deal on a number of fronts?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am looking for fairness.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister look at the schools mentioned?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will probably not take all my time because I have to rush off to a Right2Water meeting at 6 o'clock.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, I know, and still some people want to charge for it. It is extraordinary, is it not? I support the proposals in the Fianna Fáil motion relating to the collapse of Setanta Enterprise Insurance and generally unregulated motor insurance firms and the measures needed to deal with the consequences. In particular, I support the importance of compensating those who have been affected. It is reasonable to pursue the authorities of the jurisdictions that did not seem to regulate properly to try to recoup some of the money it will cost us to ensure, as we should, that those who have been affected by this are compensated. They are victims of a failure of the authorities in Europe and here to have a properly regulated insurance industry. That is what it comes down to. I support the proposed measures but we would go a lot further. This all relates to a race to the bottom that one gets in just about every area, including insurance, as a result of unregulated, free-market globalisation. We got it with banking, multinational corporate tax evasion and insurance. There is always somebody who is trying to get around the regulations for profit by under-provisioning. They have an unsustainable business model which means that when they get into trouble and are not making enough profit, they decide to go out of business. The poor customers, or more widely the general public, pick up the bill when the profit-seeking entity goes bust. Failures of regulation and the inadequacy of pre-established compensation structures mean that we must deal with the consequences. The problem is that we then move to close the door after the horse has bolted. We keep doing this in the case of insurance. In so far as we must compensate the innocent victims, we create another problem because we must load levies on everybody else's insurance. Insurance thus becomes unaffordable and people get screwed on premiums or are not getting insured at all, as is increasingly the case. Last week we talked about cohorts of people seeking insurance. Some taxi drivers, who require insurance cover to make a living, cannot get it because costs have risen so much. We cannot get credible information, or in some cases any information at all, from these insurance companies to justify their premium increases. One aspect is the cost of the collapse of other private entities, but they also throw out all sorts of other excuses, including legal costs and, as they see it, the unnecessarily high level of awards. They blame juries or fraud, but we do not really know the truth of the matter because we cannot get the actual information from insurance companies. How, therefore, do we resolve this matter in such a way that the situation does not continue to get worse? While the proposed measures before us are some response to the immediate situation, are we going to be back here again fairly soon? Following a particular crisis, like the collapse of a few insurance companies or the collapse of the banking sector due to light touch regulation, we say we are going to regulate, let us have more regulation and it will never happen again because we are going to regulate. Shortly after the commitments to regulate, however, we have bleating by the for-profit institutions, be they insurance companies, banks or multinationals, saying we are going to have to lighten up this regulation because it is not viable for them with that level of regulation, or else they will have to jack up premiums. We are in this vicious cycle where we end up toing and froing between picking up the cost of not having enough regulation or the adverse consequences of compensation packages, and trying to regulate these guys. And so it goes on. Our answer to this conundrum is a State insurance company. That is what is needed. What is the advantage of that? First, we would not need to have committees sitting for weeks on end trying to find out the truth of what is going on in the insurance company. We could actually access the information because we would have it. I am not saying that all State bureaucracies are perfectly transparent in terms of the availability of information, but at least notionally we are entitled to the information. It would work as long as we did not have this arm's length nonsense whereby we own a bank but have no responsibility for what it does and cannot in any way influence its decisions. That is what we do when we have banks, insurance companies or any other public enterprises, including semi-State companies. We are told that is because we have to maintain the commercial independence of these entities, but that is not what we should be doing, particularly when the public always pay. The public pay higher premiums, general taxation and compensation claims when these institutions collapse. It seems to me that if the public pay every single time when anything goes wrong, maybe the public should run them. Then, at least, they would get the benefit of any profits they generate, as well as having some influence over the policies they set for premiums, business models and necessary provisioning. I am absolutely convinced that would be better, more efficient and cheaper. I recently brought to the attention of the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, the example of a Manitoba insurance company which was established directly after a series of hearings, just like the ones we had on motor insurance. Unlike our ones, where we have 77 recommendations that basically do nothing except try to perfect a market which is not perfectible, the Manitoba authorities set up their own not-for-profit insurance company to provide affordable, basic third-party insurance for everybody.It will eliminate discrimination against particular cohorts of drivers. It will base risk on individual assessments of those drivers and penalise them if they turn out to have a bad record but not penalise whole cohorts, as these insurance companies do on spurious reasons in order to make money. That is what I think we should do. Otherwise we will be here again. We will not resolve the dilemma and it will just keep going around. In a year or two we will be debating the collapse of some other unregulated entity, or for that matter, even a regulated one.
