RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Ms Dubsky for her presentation. I will take up the last point first, which is very interesting. Is Mr. Crosbie saying that the Bill essentially gives the Minister too much discretion to fully enforce provisions in the legislation, which are good but which the Minister is not bound to implement?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Coastwatch Europe has a sympathetic ear on that matter. Mr. Crosbie should send us the amendments. Similarly, I worry about the forestry Bill where there is a lot of discretion because things are not specifically tied down. Apart from the general problem of a lack of democratic accountability because people are not operating under rules, is Mr. Crosbie also saying that a real problem is emerging cornering the displacement of native oysters?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do the witnesses want to elaborate on that? Obviously it is bad that native oysters are being displaced.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Apart from Coastwatch, are other people expressing concern about this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Ms Dubsky for that interesting information. As regards coastal zone management, developing renewables and other energy, oil rigs were also an issue. Ms Dubsky said we should not be against everything and we have to develop renewables in particular. I suspect she might have a slightly different attitude to oil rigs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As Ms Dubsky knows, I am involved in the Save Our Seafront campaign. To cover both we should apply the exclusion zone that seems to exist in most other European countries. In that way, the foreshore area is excluded from major developments be they wind farms or oil rigs. What does Ms Dubsky say to that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I get some clarification on the definition of the foreshore because there seems to be a slight difference of opinion? I thought the foreshore was 22 or 24 kilometres.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My understanding is that there were the low and high water marks, and then a bigger zone.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not do away with the notion of the foreshore.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with the witnesses on coastal zone management.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why in the witnesses' opinion do countries such as Germany, Britain, Norway and others set a distance from the coast inside which these things are not permitted? Do the witnesses not think they have good reasons for doing this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The strategic environmental assessment, SEA, looked generally at the potential environmental impact of developing energy resources in the offshore. An issue arose in relation to oil rigs that could potentially arise in relation to the Dublin Array project. It was suggested in the context of the oil rig that the SEA covered the requirement for an environmental impact assessment, which we thought was preposterous because what is needed is an impact assessment of what the oil rig might do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is there any danger in terms of this Bill that we are doing away with the need for specific projects to be properly assessed environmentally?
