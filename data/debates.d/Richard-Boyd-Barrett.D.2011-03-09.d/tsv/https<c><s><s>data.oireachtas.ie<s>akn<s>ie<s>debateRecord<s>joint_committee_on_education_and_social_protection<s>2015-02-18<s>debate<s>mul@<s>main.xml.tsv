RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Vice Chairman for allowing me to come to the committee meeting and ask some questions, because I am not a member of the committee. What is the global figure for all participants in all the different activation schemes? There is some debate about the relationship between the number on schemes and the apparent fall in unemployment. Does the Department in any way track the relationship between emigration and the fall in the unemployment figures? I presume that people who leave the country do not appear anywhere else on the system. Does the Department track that to show how falls in the unemployment figures relate to emigration or actual engagement with labour activation or employment? I have a few very vociferous constituents who feel there is a problem with the JobsPlus scheme. The argument goes that when people who are trying to get back into work contact employers to go on the JobsPlus scheme, the employers say they must be joking, and why would they take them on when they could use JobBridge. I hear that quite often. How does the Department respond? I hear the witnesses say the figure is 4,000, which is not bad, but I get quite a few reports of people who would like to go on JobsPlus but find that a lot of employers do not entertain that because it is a better deal for them to pay people nothing and effectively get free labour through the JobBridge scheme. While I take the point about positive discrimination towards the long-term unemployed on JobsPlus, there is another side to that equation. A similar argument is as follows: why would an employer take somebody on for €7,500 in the first year of unemployment instead of taking the €10,000 that is provided if the person is unemployed for more than two years? People come to me who have tried to get on the JobsPlus scheme but because they have been unemployed for less than two years the employers ask why they would take them on when they can get €10,000 for people who have been unemployed for more than two years. It is an understandable grievance on the part of somebody who is more recently unemployed who cannot get back to work because of the way the incentive works. One-parent benefit has featured a little, but not as much recently-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is to do with employment and how it is defined. Carers for adults who, as a result of the changes in the one-parent family scheme-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Department acknowledge the fall from 41% to 34%? I have heard a figure of 60%, on which Mr. McKeon might comment. He seems to acknowledge that the removal of the concurrent payment has led to deactivation, not activation, but the Department is claiming that it has come back up a little. Is there an acknowledgement that it was a retrograde move that has to be remedied if it has driven people from community employment schemes? Does the Department see any correlation between this and the rather startling figures recently recorded in various reports for the increase in the levels of deprivation and child poverty? Lone parents have been driven out and impoverished as a result of changes that were supposed to improve their circumstances.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Questioning it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The issue will be in the Dáil today.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Vice Chairman has called me a bit quicker than I thought he would.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Vice Chairman for allowing me to speak, as I am not a member of the committee, and apologies to those whose presentations I missed. I thank the Single Parents Acting for the Rights of Kids, SPARK, for the briefing yesterday, which was very informative. I asked a question earlier of Mr. Egan. He seemed to acknowledge that the removal of the concurrent payment, which is not included in the table SPARK talked about, as well as what it would clearly demonstrate is a significant deterioration in-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Apologies. He referred to a significant worsening of the situation for lone parents who are working, and the figures are set out in the document. SPARK might confirm that it does not even include the impact of the loss of the concurrent payment, which is on top of this, and, therefore, we have had a double whammy of dramatic proportions. I would like to hear what the Department has to say about that because in terms of the logic the Minister outlined when all these measures were being brought in and about which there was much heated debate in the Dáil at the time about labour activation, we have unequivocal evidence that the opposite is the case. What we have got is labour deactivation and disincentivisation, and that is reflected in the fall-off in the numbers of people on community enterprise schemes that he has just acknowledged. It strikes me, but I would like to hear his comment on it, that there has to be some correlation between this and the dramatic figures we have seen recently in terms of increased levels of deprivation and increased levels of child poverty among lone parents. I suspect a big cohort of that child poverty increase is the children of lone parents. The reason I was not here earlier was because I was attending a young people's protest about child suicide, which is awful. I am not saying there is a direct correlation with that but in terms of deprivation and a worsening situation for lone parents who are hit disproportionately, is there an acknowledgement on the part of the Department that we have got this wrong and that it needs to be remedied? On the issue of the carers, which may have been raised by other members, I asked some questions about this and-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If a carer is looking after adults, not children, he or she will lose €86. The Minister said they will look at that but the point was made whether that could be addressed with the family income supplement, FIS, and other payments. The response was that they no longer do two payments. Is that true? Is it not the case that there are groups that do get two payments? Widows and widowers, State contributory pensioners and deserted wives get double payments because there is an acknowledgement that there are specific circumstances that require double payments. The point lone parents are making is that there are specific reasons they need extra supports.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are the witnesses willing to acknowledge that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the double payments?
