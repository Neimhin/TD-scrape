RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our ability to reopen society to cope with Covid-19 and non-Covid-19 healthcare is critically dependent on our intensive care unit capacity which, before Covid-19 and still, remains chronically under-resourced, understaffed, and about half of the capacity of the EU average per 100,000 population. I had an eye-opener in respect of the failure of the Government to address this problem when an ICU nurse came into my clinic this week. She has been offered a job in a Dublin hospital as an ICU nurse, but she is on a Stamp 1 visa and needs a Stamp 4 visa. She went to get an appointment at the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, to get her Stamp 4 visa. She was told that she could not get an appointment until December, in which case she will lose the job and we will be down one ICU nurse. That is, in effect, one ICU bed. That backlog is unacceptable. It shows a lack of focus in ensuring that we get ICU nurses where they are available. I ask the Taoiseach to look into the case, about which I have written to the Ministers for Health and for Justice.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a two-month waiting list.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The strategic housing development planning process, which allows developers and property speculators to get around the normal planning process and increase the value of sites that they purchase, has been thoroughly discredited. It was supposedly brought in to accelerate the delivery of the housing that we need to address the housing crisis but, as we know, only one third of strategic housing developments have actually been commenced and we now have the phenomenon of these places that get strategic housing development permission being flipped by speculators to make extortionate profits while delivering no housing.The Chivers site is a disgrace. They lied to the local community and local representatives. Another one in my area I have discovered is the former Jet garage site in Deansgrange, bought by Hyundai. A vehicle run by Hyundai, Dalton Investments, got an SHD three years ago on a site that has been derelict for more than a decade and have flipped it recently. Yet in the last week or so, the Government has said the plan to abolish the SHD planning process, which was supposed to be imminent, has been postponed. How can the Taoiseach explain that when it is clear SHDs are a mechanism for property speculators to make money, get planning permissions, inflate the value of their assets and, in many cases, flip them? They have nothing to do with delivering the public and affordable housing we need. Why is the Government extending the SHD process, which is completely discredited, has done nothing to address the housing crisis and only benefits speculators?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why not scrap the SHD now?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He has extended it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have raised the plight of taxi drivers with the Taoiseach many times. They were hit very hard during the pandemic. Taxi drivers also have a key role to play in the decarbonisation of transport. Some €15 million was allocated after some big protests by taxi drivers during the period of Covid for grants to be available to them to get electric cars. To their disappointment and surprise in recent weeks, they were told that although only €6 million out of the €15 million grant scheme has been used up, no further applications are being accepted. That is inexplicable if we want to see the decarbonisation of the taxi fleet. Also, bizarrely, if people had committed to buy an electric vehicle that was worth more than €60,000, there would be an extension on the grant being available to them until March of next year, but if a commitment had been made to purchase a vehicle worth less than €60,000, it would not. That is bizarre. I also understand, for some inexplicable reason, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI, grants for taxi drivers have a similar threshold of €60,000 in order to get a €2,500 grant. You get the money if you are a rich taxi driver who can afford a very expensive electric car, but not if the car is worth less than €60,000. Could the Taoiseach confirm that the scheme will be reopened, that the €9 million that was not spent will be carried over to next year, that there will be an additional allocation and that the arbitrary thresholds of €60,000 will be removed? The public transport bus drivers who voted against the National Transport Authority, NTA, and Dublin Bus proposals on changing their routes and significantly undermining their existing working conditions are asking if the NTA has learnt anything from the vote. In particular, they ask if it understands that facilitating the race to the bottom, where privatised operators are undermining the conditions of bus workers in terms of their work-life balance, hours of work and so on, is the last direction in which they want to go.If we want to expand public transport, we need to protect the working conditions of bus drivers and end the privatisation of routes. We need a public system where workers' conditions are protected and where we expand the routes available to people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They stopped taking applications.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	And to protect the workers’ conditions.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Definitely not Larry Goodman.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is thanks to Russia and America. They wrecked the place.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Thanks to Russia and America; they wrecked the place.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am also very disappointed that the Taoiseach has left. I hope the Minister of State will pass on the points I wish to make, which largely revolve around the issue of Palestine. It is an extremely urgent matter that six Palestinian prisoners are currently on hunger strike. Two of them, Qayed Fasfus and Mukdad Qawasmeh, have been on hunger strike for almost 100 days. Their lives are very seriously in danger. All of the six are on hunger strike because they have been imprisoned without trial and in many cases repeatedly denied any kind of due process. This is a very urgent, life-threatening matter. They, as well as their supporters and families and so on, are asking that this be raised as a matter of urgency and an appeal made to Israel to give them due process so they can come off that hunger strike, or, indeed, to release them. That raises a wider issue. The Taoiseach referred to his attendance at the Malmö International Forum on Holocaust Remembrance and Combating Antisemitism and I would really like to ask him some questions about that. At the outset, I want to say that anti-Semitism is a vile phenomenon. The Holocaust is one of the greatest crimes that was ever committed by humanity against a particular group, that is, the Jewish people. Although it is worth saying that there were other victims of the Holocaust, such as Gypsies, communists and trade unionists, the major victims were the Jewish people in a genocidal assault by the Nazis. We must absolutely commemorate the Holocaust and insist that it never ever happens again. However, it is disturbing that at that conference, as is the wont of Israeli political leaders, President Herzog made the following statement: ... when criticism of a particular Israeli policy mutates into questioning Israel’s very right to exist - this is not diplomacy, this is demonization and anti-Semitism, because Israel is the nation-state of the Jewish People.This is a very familiar refrain. You can question this or that policy of Israel but if you question the right of what some of us happen to believe is an apartheid state to exist, you are an anti-Semite. That is not acceptable. We should not sign up to definitions of anti-Semitism that suggest that and we should be aware that Israel's claim to be the Jewish state representing the Jewish people is not a view shared by millions of Jews across the world. For example, a recent study of the Jewish electorate in the United States found that 25% of Jewish electors believe Israel is an apartheid state, 22% believe it is committing genocide against the Palestinian people, 34% say that Israel's treatment of Palestinians is the same as racism in the United States, and 20% of young Jewish voters said Israel has no right to exist. They are hardly anti-Semites. It is appalling misuse of the terminology of anti-Semitism and is an insult to the memory of the Holocaust to try to equate those two things. Israel is an apartheid racist state and I say that based on its own legal constitution, particularly around the law of return. The law of return prioritises the rights of Jewish people to gain entry to the historic land of Israel or Palestine - whatever you call it - and denies that right to Palestinians. That right exists under international law, UN General Assembly resolution 194, which Israel denies and has denied since its foundation, when it ethnically cleansed 1 million Palestinians. It is a racist state in its fundamental laws. It practises persecution of the Palestinian people and the denial of their rights on an ongoing and systematic basis. It is entirely legitimate to say that we should not accept the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian people, that Palestinians have the right to return and therefore to question the existence of the Israeli state and pose the possibility of a single state where Jews, Palestinians, Christians, Arabs and people of no religion would have equality in a single state. Not everybody agrees with that but a lot of people believe it and it is not an anti-Semitic view to hold. We absolutely have to stand against that and I commend the author Sally Rooney for publicly declaring her support for the boycott, divestment, sanctions campaign against the apartheid regime. I did not have time to raise the issue of the people's vaccine but I ask the Minister of State to pass on to the Taoiseach the request from the people's vaccine group to meet with him to discuss the waiving of the TRIPS patent restrictions on the production of Covid-19 vaccines, medicines and so on because that is seriously inhibiting the global fight against the pandemic in the developing world. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State might note that President Herzog brought the issue up at the conference.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Partition.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is partition.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What the Minister of State is saying is worrying.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not.
