RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yesterday I raised with the Taoiseach the continuing ill-treatment of the La Senza workers at the hands of KPMG and I wrote to him about it as requested.  I got further calls today informing me that their P45s were-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----not done properly by KPMG and have been refused by Revenue.  In that context there is an urgent need to introduce industrial relations legislation to prevent such shoddy treatment of workers.  Given all that has happened in recent weeks, does the Government plan to introduce new industrial relations legislation to prevent the kind of mistreatment of workers we have seen with the La Senza workers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I had to write it up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I e-mailed it to the Taoiseach an hour later.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did the Taoiseach get the e-mail?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach contact KPMG?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He said he would yesterday.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I sent it to him yesterday.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Before the last election Fine Gael and the Labour Party railed against the arrogance of the Fianna FÃ¡il Government and promised more democracy and accountability, open government and to get Ireland working.  Yet, one year on the Government is conspiring with EU leaders to deny people a vote on the treaty which will further and substantially dismantle democracy across Europe and lock the citizens of this country and the rest of Europe into a straitjacket of austerity and cutbacks, which would guarantee mass unemployment and emigration for at least a decade if not longer and from which we may never recover.It is extraordinary to hear the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, talk about how the Irish public would not understand the provisions of the treaty and get caught up in extraneous issues.  It is unbelievably insulting-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and antidemocratic.  What will the next move be?  Will we do away with elections altogether because the people do not understand what the sages on the other side of the House do?Let us be absolutely clear about the legal position, no matter how the Government twists and turns to try to get out of it.  The treaty refers to permanent measures.  Permanent means no government can change them.  If that is not an infringement of the constitutional right of the citizens of the country to determine their social and economic future, I do not know what is.  Permanent means permanent and that is what the Government proposes to lock us into.It then tried to cover this with blather about jobs which people are desperate for.  Please explain to me how, if it can impose, as the treaty will require, at least ten years of brutal austerity to meet these targets, it can create jobs and growth?  It is like saying one will save a drowning man while holding his head under water.  People are being suffocated by austerity and cutbacks and are forced onto their backs by the burden of the casino gambling debts of toxic banks.It is unbelievable.  It is not just this economy that has been crushed by austerity.  The economies of Germany and Europe are slowing down.  Every forecaster, including the IMF and ESRI, says the economies in Europe and Ireland are slowing down.  At what point does one realise it is not working and is strangling and crucifying our economy and the European economy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Put the people before the bankers and speculators.  The Government should get our money back from them and invest in jobs and growth.  If the Government will not listen to the people, the people had better start taking to the streets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Well said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Flanagan has not had a chance to speak.  I will give way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister of State explain, given the targets of the EU-IMF programme, which require sucking huge amounts of money out of the economy up to 2015 with a further requirement to go beyond that to meet the targets in this treaty, how we will get growth and where that growth will come from?  Will the Minister of State respond to the downgrading of growth projections for this economy and the European economy?  Does she acknowledge at any level that this has something to do with austerity?  How does continued austerity for at least a decade produce jobs and growth?  It does not compute.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister's response is made up of "on the one hand this and on the other hand that" and the view that we should wait and see.  I am calling on the Minister to respond to the alarming but accurate concerns expressed by a major international financial body, the IMF.  It is a body that I do not have much time for and whose activities over the years have contributed substantially to the mess we are in now.  However, when the head of the IMF states that we may be headed towards a 1930s-style depression, one must take it reasonably seriously.  I do not understand why there seems to be no acknowledgment that the rather dramatic downgrading of growth forecasts that has occurred in recent months is precisely as a result of austerity and the cuts in expenditure.  It is a consequence of these cuts working their way through in terms of a serious drop in consumer demand and, similarly, a collapse in investment in this country and a drop in investment throughout in Europe.  These two things are absolutely connected.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister explain it to me, please, because the economics of his outlook appear to defy gravity?  If we continue to cut as required by the fiscal compact and the austerity programme will it not inevitably produce the same result that we have seen in recent months, that is, growth will continue to contract and we will enter a downward spiral?  How can anything else happen if the Government continues to cut expenditure, if there is no investment and if the banks continue to hoard money in the ECB?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not interested in the fiscal target of 8.6%, I am interested in growth and jobs and that is what my question was about.  The Minister should not deliberately misinterpret my question by referring to the Irish economy.  I referred in particular to Christine Lagarde's comments about the entire eurozone.  Ireland's growth projection is down, as is the case for Europe and Germany.  Who will buy our exports if consumer demand is depressed right across the European economy, even in the large supposedly wealthy states where demand is also contracting?  If people do not have an income because of the austerity already imposed and the further austerity demanded by the fiscal compact and if investment is collapsing because large businesses do not believe it is safe to invest in a depressed economic environment, from where will the jobs and growth come?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are none in this House.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Notwithstanding our significant differences on what should be done about paying off banks such as Anglo Irish Bank, bondholders and so forth, does the Minister agree that, in the context of seeking any relief on the debt burden, the Taoiseach's comments in Davos were stupid and reckless and undermined any moral credibility we have in seeking debt relief as he essentially stated we deserve what we are getting because people went mad borrowing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did his comments not substantially undermine the Minister's negotiating position in seeking debt relief from our EU partners?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Was his statement reckless?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Like Deputy Doherty, I think it would be quite important to get some facts and debate this matter more fully.  However, I want to give the Minister the opposite advice to that of Deputy Michael McGrath for him to consider, which is precisely the argument that was put in the German Bundestag by the German finance committee members.  They made the point that the one lesson we must learn from this crisis is the need to rein in the financial markets.  The financial transaction tax is precisely a means of doing that.  They argued that states which opt out on the basis of short-term advantage will suffer in the medium to long term because they will be more vulnerable to shocks in the currently extremely volatile - bordering on anarchic - international financial services sector.  That is an important point for us to consider.  If we all wait for someone else to jump, it will never happen and no action will ever be taken to have some level of regulation for states to clawback from the financial markets.  We need an informed debate but, to be honest, my prejudice would be that we should join in with those who are trying to take action to regulate the financial services sector.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Like DEIS schools.
