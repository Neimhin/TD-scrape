RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In general terms I welcome the Bill, which is a positive development. The last Government rolled back the freedom of information legislation that was introduced by the Labour and Fine Gael Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed, and there should be credit where it is due. The Bill's introduction is positive and freedom of information is being extended to more bodies. Nevertheless, amendments to the Bill are required, and the issues were discussed at the finance committee, of which I am a member. The first issue relates to fees. I accept that there are no fees for personal information but there is a €15 fee for non-personal information and an appeal fee of €50, which has been reduced from €150. There is also a €30 fee for an internal review, which has also been reduced from €75. It still costs money to access this information, which can have a chilling effect, particularly in a current climate where people are very strapped for money. This was noted extensively at Leaders' Questions earlier and people may have heard the rather disturbing reports of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul this morning about how many families are in dire financial positions. It should be fairly obvious that people in such cases would not have the money to access information they might want. Having fees means there is essentially a two-tier access to information, which is not acceptable. If we are talking about freedom of information, it should apply to everybody and there should be no obstacle or deterrent to members of the public accessing the information. Their economic status should not be an impediment to having full access to information.The Government's justification for not abolishing fees relates to the potential administrative costs and the Minister suggested that public bodies would not have the capacity or may have problems having the wherewithal to provide free access to FOI because of the loss of more than 30,000 workers from the public sector. That is not an acceptable justification. If FOI is a right that the Government seeks to vindicate for the public, then it can hardly say they have the right to FOI but because of other policies it has to cut the capacity of public service to deliver a service it says they should have and, therefore, they cannot have it or there should be an impediment to them having full and free access. That makes no sense whatsoever. If FOI is a public service the Government believes the public should have, it has an obligation to provide the resources to deliver it, otherwise it is not a service; it is just words on a page. The public service has many aspects to it but surely one of the most important should be its role in providing information to the public. That is what democracy is about and that is what the public service should be there for. It is there to serve the public and a critical part of serving the public is providing people with information about what is going on and how public money is being spent. It is not good enough for the Government parties to say they do not have the means to provide free access and it makes a mockery of freedom of information if one does not have free access to information. Furthermore, in Britain the possibility of charging fees was discussed and rejected on a number of grounds similar to those I have outlined. It was also pointed out, importantly, that the cost of levying fees might be greater administratively than the cost of not doing so. The UK Government decided not to charge fees stating:Charging for FOI requests would have an adverse impact on transparency and would undermine the objectives of the Act. A charge would be expensive to administer and may result in increasing rather than reducing burdens on public authorities. This is particularly the case where a nominal charge rather than a much higher full cost recovery charge is being considered.It makes sense not to have loads of public servants billing people or administering a charging system for request, appeals or reviews.  Perhaps there is also an implication in the Government’s decision to retain charges – an issue that was also raised at the joint committee – that there would be loads of frivolous and vexatious FOI requests. Expert witnesses who appeared before the committee rubbished that argument and said a high bar would have to be set to show that a request was frivolous because what the Government might consider to be frivolous, the member of the public seeking the information might consider to be important. It is not up to public bodies or the Government to decide that they do not like a particular request or find it irritating or annoying. If the person feels it is important, he or she has a right to that information. The exemptions for commercial semi-State bodies are unacceptable. This catch all phrase "commercial sensitivity" drives me around the twist because it is a blanket, get out of jail clause for entities that are fully owned by the public in which significant public money and resources are at stake and the notion that they can get out of jail regarding FOI requests because of so-called commercial sensitivities is just not on. There may be instances where a semi-State body could make a plea that the release of particular information would jeopardise its financial position but the presumption in FOI is that all bodies in which there is substantial public investment or ownership should be subject to the legislation as a general rule and if they want to make an case to be an exception, they should have to do so and outline why particular information should not be given out. It should not be the other way around, particularly in the context of bodies such as Irish Water, which has a monopoly on the sale of water, itself an abomination. I had desperate trouble trying to get information about industrial relations issues in Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company relating to pay, bonuses, executive expenses, huge sums wasted on ridiculous plans and so on. We need that information. The joint committee also debated the issue of direct provision, the asylum process, refugee applications and son. Will FOI legislation be fully applied in this area? This is important. We have had a dark and shameful history in the context of the cover up of institutional abuse in the Magdalen laundries, industrial schools and so on. It is only now that this terrible history is seeing the light of day and restorative justice being offered to those affected. Refugees and asylum seekers are a new version of the Magdalen laundries survivors. They have been relegated to the status of non-people. Children are spending their entire childhoods in appalling conditions in hostels with no rights. It is vitally important that a light is shone on this area and that it be fully subject to FOI provisions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Ryan report shocked the nation. At the time of the setting up of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund in May 2012, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, said it was right that the State apologise to those whose childhoods were stolen and who, in many instances, could not live full lives as adults and citizens. He talked about the State's failure of the children who were victims of institutional abuse, stated that their childhoods had been stolen and spoke of the pain and abuse they had suffered, and promised that the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund would be available to help them rebuild their lives, particularly in the areas of counselling, health, personal social services and educational services.During the summer I was contacted by a constituent who has asked me to say she is happy for her name to be mentioned in the House. Her name is Eithne Doyle; she is in her 60s and from Dún Laoghaire. She spent six or seven years in a Magdalen institution and described her treatment there as appalling. She was young. She suffered from dyslexia, yet she was ridiculed as a dunce, as being no good. She was never given support or nurtured. She described how her confidence as a human being was crushed and her self-esteem stolen from her. She eventually left school at the age of 14 years after the trauma she had suffered there. She went to Britain at the age of 19. Things did not go well for her in England, although she had two children there. She returned with them to Ireland in 1988. She was homeless for 13 months, living in bed and breakfast accommodation and hostels. She was forced to walk the streets with her children for ten or 12 hours a day because they were thrown out of the hostel. During that period her daughter, Yasmin, was unwell and she did not know what was wrong with her. When she was finally housed, her daughter died nine months later of a brain tumour. She thought she was unwell because of their living conditions and could not properly identify how unwell she was because they were homeless. This is a person who has suffered terribly and she puts it all down to her period in the residential institution.  After all these tragic circumstances, Eithne has since tried to rebuild her life, re-educate herself and regain the confidence and self-esteem that was stolen from her. She was delighted when the residential redress board was set up and she was awarded compensation. She was particularly delighted at the commitment which was reiterated by the Minister, Deputy Quinn, last year, that support for education would be provided. She has returned to education and attended courses in social studies. This year she began a further education course in Sallynoggin on social advocacy. She contacted the statutory residential institutions board believing she would be entitled to financial support from it only to discover that no applications were being taken. She is furious, upset and angry that after everything that has happened to her, after the State's acknowledgement of its complicity in her treatment and the promises of support to help her to rebuild her life, that support is not available when she needs it to re-educate herself, rebuild her life and I hope find employment. I suspect Eithne's tragic situation and life is repeated in many other instances. She wants to know whether that fund will be opened and whether applications will be accepted. She wants to know if that support will be provided for her and people like her in order that she can begin to rebuild her life as the Government promised she would be able to do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I may have caused some confusion in my contribution. The institution in this case had a Magdalen laundry run by sisters, but the person to whom I refer was in one of the residential institutions. The Magdalen scheme is separate.  On the substantive point, having passed a Bill in July 2012 in which the State acknowledged its obligation to the victims of institutional abuse and the need to provide services for them such as education, health, counselling and so on and the board having been set up in March this year, after all that time we are still talking about staffing and administrative problems and there is, in fact, no scheme for the victims. The Minister himself described it as one of the darkest, most shameful chapters in the history of the State. He has acknowledged that many of the people involved are elderly. If the scheme is to mean anything, they need support now. I have described one person's situation, but I suspect there are many more. A total of 15,000 may be eligible for the scheme and after all this time and given the tragic circumstances of their lives, we are still talking about administrative problems. They want the scheme to be opened. The Minister should be here to tell the House when it will be open for applications. What Eithne and others in the same position would like is a commitment that when it is opened, any support they need will be backdated to when they first sought it. Eithne is now starting her course. She is dependent on social welfare payments and has a daughter to support. As she suffers from dyslexia, she needs a computer and other things to help her to proceed with this course. She does not have them because she does not have the support that she was promised by the Government and the State. I ask the Minister of State to give a specific timeline for when applications will be accepted and indicate whether they will be backdated to provide support for these survivors of abuse and to whom the State has acknowledged it has an obligation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Government provide a date?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There might be some spare money under Tom McFeely's bath.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I believe it is in the constituency of the Minister, Deputy Ruairí Quinn.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not know about that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some of us believe we should tell the markets to take a hike and not pay the €8 billion in interest on a debt that is mostly not ours. Will he confirm that the figure is €8 billion? The Minister is hell-bent on going for the 5.1% target, which means either €2.8 billion or €2.9 billion in cuts. Most people do not care about the difference between the two figures because they are going to feel the pain regardless. When he is framing his budget, will the Minister consider some redistribution of the pain he is planning to inflict by lifting the burden off low- and middle-income families and small and medium-sized enterprises and shifting it to those with wealth and large profits? Will he consider examining the corporate tax rate, wealth taxes or a higher tax rate for those earning over €100,000, measures that up to now he has refused to examine?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a pre-budget consultation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister examine sectors he has not examined before?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that a decimal point on the deficit?
