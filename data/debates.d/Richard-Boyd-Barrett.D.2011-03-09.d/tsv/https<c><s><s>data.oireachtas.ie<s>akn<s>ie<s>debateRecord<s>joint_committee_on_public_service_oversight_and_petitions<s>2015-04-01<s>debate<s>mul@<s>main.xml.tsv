RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I pay tribute to Anti-Deportation Ireland, the Anti Racist Network and other groups that have spoken out on behalf of people in direct provision or, most important, the people in direct provision whose campaigning and protests brought this issue to the fore. I remind the Minister of State that he and I travelled to a big protest in Genoa in 2001 for the G8 meeting. One of the big slogans at marches attended by hundreds of thousands of people was that no human being is illegal. I think the Minister of State chanted that slogan along with the rest of us. The sentiment driving it is that all human beings deserve human rights and deserve to be treated with equality, dignity and decency. The notion of human beings being illegal and consequently treated in a different fashion from other human beings is abhorrent. The context of our discussion is a scandal and another shameful incident in Irish history, where a group of people have been denied the most basic dignity and human rights for a prolonged period of time in a way that requires immediate remedy. We owe these people for the wrong done to them over the past 11 years. This should not be a change of policy but we owe them an apology and remedy for what they have been put through in the centres. That is the context of my questions. The Minister of State has put a lot of emphasis on the working group and it is very alarming that some of the concerns of people who have campaigned on this issue, including the asylum seekers and the people concerned, expressed about the working group before it was set up now appear to have been realised by the decision of the Irish Refugee Council to come off the working group. That is very disturbing and raises serious questions about the credibility of the working group. I want to know what the Minister of State thinks about this. Some of the concerns were expressed by campaigning groups before it was set up and the Minister of State has placed emphasis on the working group's recommendations and independence but now a credible player, the Irish Refugee Council, has resigned from it. Does that worry the Minister of State?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It certainly worries me and places question marks over the process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was by the Italian police.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not reject it, because I have not seen it. My question was whether it concerned the Minister of State that a credible player like the Irish Refugee Council has withdrawn from the working group on the basis already alluded to by Senator Ã“ Clochartaigh. To my mind, that raises serious questions about what is going on in the working group. I have no doubt that there are other decent and credible people there, but there is something wrong if the Irish Refugee Council pulls out of it. In advance of all this, concerns were raised by the asylum seekers themselves, their representative groups and others who advocate on their behalf, that the whole thing could just be a rubber-stamping of administrative changes that the Department had already decided upon. That is worrying. Everything the Minister of State says about the wrongs that have been done just echo what I am saying. However, is the credibility of the process we are setting up called into question by a credible player like the Irish Refugee Council pulling out? The Minister of State has replied, but he has not really answered the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also asked about another matter. Ultimately, these decisions come back to the Minister of State. I take the point about bringing like-minded people together, which is fair enough. We need to do that urgently because we are 15 years too late, but then it comes back to the Minister of State. Some details are up for discussion about how exactly we do the right thing and that there may be some difficulties in doing so. Other things, however, are not up for discussion. First, we have wronged all the people who have gone though the system if, as the Minister of State rightly says, we cannot stand over it. It is shameful what has been done to children and shameful that people have had that many years of their lives robbed from them. It is also shameful, for example, that victims of sex trafficking are put into direct provision centres in completely inappropriate circumstances. It is shameful that children do not have money to buy school books. It is also shameful that they do not have access to proper health care due to prescription charges and lack of money. Is it part of the remit to make as much recompense as we can to the people we have wronged? Will the Minister of State say that that will be done? We owe those people in the same way as we owe those who were in the Magdalen laundries and mother and baby homes. These are absolute racing certainties, otherwise we are not doing what needs to be done. We are not doing right by these people and it comes back to the Minister of State.  Is the Minister of State worried about the Irish Refugee Council pulling out of the working group? Can he say anything about what will happen, one way or the other, regardless of the deliberations of this group? They have to happen because they are the right things to do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I applaud the Minister of State's faith. However, faith is one thing but there should be a determination to achieve certain results which I do not think are open for discussion. That is the point I am making. Some things are open for discussion, but others are not. I do not see how we can justify the system the Minister of State has inherited. In fact, he has clearly said we cannot justify it and that something must be done about it. I have not heard anybody put forward a credible argument in this regard, however. I know what the Minister of State thinks and what he has expressed in the past. People in the system deserve the right to work. The working group could legitimately examine how that could be made to happen. The Minister of State and his Government colleagues have to say that the end game, which will happen soon, is that asylum seekers will be allowed to work. It is unacceptable, wrong, inhuman and degrading that they should be incarcerated for any substantial length of time in a situation where they are denied that basic right.  What is the bottom line? What are the red lines that are not negotiable? It is the Minister of State's job to set them out. How long do people have to be in the system before they are allowed to work? We could debate that straight away, but the Minister of State might have an argument for doing so in six months. There have to be certain bottom lines. Children should not be put in situations where they could have inappropriate sexual contact. Families must have proper cooking facilities, also. These things should be clearly set out. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I, too, welcome the fact that we are having this discussion. I give credit to the Minister of State for at least enunciating the need to radically change the situation but I give most credit to the people in the asylum process who fought on the issue and demanded justice. However, before we throw bouquets at ourselves for the fact that we are discussing it, we must deliver. I hope we all agree on that. I am pleased to hear the right to work is being openly discussed. However, I do not think there is much to discuss except that must be allowed to happen. Is an amnesty being discussed for those who have been incarcerated in a system that the Minister of State and everyone else have acknowledged is wrong?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am only asking whether it is being discussed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a pretty big one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given that the transcript has been passed on to it, I hope the group will seriously consider an amnesty as a minimum remedy for the wrong done to people. The other issue on which we have touched that is unacceptable is the veil of secrecy and lack of transparency and oversight in terms of what has been going on in direct provision centres, which have been excluded from the normal inspection and oversight process. That is shocking. We were all shocked by what was revealed in the clerk's report, when representatives from the centres came in and talked about the number of people who died in direct provision. We do not know the full circumstances of those cases as there was no proper oversight. It is shocking stuff. There must be an absolute commitment that the situation will be fully remedied. I accept there can be discussion of how we do that but there should be no doubt that it is going to be done and that the Minister of State is determined it will happen.
