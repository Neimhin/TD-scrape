RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Workers, students, pensioners, renters and single parents are sick and tired of the false promises, the failed plans and the half measures to deal with the crushing cost-of-living crisis and, most importantly, the housing disaster people are facing, which gets worse by the day. That is why at 1 p.m. this Saturday, in Parnell Square and five other locations across the country, we in the Cost of Living Coalition hope to see thousands of people come out on the streets to express their fury at the Government’s failure to deal with the cost-of-living crisis and the disastrous housing crisis. Yesterday, as if we needed reminding, the President had to come out to call the Government to account for what he rightly described as the "great, great failure" of this Government and Republic to deal with the housing disaster over which the Government is presiding. He said that the job of a Government is to build homes-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Come on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The clock is ticking.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is it that we hear Government Ministers are saying that the President crossed the line or that he was even embarrassing? These are Government Ministers when he simply expressed-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is incredible.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He has been referenced already on a couple of occasions, but nobody else was pulled up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When the President referred to the poor law system that we thought we had left behind us as still being present, he was obviously referring to what is truly embarrassing, namely, the fact that there are 10,000 families, households, individuals and, worst of all, children in emergency accommodation. The situation has got worse and worse month after month under the auspices of this Government. There are 136,000 families on social housing waiting lists, some for a decade or two decades. There are an estimated 136,000 vacant properties, often being sat on by investors and speculators who this Government allowed to run riot and destroy the housing sector, while benefiting from the misery of tens of thousands of people who cannot afford the obscene rents or house prices and who were, in many cases, then driven into homelessness. Was the President not right when he described this as a disaster? Are the people - the workers, students, pensioners and renters - who are going to come out on the streets this Saturday to protest and say they have had enough not right to be fed up and sick and tired of this Government's failure to do the most basic thing of putting an affordable roof over the heads of the people of this country?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are talks, plans and promises but the reality is the situation just gets worse. More people are homeless and more are being threatened with eviction. Rents are rising to obscene levels and are still going higher. House prices are at obscene levels and are still going higher. Families who have done nothing wrong are being evicted. Students cannot get accommodation that is anything even approaching affordable. It is just gets worse. That is why I invite people who are fed up - and I think the majority of people are fed up and think this is a disaster - to get out on the streets this Saturday and march to force this Government finally to listen. Frankly, the Minister is not telling the truth when he says the local authorities are building more public housing. I just got the figures from Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council on the social housing it will build for the next four years. Out of 2,300 houses, approximately 10% will be directly built by the council. For the rest, it is relying on private developers. This is the truth of what is going on. Anybody can just look around the city to see the apartment blocks going up. They are not being built by councils but investors charging obscene rents and prices. That is the truth.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The figure is 10%.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a tiny percentage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is it getting worse?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to raise a specific issue in the climate transition, which is the situation facing our taxi and other public service vehicle drivers. There are approximately 20,000 people whose livelihoods depend on cars. They understand and they are quite happy that the future will be electric for taxi drivers but they have a big problem. An electric vehicle costs a lot of money - between €60,000 and €80,000. The maximum grants available offer between €20,000 and €25,000. The same drivers have lost pretty much two years of income and opportunity to save because of Covid-19. For thousands of them, their vehicles will no longer be licensable at the end of this year. Some of them are not licensable already because they have gone over the ten-year limit. They do not have the money to buy a new EV and because of the ten-year rule on taxis, they are out of business. However, it is important to note that those cars will stay on the road, but just not as taxis. The ten-year rule does not do anything for the climate. It does not do anything to reduce the number of polluting vehicles on the road. It simply puts taxi drivers out of a livelihood. They are asking for an extension of the ten-year rule because apart from anything else, and this is another critical point, there are no EVs for them to buy or very few that are suitable for taxis. They are asking for an extension of the ten-year rule to give them the time to accumulate savings to purchase the EVs and to make the transition to an electric taxi fleet. Obviously, additional grants and support beyond what is currently available would also be helpful. There should also be time for the EVs to come on stream, because at the moment they are not there. That is a plea on behalf of the taxi drivers. It is very real and tangible. They deserve a just transition and that extension should be given.
