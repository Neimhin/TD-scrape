RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister is well aware, I am implacably opposed to this new Croke Park deal in so far as it requires further sacrifices from low and middle-income workers. Following from Deputy Sean Fleming's point about the net savings the Government hopes to make, the Minister mentioned macro-economic variables. If I understand it correctly, he said that the Government will carry out further analysis with the Department of Finance in respect of those. That seems a rather bizarre way to proceed. We make the cuts before we have analysed what the impact might be on the wider economy. That leaves open the likelihood that we are cutting off our nose to spite our face. Many of those of us who have opposed austerity have suggested that by cutting the incomes of low and middle-income workers, the Government is reducing spending power and demand in the economy and doing further damage to other sectors of the economy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister agree it is rather bizarre not to carry out an analysis of the likely impact on the rest of the economy before ramming through these cuts to the incomes of low and middle-income workers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The wording of my question may have led to its being misunderstood. The phrase "or body under his aegis" refers to the wider role of the Minister in public sector reform and throughout the public service. I am trying to get information on the phenomenon of the re-hiring of people who took early retirement and were in receipt of big lump sum payments. Although people who are retired from the top echelons of the public service and in local authorities have very substantial pensions, it is often the case that days or weeks following retirement they are being re-hired on salaries which, when combined with their pensions, are effectively at the level of their previous salaries, along with significant retirement lump sums. I was hoping to get informative figures on the extent of this phenomenon. I take the point that the question may not specify that request. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence that this is happening, which is alarming. Levels of public services are declining, resulting in long waiting lists for social welfare and other areas. Front-line services are suffering due to the moratorium on recruitment, while people who were at the top of the public service and in local authorities are being taken back after retirement. That is a big problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the Minister's response. It would be useful to quantify the extent to which this is happening, because it grates hugely with people who are lower down the ladder. It also raises the question of why people were retired if their skills were still required. Either they should have been retired or they should not have been. If retired, they should have stayed retired and those on the live register should have been given the opportunity to take up those jobs. The situation needs to be examined. The perception could be created - rightly or wrongly - of jobs for the boys.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Mick Wallace is specifically referring to those who return to their former places of employment via the agency route.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister should vote for the motion then.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that a dig?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope I will get the Ministers' attention for this last few minutes, as the author of this motion. A great deal of work has gone into it. It is a very serious issue. I thank my colleagues in the United Left Alliance and other Independent colleagues who signed the motion and spoke so well and passionately on it. I also thank Members on all sides of the House who have spoken on it and taken the issue seriously. I wish to give the greatest amount of credit to the groups outside this Parliament who have brought this issue to the top of the agenda. They include environmental groups, walking groups and people involved in the timber industry. I had a group of scouts from Delgany in Greystones in the House today. The group was not here specifically for this debate, but was in the Visitors Gallery for some of it. Both the scouts and their leaders said they were utterly opposed to the sale of Coillte harvesting rights, because they are the forests in which they walk and hike. I particularly pay tribute to the Woodland League, which protested with us outside the Dáil today. Tragically, its spokesperson, Andrew St. Leger, was barred from coming in to attend this debate because he spoke at a protest outside the Dáil at 5 p.m. It was a shocking decision.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He and his group have collected over 30,000 signatures in opposition to the sale of any part of Coillte harvesting rights or any other asset. The reason there is such a broad coalition of opposition to the sale of Coillte harvesting rights is itself indicative of how many different reasons there are for opposing the sale. Every sector and stakeholder and anybody who has any concern with this issue has stated their opposition to it. It ranges from economists to scouts, the timber industry, trade unions and rural communities. Nobody supports it, because there is no good reason for it. The troika and, it appears, this Government are only interested in the bottom line, that is, deficit and financial targets. The Minister made clear last night that this is the territory on which this decision will be made. I take heart from the fact that the Government is clearly shifting its position on this. Last night, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, stated that the Government agreed in principle in June last year to the sale of the harvesting rights of Coillte. The Minister of State has said it is being considered.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have read it, and it is contradictory. The Government agreed it last June and now it is being considered. I am glad the Government is shifting its position. I believe it is doing so because all the evidence is piling up, as is the public pressure. The Government knows there is no justification for doing this, except to meet the targets of the troika to pay off the gambling debts of bankers and speculators. There is simply no argument for this. It is unfortunate, as Deputy Donnelly said, that we must argue this in terms of economics and finance. It should not be argued on those terms. The forests are our heritage and history. They are a critical part of what it is to be Irish. They are linked indissolubly to our rich literary heritage, and are indistinguishable from what it means to be Irish. That they should be given away to a private entity concerned with profiting from them rather than remaining fully the property of the public is an utterly appalling proposal. Private for-profit entities are always about making profit, often short-term profit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister had his chance to speak. By definition those entities are not concerned with public access. That is not their job. I am not making a moral statement, just an objective statement of fact. They are interested in making money. Public access, maintaining biodiversity, meeting climate change targets, creating jobs for the economy or creating revenue for the State will not be their priorities. Those are our priorities, as a society, but a private company's priority is to make money for the company. That priority will conflict with the objectives we as a society would have for forestry, to protect its environmental integrity and to protect it as a piece of our heritage and history and, yes, as an economic asset, but for every citizen of the country and not just for one or a number of private entities. In the forestry sector there is perhaps no clearer example of where environmental, heritage and social concerns cross over directly with economic interests. In Ireland, more than any other country in Europe, our environment is our economy, and forests are a critical part of it. The forests, the sea and the land are our economy, or a critical and indistinguishable part of it. Historically, the State has recognised that in the case of farming, but, sadly, we have not recognised it in the case of forestry and perhaps fishing, to the detriment of those sectors. The evidence is clear - 12,000 jobs, 18 million tourist visits, approximately €0.5 billion in revenue generated from domestic and foreign visitors and €2.2 billion in annual output from the forestry sector. The Minister will be familiar with the statistics.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a major asset but, as the Minister correctly said, it has not been properly developed by Coillte. We are not here to stand up for Coillte as it is currently constituted. The reason that Coillte has underdeveloped our forests is that it has been preparing them for privatisation since Ray Burke, Bertie Ahern, Frank Fahey and Ray MacSharry established it. That is why it has been clouded in mystery. One cannot get any information about it. It has sold 40,000 acres of forestry to the Irish Forest Unit Trust, which is made up of Bank of Ireland, Allied Irish Banks and Irish Life and Permanent.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Here is the supreme irony. The Minister says we must sell the harvesting rights to our forests because we must pay off the gambling debts of banks, yet those banks or a Swiss bank such as Helvetia Wealth, with its subsidiary headed by the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, may end up owning the forests. The choice we are putting forward is very simple. Should the people or the banks own the forests? We say the people should own them. Please do not tell me that Helvetia Wealth or the Chinese, who have also expressed an interest, or Allied Irish Banks and Bank of Ireland will develop our forests in the interests of the public and in the interests of public access, environmental integrity and protecting our heritage.They will not. They will take what they can get from the forests, make as much money as possible for shareholders and probably sell them on in a few years. Forests, more than anything else, require long-term management and stewardship in the interests of future generations.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State can say that about the banks too and that is why he should assert some control over them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He does not exert any control over the banks and cannot even give them the instruction to write-down unsustainable mortgages. I certainly do not trust him to ask the banks to manage our forests for us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Look at the heckling.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are asking the Government to keep these assets in public ownership and develop them the way they are developed elsewhere in Europe. Switzerland is half the size of Ireland with roughly the same acreage under forest and it has 100,000 forestry-related jobs. We could do that. We could get money from the European Investment Bank to do it. It is money in the bank and it would protect our forests and our heritage for the people.
