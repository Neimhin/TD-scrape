RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is, no doubt, relief among ordinary people across the country that the Taoiseach did not inflict a general election on them in the face of the pressures - often very serious financial pressures - they face in the run-up to Christmas, to gain some cynical political advantage which I think was part of his calculations in how he dealt with this unfolding crisis. How else can he explain that, right up until the last minute, he protected the former Minister for Justice and Equality, even though he knew over the weekend that the Tánaiste had misled the Dáil about the extent of her knowledge of an absolutely foul smear campaign against Maurice McCabe? This place never ceases to amaze me. I have just come from the Business Committee. Given the scale of events unfolding around us, in which we have lost a Minister and Tánaiste over the revelations that she misled the Dáil and with serious questions hanging over the current Minister for Justice and Equality over why he did not inform the Taoiseach of the extent of the knowledge within the Department at the time about the campaign against Maurice McCabe, and the questions the Taoiseach has to answer on why he protected the Tánaiste until the very last minute when it was politically unsustainable for anything to happen other than that she step down, I proposed that the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and the former Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, come to the House to answer questions. There was a complete conspiracy of silence at the Business Committee. My request for questions to be taken on all the unanswered questions was opposed across the board. It was even suggested, incredibly, that the Taoiseach should not even take Leaders' Questions today, though there was a quick backing down from this suggestion.The Taoiseach is trying to close the can of worms that has been opened on this scandal and Fianna Fáil is colluding with him, which is absolutely outrageous as so many questions remain unanswered. If information that should have been given to Mr. Justice Charleton was not given, who else in the Government at the time knew what Deputy Frances Fitzgerald and the rest of the Department knew? Did the Cabinet sub-committee on justice reform know about it? Did it deliberate on it? Is there other information in other ministries or memos on this matter that has not been handed over to Mr. Justice Charlton? Why did the Government and Fianna Fáil continue to defend Noreen O'Sullivan right up to the end, given that people in the Government knew that she had this knowledge of the smear campaign against Sergeant Maurice McCabe? It is absolutely extraordinary. We do not want to have a general election before Christmas because the people do not want to have one inflicted on them, but how can anybody have confidence in the Government, given its handling of this issue? The people certainly need to have a general election to get rid of the Government as soon as possible in the new year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a point of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Ceann Comhairle has just raised a point of order. I want to raise one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Seriously-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Ceann Comhairle should outline my response to the points made at the Business Committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also pointed out that Deputy Frances Fitzgerald had come in here last week and answered questions which had not been considered to infringe on the competency of the tribunal. If it happened last week, it can happen this week.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is the establishment trying to put the lid back on the can of worms that has been opened. It is quite extraordinary. It was perfectly okay for the former Tánaiste to come to the House last week and for us to ask questions about these matters. There was no problem with the Charleton tribunal, although there had been some suggestions previous to that, mainly from the Government, that there might be. It turned out that there was not. Now, because Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have decided to put a lid on this matter, suddenly legalese is being used to justify saying that we cannot ask questions as to why the Taoiseach protected the former Tánaiste at the weekend when he was in possession of the knowledge that she had misled the Dáil about the extent of her knowledge and that of her Department of the smear campaign against Maurice McCabe. Incidentally, we now also know that she did not get legal advice from the Attorney General at that time, which was her excuse for not acting on the information that this smear campaign was being conducted against Maurice McCabe at the O'Higgins commission. I do not buy these legal covers for the Government now trying to run away from the questions that hang over the Taoiseach and the current Minister for Justice and Equality in the context of his stance and his failure to disclose the information that he had about this matter and in respect of the questions that still remain for the former Tánaiste.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is absolutely extraordinary. Just to conclude-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The people of this country did not want an election inflicted on them before Christmas. The Taoiseach discovered that at the weekend. We all know that. However, that is not an excuse for these questions not being answered.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	After the way the Taoiseach has handled this matter, his legitimacy and that of the Government have been shredded. The people need an alternative Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even earlier.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what was said at the Business Committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not; I objected to it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Frankly, I do not understand why the Taoiseach needs this strategic communications unit for any purpose other than political propaganda. He has the Government Information Service. Why does he need this? How will he prevent the blurring of the lines in terms of the Taoiseach just getting out a political message that is convenient for him as against information? We have Ministers who are responsible for different Departments. They are supposed to answer questions. They make announcements about what they do. Why does the Taoiseach need another highly staffed, costly, so-called strategic communications unit? Where are the lines drawn between information the public objectively needs to know about what the Government is doing and the Taoiseach just putting out spin that suits him? For example, most people's perception of what happened over the past few days is that the Taoiseach had information which the public would have wished to have known about the extent of knowledge of the former Minister for Justice and Equality and within the Department of Justice and Equality about a hotly debated issue regarding the treatment of a whistleblower. As soon as that information comes into the Taoiseach's possession, is it the job of the strategic communications unit to get that information out and inform the public or is it something the Taoiseach does when it suits him, as turned out to be the case, or when the media leak certain information the Taoiseach then puts a spin on it? I do not understand where the information begins and the spin ends for this communications unit. Certainly, I believe, and it is the public perception, that this is just a spin unit, and a highly resourced and expensive one at that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Short questions
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I still do not understand what is the independent information that might be put out. Over the past few days, everybody wanted to know what information was in the possession of the Government about the extent of knowledge within the Department of Justice and Equality and the former Minister about the campaign against Maurice McCabe. Is it the Taoiseach's decision when we find out what he knew and when or it is down to the strategic communications unit to independently state that the public needs this knowledge and that it is going to put it out there regardless of the Taoiseach's political considerations? The signs are that the Taoiseach only acknowledged that when it suited him politically. I asked how we can know whether this strategic communications unit will be genuinely independent and operate objectively to get information out and who decides what information the public needs to know in an objective manner independent of the political considerations of the Taoiseach or other members of the Government.
