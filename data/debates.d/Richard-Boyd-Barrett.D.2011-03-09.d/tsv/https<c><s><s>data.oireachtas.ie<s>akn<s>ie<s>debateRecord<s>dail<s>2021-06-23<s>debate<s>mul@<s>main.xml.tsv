RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach said there would be no cliff edge for people on the pandemic unemployment payment. Taxi drivers informed me yesterday of something I did not know and I ask the Taoiseach to confirm it. It now turns out that there is a cliff edge in September and then again in November. If someone's payment reduces from €250 to €203, he or she will immediately be pushed to go on jobseeker's payment. The whole point about people on the PUP is that they are not jobseekers. Taxi drivers, musicians and others will be forced to be categorised as jobseekers and have their PUP withdrawn. That is a cliff edge and it is completely unacceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a cliff edge, but the Government did not announce it as a cliff edge.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are several hundred musicians and performers outside the Dáil as we speak who have come here to protest about the abysmal failure of the Government to engage with them about a roadmap back to work, clarity as to when they can get back to work and their concern about the plans to essentially make them jobseekers. As I previously told the Taoiseach, the cliff edge for them is a reduction of their pandemic unemployment payments when, as a result of Government measures around public health, they have not been able to work, they have no idea when they will be able to get back to work and potentially they will be forced to identify as jobseekers. Despite some funding being provided to this sector, these people, the vast majority of them ordinary jobbing musicians and performers, have got nothing in terms of support. Well-being was mentioned. There is nothing that has assisted, and generally assists, our well-being more than music, performance and entertainment yet these areas have got nothing. What does the Government propose to do for the musicians and performers that will not force them over a cliff edge but will give them clarity as to when they can return to work and some financial support or compensation for the suffering they have endured for the last year and a half?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why are they outside Leinster House?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to push the issue of Dublin Bay up the agenda of the Cabinet environment committee. Dublin Bay is a UNESCO biosphere and a place where fishermen-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry, I should have said "fishers". It is a place where fishers make a living in what is left of the decimated fishing industry. Critically, it is a precious public amenity where huge numbers of people swim. We have a major capacity problem with the Ringsend waste water treatment plant, which will not be dealt with until 2025. In the meantime, there are discharges of untreated sewage going on all over the bay, both from the plant and from storm overflows because of the lack of investment by Irish Water in rehabilitating our water infrastructure. There is a simple measure that could be taken to address this and I ask the Taoiseach to look into it. I put the same request to the Tánaiste last week. There is an ultraviolet treatment facility at Ringsend that is only being used three months per year, for the swimming season. Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister to instruct Irish Water to use that facility all-year round? It reduces the microbiological bacterial load of untreated effluent going into the sea and it would make a difference immediately if it were used.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The first issue I want to raise related to tenancies and tenants relates specifically to the pandemic. I found this out in the past few minutes and would like the Minister to do something about it urgently. Somebody who I know personally has just found himself homeless. He lives in Dún Laoghaire. He has been told that the only accommodation available is to share with five other people in Frederick Street North. This person has a chronic respiratory condition, very bad asthma, and is extremely vulnerable. I will not mention his name. We rang the council and said that it is unacceptable for somebody who is medically vulnerable to be put with five other people. I was informed by the council that the cocooning regime put in place during the height of the pandemic has been phased out. If the Minister is saying that is not the case-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am putting it on the public record because I really want that not to be the case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would really appreciate it that the Dublin Region Homeless Executive, DRHE, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council or whoever needs to be contacted, is contacted as a matter of urgency and told that a cocooning place must be made available for such people. They cannot be put somewhere where their health will be put at risk. They are not vaccinated yet and so on. They got a doctor's letter today confirming all of this. It really would be unacceptable if that were the case. That is my first point. We will, of course, support the Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Bill 2021. Insofar as it extends a small amount of protection to a very small cohort of people who self-declared that their income loss as a result of the pandemic has affected their ability to pay rent and that the protection against eviction and rent increases has been extended, of course we will support that. Similarly, we support the measures the Government has taken to put into legislation what USI has campaigned for on students having to pay only one month's deposit and so on. I welcome those developments and therefore we support the Bill. We are more than willing to say that, when the Government is doing something progressive. However, it is not opposition for the sake of opposition to say this. I will not use one of the most tired clichés that we hear in this place about missed opportunities. It is almost criminal neglect that Residential Tenancies (No. 2) Bill 2021 is not doing more to protect all tenants - not just a tiny cohort of a few hundred - against unfair evictions or no-fault evictions.  Figures from TCD and Focus Point in the last week or two indicated that 38,000 people in this country have been through homeless services since 2014, which is estimated to be 1% of the adult population. I have a personal friend in that situation. I have repeatedly raised with the Minister an entire block of tenants in St. Helen's Court in Dún Laoghaire who are facing that. These are working people who have done nothing wrong. They pay their rent and are good tenants. It is a lovely community with elderly people, new communities and working people like taxi drivers who have had their income affected but will not qualify for the protection of this Bill. They pay their rent anyway because they do not like being in arrears of their rent. They are going to be put out on the street. I have been pleading with the Minister and with officials in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council to prevent this from happening. I repeatedly hear the Taoiseach say that the Government wants to prevent people from going into homelessness. Most of the people who are faced with homelessness are being evicted from the private rental sector and most of them have done absolutely nothing wrong, but there is no protection for them.  We have pleaded with the Minister and I plead with him again. We have proposed amendments to the Bill to this effect. We should extend the protection for all tenants against no-fault evictions at least until the pandemic has fully passed. We also need to use the interim to stop no-fault evictions altogether. Why should people who pay their rent be evicted? The Minister frequently mentions the "mom and pop" landlords and that they can be treated as an exception, but not the default position. We have legislation where the default position is that it is acceptable to evict people who have done nothing wrong. The default position should be that they should not be evicted unless there are exceptional circumstances which justify the kind of individual landlord the Minister is talking about having an urgent financial or other need to sell. Other than that, landlords should not be allowed to evict tenants when they have nowhere else to go. It is just not fair for 1% of the adult population to be going through homeless services with all that entails. We cannot allow this situation to persist. It is brutal and inhumane.  It is equally unacceptable for the tenants who in my area are paying €2,000, €2,500 or €3,000 for two-bedroom apartments. Those who are single can forget it. Many of the people in St. Helen's Court are single. They are paying €800 or €900 in rent which is a lot for people on a moderate income. When they go looking for somewhere else in Dún Laoghaire, they will not get anything for less than €2,000 for a one-bedroom apartment. They will end up on the street. The local authority says, "Sorry, we have nothing for them." Will they be sent into North Frederick Street in a few weeks' time? These are ordinary decent working people. It is not right. These people are vulnerable with health conditions and other things. I plead with the Minister to do something now - not carry out a review, but do something now - to protect tenants from an 8% increase in rent on top of the €2,000 or more they are already paying. These people have a real terror that they might be made homeless and they need to be protected. The wheeled-out justification of saying, "What about the mom and pop landlord?" pales into insignificance compared with people being put on the street. That is not opposition for opposition's sake. I am saying those things because I meet those people who are crying and shivering with fear wondering what on earth they are going to do. It is just not right.  We have tabled amendments to the Bill. We will support the Bill. Given that the Bill is to be guillotined in any event, I do not expect that the Minister will accept them, although he should. However, when is he going to protect these tenants? We are talking about tens of thousands of people who are in constant fear. These people have been working all their lives but their income is insufficient to pay the unaffordable house prices and they have been on a local authority housing list for 15 or 20 years. The average waiting time in my area for council housing is now in excess of 20 years which is unbelievable. They have nowhere to go if they are evicted. I know the Minister will say this is not all his fault, which is fair enough as he is a new Minister. However, in my view it is his fault if he does not do this. While this unacceptable situation, which is the legacy of successive governments, pertains, if we want to stem the flow of people into homelessness, the first thing is to say that we must not put people out on the street. We must not allow a further increase in rents on top of already unsustainable rents. The Government should immediately bring in long-term protections for people against no-fault evictions and introduce real rent controls.  In other jurisdictions across Europe people regularly control rents; they do not just stop rent increases. A rents board or a local authority determines a maximum rent for a particular property. Will the Minister not introduce those kinds of rent controls? He may say he cannot because of the Constitution. Even though I am not sure that is true, we have introduced a right-to-housing Bill that seeks to address that and the Government could fast-track that Bill so that we can have the real rent controls we urgently need.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 2:In page 4, between lines 9 and 10, to insert the following:“ “Act of 2020” means Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Covid-19) Act 2020;”.Before I speak directly to the amendments, I wish to say publicly that I raised with the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, earlier today an issue relating to a person who is homeless and who it had been suggested might be put in shared homeless accommodation in spite of a chronic respiratory condition. I thank the Minister for responding immediately on that issue. That person, although he is still in what is obviously a very difficult situation, being homeless, has now been given his own-door emergency accommodation where he will not be vulnerable to infection due to not having been vaccinated. He and I are very appreciative that the Minister has responded so quickly. I thank him for that. As I said on Second Stage, insofar as the Bill seeks to extend protections to a small cohort of tenants, People Before Profit will support it. Support that protects any group of tenants from eviction or rent increases is to be welcomed, as are the decisions to bring into legislation some of the calls that the Union of Students in Ireland and members of the Opposition brought forward previously. However, the Minister will not be surprised to hear that we think it is not enough and that all tenants, tens of thousands of them, are in a very precarious situation and need urgent protection. In our view, the Bill should include much more serious, effective and comprehensive measures to protect tenants from eviction and rent increases they simply cannot afford when one considers that the vast majority of tenants are already paying absolutely obscene levels of rent. As I mentioned earlier today, the minimum rent for a two-bedroom apartment in my area is €2,000. Very often it is more than €2,000, such as €2,500 or €3,000. Who can afford that? In order to pay the rent for a two-bedroom apartment, one needs to earn €24,000 a year after tax. It is beyond belief. It is thoroughly obscene. On top of that, because of the blanket restriction on further rent increases that the Minister rightly introduced during the pandemic but which has now been lifted, we face a situation where the two rolled-up 4% increases over two years can mean that people are facing 8% rent increases on top of those kinds of rents. It is utterly unacceptable. It is equally unacceptable that tenants could be faced with eviction when there is no fault involved. Good tenants who pay their rent, have not done anything wrong and are not engaged in anti-social behaviour could be evicted. I want to stress that at the moment, if you are evicted, you are, in effect, in a homelessness crisis. That is certainly the case where I live, as it is in most of Dublin. Most people would say it is also the case in Cork, Galway, Waterford and many of the other epicentres of the housing crisis, such is the level of unaffordability and the extortionate rip-off rents being charged by vulture funds, corporate landlords or just landlords who think they can make a lot of money. That is not acceptable. If there was a big supply of affordable rental accommodation, one might say maybe it is okay that people can be evicted, but in a situation where there is nothing out there that is affordable and 100,000 families are, in one way or another, on social housing lists, transfer lists or a HAP transfer list with no chance of getting a property, there is nothing there for them. Almost as a matter of definition, if one is evicted, one is very likely in a homelessness crisis. I have previously mentioned the St. Helen's Court residents to the Minister. I hope he might intervene in the effective way he did today in terms of their plight. They are in a dire situation. These are elderly people, working people who pay their rent and so on. This community is facing the prospect of being in emergency accommodation in the coming weeks because the protections they enjoyed during the pandemic have not been lifted and this Bill does not provide them. The amendments in this grouping are an attempt to address that issue and to bring into the Bill protections for all tenants for the duration of the emergency period at a minimum so that they evolve. These are amendments to the emergency legislation. They provide that for the emergency period, that is, for as long as the pandemic is with us, there should be absolutely no question of anybody being evicted and, similarly, there should be no question of people having further rent increases imposed on them. In addition, when the period ends there should be no question of rent increases being backdated or accumulating such that people face an 8% or potentially a 12% rent increase. Even those who are protected by the Bill could find themselves getting a 12% increase. There should be no backdating of those increases. That is what these amendments do. By the way, that is only as a stopgap. We need not just pandemic-related protections for all tenants, but fundamental reform in the legislation to protect tenants properly. Nobody who pays their rent and is a good tenant should face eviction. If landlords are selling, they should be required to do so with tenants in situ. As regards the stopgap, if the Minister accepts these amendments, which I know he will not do, he should then bring in legislation that will give that protection to tenants and, similarly, bring in rent controls. I do not see what other way it can be done because I do not believe for one minute that rents are going to come down even if the supply to which the Minister often refers increases and so on. There is no real prospect of the current unaffordable rents coming down. We need rent controls, as are standard in many countries. Even in the heart of capitalism, in New York and places like that, the authorities set rents at affordable levels and that is what should happen here. People from a rent board or the local authority should go in, look at a property and say a particular figure is as much as can be charged for that property. That is what we actually need to protect tenants. I do not know whether the current by-election might spur the Minister on a bit. It certainly spurred the Tánaiste into making some fairly remarkable promises. It might be worth the Government bearing in mind while considering these amendments that there is a significant number of renters in Dublin Bay South. Many of the people to whom I have spoken on the doorsteps have asked what will be done for tenants and renters. I think the Minister should take this opportunity. If it protects tenants, I do not care that it might get a few votes for Fianna Fáil. This is the time when we have to protect tenants from unjust evictions and the extortionate rents they are now facing. At the very least, the Minister could accept these amendments which would mean that for the full duration of the emergency period, that is, until the emergency legislation is repealed, there will be no rent increases and no evictions. A lot of people would benefit from that, including the tenants in my area whom I have mentioned and who are now facing the imminent threat of eviction and homelessness when they have done absolutely nothing wrong. I appeal to the Minister to seriously consider these amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us be clear that these amendments are in order. I was pleasantly surprised that they were found to be so, but the fact is they were and, as such, I do not really accept the Minister's response. It is tricky for us to bring forward amendments to this type of legislation without finding ourselves out of order. There is a difficulty in trying to do things that were not directly envisaged by the Minister, as author of the legislation. If there are any technical problems with any aspect of these amendments, the Minister could overcome them if he had the will to do so. His response does not really answer the substantive point. I am not saying that what the Minister said is wrong but nor am I accepting it is right. The amendments represent our effort to extend the protections that were provided under the 2020 Act. When the Minister says that legislation has ceased to operate, I do not quite know what he means. There is still an emergency period operating in that some tenants are being protected under this Bill. We want that protection extended to all tenants. The Minister has not addressed the substantive point that the vast majority of tenants, who should be protected in this Bill, are not being protected from the prospect of rent increases they simply cannot afford.The Minister can tell me if he disagrees. I do not think, however, that anybody could seriously disagree that the amounts of rent that are being paid by the vast majority of people in this country, particularly in Dublin, Galway, Cork and Waterford, the epicentres of the housing crisis, are utterly obscene and unaffordable for ordinary working people. Does the Minister accept that? I would be interested to know because, to me, it is blatantly obvious. Rent of €2,000 or more a month is just not acceptable. How are ordinary working people supposed to pay that? As I have pointed out, of a renter's after-tax income, this amounts to €24,000 a year. That is just obscene. Does the Minister accept that most people cannot afford to pay these amounts? They most certainly cannot afford to have an 8% rent increase on top of that - a very real prospect they are facing - or a 12% increase at the end of the emergency period for even the small group that will be protected by this Bill. They simply cannot pay. We need rents that are affordable and that ordinary people can pay. I cited the St. Helen's Court complex as a tangible example in this regard. The people who are facing homelessness and who have always paid their rent, were paying amounts of €900 or €1,000 a month. That is a lot, but they could just about manage it. They are being evicted because the owners of Mill Street Projects, the vulture fund, want to charge double that amount and they know they have to evict the tenants to do so. They have spent four years driving those tenants out and trying to circumvent the legislation. They have finally found a way to do it and they are going to put those people out on the street. There is no protection for them and there is no social housing in the area. There is no other rental accommodation in the area that they can afford. Where is the protection for them? Is the Minister going to protect them and other tenants like them? That is the question. That is what all those renters out there want to know. If there is something technically wrong with our amendment, I ask the Minister to tell us what the Government's response is going to be to protect them against evictions or unaffordable rents. People need to know. Earlier, we outlined to the Minister the statistic that 38,000 people have gone through homeless accommodation since 2014, which equates to almost 1% of the adult population. That is absolutely shocking. There are probably several thousand people who are going to face eviction in the coming weeks and months. They are in dire trouble. Once a person is evicted, he or she is, by definition, in dire trouble. Does the Minister accept that? Does he accept that if a person is evicted, he or she is in serious trouble? What is he going to do to protect those who are in that situation? There is an urgency to this question. What we are doing is not what Deputy Higgins described on Second Stage as opposition for opposition's sake. We are reflecting the reality of what renters are facing. We are asking, with these amendments, for the Government to insert into the legislation protections that would prevent people being put into a crisis situation over the coming weeks and months while the more thoroughgoing legislation to which the Minister referred is prepared. It would be interesting to know what will be in that legislation to address these issues. Why would the Minister reject the idea that we freeze things now until that more comprehensive legislation is introduced? I ask him to explain that to me. I do not understand why the Government would create a window for unfair rent increases and evictions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will support the amendment before us, in particular, along with the other amendments in the grouping. It covers some of the ground we sought to cover in our amendments Nos. 14 and 15. It seems the Minister does not really want to answer the question that is being asked about these tenants. I never used the word "tsunami", by the way, although I acknowledge it has been bandied about a bit. I know, because I am dealing with a case I have mentioned many times in the House, that there is a group of human beings for whom, as soon as the 5 km travel restriction linked to the blanket ban on evictions was lifted, the clock began ticking on their eviction, namely, the tenants at St. Helen's Court. Now they are overholding because they have nowhere to go, but they have been evicted. They had protection, which the Minister took from them with that change. He has stated that he will introduce more comprehensive protections, which is good, but will they protect people in those circumstances? In the meantime, a group of people I know, and there have to be others, including some of the 1,122 tenants in the system who were mentioned, will be in similar circumstances. It is worth considering the logic driving some of these evictions and why it is even more right that the Government should provide them with protection against these uncaring evictions. Deputy Ó Broin's amendment relates to the Residential Tenancies Act 2004. I have to hand a copy of a determination order from a hearing of the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, that I attended on behalf of some of those residents. It really tells a story. I sat through the hearing and was disgusted by what happened, and I have since read over the document. The tenants were living in an apartment block and paying rent. Their landlord, obviously, got into trouble and a vulture fund came in and bought the apartment block. It tried to raise the rent by 60% or 70%, which would have driven out the tenants, but it backed off because the tenants resisted and took the case to the Residential Tenancies Board. The fund then issued a spurious eviction order against all the tenants on the grounds that it was going to refurbish the property, and the tenants rightly made the case at the time, a few years ago, that they did not need to be evicted to allow the place to be refurbished. It was a ruse to get them out, and they fought that successfully. It was getting a bit embarrassing. PwC was representing the large American vulture fund and I raised the matter in the House. I do not know whether it subcontracted the dirty work of evicting the tenants to another crowd but then a crowd known as Mill Street Projects Limited came in and took over the case in 2019. It is based at an address I do not believe exists - Aught, Ture, Muff, or something - that spans three townlands in Donegal. I do not know how a company can have an address in three different townlands and an address in Derry where, when it is contacted, nobody is ever there. The company seems to be quite an outfit. In any event, it took over the case in 2019 and tried to evict the remaining tenants, many of whom had left at this stage, although there were originally 20 of them. Many of them had left because the stress of it was too much for them, but others had nowhere to go, so they were still there. This crowd then issued an eviction notice stating that it had not decided whether it would sell or refurbish the property but it wanted the tenants out in any case. That ran afoul of the Tyrrelstown amendment which, obviously, the company's legal advisers had not sussed out, so it backed off at the last minute. A few weeks later, it stated that it was not actually going to evict ten tenants, because that was not allowed, so it would evict eight of them instead, as if it was not going to come back later and get the other two. We contacted the RTB, with the tenants and Threshold, and explained what was blatantly obvious, that is, that it was a ruse, that the company was going to evict eight of the tenants because it could not evict ten and that it was going to come back for the other two as soon as the legislation allowed it to do that, which I think was six months later. The cold logic of the hearing is worth considering. The tenants had explained that this was a ruse and that they had done nothing wrong, and the representative of the landlord confirmed he was employed by the landlord company as an investment manager. The determination order quotes him as stating that it was his job to assess all options for the dwelling with a view to realising the best value, and he submitted that it was always the landlord's intention to refresh and resell the dwelling based on a commercial decision. It goes on to state that a named real estate agent had been engaged for the purposes of sale and that the landlord had created an owner-manager company and reiterated it was always the company's intention to sell it following a refresh he estimated would take ten or 12 weeks. In other words, the landlord was saying clearly to the RTB that it had bought the place in 2019, and the only thing it had ever intended to do was evict the tenants to increase its value and flip it on, and that is allowed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Those tenants deserve protection now because that is a ruthless logic. This is not the mom-and-pop landlord often referred to as a justification for the lack of protections; this is cold, ruthless, profit-driven logic. These people have no intention of being landlords to tenants. They have one intention and one intention only, that is, to make profit by putting people out in the street. Why would the Minister not want to take this opportunity to protect such tenants? That is the question and I have never got an answer to it. Is it his intention to stop that type of behaviour and, if so, why will he not do it now? That is a serious question. Real people's well-being and mental health, in the context of having a place to live and not being forced into crisis situations, depend on the answer he gives to that question.
