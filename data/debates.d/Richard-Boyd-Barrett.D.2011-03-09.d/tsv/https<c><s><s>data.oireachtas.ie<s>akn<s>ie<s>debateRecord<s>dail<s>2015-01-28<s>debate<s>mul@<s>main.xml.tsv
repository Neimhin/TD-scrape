RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend the various organisations representing the survivors of the vast array of institutions that formed this architecture of oppression, abuse and persecution which ruined the lives of tens of thousands of women and children.It abused them, robbed them of their identities and histories and inflicted a crime on tens of thousands of vulnerable people and children. The damage that was done can never be fully undone. All those groups, organisations and individuals deserve credit for finally forcing these issues to the forefront, getting the State and political system to acknowledge that a crime against them has been committed and that as much as possible must be done to detail the full scale of the crime and provide redress and support to the victims of survivors of that great crime. These groups are the Adoption Rights Alliance, the Irish First Mothers group, Justice for the Magdalenes, the survivors of the Bethany Home and Westbank orphanage and other such institutions. Many individuals have not survived and will never see justice on this matter. All of those deserve great tribute for bringing events to this point, where finally the Government and the State has acknowledged the need for some sort of redress. It is still hard to get one's head around the scale of what was done. Most of the history of this State was one where this great crime was being committed and the most powerful people in church and State were overseeing this horrendous treatment of tens of thousands of women and children on the basis of the extraordinary notion of legitimacy and illegitimacy. It was an incredible thing for a State and church to have in mind when the founding document of that State, which we will celebrate next year, details the cherishing of all children equally, and a church would outline principles of humanity, decency and the ten commandments, etc. At the same time these people would hold in their heads this notion that some people were legitimate and some were illegitimate. On the basis of that notion, they could then stigmatise, abuse, imprison and incarcerate those people, treating them as sub-humans. All the normal rights and dignities that would have been accorded to legitimate people would have been simply denied to them and they were treated like animals. It is just extraordinary that such a position could persist for so long. Even when I was a young person growing up, the notion was still around of stigmatising single mothers and it persisted until the 1980s and 1990s. It was an extraordinary, barbaric and uncivilised perspective on life that justified horrendous crimes. I was adopted through St. Patrick's Guild and my mother was forced to go to England and give birth to me in a mother and baby home. Many of the mothers who were in a similar position will not be included in this because the birth and adoption took place in England. They will be outside the terms of reference for this commission. I was relatively lucky because I was adopted by a good family and, although my birth mother faced very considerable resistance for many years from the institutions that had facilitated these adoptions, she fought through that resistance, was persistent and was finally able to make contact with me. Therefore, I was lucky in a way that thousands of other people have not been. They will never get to see their children or biological parents and they may never fully recover their history or identities because of the unbelievable architecture of oppression and abuse that existed. There was political cowardice in the failure of successive Governments to address this issue and give redress to the people who were victims of this system. As a result of pressure and persistence from the survivors of this, we have got to this point so could we please not fall at the last hurdle and deny people the full justice and redress that they are asking for? There is an idea that we can partially deal with this matter, decide that we will look at particular institutions or shine a light on specific parts rather than the entire architecture. All these institutions, including the State, the church and various other bodies, were part of an integrated whole. They were a system of oppression that led to a denial of rights. We need to shine a light on all these so that full justice and redress can be given to all those who seek it. This must come without partiality, restrictions or limitations. As we have got this far, can we not go the entire way and ensure nobody is left outside? We must get all the truth, redress and justice for all the victims in those institutions. None should be excluded from this belated process of justice and acknowledgement of a great crime.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What I find utterly depressing about this place, this Chamber and even media coverage is that one might, if one bangs one's head off the wall for a couple of years, raise issues relentlessly, as some of us have raised this issue for the past four years, and at one point there might be a few headlines and a grandiose statement from the Government of its intent to solve a problem. For example, in response to one parliamentary question I asked in 2012, the Minister for Social Protection assured me, "There will be no incidence of homelessness due to these changes." Of course, the homelessness crisis spiralled out of control for the next two years, but I am sure there was a headline and an RTE soundbite that the Government was getting on top of the housing crisis. That is the way it works. Every now and again, we get a flash where there is an acknowledgement of the crisis, we get a grandiose announcement and the crisis only gets worse. That is what has happened. All the way along, the Government has been warned, screamed at, pleaded with and urged to deal with this, occasionally it acknowledges there is a crisis, and every now and again there is some initiative and the situation only gets worse. In the past year the housing list in my area has gone from 4,000 to 5,200, with 100 more applicants per month going onto the list. Homelessness levels have gone through the roof. That, proportionately, for the size of the county, is a bigger increase in the housing list than anywhere else, including Dublin city, because rents are unaffordable and the caps are a joke. Does the Minister know how many council houses - not fictional houses in the HAP scheme, fictional council houses in RAS or leasing schemes, but actual council houses - Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown will build next year? They will build approximately 13 next year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are approximately 40. Even if they sorted those 40 houses out, that would be 50 off a list of 5,200.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It would not even keep track with the number of applicants who will join the list in one month, never mind what is happening in the country. Will the Government take some of the €4 billion NAMA has and use it to start an emergency council house programme? Nothing else will even begin to touch this problem.
