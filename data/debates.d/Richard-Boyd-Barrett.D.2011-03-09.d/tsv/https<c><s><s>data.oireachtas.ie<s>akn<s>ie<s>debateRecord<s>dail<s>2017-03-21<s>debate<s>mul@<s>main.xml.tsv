RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us see some action here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Taoiseach sure? That will be next year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is on top of his game.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The strategic priorities document is littered with pious aspirations and noble objectives, particularly in the area of housing and social inclusion. They are belied by the actual policies implemented in these areas. I will quote the better society section of the Taoiseach's document, "We will seek to ensure that the position of vulnerable groups in society is taken into account." It continues, "There will be a focus on providing a safe and supportive environment for children, families and older people, including through reforms in the areas of housing." Let us test those noble aspirations against the human reality. I am dealing with the case of a young mother called Sinéad at the moment, who has a four year old child. There is a history of abuse in the background of the family. They are very vulnerable, and Sinéad is terrified for her four year old daughter. She is homeless. She has been told, as part of a new policy, that she cannot stay in hotel accommodation in Dún Laoghaire near a supportive family network, but must instead go into a hostel 11 km away, in Francis Street, over a pub. How is she supposed to get her child to school? This is a policy that has been set down by the Minister because he has to meet a target of getting everybody out of hotel accommodation.Therefore she cannot stay in a hotel in Dún Laoghaire near her family, but it is okay to put her in a hostel over a pub in Francis Street, 11 km away. A year ago, Amanda got a HAP scheme housing placement, which was the Government's big solution. One year later the landlord pulls out of the HAP scheme. In my naivety, I thought that under the HAP scheme, the council had an obligation to find her something else. That is not so, however. Amanda has been told to take her three young children under the age of three into a hostel in Dublin city centre, 11 km or 12 km away from where they go to school. Is that the supportive environment for families, including children, that was promised in the document?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach did not answer my question at all.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what happened.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The decision is not being taken by the council.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our councillors have raised it at Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Better a hotel in Dún Laoghaire than a hostel in Dublin.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will take up where Deputy Barry left off. Something that depresses me about the frightening rise of the far right and the openly racist - in some cases, openly neo-fascist - organisations is the poverty of analysis, deep cynicism and, often, dishonesty of the political establishment in this country and across Europe when faced with the dire threat of a return to the extreme nationalist and far right politics of the 1930s that spelled such a disaster for Europe. Disappointingly, we heard that poor analysis and dishonesty expressed by Deputy Donnelly in trying to link People Before Profit to the UKIPs of this world. That is echoed by Fianna Fáil-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----Fine Gael-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----Labour and the Greens-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not interrupt Deputy Donnelly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Donnelly linked us to despicable people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It showed a dishonesty of analysis and a lack of any sense of humility about the failures of the political establishments in this country and Europe and their responsibility for giving rise to these vile political forces. We on the left are the ones who criticise Europe time and again, not because it is too generous to immigrants, but because it allowed 7,000 immigrants to die in the Mediterranean through a Fortress Europe policy and because of the despicable policy, which Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have their fingerprints on, of imprisoning 4,000 people, including 1,500 children, in the abomination that is direct provision. Despite setting up and maintaining that system, which degrades young people, those parties say nothing about it. They fail to criticise Europe's racist Fortress Europe policy or its despicable deal with Turkey that forces desperate Syrian refugees back into the hands of the rotten Turkish regime, which has a despicable human rights record. Similar deals are being done with Libya and Afghanistan. In the case of the latter, Afghan asylum seekers will be deported from the EU back to Afghanistan en masse. We are the ones who speak up for the refugees. We are the ones who speak up for Ibrahim Halawa, who is rotting in an Egyptian prison and whose sisters ask why the political establishment does not do more? I will tell the House what I honestly believe - the beef deals are more important than the need to take a hard approach with the Egyptian regime.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not interrupt the Deputy. He does not like it when he is criticised.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not interrupt you, so why do you not shut up?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are the ones who try to address the inequality that the political establishment in Europe-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----has fostered and fomented. Now I am being interrupted by all three sides of the Dáil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They all keep interrupting because they do not like being criticised. Consider the gross levels of inequality that Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have presided over and Europe has created, the high levels of homelessness and the housing crisis. It is these kinds of inequality and social injustice that provide the fuel for the rotten forces of the far right. Nor is there any reflection of the similarities between the policies of the so-called moderate centre and these extreme right forces. Is it not interesting? Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael support the race to the bottom in reducing corporate taxes on large corporations, which is one of the major contributory factors to global economic inequality. Who supports the same policy but Donald Trump, Farage and Theresa May? The only result of reducing taxes on corporations is an increase in the economic inequality that is giving rise to the far right. As such, we will not be taking lectures from a political establishment that is responsible in Europe and domestically for the rise of these forces. We are trying to offer a genuine, radical, progressive and anti-racist alternative to a failed establishment and a despicable far right.
