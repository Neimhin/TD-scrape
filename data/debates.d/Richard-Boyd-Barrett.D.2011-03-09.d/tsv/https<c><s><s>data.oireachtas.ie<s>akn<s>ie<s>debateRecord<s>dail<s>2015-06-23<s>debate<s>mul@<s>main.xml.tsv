RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Ruth Coppinger, who raised a similar issue today, and a number of other Members, including me, have for years been receiving allegations from construction workers, particularly bricklayers, plasterers and labourers, that there is widespread tax fraud taking place on building sites. Contractors and developers are abusing the so-called RCT 1 system by misclassifying people as "self-employed" when they are not in order to evade tax responsibilities and to underpay those workers. The ruling of the Labour Court in the JJ Rhatigan case, where workers were paid €100,000 to basically get lost, suggests that this is happening, and continues to happen, on other sites which I will mention in a minute.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister please get off the script and address what is a very serious issue? Currently, approximately 63,000 people are classified as being self-employed in construction, which accounts for about half of all construction workers. Are we seriously to believe that half of all those working in construction are entrepreneurs? I can tell the Minister they are not. If he wants examples, he should go out to the Gannon Homes site in Swords, a NAMA developer, where he will find people being misclassified as self-employed when they are not self-employed. They are not entrepreneurs; they are simply bricklayers being paid €100 a day. Similarly, this practice is going on at the Robswall site in Malahide just as it went on in Rhatigan's. It needs to be investigated but there seems to be no will on the Minister's part to ensure it is investigated. People who are clearly not self-employed subcontractors are being employed by builders in order for those builders to avoid paying PRSI, holiday pay and tax for those employees. The result of this practice is that Revenue is losing possibly hundreds of millions of euro in tax revenue each year because people are being misclassified. This is tax fraud. It is a criminal offence and the Minister has shown no interest in tackling it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister just passes the buck; this is not Revenue's job and it does not come under the RCT system. These people are being misclassified as self-employed when they are not. It is an abuse of the system and the taxpayer is losing out, not to the mention the exploitation of workers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I want the Minister to take responsibility for tax fraud. The allegations are that this is rampant in the construction industry and on sites involving big public contracts. We saw this happen in Rhatigan's and it had to pay €100,000. Did it have to pay it because everything was squeaky clean? No, it was because it was abusing the system. This is tax fraud. It is a crime. If contractors and subcontractors are misclassifying people as being self-employed when in fact they are employing those people directly, that is the business of Revenue and it is the business of the Government, collectively, to ensure inspections take place. I mentioned two sites. The inspectors need to be sent to those sites now. This practice is going on as we speak at the Gannon Homes site in Swords, a former NAMA site, and at the Robswall site in Malahide. Rhatigan's, which, as we know, was involved in such practice arising from the dispute in Kishoge, also has four or five other sites where it is currently building schools. This practice is rampant and the result is that €167 million was deducted last year in RCT but €139 million was given back. Therefore, only €27 million is being collected in tax from 63,000 employees. It is an absolute joke.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government needs to follow it up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ironically, one of the big issues at Davos this year was inequality. This discussion at Davos about inequality in the world was proceeded by the aforementioned Oxfam report that showed by next year the richest 1% of people in the world will own more wealth than everybody else in the world put together. There is a discussion about inequality against a background of obscene and gross inequality where a tiny group of people control the vast majority of wealth in the world while billions of people are starving, without homes, suffering extreme financial distress and suffering austerity. Those discussing austerity, along with the Taoiseach and the other leaders, were 100 billionaires who were invited to this event. They included our old friend, Mr. Denis O'Brien, worth €6 billion. Interestingly, according to The Sunday Times rich list, his wealth has doubled since the recession started. We have persons whose wealth is obscene beyond belief gathering together to discuss the evils of inequality in the world when those who are discussing it are the culprits. They are the ones responsible for the inequality because they, between them, have hoovered up more wealth than the vast majority of the world's population has. Does the Taoiseach agree that is quite obscene? The Taoiseach, as a head of state, gets a free ticket but the tickets for the conference at Davos are $30,000 each.There, the super rich - the world's richest people - along with heads of state and royalty discuss inequality. Not many of the victims of inequality will be getting in at $30,000 per ticket. The banquets and partying are pretty sumptuous according to reports.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Those are the reports that I am reading, not that I would ever get into Davos or want to.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach believe it is appropriate to attend such a conference when it is a symbol of the gross inequality that has developed in the world? If we are in any way serious about the issue of inequality, we should have an aggressive policy of wealth redistribution. Did the Taoiseach come away from the conference with anything like that? Looking beyond the irony of these super rich people discussing inequality, did the Taoiseach conclude that we should perhaps increase taxes on them and their corporations so that we might have real wealth redistribution and make an impact on the gross gap between the rich and the poor? Has the Taoiseach come away from Davos with any intention of doing that? I have raised the issue of corporate profits and how little corporations pay in taxes. We have seen a further example in the business section of today's The Irish Times. The Taoiseach should read it. It relates to the Covanta incinerator. Besides the fact that the elected representatives of Dublin opposed it, we have discovered-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My point has to do with inequality and wealth. We have discovered that a shelf company has been set up in Luxembourg by the owners of Covanta. It is charging 13.5% interest on a loan-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----to Covanta such that Covanta's tax liability will be reduced to virtually nothing. Okay?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point is that, after €100 million in public money has been invested in the project, Covanta will not contribute anything-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----to the Exchequer. Aggressive tax avoidance, which we appear to be up to our necks in facilitating, is responsible for the gross inequality that was discussed at Davos despite the irony of hob-nobbing with the individuals who are benefitting from that inequality. In all sincerity, does the Taoiseach recognise that this level of wealth inequality results from tax scams like that one and the obscene concentration of wealth in the hands of a few individuals, the very people who attended Davos? Having heard reports like the one I have just mentioned, has he any intention of radically moving in the direction of redistributing wealth through higher corporate and income taxes on these wealthy people? What does he propose to do about inequality, which is rampant in this country and across the world?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is because they do not pay any tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was $25,000 in Davos to eat from a plate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There were no billionaires.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did the Taoiseach have drinks with Denis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The last few weeks have been another shameful chapter in the period of office of the Government when it comes to solidarity and internationalism with Greece and other people throughout Europe who are suffering under the cosh of austerity. It is really treacherous that the Irish Government has lined up with the austerity bullies of the EU against the Greek people. Last week the Taoiseach said Greece must face up to its responsibilities. What a shocking and ignorant statement to make. The people of Greece have more than faced their responsibilities and at a very terrible cost in that since austerity started 1 million jobs have been lost; there has been a 190% increase in unemployment; 30% of businesses have closed; there has been a 38% average salary reduction and a 45% average pension reduction; there has been a 42.8% increase in child mortality and a 98.2% increase in poverty; and two people commit suicide every day in Greece, a dramatic increase in suicide rates. All of this has resulted in almost one third of GDP being slashed. The Greek economy has been devastated. This is as a result of austerity and implementing the troika's programme, not because they resisted but because previous governments implemented the austerity programme. It devastated the society and the economy. The notion the Greeks were overspending is nonsense. Greece has historically underspent in social spending as a proportion of its GDP. It had caught up to some extent only recently, until this austerity was imposed. It still spends three percentage points less, for example, on social spending than Germany, the Government of which is ramming this brutal austerity down the throats of the people and saying they have not given enough. Shamefully our Government played the best boy in the class routine yet again for its comrade in the European People's Party, Angela Merkel. I honestly wonder does the Taoiseach bring an apple to Mrs Merkel every time he goes to see her, like the little teacher's pet sucking up to Angela Merkel and the head of the EU bullies. The irony of this is what the Government gets in reward for sucking up to Angela Merkel and the austerity bullies. We got the answer to this yesterday when the IMF turned around and told the Government to be careful with what it does in the budget as it is not happy with any talk of pay restoration. For all the sucking up and treachery in terms of the Greek people, the IMF is still bossing the Government around.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no reward. It is still being told what it can and cannot do in the budget. This is what the IMF said. It is pathetic and treacherous, particularly when we, like the Greeks, are still being forced to pay billions and billions of euros out in interest to these banks which destroyed the European economy and caused this mess in the first place. The Government should be ashamed of itself.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State should read 1984. He sounds like Big Brother.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Watch out for the cyber-terrorists and aliens from outer space.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this topic for debate. To say that Gaelscoil Phádraig in Ballybrack has had a raw deal would be a major understatement. It has been in existence for 20 years. In that time it has been in four different temporary locations. Most of that time, and currently, it has been on a 0.7 acre site with prefabricated buildings, many of which are over 15 years old, some of which have recently required emergency repairs. The contractor repairing them cannot guarantee those repairs for any period. Fifth and sixth classes, and first and second classes are thrown together. It has a tiny play area which because it has no assembly hall has to double up for use for school concerts and assemblies. The conditions are completely unacceptable. The classrooms are below the recommended size, yet this school was promised in 2005 that it would be moved to a permanent location in the nearby Archbishop McQuaid school. Ten years on and 20 years after it was set up, it is still in these completely unacceptable conditions. The school wants to hear from the Minister of State today that the coming year will be its last year in these temporary conditions. It is shameful that it has been left there so long. It cannot abide these conditions. At this stage the parents, teachers and students wonder what they did wrong, that they were allowed to persist in these completely unsuitable conditions. This is a disadvantaged area but despite having applied for Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools, DEIS, status Gaelscoil Phádraig did not get that, although all the children come from the same area as children in other schools given DEIS status. The Minister of State might also consider that. They have been short-changed for 20 years. It is just not good enough. The Taoiseach talked earlier about the priority he gives to investing in the future, education, upskilling our citizens and so on. How the hell can we do any of that or how can that mean anything if we leave our kids in these conditions for 20 years? That is the commitment they want. They really want some hope because they have had enough and are at the end of their tether. The Minister of State will probably tell us that the school has been allocated a new emergency prefab. It is even frightened of getting that because it thinks that may be an excuse to put it on the long finger again and it points out that will further infringe on the tiny play area it has and crowd the school out even further. It may have to put up with it for another year but it wants a guarantee this is the last year and that it will be in the school that was allocated ten years ago, which sits less than a quarter of a mile away, and that the new buildings the special school currently in that building requires will be completed by then, and Gaelscoil Phádraig can have the school it should have had ten years ago.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no news there for Gaelschoil Phádraig. It is aware of all that the Minister of State said. This is the fear, that it will extend beyond this year. The situation has got progressively worse for it after a 20 year saga of moving from one place to another. It was in one room without proper windows, then it had two classrooms in another school, then it had to be bussed to another area, now it has been in the prefabs for years. These prefabs are way beyond their sell-by date and are completely unsuitable. The numbers have increased by 26 this year so there will be more overcrowding. It had to hold last year's school concert in the playground. That is the only place it can hold assembly as well. It is not acceptable. Of course it does not want to be played off against a special school, which also needs to be housed. For this to have gone on for this long is crazy. After all it has gone through, the Department should be able to say it will get it, come hell or high water, by September 2016.It would not be fair or right for this to drag on for another year thereafter. Gaelscoil Phádraig is asking the Department to recognise that it has been wronged, not only by this Government but by its predecessors over 20 years. The school has been short-changed and is asking that special care and attention are shown and an effort is made to ensure the new building is completed by the end of 2016. This could be achieved with determination. That is the appeal being made by the school. I also ask that the Department consider the DEIS status of Gaelscoil Phádraig, which will, I understand, apply for disadvantaged status again this year. There is no reason for the school's failure to secure DEIS status given that other schools with students from the same catchment area have such status. Gaelscoil Phádraig has been short-changed at two levels and the Government must recognise the wrongs done to it by showing fairness to the children in the school.
