RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In 2004, in the biggest demonstration since 1921, 5,000 people marched in Dún Laoghaire to demand that the council abandon proposals to build a ten-storey private apartment block on the site of Dún Laoghaire baths and force a commitment from it to restore the public swimming baths.  The demonstrators later forced it to commit to a plan in this regard.  After a long delay and endless foot-dragging by the council, last night the Minister's Labour Party and Fine Gael colleagues voted to give €1.5 million to the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company to place a barge off the east pier in Dún Laoghaire.  The county manager, in supporting the proposal for a barge off the east pier, stated it would allow the council to "exit the baths thing".  Does the Minister believe it is acceptable for his Labour Party and Fine Gael colleagues and the county manager to show such contempt for the wishes of the public, so strongly expressed over ten years, that they would abandon the plan to have a swimming pool back on the site of Dún Laoghaire baths?  Would it not be in the interests of the State's tourism infrastructure and the Government's stated commitment to develop tourism to give the people of Dún Laoghaire what they want, namely, restored Victorian swimming baths on Dún Laoghaire seafront?  Acceding to the people's demands would boost tourism in Dún Laoghaire and the wider Dublin area.  I ask the Minister to intervene in this regard by getting the council to restate its commitment to provide the swimming baths and by having the Department become directly involved in providing funding therefor.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Dún Laoghaire seafront is a national tourism asset of great significance.  Dublin is the biggest tourism hub in the country.  To develop the seafront in Dún Laoghaire and provide amenities there is of national significance.  There was widespread support across the city of Dublin for the campaign against the privatisation of the seafront and to demand the restoration of Dún Laoghaire baths.  There was support from all over the country because people understood restoring the public swimming amenity and the Victorian heritage of the seafront would be a great boost for tourism in Dublin and that the provision of amenities would be of citywide and national significance.  It is, therefore, the Minister's business.  His Fine Gael and Labour Party colleagues on Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council are playing politics with the issue to the detriment of the interest of the residents and the Government's stated objective to develop tourism infrastructure and create employment therefrom.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They promised the people a swimming pool, but they have not delivered.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	More broken promises.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the returns on investment in cultural heritage, cultural heritage is an end in itself.  Given the dire economic circumstances, many people believe that investing in our heritage infrastructure and improving access to it could have significant economic spin-off effects.  Consequently, the Minister must take a more hands-on approach in this regard.  I am sorry to be parochial but this is important.  I will cite three examples of the failure to do this within my own constituency.  I have just mentioned the Dún Laoghaire baths and the council's ten-year refusal to invest in this site, which could enhance the heritage and tourist amenity of Dún Laoghaire.  The Joyce tower now has been closed, essentially because of the public sector recruitment embargo.  Moreover, the council lacks the resources to facilitate small boat owners in organising trips for the public across to Dalkey Island to see the Martello tower there.  This is in a small stretch.  It is the Minister's business if local authorities lack either the will or the resources to ensure public and tourist access to such vital heritage amenities or if they do not have the available resources to restore them and bring them up to a level at which they would encourage tourists to visit the country.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To fight an unjust law.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a regressive law.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister aware the public cannot visit Dalkey Island?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is because the council does not have the money to repair the jetty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, are we seriously expected to take 60 questions together?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have spent an hour dealing with five questions and now the Taoiseach is proposing to take 60 questions in ten minutes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is crazy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the case that European leaders were staring into the abyss last week and had to produce something new or face going over that abyss?  Is it not also the case that when one examines the detail or lack thereof in the so-called breakthrough, there is good reason to believe it may be something of an accountancy trick, especially in light of the statement by the Minister for Finance immediately after the great declaration that there will not be any easing of the burden of austerity to be imposed on people this year?  Moreover, given that we own the banks, does shifting the burden from the sovereign to the banks not mean re-imposing it on citizens in another form?The European Stability Mechanism, the fund that is supposed to bail out the European banks, has a capacity of only €500 million and it is estimated that the hole in the Italian and Spanish banks alone is €2 trillion.  Does this not guarantee that Ireland will have to fork out the entire €11 billion called on this country under the ESM to bail out these banks?  We do not know the size of the hole in the rest of the banks.  One of the major problems in Europe and Ireland at present is the failure of the banks to lend and to put credit into the system.  Is it not the case that shifting this burden from one place on the accountancy balance sheet to another will simply mean those banks we have recapitalised will be even less likely to invest and lend into the economy-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----after all the money that has been poured into them?  Therefore, this will do next to nothing to stimulate economic growth or the job creation that would be something one could really celebrate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what I asked about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked about the €11 billion.
