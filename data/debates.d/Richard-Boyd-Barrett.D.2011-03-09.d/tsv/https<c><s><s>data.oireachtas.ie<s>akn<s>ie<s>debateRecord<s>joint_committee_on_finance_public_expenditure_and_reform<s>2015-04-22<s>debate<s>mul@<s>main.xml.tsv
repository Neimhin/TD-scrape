RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not in the habit of being nice to banks given the role they played in the pretty awful situation the country has found itself in. However, I acknowledge Mr. Duffy's office and AIB on the issue of cases that I brought to their attention. I wish to give some credit to the comments made by Mr. O'Connor that AIB seems to take a more reasonable approach to people in mortgage arrears which I put down to the fact that it is 100% owned by the State. Mr. Duffy has more or less acknowledged, in his statement, that because the bank's shareholder is the Government it is under more pressure to be a bit reasonable about these things in a way that some of the other banks that have come in here have not been. I am sure they are very nice people too but that is not the point. Certain other banks that have come in here have a very different attitude. They do not give a damn what we or the Government thinks about priorities, dealing with distressed mortgage holders, rates and such like. I welcome that fact.  I am worried about influences on the bank. Mr. Duffy said in his opening statement, in a number of different ways, that the other influences on the bank is "the need to generate sustainable and viable returns for shareholders" and, to use a particular phrase, "to create an investable model so that over time the bank can start to return capital to the State". That is a euphemism for privatisation. Am I correct? We are talking about creating a model where the State disposes of its holdings in AIB which are sold off to private interests. Is that the case? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would prefer if we had a banking system which was under more public pressure, in the way that I think AIB has been, to be a bit more reasonable with people in mortgage distress. I want a system whose priorities are not solely about the bottom line and that its mandate is a bit more focused on the wider economy, keeping a roof over people's heads and all those kinds of things. Is it the inevitable direction that the bank seems to be taking and which Mr. Duffy's speech indicated one where we will move away from that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not really accept that. There is a marked difference between the demeanour of AIB and that of some of the other banks. I attribute that to the fact that AIB is publicly owned. If it is not the case-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have only just started. I am not asking Mr. Duffy about his personal relationship with the Minister but about his working relationship in terms of what directions the Minister gives him. The Government says it wants relief for variable interest rate mortgage holders and fairness for people in mortgage arrears but when we complain about the banks not offering such support, the Minister says there is nothing he can do about it because the banks are independent entities. I want to try to square the circle. What is the actual relationship? How often do the Minister and bank representatives meet? To what extent does the Minister ask the bank to do something about variable rate mortgages? Could Mr. Duffy explain the nature of the relationship to us?
