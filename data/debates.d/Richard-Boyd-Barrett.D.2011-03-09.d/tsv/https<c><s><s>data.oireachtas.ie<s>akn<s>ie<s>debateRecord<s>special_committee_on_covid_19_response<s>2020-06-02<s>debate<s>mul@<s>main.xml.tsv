RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government announced that it would make changes to the public-private contract on Friday.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I immediately contacted the secretariat in writing and stated that in my opinion it would be crazy for us to have a session today with the HSE and the Department of Health without having the Minister, Deputy Harris, here as well because Mr. Breslin has already made clear that he cannot answer certain questions to do with policy because they are not in his remit. It renders redundant our sessions today if the Government has already made a decision. I believe the Minister should come in here today and explain what he is doing. Otherwise, what is the point of the afternoon session? I wrote on Friday and I phoned the secretariat but I do not know if the request has been processed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not labour the point as we need to get on with business but this is closing the door after the horse has bolted. The Government has made a major announcement that it is going to change the deal and hand back much of the private capacity without us discussing the extent to which we need that private capacity, whether it is the best way, if we should be going back to the two-tier system or if, as some of us believe, we should be going forward to a national public health system. This is pre-empting all of that and our oversight becomes meaningless.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would Mr. Breslin accept that we are caught on the horns of a major dilemma here, where one is damned if one does and damned if one does not, arising from the fact that on entering into this crisis we had woefully inadequate levels of capacity in intensive care units, ICU, beds, staff and consultants? That is the fundamental problem. It was unacceptable, on entering into the crisis, that we were already operating at near to 100% capacity, and were sometimes overwhelmed during flu season. On top of this, for the foreseeable future, there is an additional care need around a pandemic that could surge at any point in time. Unless we dramatically ramp up capacity we could be in deep trouble in the near future.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not dispute that. We accept there is an unacceptably low level of capacity given the pre-existing challenges pre-Covid-19, and now with Covid-19. As a sidebar, I will turn to the heroic work of our health workers.Are the high infection rates in any way linked to the low staffing and capacity levels, which meant staff were overworked, working excessive hours and therefore exposed more to the virus? It seems to me that there is a connection. Some in this House have made it clear that they want to return essentially to the two-tier system and give the capacity back to the private health system. Is that not reckless in the extreme given that we could face surges in the near future? With the limited capacity we have, do we not at least require a totally integrated system rather than a fragmented one? That means keeping the private capacity under public control. I think that is what we must have. Has Mr. Breslin considered the outright nationalisation of the private hospitals rather than paying them rent of €110 million a month, which is clearly not very good value?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough. Given that we have to increase capacity, would it not be helpful if, for example, the Department did not have to negotiate with private hospitals but just had the capacity? Would that not be better? It would be better if we knew what was on their books, which we do not really know, in terms of the cost of beds. Would that not be better notwithstanding the need to ramp up capacity? One of our earlier witnesses, Professor Alan Irvine, suggested that we should be looking at local solutions to quickly ramp up capacity. Are we doing that? For example, there are two buildings of 17,000 sq. m near Merrion Gates called the Seamark buildings. They are sitting empty for the last five years, right beside St. Vincent's Hospital. When there is talk of setting up modular hospital beds, would we not be better going in and purchasing those blocks for increasing capacity on an emergency basis? That is just by way of example.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are many issues impacted by Covid-19 in terms of transport. I do not have time to address all of them but as a general remark, while social distancing and Covid-19 is around, if we are going to maintain our public transport system it has to be on a not-for-profit basis. It will not be commercially viable, but we cannot do without it. We have to move to a not-for-profit approach. On aviation, we need to reconsider renationalising what used to be the national airline in order to maintain air infrastructure. The main questions I wish to ask are about the taxi industry, which was briefly referred to by Ms Graham, but really it has been addressed in a cursory way. In response to a request sent through me from the four taxi representative groups, the Taoiseach said he would ask the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to meet these groups. I have still had no reply from the Minister. That is not Ms Graham's issue, I want to state that for the record. He should answer and agree to meet the four taxi representative groups because they are facing absolute devastation. I would urge that it is the case and I hope our committee would support that call. They are in serious trouble for all the obvious reasons. The crucial thing that has to be discussed is a roadmap and financial package of supports in order to keep the livelihood of taxi drivers sustainable.  I have some questions for Ms Graham. All licences that expired before 12 June for taxi drivers have an extension of three months. What happens to licences that expire after 12 June? Taxi drivers need certainty, they should have the extension and be given that commitment and certainty. The NCT and suitability tests need to be done in order to get a licence.Given the financial hit that taxi drivers have taken would Ms Graham consider not charging for those? Could she tell us whether NCT and suitability tests could be done together rather than separately, which used to be the case? Can taxi drivers who choose to try to get back to work be prioritised for those tests? Regarding the state of the taxi industry, has Ms Graham information on how many taxi drivers are on the Covid-19 payment? Can she tell us how many are old-age pensioners over 66 who may be working but are not entitled to the payment? A driver can suspend a licence for a year, but after that they have to pay a €500 reinstatement charge. While the public health situation remains uncertain, drivers may wish to suspend their licence for a longer period. Could that charge be waived, to give them some support? Also, could the ten-year rule for the age limit of cars be changed to a 15-year rule? Again, this is because of the financial cost that will be incurred by taxi drivers in replacing their cars after ten years, given that they are going to be in deep trouble. Finally, there are no clear guidelines or support for taxi drivers in terms of health, or for standardised screens. There are also insurance issues. Could Ms Graham comment on that because it is a serious concern for many taxi drivers?
