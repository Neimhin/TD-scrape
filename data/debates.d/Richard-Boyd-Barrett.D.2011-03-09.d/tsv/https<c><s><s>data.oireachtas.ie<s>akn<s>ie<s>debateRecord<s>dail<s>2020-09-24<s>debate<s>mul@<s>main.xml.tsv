RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I have repeatedly stated to the Minister and his predecessor in recent months, the clock is ticking on the dire situation faced by taxi drivers. They believe they have no choice but to organise another demonstration, to be held on 9 October, because of the failure of the Government to give commitments and assurances about supporting them through income subsidies, extending the ten-year replacement rule to 12 years, a moratorium on the issuing of licences, grants to cover ongoing costs, a buy-back scheme for those who wish to exit the industry and disbanding the taxi advisory committee. Will the Minister give those supports and commitments as requested?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In all that chatter, there was no clear commitment. The Government cut the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, of many taxi drivers who now have even less work available to them because of the new restrictions and there is no income subsidy for those who are able to return to work. They are caught between a rock and a hard place. They are in a dire situation but there has been no commitment by the Government. Will it commit to not cutting their PUP if they must stay off work and that the payment will give them the income subsidy? Incredibly, licences continue to be issued while the industry is on its knees and there is 70% less work available for the fleet. Taxi drivers have, on average, â‚¬11,000 of costs, which are clocking up all the time while there is no work available to them. They are not getting grant support in that regard. They have asked for the implementation of a buy-back scheme for drivers who wish to exit the industry but that has not been done. The last two actual taxi driver representatives on the taxi advisory committee left it because it is completely unfit for purpose, does not represent the interests of taxi drivers and does not put forward demands that would protect their livelihoods and industry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was not a good start for the Government to cut taxi drivers' PUP payments at the same time as it imposed restrictions that would even further reduce the amount of work available to the drivers. The Minister really needs to get a move on and give those assurances. The taxi drivers do not wish to hold another protest, but they believe they have no other choice because they are in desperate straits. On the ten-year replacement rule, that could be changed now. The drivers do not have the money to replace their vehicles. It is not true to state that this issue will not arise until the end of the year because the drivers need to know 90 days in advance whether they are going to renew their licence for their existing car, buy a new car or leave the industry. They need to know these things now. It is clear they have no faith in the taxi advisory committee. They were part of it but their last two representatives left it because it simply was not representing their interests. I appeal to the Minister to get a move on because taxi drivers are in a dire situation. Words, tea and sympathy are not enough. They need concrete assurances and real supports to get them through this period.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I cannot see into the mind of Boris Johnson, MP, and I am not sure I would want to, because I would say it is a pretty scary place but what we can say about him is that one of his biggest international backers is President Donald Trump, another man whose mind I would not like to see into, as it would be even scarier. As we speak, Donald Trump is willing to incite civil war in the United States if he does not win a general election. If Trump is the more extreme version of a certain type of political madness that is unfortunately taking off around the world at the moment, Boris Johnson is his Mini-Me. I would, therefore, not be so complacent as to suggest that reason will prevail. Rationality is not a characteristic of extreme right-wing, imperially minded, hard nationalist politics. It is not reasonable. If one looked at this reasonably, one would conclude that the British Government wants to do a deal and these are just negotiating tactics. However, looking at the records of Donald Trump and Boris Johnson and where the sort of politics they are propounding have historically led, one sees that acting reasonably is not a feature. These people are quite capable of going on wrecking missions. Trump has done that in the United States. Boris Johnson has treated his own people with utter recklessness during the Covid-19. He is threatening the health and welfare of ordinary working-class British people. That is the record of the Tory party, particularly the rotten wing that Johnson represents, which is given to nostalgia for the glory days of empire. We have to understand that we are in a serious and dangerous situation. Being complacent and hoping that reason will prevail is not a strategy. That means we have to defeat what Boris Johnson represents. We have to be very tough and say that peace and security on this island will not be a pawn in the dangerous game he is playing. Under no circumstances can we allow his wrecking agenda to lead to the erection of a border on this island, which would threaten the peace and stability we have achieved. We also need to say to the EU that we will not be a pawn in any game it is playing with Boris Johnson. We must be clear that we will not be anybody's pawn and that we will not accept a hard border in any circumstances or for any reason, or the question of the re-establishment of a board being a bargaining chip in the game and the negotiations. We cannot allow that to happen. In that context, it is not dangerous or a mistake to put forward the argument for ending partition and bringing about the unification of this country. The people of Britain, the North and Scotland are not stupid. They understand how dangerous Boris Johnson is. His agenda is revealing itself to huge numbers of people, who perhaps would not have questioned certain allegiances previously but who can see the irrationality, recklessness and danger of what he is pursuing. The Government appears to think this is a no-go area and that it is somehow threatening to talk about ending partition and uniting this island. Now is the time that putting that argument forward makes sense.  In doing so, we have to make it clear that uniting this island is about making a better country than either of the ones that exist at the moment, North or South. Unionism maintaining its grip in the North has a lot to do with pointing at deficiencies in the South such as the control of the Catholic Church, the conservative nature of the State and, once upon a time, economic backwardness. Even now the lack of a national health service is an issue. There is a strong argument for taking an all-Ireland approach to dealing with the mortal threat of Covid-19. We need an integrated national health service across the island. If we champion issues such as the separation of church and State, a national health service and a sane, all-Ireland approach to tackling Covid-19, we can open the door to challenging the rotten nationalism of Boris Johnson and the rotten politics of the DUP and Orangeism. That is the approach we have to take. It is not about saying how superior we are to Boris Johnson; it is about showing in practice that we have an agenda for a changed Ireland. Historically, big shifts in allegiances have taken place at critical moments. Under particular circumstances of economic or political crisis, people who thought they had certain religious or cultural allegiances have begun to question them. That is a time when that is happening.  It is time to start talking about ending partition on the basis of uniting Catholic and Protestant working people in the fight for a different republic, the sort of republic James Connolly fought for. That is not just idle rhetoric. This is a truly opportune moment. We are at an historic crossroads for all sorts of reasons. We have to radically change the sort of republic we are fighting for down here to make unification a seriously attractive option for people from all backgrounds, North and South.
