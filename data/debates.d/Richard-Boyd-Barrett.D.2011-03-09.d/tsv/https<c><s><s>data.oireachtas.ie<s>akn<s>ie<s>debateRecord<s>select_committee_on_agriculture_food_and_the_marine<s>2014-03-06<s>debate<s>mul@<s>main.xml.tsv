RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will we get a chance to speak on the section as well?  I missed my first amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can raise the issues at the end of the section.  Is that not so?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can raise the issues at the end of the section.  Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can speak at the end of the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some of the amendments are mine and some are those of Deputy Pringle.  Amendment No. 59 is Deputy Pringle's amendment.  Should I move it now?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 60:
In page 13, line 33, after “days” to insert “, if investigating alleged offences,”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This section needs some additional elements because it deals with protection of the forests.  The Minister should have the authority to carry out ecological surveys of forests to ensure the ecological integrity of forests with a particular focus on ancient woodlands and native species.  There should be a provision to allow citizens who are concerned about the ecological integrity of forests to petition the Minister for such surveys to be carried out if they are concerned that ancient woodlands, native species or biodiversity are being adversely impacted upon in any way.  I am proposing an environmental protection measure and a public consultation measure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are we allowed to respond?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This matter does not involve people, in a rather whimsical manner, seeking surveys.  What we are seeking is that people should be allowed to petition for such surveys if they have concerns.  Ultimately, the decision on whether a survey would be carried out would lie with the Minister.  There should a procedure whereby people with concerns would have the opportunity to indicate that they want action to be taken.  The details of what would be involved in the context of the criteria relating to petitions, etc., could be discussed but provision should be made to allow people to seek surveys.  There are many individuals who have concerns about the environment in general and, in the context of this matter, adverse impacts on ancient woodlands and problems relating to biodiversity.  These people should have an avenue whereby they could petition the Minister to have surveys carried out in circumstances where they raise legitimate concerns.  I am of the view that the amendment is very reasonable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These are Deputy Pringle's amendments.  It is about having a speedy timeline for getting the licence, and Deputy Pringle believes there are too many get-out clauses in the Minister's amendment.  There are qualifications on his requirement to grant or refuse the licence within a particular timeline.  His amendment is straightforward in that it states the timeline and that the licence will either be granted or refused within that period.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 71:In page 16, line 8, to delete "replanting" and substitute “reforestation".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 72:In page 16, line 10, after "species" to insert "and provenance".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 74:In page 16, line 30, to delete ", and" and substitute "within 28 days of receipt of licence application,".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 75:In page 16, line 33, after "require" to insert "within 28 days of receipt of licence application".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 76:In page 16, between lines 33 and 34, to insert the following:"(6) The Minister shall make a decision on a licence application, with or without conditions, within a period not exceeding 90 days.".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He could discuss it in the discussion on the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The amendment is to insert the new section; that is the problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 81:In page 18, line 25, to delete "10 metres" and substitute "5 metres".This amendment is intended to change the distance in respect of the protections which apply where it is intended to cut down a tree.  There are safety issues where trees are close to roads.  One cannot have an extensive bureaucratic obstacle where a tree near a road raises health and safety issues.  It is a practical consideration but it need not be 10 m.  When one goes that far in from the road, one is talking about giving a free hand to cut down trees which should not be cut down and where protections should apply.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a balance to be struck.  The point has been made.  However, what we have here does not capture the balance.  Deputy McNamara made the point well.  It is not simply an issue of distance.  I might raise something that was mentioned to me by someone from a different constituency who happened to be passing through Dún Laoghaire.  Where trees are overhanging a road and there is a requirement on the property owner to cut them down on foot of a health and safety risk, it is virtually impossible for that property owner to act.  He or she would have to stop the whole road.  It should really be the local authority which has the responsibility for doing it.  A complicated balance is involved.  Certainly, the idea that one could have free rein to cut down any tree within 10 m of a public road means trees that should not be cut down will be.  They will not be cut down just for legitimate health and safety reasons but potentially for other reasons.  I have further amendments in the same vein with respect to hedgerows.  We must reconsider the provision.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am pressing it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 84:In page 18, line 33, after “species,” to insert “below a certain size,”.I will await the Minister of State's response.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not entirely.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a question of striking a balance.  We have to be practical, and farmers have to be able to maintain-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is accepted but on the other hand hedgerows have important environmental, amenity and biodiversity value.  It is about achieving the right balance and it is felt by some of the environmental groups that this swings the balance a little too far in the direction of giving free latitude to do something that could be potentially damaging to the environment.  That is why there is an attempt to put qualifications on that freedom.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Also, the balance is problematic.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 85:In page 18, line 35 and 36, to delete "20 centimetres" and substitute "10 centimetres".All of these amendments have the same theme.  What has emerged from this discussion is that size might not be the right criterion.  It is a question of practicality.  If something is a danger, blocks school buses or damages the road or if it has the potential to pose such dangers, cutting it down should be possible.  Proximity to the road or size is not a good criterion, as it would allow hedges or something that is environmentally important or sensitive to be cut down unnecessarily.  There is a problem with the criteria for making decisions on what can be cut down and it needs to be examined.  Perhaps there is no perfect solution.  The person in question is from Mullingar and the issue never even occurred to me beforehand.  That said, some roads near the edge of my constituency towards the mountains experience these problems.  Clearly the local authority must have a role in assessing what is dangerous and a responsibility to assist property owners on the basis of the common good.  The Minister of State should take all of these points on board.  I certainly must consider some of them.  I will revert to the people I have spoken to and consider which amendments can be tabled on Report Stage to try to get the balance right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have raised the issue, so I can raise it again.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not like the idea of withdrawing it either.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not the way I do things.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I must press or withdraw.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 87:In page 18, line 37, after "ground" to insert "or is not in a hedgerow of historical, ecological and/or landscape significance".We have more or less discussed this matter and are going over the same ground.  It must be taken into account and balanced against other practical concerns if something is of historical, ecological or landscape significance.  This is the common theme of these amendments and I will not elaborate further.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister of State moving another amendment on the matter on Report Stage?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not think that is sufficient.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I shall press the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Obviously the conditions being imposed are positive, but the point of the amendment is that there are trees that could be felled but should not be, which fall outside these conditions.  I take the Minister of State's point that the matter can be a bit subjective, although not on the ecological front.  Areas such as historical and landscape significance can have a subjective element.  I feel - and I suspect that the Environmental Pillar people will feel the same - that there needs to be a little bit more than the criteria proposed in the amendment, which refers to the curtilage of a protected structure, a special amenity area or a conservation area.  I support the amendment but suggest that additional criteria should be included to provide protections against trees being cut down that should not be cut down.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 89:In page 18, between lines 43 and 44, to insert the following:“(2) Provision should be given to encourage natural regeneration of scrub back to high natural forest as scrub is a valuable habitat.  Scrub should be designated as agroforestry.”.The amendment is pretty self-evident and I look forward to hearing from the Minister of State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Again, this is a question of balance.  The spirit of the amendment and the theme of my amendments is Ireland's underperformance in developing its natural potential for forestry in general, afforestation using native species and the creation of biodiversity.  It is a tragedy that we have performed so badly when our conditions are so well suited to forestry.  Our forests are a significant attraction and one of the reasons people love our landscape and countryside.  We are failing absolutely to utilise our potential in this area.  This amendment proposes that we encourage the natural development of native forests from scrub and seek out the means to do that.  It is not about targeting farmers negatively but alerting them to a major untapped potential that has not been recognised.  This could be good for the farmers, for the country and for the environment.  I do not understand the reason the Minister of State has a problem with this amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think it should be encouraged.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Section 25(9) reads "The Minister, may, with the consent of the owner, issue a replanting order in respect of other land owned by the owner instead of the land concerned".  That is problematic because it is potentially open to abuse.  Something is cut down that should not be cut down, but then the offender can replant somewhere else.  There may be times when that is right and appropriate, but it should be as a last resort and only when it is line with the principles of sustainable forest management and is shown to be the best option from that point of view.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not catch all of that.  If someone cuts down trees-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 93:In page 28, between lines 31 and 32, to insert the following:“(w) importation of forestry products or materials;”.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not see why the Minister of State has a problem with it.  It is simply including another measure.  Imported forestry materials should be regulated positively.  Why does the Minister of State not include it as part of the extensive list?  Arguably, all the items on the list are dealt with elsewhere by other things so why bother listing them at all?  If the Minister of State has a list, why does he not include this measure on it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 97:In page 31, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:“30. Provision shall be made for a review of the Forestry Act 1988 for the purpose of improving the consistency of Coillte objectives and operations in line with the Rio Forest Principles.”.This is an important amendment.  The question of Coillte and its centrality to Irish forestry has been discussed at the committee before as well as in the Dáil in the context of the discussions that took place there recently.  It is the elephant in the room because Coillte is the biggest owner of forestry in the country.  While we were all pleased to see Coillte stay in public ownership-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have praise for everyone who fought to keep our forests public.  This does not mean that all is rosy in the Coillte garden.  There are concerns about Coillte, its objectives and the fact that it has failed in the area of afforestation.  I imagine the company will give reasons and justifications for that but when the largest owner and the public owner of our forests has not assisted in our reaching our targets and, consequently, we have fallen far short of them, then the matter must be addressed.  There are many other questions relating to objectives, priorities, governance, conflicts of interest and the sale of some public forests, all of which need to be examined.  We cannot properly address the question of Irish forestry without bringing Coillte into the frame.  The Act that established Coillte predated the Rio declaration and the principles of sustainable forest management that are supposed to inform this Bill as well as our approach to forestry generally and that is a problem.  It is problematic that we are dealing with this Bill at a time when the long-promised review of Coillte has never materialised.  It was never published, it was started and abandoned somewhere along the line.  There is something of a veil of secrecy around Coillte.  It is insulated from proper scrutiny and accountability.  For all these reasons we believe it is imperative to have a review of the Forestry Act 1988, which is out of date in so far as it informs the position of Coillte.  We have moved on to Rio and all of the things that flow out of the declaration.  Therefore, Coillte must be brought into that frame.  We need a review of Coillte to inform proper forest policy in the country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I believe that is getting things the wrong way around.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a big one and it is not possible to separate the matters by saying there is forestry, which we are addressing in this Bill, and then there is Coillte, which is totally separate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can see that is what the Minister of State is doing but I do not believe it is sustainable - to use that term - because Coillte is so dominant in this area.  It is not possible to talk about having sustainable forest practice if Coillte is not in the frame and we do not really know what it is doing.  I believe the Minister of State has got it the wrong way around.  The rumour now is that the Bord na Móna merger will not proceed, which would be a positive thing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would be heartened by the rumours.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I believe that would be moving it in the wrong direction.  However, I still believe we should have the review.  The legislation that underpins Coillte dates from 1988.  If Coillte is not reviewed in the light of the concepts of sustainable forest management and good forest practice that are supposed to inform how forestry is done all over the world now and that we have signed up to, then we are doing something dreadfully wrong.  Half of forestry would be left out of the frame which is just not right or sustainable.  I will certainly be pressing the amendment and raising it again on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is undoubtedly correct.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Forestry was a big passion of the revolutionaries.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is good that there will be a forestry appeals committee.  However, independence and composition are two important considerations in that regard.  In light of what the Minister of State just said and in view of what is concerned in the amendment, I am of the view that it should be stipulated that stakeholders should be involved.  Given that we are dealing with issues which affect farmers, they should be represented.  In addition and given that there are also issues relating to the environment involved here, why is it not stipulated that environmental experts should serve on the appeals committee?  There are probably other stakeholders who should also be involved.  The Minister should not have a free hand.  What is proposed somewhat resembles an insider appeals mechanism.  In other words, the appeals committee will comprise individuals similar to those who will make the decisions in the first instance.  That would not be great.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not stipulated, however.  The matter will pretty much be dealt with on the basis of whatever the Minister decides.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not everyone is as open as is the Minister of State.  That is the problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have done what I can to flag the issues involved.
