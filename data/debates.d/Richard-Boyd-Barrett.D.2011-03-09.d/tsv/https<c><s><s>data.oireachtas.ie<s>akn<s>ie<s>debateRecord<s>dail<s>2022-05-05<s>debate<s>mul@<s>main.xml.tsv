RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Obviously, the Minister is aware of the issue. I say, "Well done", to the Music and Entertainment Association of Ireland, MEAI, among others, for campaigning on this. However, it is worth saying, on the task force that was looking into the basic income project, there was no representative of people with disabilities and we need to be absolutely certain that there is not a disincentive for people with disabilities to sign up for the basic income pilot. Certainly, on the calculations the MEAI has done, there is potential for them to lose in some cases the medical card and for a failure to take into account that people with disability carry additional costs to those who do not have disabilities. An Indecon report recently estimated there is €10,000 a year additional costs if one has a disability. Whereas somebody who does not have a disability will get 100% of the benefit of everything over previous social welfare basic payments, the people with disability could see much of that additional money eaten up by what they lose when they take up the payment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Unless it is addressed, people on disability payments or blind payments could potentially lose up to €90 of their payments. Inevitably when one is getting a higher payment as one would on the basic income, it is going to impact on other payments. However, the critical point here, as has been pointed out by the MEAI and others, including Disabled Artists and Disabled Academics, DADA, is that people with disabilities carry additional costs variously estimated, depending on levels of disability, at between €7,000 and €12,000, or an average of approximately €10,000, and there is the potential to lose their medical card. What they want is certainty that this will not be the case and that the additional money over basic social welfare payments in the new €325 payment will be available to artists with disability to channel into their art, which is the purpose of the basic income pilot, and is not gobbled up by them compensating for losses in their disability payments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Across all the area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown and in much of Dublin, the HAP limits that people have available to them if they are looking for rental property are not even at the races in terms of the levels of rent. One will not find a two-bedroom apartment for less than €2,000 per month and more often it is €2,200 per month. Something has to be done. Otherwise people looking for rental property or facing homelessness are absolutely banjaxed. What will the Minister do?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the long run or even in the medium term, I am not in favour of pouring huge amounts of money into rent support, but I accept that for now, until we address the social housing deficit, we must do it. We have to give people options. However, this is a matter of urgency. I am not exaggerating. Everybody who is approaching me, and the number has been increasing over the last few months, are doing so often because they are being evicted from HAP tenancies. By the way, I appeal to the Minister on that ground. If people are being evicted from HAP tenancies on grounds of sale, the local authorities should just buy those properties straight away. Why would they not? If they are for sale and one can prevent people being made homeless, just buy them so we do not have the same people knocking on the council's door and saying they are homeless. In the meantime, there is a massive gap between the HAP limits and the actual rents. The HAP increases must be introduced as a matter of urgency. Otherwise the numbers going into homeless accommodation are going to increase. Even the place finder service is sending people out to look at places which the HAP limits would not allow them to view. It is ridiculous at this point. They have to be increased as a matter of urgency. Otherwise people who are looking for a rental property and do not have a roof over their heads or are facing eviction are in really deep trouble.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The substantial issue, of course, is that we need more social housing stock. By the way, and we will discuss this later, we should be looking for purchases in excess of 10% in private developments as well, given the situation we are now facing and to increase the options for people. Apart from that, I should also mention the income thresholds, because I probably will not get a chance to mention this anywhere else. The Minister could respond on that. Seriously, there are many people who are caught in limbo. They are just over the threshold and as a result cannot even get HAP support, never mind get a council house. Something has to be done about that as a matter of urgency. These people are caught. I am aware of one woman who has been in emergency accommodation for three and a half years. She is working in a State agency and now she is not entitled to housing support, but her income would not get anywhere near the local rents. We need to look at the things that are happening to people and tailor the policy to that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Government for agreeing to the debate I asked for on this. I did so in response to the Minister's letter, which I responded to a number of weeks ago. I will not get into the politics or the foreign policy because I do not have time and we will debate that on another day. I want to discuss the practical issue of how we do what we have to do, namely, both accommodate Ukrainian refugees and address the housing crisis, which is very severe at present. I want to argue with the Minister that we have to make this a win-win. Notwithstanding all our debates on previous policies and so on, if the current situation has prompted the Government into doing extraordinary and unprecedented things and if it is willing to consider extraordinary and unprecedented things, then I suggest we do that to get that win-win. We have the opportunity to do it because Putin's bloody invasion and the fact there is a war gives the Minister extra powers and I specifically refer to the Emergency Powers Act 1939, which gives him the power to do extraordinary and unprecedented things. Critically, this includes the power in section 2(2)(g) to "authorise and provide for the acquisition, taking possession, control or user (either by agreement or compulsorily) by... the State of any land or other property whatsoever" in the context of war. We should have used those powers before to get hold of vacant and empty buildings but whatever about that debate, I am appealing to the Minister to now use that power because he is justified in doing so. I want to cite the following examples from my area. I invite the Minister to look at the Seamark Building on Google. It is 10,000 sq. m large with about six storeys and has been empty for a decade at Merrion Gates. It is a scandal and we could use it for accommodation. We could reconfigure it very quickly; it is a modern building and a lot of people could be put in there. Right beside it, in the hands of the Religious Sisters of Charity, are the St. Mary's Centre Telford complex and the Caritas nursing home, which are virtually empty and have been for a few years. Whatever about the previous history of that it is available and there are other public and private buildings available. I am saying we need to do this unprecedented thing. Simultaneously, we should use the same powers to get a higher proportion of social and affordable housing from new developments. Legislatively the Minister can get 10% social and affordable housing in new developments and I know the Minister has upped it to 20%. I am asking the Minister to seriously consider getting a higher proportion. In my area one could drive along the N11 and see multiple apartment complexes near completion. In Cherrywood, there are huge amounts of properties near completion, for example. In the current situation we are justified in doing this and the Minister has the power to purchase more of those apartments, both for people on the housing lists and for the extra housing needs we have. We have to do that now.Otherwise, we will not be able to deal with the housing crisis, which is at a very acute level. The Minister was saying I was a bit late. I know he has to run off. I have just come from Dún Laoghaire courthouse where a young working man and his family are about to be evicted by the council over a dispute about family succession. I will not get into the rights and wrongs of the issue, although I think it is wrong, but it makes no sense. Why would we allow no-fault evictions in the current climate? Why would the Minister allow it? It will put extra burden on the emergency accommodation which we need for all the refugees. There is a win-win here. Stop the no-fault evictions on an emergency basis. I would like to see it go further but surely this is the emergency that would require that to happen. I ask the Minister to stop them even if it is on a temporary basis for a year or two. Given the current climate, why would we put extra burdens on emergency housing services by allowing no-fault evictions from public or private housing? I ask the Minister to get a higher proportion of the buildings that are near completion or completed and to use the emergency acquisition powers that are available to him to get public and private buildings. We should go on an aggressive campaign to recruit people directly to local authorities or to some sort of State construction core in order to reconfigure and refurbish buildings. I know the Minister has made efforts to move in this direction, but in my area there are more council voids than there have been for quite some time. It is clear that we have not got enough staff. There should be an aggressive campaign to recruit people directly in order that the State will have the capacity to move in and refurbish both council and private properties that could be reconfigured to provide temporary, emergency or medium- and longer-term accommodation. I appeal to the Minister to take those suggestions seriously and to look at some of the proposals in my area.
