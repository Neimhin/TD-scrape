RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Go away out of that. The Minister of State is a spoofer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will continue on the same theme. There were many retrograde aspects to the austerity cuts that began in 2008. They were begun by Fianna Fáil when it started to cut the arts budget. It was cut by €30 million. If ever there was a misguided set of cuts it was in this area. The point of our questions and the disappointment expressed by the arts community about this budget is that there is no recognition that we need, at the very minimum, the full restoration of the cuts that were imposed and to move towards a reasonable level of overall arts expenditure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Poverty of vision was a fairly apt description of the budget as a whole. It was just scraps here and there. Nowhere is that phrase more apt than in the area of arts, which is about vision. It is true there was a small increase in the allocations for certain agencies and institutions over and above last year. That has been welcomed by those institutions. We had a lengthy debate in here. The Minister knows that the National Campaign for the Arts has asked for much more than that. It asked specifically that the €50 million - not €18 million - that was provided on a once-off basis be retained in full to begin to move us even in a small way in the direction of European average levels of spending in the area of arts. We have a pitifully low level in a country whose revolutionary tradition was infused with the vision of artists who would turn in their graves if they thought the celebration of that cultural tradition was a once-off event. It should be about seriously ramping up the investment in our artists, not just in some institutions but in the artists and the arts generally.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The vast majority of artists in this country live in absolute poverty. Let us start with that reality. Garry Hynes put it well when she said:I hate that the arts are so underfunded ... How proud we are of our artists but we're not proud enough to make the lives of the people who work in the industry better.That is the reality. This level of funding simply will not impact on that in any significant way. To fail to acknowledge that the overall level of funding is still well short of what it was in 2008, when the arts were wrongly assaulted for an economic crisis they did not cause, shows a complete poverty of vision. That is my point. The minimum ask is that the entire €50 million, not a portion of it, should be retained. That would not even bring us to 0.6% from the abysmal 0.1%. It is retrograde. I have not even mentioned the 9% cut for the Irish language, which is unbelievably retrograde. It is a philistine failure to recognise the importance of this sector.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister could not keep the €50 million.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can provide the Minister with a few arts capital projects.
