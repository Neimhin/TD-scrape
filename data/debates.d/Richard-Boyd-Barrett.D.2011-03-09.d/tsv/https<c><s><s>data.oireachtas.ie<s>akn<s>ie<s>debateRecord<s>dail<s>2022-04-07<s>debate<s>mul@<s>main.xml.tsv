RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also offer my thanks and best wishes to Teresa Doolan, and my best wishes to Liam and Noel in their new jobs. The Government has committed to supporting artists, in particular after Covid-19. I am glad the Minister for Tourism, Culture, Arts, Gaeltacht, Sport and Media is in the Chamber. I wrote to her on Tuesday about the plight of 20 artists in a studio on Richmond Road near Drumcondra. They have been there for about 20 years and to their shock, on 8 February bailiffs from a receiver came to the studios and told them they had to get out. It would appear that the receivers had no idea that the artists had paid rent, had contracts with a landlord and had been there for 20 years. They and I are asking the Minister for urgent intervention to support them. They will be evicted from their studios and will be homeless unless intervention and support is offered.
