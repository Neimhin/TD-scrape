RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I concur with that point, but I want to raise another issue. The sessions we are having this week, and indeed every week, were established on the basis that we could ask questions of Ministers and get accountability during the Covid-19 pandemic. Last week in the Dáil, I was given a commitment by the CMO that they would publish the minutes of the expert advisory group to NPHET.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, hold on, a Cheann Comhairle. I am pointing out that the procedures and the mechanisms for accountability set up by the Business Committee, where I first sought the publication of the minutes of the expert advisory group on 16 March-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On 16 March-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There were multiple commitments. Are commitments made-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I am asking whether commitments made in this House and to the Business Committee are respected or are they just meaningless.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I got answers, I have got commitments and promises and they have come to nothing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At this point the Dáil and the Business Committee are being treated with contempt by the refusal to publish the minutes of the expert advisory group; the people who are supposed to be advising NPHET on the public health response.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not just the sub-committee; it is this House and the Business Committee.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach would respond to my inquiry as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He has not done so far. My point concerns the procedures and the schedule for this week. This schedule is a sham. Commitments to transparency relating to issues such as the expert advisory group to NPHET are made in the House and then they are just ignored.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The point of this place is basic transparency and accountability. If I ask for the minutes of the expert advisory group for two months, am promised them time and time again and never get them, something is wrong. I want the Taoiseach to tell the Minister for Health to publish the minutes of the expert advisory group. We need to know what the experts told NPHET.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach did hear it-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I believe this is also relevant to the debate around our ability to have committee hearings. Public health advice about the health implications of proximity is acting as a barrier to having further committees to cover the many different areas in our society where people are in real trouble and need their voices heard. We are told we can only have one committee because of physical constraints relating to public health guidelines. It looks like these are just excuses. I will throw a real spanner into the works now. There is no consistency on the issue of who is considered a close contact of a person who is Covid-positive. I am sure all Members have been reading the RTÉ website since the outbreak of this crisis. At the end of every single article, it says that a person who has been in close contact in the same room as somebody else for more than 15 minutes - not two hours - is a close contact. It says that this is the public health advice. On that basis, nothing in this country would be operating at all. It is nonsense. We need consistency on this. The difference is that essential workers have been working all the time under very different conditions of close contact - according to these definitions, for two hours or 15 minutes - to keep our society functioning-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This House is doing essential work to represent the people of this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Spokespeople for Fianna Fáil and Ministers from Fine Gael have been expressing horror at the idea that people who may have earned less when working before Covid-19 are now getting €350 a week. They are trying to justify suggestions that the €350 payment should be cut for those people and many others who have already seen a reduction in income. Does the Taoiseach think that is fair? Does it chime with the motto "we are all in this together" for Ministers and Deputies who earn multiples of €350 a week to tell people who were essentially earning poverty wages that €350 a week is too much for them? For example, I met a woman named Lisa, who has given me permission to mention her name, on the Debenhams picket. She has worked for Debenhams for 20 years, since she was 16. She earned just under €350 a week but with overtime she sometimes earned more. She was unceremoniously sacked by Debenhams and thrown on the scrap heap. She says she does not want to be getting the €350 payment. She is applying for jobs but she cannot get one at the moment. Does the Taoiseach honestly think it is fair to Lisa and people like her, who have worked all their lives and never claimed social welfare, to even consider cutting their €350 payment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach went way over time.The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Regina Doherty, has talked about cutting and tapering the Covid payment, saying it is unsustainable. Deputy Rabbitte of Fianna Fáil has said that the payment is unfair and unsustainable. It is not. People who are earning multiples of the amount of the payment are suggesting it is unfair, unsustainable and needs to be cut. It is good if the Taoiseach is backtracking on that position but he should give a clear commitment to people such as Lisa, workers in the arts and retail sectors, taxi drivers and others who may face protracted periods where, through no fault of their own, they will not be able to get back to the amounts they were previously earning, or employment at all, that the Covid payment will not be cut for them. That is the commitment we need.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Barry. I should probably be directing this question to the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, but I will ask it anyway. I have made fairly well known my views that the box-room, rabbit-hutch accommodation known as co-living is not something that should be allowed in this country. It is just a way to make money for developers and to maximise the value of a site, rather than providing decent quality accommodation for people. If that was true prior to the outbreak of Covid-19, and I believe it was, is there any recognition from the Government now that we must immediately shelve and prohibit these co-living developments from a public health point of view? There is one planned in our area for 200 box apartments with shared kitchens. I believe that 40 or 45 people are to share a kitchen. This absolutely cannot happen in the era of Covid-19. The council in Croydon, for example, recently approved planning for a co-living development of more than 200 units but it is now saying it cannot go through with it anymore. Is the Government considering prohibiting these co-living developments on public health grounds? If not, why not? I put it to the Minister of State that all that is required is for the statutory ministerial guidelines of 2018 to be amended to prohibit these box co-living apartments. Will the Government do this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is back and forth. I will come back.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There should be no buck-passing. The guidelines just need to be changed as this is public health we are talking about. These overcrowded conditions were unacceptable from the get-go but now they just simply are not compliant with public health guidelines. Accordingly, these guidelines should be changed. One of the rather grim facts of the Covid-19 situation is the pretty awful spike in domestic violence and violence against women which has been reported by Women's Aid, the Rape Crisis Centre and other bodies that deal with this. That is an awful vista. In my area, it particularly highlights something that is just unacceptable, namely that we are one of the only counties, if not the only county, that does not have a women's refuge. For those counties which do have refuges, the capacity is not sufficient for the number of people seeking refuge when faced with domestic violence and abuse. Is the Government doing anything about increasing the capacity for women's refuges? At a minimum, should it not be the case that every single local authority area should have at least one women's refuge? We have none in our area and it is a real problem that has now grown worse as a result of Covid-19.
