RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are amendments Nos. 1 and 19 grouped?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The purpose of these amendments is to insert prioritisation of the protection of ancient woodlands into the Bill. Section 2 pertains to definitions, and obviously it is necessary to define "ancient woodlands". Later on, amendment No. 19 relates to a section containing a list of responsibilities for the Minister regarding what he or she should prioritise. It proposes that the issue of prioritising the protection of ancient woodlands must be spelled out specifically because a matter of major concern for quite a number of people has been that the ancient woodlands have not been protected but in fact have been devastated over a long time. The protection of the ancient woodlands is very important from an environmental and a biodiversity perspective. Moreover, from a heritage point of view and in so far as people are attracted to this country for activities such as tourism, it is precisely because of that ancient woodland heritage, much of which has been devastated. As we have failed to protect it, it is important to include such protections in a new forestry Bill and that it be a specific priority for the Minister to protect ancient woodlands. Obviously, one must first know what they are, and consequently they must be defined at the beginning of the Bill. This proposal is fairly self-evident and I hope the Minister of State will support it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State and I must agree to disagree. He may have a point about the date and whether it is a little too prescriptive. I take his point that there are woodlands dating from after the 1650 period that could be included. While I would be open to considering that suggestion, I will return with this amendment on Report Stage. This is a forestry Bill, and the fact that some issues may be under the remit of the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is not a reason for not including them in a Bill that deals specifically with forestry. In the context of a Bill that is meant to be fully comprehensive and achieve the sort of balance to which Deputy McNamara referred earlier - between the need to prioritise the protection of the environment and heritage on one side and the need to develop forestry as an industry on the other - not so doing makes little sense to me. It is of critical importance that we place specific obligations on the Minister to protect ancient woodlands, because they have been devastated. There is no argument about that and the State has failed to protect them for lengthy periods. While I acknowledge that the situation has improved somewhat, the best way to ensure there is a change in that regard and to ensure such protection is to include it in a forestry Bill. Consequently, while I will not call a vote on this amendment now, I will come back to it on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to table it again on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It can be pressed and then withdrawn. Is that the procedure?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will press it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given that reference has been made to the United Nations and the need to be in line with its priorities, I am sure the Minister of State will accept the amendment because that is what we are trying to do. The Rio de Janeiro summit in 1992 was a turning point in environmental politics by asserting the vital importance of the environment in general. The forest principles were the most comprehensive statement on the need to protect and develop a sustainable forestry model for the future of humanity, societies and indigenous cultures all over the world. They spelled out at every level the manifold importance of forestry and forest culture, what was sustainable forest management and what its priorities should be. It is logical that this be set out in the definitions section. If we are committed to sustainable forest management, we should work with the definitions set out at the Rio summit, which are comprehensive. They cover all bases, including economic, social, environmental, cultural, heritage and climate change imperatives, the need to balance them to inform our forestry policy, and forest management. I cannot see an argument against the amendments. The definitions, as drafted, touch on these issues. My amendment lifts the wording from principle 2B of the Rio forest principles and should be included. All of the amendments relate to the issue of sustainable forest management which needs to be provided for in the definitions section. That speaks for itself, although sustainable forest management is not always what we have done. However, I acknowledge we are all committed to it. That needs to be set out and defined.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will agree to disagree with the Minister of State on this matter. The Rio declaration may not be binding legally, but we signed up to it. I see no reason not to commit to its wording in a Bill that is supposedly setting out to develop forestry on a sustainable basis. Nothing the Minister of State has mentioned tells me why the proposed wording, which was taken from the Rio forest principles, is difficult for us to accept. It is vital that the concept of SFM be included in a forestry Bill. Were it not included, I would be concerned. Deputy McNamara rightly pointed out that there was a balance. We all know that. The balance can be skewed in all directions by commercial, environmental, heritage and ecological imperatives. SFM is the concept that attempts to strike that balance. It recognises the economic value, imperative and potential, but states that these can only be developed sustainably if we recognise that it is not just a short-term matter, but is also about links to our heritage, biodiversity, climate change and social and cultural issues. Rio's declaration is the most comprehensive statement in this regard. As such, I do not know why one would second-guess or have a problem with it or why it would be inappropriate for inclusion in this Bill as an informing spine to forest policy. I will press this amendment and table it again on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not prolong this debate unnecessarily, but our national standards are not great and major questions surround them, to put it mildly. People from all perspectives who are observing the forestry sector would agree that this Bill should facilitate an improvement, given that we have not done as well as we should have in many respects. This is not to say that there has not been a significant improvement or good measures have not been taken, but major questions and problems remains and there is a considerable unrealised potential. For this reason, I am pressing the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The provisions of this amendment are fairly self-evident. As with many of my other amendments I do not see any reason the Minister of State would not accept it. It is an obvious, innocent and innocuous yet very important amendment. It would include "the harmful effects of pollution including airborne pollution" in the list of things against which we must protect forests. Airborne pollution is mentioned specifically as it is sometimes forgotten but forests are adversely impacted by all pollution. It should be an imperative of the Bill to protect against it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not accept that explanation. Other bodies may consider environmental pollution, which is fair enough, but this Bill specifically relates to forests and bringing to the fore issues relating to forestry. Perhaps people assessing levels of environmental pollution may consider general problems but they may not be really focused on how to make an impact on forestry. People with more expertise than me have suggested there are quite significant problems that are specifically damaging to forestry that must be examined. It seems logical for the provision to be included, as it does not take away from the roles and responsibilities of anybody else. In putting together the regulatory and legal framework around forestry, this would be an important issue to consider. Paragraph (f) refers to the promotion of education and training in forestry but that is covered by the Department of Education and Skills in geography classes. The same argument could be made that perhaps such a provision should not be in the Bill. If we proceeded on that basis there would be nothing in it because forestry overlaps with many issues. It is not an adequate response.It is blatantly obvious that the section should include a reference to pollution and airborne pollution because it sets out the priorities for forestry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The amendment is in line with many of the other amendments. It follows on the same line of thinking so I do not need to elaborate greatly. I want to deal with the term "multiple value" but first I will spell out one point. We should develop the industry's economic potential, tap into and realise it by encouraging people to go into the industry. Those are all the things the Government has said we should do. It is critical we are not too narrow in our conception of what doing those things to develop the industry means. If our focus is too narrow, too short-term and too concerned with making the next buck around the corner, we may do irreparable damage to the potential of the industry in the medium and long term. That is why the amendment emphasises and includes the words "multiple values" which refer to all the things that forests provide. We do not want the focus to be too narrow and that is the logic behind many of the amendments we have tabled. We think it is right to spell it out. We do not know why one third of the trees at Gougane Barra had to be cut down but we would all agree it is bad it happened. Sometimes we do not know why things happen to forests so it is important we keep an eye on these matters, but I will not elaborate further.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have already asked the Minister of State for assistance and someone in his Department has said they will forward the documents to me for my perusal, so I cannot comment in great detail about the matter. There could be things we have done wrong, like the overuse of imported species, for example, rather than using native species, that may have contributed to the spread of disease. I am not saying that is the case but we must be conscious of what we do. As the Minister of State has said, the industry is a moveable feast. We are learning about forestry and its related matters. However, it is important it is spelled out that we have an eye for these things which is the purpose of our amendments. I do not see why the Minister of State has a problem with them. I have made my point. I can table the amendment on Report Stage so there is no need to press it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Pringle has covered much of it. It is a bit worrying that, in response to all of these points, the Government is playing down the need to spell out these matters. It worries me in respect of the emphasis and priorities of the Government when it is drafting this. It is leaning too much in one direction.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will leave my comment until the end of the section.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a theme that links many of these amendments. We need to develop this area. There is huge employment potential but it is a question of what the model is and what will work in the long term. The word sustainable is used so often that it almost loses its meaning. It means that something will last and will develop.I suppose one contrasts sustainable with short-termism because short-termism has dominated too often in too many things with disastrous consequences. That is why that sort of concept has developed. One of the elements in this area which demonstrates how we have got the balance a bit wrong is that there is an over-reliance on one particular crop. Obviously, there are understandable reasons those involved in producing that crop choose to produce it. It grows quickly and there is a market for it but in terms of the overall picture, this is not sustainable. There has to be diversification, which has been acknowledged. There must be a greater emphasis on native species. We must expand our vision and model of forestry in the direction of native species. That requires long-term planning and we have not even mentioned Coillte in all of this. However, this cannot happen without Coillte. I do not think we can develop the employment potential without a radical change in what Coillte is doing and its modus operandi. Something like a public works programme is required to develop the huge economic, social and cultural potential in this area. This amendment touches on the need to shift the model from the current one towards one with more emphasis on community forestry and not just on clear felling and all of that area, about which the Minister of State spoke. There are as many employment prospects from all sorts of angles if we move in that direction. In fact, one could well argue that in terms of the overall economic impact of forestry not only on the timber industry, but in regard to the tourism potential. Much of the reputation Ireland has as a place of history and heritage is tied up with our forests. That is just as important as the maybe slightly shorter-term view sometimes taken. That is the logic behind this amendment and some of the other ones. Again, it is part of filling out the picture of what sustainable forestry means.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not think we have got the balance right. We certainly have not got it right so far and the Bill should address the failure to get the balance right. That is the logic behind the amendment. Of course, there are different management systems and different people deal with different aspects of forestry. I fully accept the point Deputy McNamara made earlier about making distinctions between different types of forest. We must try to have a Bill which covers all the bases and does not make it difficult for a small farmer but provides the protection we need, shifts the model a bit and addresses the failures. There is no doubt it has been a failure that we have placed so much emphasis on one species, a non-native species, and that we have failed dramatically in our afforestation targets. This is a problem which must be addressed and the Bill should be part of addressing it. However, I will not labour the point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The amendments tabled by Deputy Pringle are similar. Clearly we were advised by the same source. What we have learned in the past year or two from the dispute on the proposed sale of the harvesting rights of Coillte is the enormous interest and passion that people have for Ireland's forestry. We should seek to harness that in the best interests of forestry, communities and of the country as a whole. There is a requirement to open up all aspects of managing forests, planning afforestation and all environmental concerns - in fact, the whole gamut. The Minister of State has stated his priority is to encourage people to invest in forestry, whereas it should be about opening up the process. Much of the discussion has been about encouraging farmers to invest in forestry, but the elephant in the room, as I mentioned earlier, is Coillte, as it owns the largest proportion of forests. To say that the public does not know what is happening in Coillte would be a mild understatement. We need to have an imperative in the Bill to involve the public and local communities in all aspects of how we develop and enhance our forests. In my view, the logic of these amendments is irrefutable. I hope the Minister of State may consider accepting this amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is a theme on our side in these amendments. The theme on the side of the Minister of State is that he does not seem to see the need for the amendments. The people on behalf of whom we are proposing many of these amendments, who are very knowledgeable about forests, are very concerned about the lack of transparency, accountability, public participation and openness when it comes to this country's forestry sector and how it can be developed in the best and most sustainable way. It is unfortunate the Minister of State is taking this view. These amendments are trying to address a more generally worrying aspect of the Bill, which is the manner in which it centralises a great deal of power in the hands of the Minister, who will be responsible for fleshing out the details of the general priorities that are set out in this legislation. I find that somewhat worrying. A balance should be struck in the opposite way. We need to involve the public. This is true of planning and development generally. The public is the last to know. The people are given the minimum amount of information at the last minute. These amendments seek to redress the balance by providing that the stakeholders in this sector - non-governmental organisations and communities, etc. - must be involved. The purpose of this Bill should be to ensure that happens.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I tabled an amendment to this section to deal with an important issue. I understand it was ruled out of order because of a potential charge on the Exchequer. Our pretty spectacular failure to meet our afforestation targets is well known. We are delivering a small fraction of our afforestation targets. It is clear from the current trajectory that there is no real likelihood of a significant improvement in that regard. I believe it should be set out in the Bill that we will have targets and that we will meet those targets. It is clear from the discussion on the various amendments to section 5 that the Minister of State is placing a big emphasis on his hope that any expansion of the forestry sector will come from the owners of small or slightly bigger amounts of land. I do not think it will happen on that basis. The Minister of State has made it clear that this is what he is trying to do. I just do not think it is enough. The State, which is the biggest owner of forests, has singularly failed to advance the afforestation project. While it might succeed at some level, I do not think it will cut it in an overall sense to rely solely on incentivising or facilitating private owners of land. The State has to be obliged to deliver on afforestation. I have made it clear when speaking on all the amendments to this section that many of those who are in favour of afforestation think there should be a binding requirement for it to happen within a short timeframe, for reasons relating to climate change, etc. They have suggested that if we do not act in such a manner, it could have disastrous environmental consequences. They also argue that when we are setting out to meet those targets, we must shift towards greater use of native species for all sorts of reasons. I would like to make it clear, in the context of the disease that has affected Gougane Barra, that native species are less susceptible to disease than foreign species. If we do not shift from our current mode, it is a potential accident waiting to happen. I have mentioned the two aspects the Bill has to address to a greater extent than it does at present. First, it should focus on meeting our afforestation targets. Second, an emphasis on moving towards native broadleaf species is necessary for a myriad of reasons, some of which are linked to the question of sustainable forestry.This section should set out those priorities but fails to do so adequately.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This amendment seeks a proper planning process in the same way as for other types of development and is self-explanatory. There is a point also, as in Deputy Pringle's previous amendment, about proportionality and excessive regulatory burden on some people. It is always the wrong people who get over-regulated, because proportionality does not work. It is the big guys who have the big impact and who, historically at least, get away with murder. There is no exception in forestry, because the largest owner of forests is not even subject to freedom of information. Recently we discussed Irish Water. I might argue that because the Government was put under pressure with regard to the application of freedom of information provisions to Irish Water, it conceded. The provisions do not apply to Coillte, nor to many of our semi-State companies, but they should apply. It is the little guy who is burdened with excessive regulation in some cases. I am not saying there should not be regulation. There is a need for some regulation because we are dealing with a very important resource and one that has significant environmental and social impacts and so on. However, we are a long way from getting the balance and the proportionality right. As the little guy is hit hardest while the big guy gets away with murder, the Bill must address that problem.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This reminds me of the whole maritime and foreshore area. We have had a situation up to now in which the Minister, with no timeframe set out and, essentially, completely off his or her own bat, makes decisions about oil rigs, windmills or whatever it is. The Government, with the new Bill, which is only at draft stage, has said it must have a transparent process. We have to change that - it does not go as far I would like but at least it is a move in the right direction - to say it is not good enough to centralise all this power in the hands of a Minister who can do whatever he or she likes on a discretionary basis, where he or she "may" do this and "may" do that, or may not. When it is open to discretion in this way, who benefits? Almost always it is the big players who have the ear of the Minister. The Minister of State made an interesting comment. I take the point - I know it was genuinely said on his part - that since he got into his Ministry he has been talking to Coillte, the timber people and so on, but he did not see all of the issues when he was on the outside. That is a very telling comment, if one thinks about it - the insiders and the outsiders - but most people are the outsiders. If one is on the inside and the Minister has-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not doubt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not disputing that. What I am saying is that there is a problem because, in reality, most people are on the outside. Whether good or bad, they do not know what is going on. They do not know the considerations and what is influencing the Minister to make decisions. I worry that much of what is in the Bill borders on the aspirational, when it really goes back to the Minister and says that he or she decides the detail. That is a problem. A transparent process is needed which is fair and is seen to be fair. I worry that too much of the power is vested in the hands of the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This follows on from a series of earlier amendments about sustainable forest management and the more recent discussion about the powers of the Minister. The power of the Minister to grant licences should be subject to being compatible with sustainable forest management, which the Minister of State has sadly decided so far he does not want to put into the Bill. I suppose the appeal to include that in the Bill falls with the Government's refusal to put that into the Bill generally. I feel that should be the critical criterion. I can only ask the Minister of State to reconsider that, and I will be pressing the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Most of the points have been made on good forest practice. The Minister of State referred to our having a national forest standard. Where did that come from? Who developed it? The Minister of State says it will develop over time, that it can evolve, but it seems to be self-generated now and all the stakeholders do not have real input. Environmental groups have pointed out to me that the standards proposed at the Rio Earth Summit are the best we have come up with to date. While it may evolve from there, a self-generated standard, probably developed by the Department, is not as good as something that was generated at the most important environmental summit ever held, with much greater levels of input. That is the point of this and other amendments. We need a higher standard based on more consultation, expertise and knowledge.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As this discussion evolves, certain points are becoming clear to me. I hope the Minister of State might take on board some of what is coming up. Otherwise he will end up placing a massive burden on those he says he wants to encourage and those who should be subject to much more regulation will get off scot free. The Minister of State needs to shift the balance.
