RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Deputy Nash for tabling this motion on inflation and the cost of living. We are happy to support it. We will move two small but important amendments on the issue of introducing energy price caps and supporting workers who put in pay claims to keep their wages and income ahead of the galloping rate of inflation and rising cost of living. The inflation figures are bad enough if they are just taken on their own terms, at 5.7% in December, and they are expected to be above 4.5% next year. That means if people are only getting a 1% pay increase, they are taking a pay cut. Workers are taking a pay cut. I am on the Committee on Budgetary Oversight. It showed that the State contributory pension has nominal increases but the actual real value of the pension dropped by 2%, so pensioners are taking an income cut. That does not tell the whole story, because inflation figures are averages of the cost of living across the economy. The areas where it is much worse are those that really hit the people who can least afford it, who are the vulnerable, low-paid working people. The area of housing is a disaster. People end up homeless as a result of the failure of this and previous Governments to control the price of rent and houses. We do not have time to go into the housing debate now, but it is outrageous that the Government refused to introduce a rent freeze. We would go further and introduce rent controls where the Government controls the rent that can be charged, so that rents are linked to incomes, and are affordable for people. That has to be done urgently. Rents increased by 8% last year and 8% the year before that. A critical point is that the income of landlords in that same period went up by 16%. This is a key point about inflation and the cost-of-living crisis. Rents, childcare costs and energy prices are going up and somebody is making money out of it. Landlords are creaming it. The Government's failure to control rents is not just impoverishing people who need housing, but it is enriching people who control the property sector. This is a basic elementary truth about inflation. For inflation to go up, the producers of goods and services have to increase prices in order to increase their profits. Profits in this economy have shot through the roof. Ordinary workers are stuck on low pay. It is laughable for the Government to talk about high wage rates in this country. We have one of the highest levels of low pay anywhere in the western world. Some 370,000 workers are on low pay in the retail, private security, transport, health and manufacturing sectors. Many are on abysmally low levels of pay. They are poverty levels. The working poor are now being hammered by energy price hikes because of the profiteering of energy companies across the world and in this country. We need to control prices and rents. We need to support workers who are putting in pay claims to keep ahead of the galloping rate of inflation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On many issues this Government talks a good game but is not so good at delivering. Delivering new schools and the actual buildings for those schools is one spectacular failure in that regard. Under the online patronage process system, the Department of Education is due to deliver 47 schools between 2019 and 2022. I would like to know how many of them have actual sites and buildings. Certainly, in my area sites and actual buildings for the schools that have been decided-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. It relates to a promise that the Government would deliver these schools.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Dún Laoghaire Educate Together National School has a site but no building. The proposed Sallynoggin-Killiney Educate Together national school has no site and no building. Gaelscoil Laighean is still waiting on a permanent site. The Red Door School, a special school, has been operating in prefabs for over a decade. Gaelscoil Phádraig has spent 20 years in prefabs waiting for a site. Blackrock Educate Together Secondary School has a site but no building and is in temporary accommodation. That is just in my area.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Gaelscoil Phádraig has been waiting 20 years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is called advance planning.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The mother and baby home regime was organised abuse of mothers and children by the church and State. They have been cruelly let down time and again by the State. The commission report was an absolute travesty, as I said from the start, in that it failed to take on board in a serious way, and give way to, the voices of the survivors. However, the leak was a disgrace. Government spin came before the needs of the survivors and their right to see that report before journalists and everybody else. A year later is the Taoiseach seriously not just pulling our legs when he says that he has not come to a conclusion as to how the leak happened and that somehow it has got tied up in some wider discussion about Cabinet confidentiality? That is an insult. Is there going to be a cover-up of this leak or are we going to get a conclusion? Can the Taoiseach also end the further insult of the arbitrary six-month date for acknowledging the pain, abuse and wrong that was done to everybody who went through the mother and baby home system?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Global Ireland: Ireland's Global Footprint to 2025 puts much emphasis on our culture, arts and heritage but most of its initiatives are essentially about punting our reputation around the world. I am not saying there is anything wrong with them but we are not doing what we should be doing, which is to nurture and support those who produce the art, literature, music, film and so on. We have been talking about wage rates in this country. The two lowest earning sectors in our economy comprise retail workers and arts workers. They endure miserably low pay and most have no job security because they have episodic employment. In many cases they live in poverty. It is interesting that both of those groups were the worst hit during Covid-19 but we needed them most. We do not give the support to the people in arts and culture, although we are quite happy to punt our reputation around the world. We spend one sixth of the EU average on arts and culture in this country and there has been no real significant increase lately. There was a little increase during the Covid-19 pandemic but it is not anything to the level we see elsewhere. Let us match words with deeds if we want to support our fantastic and rich heritage and the creative talent that exists in the country. Let us give those people decent incomes and employment security. We should end the scandal in the film industry where nobody has a job but we spend hundreds of millions of euro there every year. Performers do not get royalties because they are forced onto buyout contracts when they work on films and television productions. Let us match the words about culture with deeds to support the artists, technicians and performers in arts and culture.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to see Government information flowing in respect of two areas with the sort of frequency and sophistication that we saw around Covid announcements. I note there is a Government of Ireland document entitled Be Winter Ready. We discussed at length the question of fuel energy price hikes. Notwithstanding the debate around all of that, there is a real danger of people on low incomes, such as pensioners, freezing during the winter and excess winter deaths. Many of those people do not know where they get help. We can debate whether the help that is available is sufficient, but many people do not know where to get that help. I am dealing with a man who has cancer. His boiler has been broken for three or four months and he has been freezing since October. He does not know where to go. He needs help and information. The Government is telling people to be winter ready. We need to get information out to the people who may need to make choices about turning off heating or who do not have their heating on about where they can get help and how they can get out of that situation. I appeal for that kind of information to be made available. Second, there was a shambles around the PUP over the Christmas period, and that continues. There is huge confusion about the entitlement to the PUP. I discovered from our taxi driver friends, who were one of the big victims of this, that people thought PRSI contributions were being awarded to them while they were in receipt of the PUP. As far as I understand it, that should have happened. However, when people went to apply for the PUP they were told they did not have sufficient PRSI contributions or there was significant confusion. People are having difficulty getting the help they need. We need Government information to explain how people can get answers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are supposed to be a neutral country but the way in which the Government is articulating its position on the dangerous brinkmanship and escalation by two major military political blocs - NATO and Russia - suggests that, for the Government at least, there is no question of being neutral or objective but that the Irish Government is taking sides.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ironically, the Government suggests - obviously, the Taoiseach does not understand the position of socialists on this - that we are reluctant to criticise Russia.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State really does not listen, does he? Let me put it as baldly as I can. Putin is a thug over an autocratic, nasty, militarist and imperial-looking regime.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I may finish, to put to bed-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not interrupt the Minister of State or the Taoiseach. I wish to put to bed the nonsense that Government Deputies come out with. I cannot put it more baldly. They would not put it as baldly as that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We were out criticising what the Russians were doing in Kazakhstan last week, and there is not much action from the Government on that. I stood at many a protest over what the Russians did in Chechnya and the carnage they inflicted there and I did not see Members opposite there, so they should not try to confuse the issue. While I object absolutely to the Russians' massing troops on the Ukrainian border, to the whole nature of the Russian regime and, for that matter, to the carrying out of military exercises in the Irish maritime area, the problem is that I have heard not a word about the NATO military exercise on 24 January in the Mediterranean. There has been no criticism of that military exercise, in which NATO flexed its muscles. It was the first time since the end of the Cold War that an entire US aircraft carrier fleet came under NATO control. What is it doing there except ratcheting up the tensions? The Russians are massing troops on the Ukrainian border; they should not be doing so. The Americans are planning to send troops into Ukraine and are arming the Ukrainians, as are many of the NATO powers - not Germany, notably, but many European powers are arming the Ukrainians with weapons that the Russians, as much as I criticise them, have a reason to be concerned about. James Baker promised at the time that an eastward expansion of NATO would not happen. That promise was broken and NATO was expanded aggressively, encircling Russia, inevitably provoking an escalation of political and military tensions. There has been not a word on that from the Irish Government and no balance in its criticism. That is why I say it is not being neutral or objective in this. Some of the world's media outlets that do not have an axe to grind for one side or the other are objective in their assessment of what is going on. Ireland is not. Why? Because the Irish political establishment has always, in truth, wanted to facilitate the US-led western bloc, as it does at Shannon Airport, allowing it to prosecute the utterly disastrous wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, where hundreds of thousands of people were slaughtered and we facilitated it. We facilitated the kidnap and torture programme that is US rendition. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael and some of their coalition partners stood over that and allowed that to happen and continue to allow it to happen. They want to sign us up to the permanent structured co-operation, PESCO, when the European military project being pushed is all about deepening the integration with NATO, which is a first-strike military and nuclear alliance. I ask the House to just think about that. NATO has a policy of first-strike use of nuclear weapons against states that do not have nuclear weapons. That is an actual policy of NATO. We should be railing against that kind of stuff. Let us uphold our shattered tradition of neutrality and call this out for what it is. These are two nasty, expansionist military-political big power alliances. Neutrality means calling them both out and calling for people to step back from the brink of war, to demilitarise the area, to de-escalate and to say that weapons and the deployment of same as well as military advisors and troops from either side are not acceptable and are adding fuel to the fire.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have two questions. I have charged that the Government is betraying our tradition of neutrality. It did that with regard to Shannon and regarding numerous US military adventures. It is doing it again. It rightly criticises Russia for what it is doing off our coast with military exercises that are unwanted and should stop - Russia should be told we do not want them - and for Russia's often aggressive stance, military escalations and massing troops on the border, but has the Government any word of criticism about NATO? If we are trying to be balanced and objective, has the Government a single word of criticism for the eastward expansion of NATO and for the US putting troops, military advisers and so forth into Ukraine? Does it approve of that? Does the Irish Government think it is a good idea that NATO is doing military exercises in the Mediterranean Sea while these tensions are ratcheting up? Does it think these are good ideas, given how they will contribute to the escalation? The Minister of State should give us a straight answer on that. I suspect he has not got a word of criticism of NATO, but I ask him to prove me wrong. On foot of what he said earlier, and I realise we do not have time for a broad debate on it, I would not be so proud of defending the two-state solution. Many Palestinians do not support the two-state solution. Frankly, the two-state solution is the equivalent in Palestine of arguing for maintaining partition in Ireland. That is what the two-state solution was, the partition of Palestine along ethnic and religious lines. Some would argue, Israelis and Palestinians, that this is the main source of the conflict and that what is actually needed is equality and respect for human rights regardless of whether one is a Jew, an Arab, a Christian or a Muslim, and that a state where everybody has that equality would be a far better solution. I would say most Palestinians now subscribe to that view.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In Ukraine it is highly divisive, and the Minister of State knows it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The scandal that has been revealed in Kerry, involving overmedication, losing files and children and young people with mental health issues not being looked after properly, is not at all unique to Kerry. In 2018, psychiatrists in Wexford, including the consultant in CAMHS, resigned, saying the service was totally unsafe. Dr. Sharma said he was sidelined because he expressed concerns about the overmedication of children. I know of other people, and I will not mention their names, who were witch-hunted in CAMHS by the HSE because they protested at the level of overmedication. Overmedication was compensating for the lack of staff and resources. That is what is happening, and it is a scandal. We have to monitor this. It is self-evident that there has been a stratospheric increase in the medication of children in this country and across the world over recent years. That is what is happening. If one wants to help young people with mental health problems, one starts, as Deputy Barry said, by talking to them. That is the essence of psychology, psychotherapy and proper psychiatry - talking to them and asking what is wrong. However, one needs qualified people to do that, and we do not have the qualified people. That is the problem. It starts at primary care. If a young person is having difficulties, he or she goes to the GP. What does the GP do? Effectively, there are no primary care services to which the young person can be referred. We do not have enough psychologists. We do not have psychology departments in our schools, which we should have. Many other countries have them, including the United States. We do not have a staffed primary care mental health service, and CAMHS are nowhere near what was promised in A Vision for Change years ago. We have failed so spectacularly on A Vision for Change that we revised it down in terms of staff numbers to cover up our failure.We removed the original targets for psychology in A Vision for Change completely. That is what is going on. It is a running scandal and those who raise that scandal are witch-hunted in the HSE because nobody wants to admit the truth. Children are suffering because we have failed. We might then think about what we must do but perhaps we should start getting some of the psychologists, occupational therapists and speech and language therapists we need. However, we make it as difficult as possible for people to qualify with doctorates in psychology. We charge them €15,000 in fees so they drop out. We give no funding whatever to educational and counselling psychology. We give a little bit to clinical but none to educational and counselling psychology. All our young psychologists, after getting their basic degrees, go to Utrecht in the Netherlands. They get proper jobs over there and do not have to pay massive fees to qualify in psychology. That is the essence of the problem, which has been known for years. It was identified in A Vision for Change more than a decade ago. We have failed and failed again, and as a result we end up overmedicating our young people. We have seen the terrible consequences of that in Kerry. We must get real and start having psychologists in schools. We must staff the primary care mental health services and the CAMHS we need. We must of course address some of the big issues by listening to young people; they would tell us what matters affect them.
