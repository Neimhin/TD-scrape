RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have two questions. Has the Taoiseach had any discussions with his European counterparts about the passing of the nation-state law in Israel by Benjamin Netanyahu? On top of the long list of apartheid and racist measures directed against the Arab and Palestinian population, the nation-state law is an explicitly racist and apartheid law which flies in the face of international law and the right of Arab and Palestinian people to national self-determination. I wonder if Europe intends to do anything at all, or to make any statement, about how repugnant and in breach of international law and rights this nation-state law is. Was anything said about the shooting of migrants by Moroccan forces? To add to the atrocities being committed against desperate people fleeing the Mediterranean, this latest incident was pretty shocking.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Taoiseach scratches around for additional money for things like housing which we need desperately, health and education services and water infrastructure, has he taken note of the significance of the Comptroller and Auditor General's recent report which confirms something those of us on the left have been saying for years? Now it comes from a source that the Taoiseach cannot dismiss quite so easily. The report outlines how 90 of the richest individuals in the country are declaring taxable incomes which are less than the average industrial wage. In 2016 these high net worth individuals claimed €96 million in various tax credits and reliefs. By the way, they are people whose individual wealth is estimated to exceed €50 million. It is absolutely shocking when one thinks of some of the social problems people in this country face that some of the richest people are availing of tax reliefs and credits to bring their taxable income down to negligible levels. The Comptroller and Auditor General's report also points to something else we have said repeatedly about the extent of corporate tax loopholes. As someone who has spoken a lot about this issue, the Comptroller and Auditor General's figures stagger even me. In 2016, €296 billion was available in allowances and forward losses to be offset against profits. It is estimated that in future years it could rob Revenue of approximately €29 billion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a scandal. Is the Taoiseach going to look at it and examine the loopholes to ensure the rich and corporations will pay their fair share of tax?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not €50 million.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I referred to net worth - "high net worth individuals".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the Taoiseach's speech to Pope Francis he talked about a new chapter in the relationship between Ireland and the Catholic Church. The repeal referendum and, perhaps, the visit itself, given that the numbers going to see the Pope were far lower than expected, clearly indicate, as the Taoiseach mentioned, that the relationship the majority of people in this country want is a separation of the institutions of the State from church and religious doctrine. The question is whether the Taoiseach's vision of that is going to be different from the old relationship when it comes to who runs critical services and what services they provide, particularly in areas such as health and education. I especially want to ask the Taoiseach about the national maternity hospital. I and others have asked about it and we are deeply concerned about it. Dr. Peter Boylan wrote an alarming letter to The Irish Times in August in which he pointed out that the Religious Sisters of Charity says that the St. Vincent's group will have to uphold the values and vision of Mother Mary Aikenhead, foundress of the Religious Sisters of Charity, and that the Irish Catholic Bishops' Conference published in its Code of Ethical Standards for Healthcare that Catholic health facilities will not provide assisted fertility treatment, artificial contraception, morning-after pills, surrogacy, abortion, a referral elsewhere for abortion, sterilisation, or gender reassignment surgery. If that were to be the situation in the national maternity hospital run by the new St. Vincent's group, it would be absolutely unacceptable. I want reassurance, as do the women of Ireland, that the national maternity hospital will not be abiding by that sort of code of ethics.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Josepha Madigan, said that section 481 film industry tax relief is key to underpinning a film industry. Yesterday morning, I was with film workers outside Ardmore Studios where they were protesting. They say there is no industry. There is an awful lot of money going into the hands of ten or 12 companies who employ next to nobody. The workers who worked on production after production for those same companies for ten, 15 or 20 years have been disowned by the companies and have no security of employment. This is precarious employment and a denial of rights. These workers have asked to meet the Minister but she has refused a meeting. They say they are now being blacklisted because they are insisting on the quality of employment that was promised under the legislation, which was supposed to be attached to section 481 tax relief. How will the Minister respond to them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When is the film industry forum as recommended going to happen to bring all stakeholders into a room to sort out the problems? We need to consider matters such as Mel Gibson suing a company that has produced a film, stating that the producers benefiting from section 481 tax relief are defrauding that tax relief by artificially inflating costs and expenses and milking the taxpayer. That is a very serious matter. Business cannot continue as usual when there are workers outside Ardmore Studios who say, and I have seen evidence to back this up, they are being blacklisted, even though they have worked for many years for these production companies which are getting €80 million a year from these loans, grants and section 481 tax relief which are intended to give employment. The GMB trade union and the Irish Film Workers Association, IFWA, have asked to meet the Minister. Will she meet them to hear what they have to say?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a very serious issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking the Minister to meet these workers. She is obviously meeting Screen Ireland. Will she meet these workers, who have asked to meet her, to hear their side of the story? It is a direct question and I wish she would answer it. Unless she gets all the stakeholders involved in this discussion, she is not being serious about trying to address the problems. The Mel Gibson action is very serious. That could shred our international reputation, never mind the fact that serious sums of public money are involved. That needs to be investigated as a matter of urgency. Whatever about the individual case, we need to establish whether there are loopholes that can be exploited and are being exploited. Something needs to be done about the fact that we are putting €80 million into an industry and there is no standing workforce. A child could take €80 million and employ a few hundred people or 1,000 people for a year, but there is no standing workforce. It is, so to speak, a hire 'em and fire 'em workforce. If anyone dares say a word about their rights, compliance with EU directives or the working time directive, and if he or she does not sign up to certain agreements that are imposed on him or her, that person is blacklisted. That cannot go on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Except for film workers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would appreciate it if we could keep it tight because I have another question after this one.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is well aware that there is a huge campaign and great public concern about the Luggala estate in the Wicklow mountains, a unique piece of our cultural heritage which is up for sale. Under its previous owners, the de Brún family, public access to Lough Dan and the surrounding area was guaranteed. With its sale, there are real fears that any new owner could cut off access to Lough Dan and the surrounding area and that access to this precious piece of our cultural heritage could be lost. People are appealing to the Minister to step in and purchase the Luggala estate to secure it for public use into the future.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need more of an assurance than that. There are big petitions ongoing and the matter has been raised a number of times in the House. It would be completely unacceptable if the area was to be fenced off as private property and become inaccessible. There would be uproar. Any restriction of access to the vista at Lough Dan would be totally unacceptable. We need an assurance that the Minister is going to do something about the matter. If the house is a problem, can the Minister give security about the surrounding lands, guaranteeing access to Lough Dan, the walks and viewing points? Will she at least guarantee that they will be taken into public ownership in order that public access to this unique and beautiful piece of our heritage will not be restricted? If that is allowed to happen, it will be beyond shame.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I move on to the next question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have three minutes, do we not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Therefore we cannot move on to the next question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To refer to commercial considerations when we are discussing this piece of our national heritage is not good enough. Some things are too important to simply allow the highest bidder to come along and take them. As has been mentioned, "private property" signs are appearing on the road with views over Luggala. That is a very ominous sign of what could come down the line if the State does not step in to secure this site. It provides value in terms of tourism, walking and access to Lough Dan, and is irreplaceable. The Government needs to give firm assurances that it will not let this land go to the highest bidder with so much heritage and access for the public going a begging. That would be a shame on the State.
