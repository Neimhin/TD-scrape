RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are many aspects to the housing crisis and the failure of this Government to deal with it. The programme for Government puts a particular emphasis on affordable housing. The Rebuilding Ireland affordable home loan scheme, which commenced last February, is a mess. More evidence of the mess around it was provided by Brian O'Connell on the "Today with Seán O'Rourke" radio programme. We heard of numerous families who had been approved but who are now being told the funds may not exist. We know that a considerable amount of the funds have been drawn down. These funds would have been expected to have been drawn down in the timeline set out for the €200 million.I have had multiple items of correspondence, which I have raised and will again today, from people being refused the loan for inexplicable reasons. One family was told that they earn too much and that the other reason they were not being given it was because it was not thought that they could repay the loan. It cannot be both. Is the real reason that the funds are running out? Is that why people are being refused and may not get loans even when they are approved?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is clear since Theresa May abandoned her futile attempt to engage with headbangers like Boris Johnson, the European Research Group, ERG, Rees-Mogg and the Democratic Unionist Party, DUP, that there is now a little bit of hope that reason might prevail and we might avoid the crash-out because she is talking to a man much maligned in this House, Jeremy Corbyn, a socialist and left-winger, and Corbyn does not want a race to the bottom Brexit. He is saying he is willing to consider backing the deal as long as workers' rights and environmental and health standards are not undermined. It is the headbanger politics on the right of the Tory party that have left us in this mess. What is the European Union's attitude and the attitude of the Taoiseach towards the possibility of a general election in Britain? If that becomes a prospect, that would be a very good thing for us and Europe. Ireland should be very tolerant of creating the space for a general election that might change the political landscape in the direction of the left and of Mr. Corbyn in Britain because we would be looking at a far better opportunity for a deal that was not a crazy crash-out. I note from the Taoiseach's comments about meetings over recent days that there were more detailed discussions about arrangements for the Border issue and so on in the event of a crash-out, which we hope does not happen. Will the Taoiseach elaborate on these because there is an anxiety, notwithstanding positive statements from European leaders, that in the event of a crash-out, Europe might push for Border infrastructure to protect the Single Market?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Most people were relieved that Chancellor Merkel made references to the Berlin wall and the problem that the division of Germany and walls and borders made. She showed empathy with the cause of preventing a hard border on this island. On foot of the earlier question, there have been discussions about intensifying the detailed discussions on that outcome which we hope will not happen, can the Taoiseach tell us anything about the details of those negotiations? On the day of the Israeli election, where we have a government in Israel that is all about walls, borders, annexing people's territory, dividing people up and so on in the most brutal way, did the Taoiseach take any time to discuss that with Angela Merkel?Germany is one of the most unflinching supporters of Israel and the most muted in criticising Israel for its mistreatment of the Palestinians. Given her welcome comments about borders and walls in Germany and Ireland, she might take the same view in terms of Israeli walls in Palestine.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not believe any clarity is required on the DUP's position, and I disagree with the leader of Fianna Fáil. The raison d'être of the DUP is to maintain political sectarianism, even if it has self-defeating consequences and leads to a hard border or something else. We could more usefully talk about the social and economic transformation of this island in a progressive direction and things that can unite people North and South. One of the most obvious ways to do that is the extension of abortion rights to women in the North. Did the Taoiseach have any discussions with any of the people he engaged with on issues such as that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I made most of the points I want to make about Brexit in the earlier engagement, but I will summarise briefly. It is very welcome and long overdue that Prime Minister Theresa May has moved away from trying to engage or have reason to prevail with the headbangers on the Tory right like Mr. Boris Johnson, MP; Mr. Jacob Rees-Mogg, MP, and the European Research Group, ERG. They are driven by their own personal ambitions, a really rotten nostalgia for Britain's imperial greatness as they imagine it, little Englandism and xenophobia. As they were never likely to listen to reason, it is welcome that Mrs. May has started to engage with Mr. Jeremy Corbyn, MP, notwithstanding the tendency of people both here and in Britain to malign him for his left-wing views. This engagement actually offers the possibility of a deal being done because Mr. Corbyn does not want a race-to-the-bottom Brexit of the sort the Tory right wants. It is noteworthy that the issues he is raising in his engagement with Mrs. May are ones that really matter to British people and people across Europe, issues such as workers' rights, health and safety standards and so on. He is saying clearly that he wants a deal that would not undermine these standards. Left-wing politics of Mr. Corbyn's kind are precisely about raising standards in areas such as workers' rights and environmental ambitions, opposing militarism and promoting an egalitarian and progressive agenda. They are quite alien to Mrs. May and will make her reluctant to do a deal with Mr. Corbyn, but there is a glimmer of hope. The best hope, however, lies in having a general election in Britain to remove the Tories and open the way for a left-wing Government with politics of the kind Mr. Corbyn is articulating. It is welcome that the clear message from here to the European Union is that in no circumstances can a hard border in Ireland be considered for any reason and it seems to be having an impact.I hope we can trust our European counterparts in the event of a no-deal Brexit, which we hope will not come to pass, and that they will not intend to put pressure on us to impose border infrastructure between the North and South, something that should be hotly resisted if there is any attempt to do it. It would seem that the message at least from here is clear in that regard. I wish to move on to some other issues, which the Taoiseach will probably not have much time to discuss at the European Council but it would be remiss not to mention given the day that is in it, that is, the Israeli general election. I made the point to the Taoiseach earlier that it is a very positive thing for Angela Merkel to come here and say that the bitter experience of the Berlin Wall and the division of East Germany, which ended with the wall being pulled down in 1989, led her to somewhat empathise with our concerns and opposition to a hard border North and South. That is a positive development, but Europe is failing to take the same attitude when it comes to the walls and borders brutally imposed by Israel, and in particular by the Netanyahu Government on the Palestinian people. We are seeing the rottenness of Israeli politics manifest in a particularly repugnant way in recent weeks and months. The talk by Mr. Netanyahu of annexing further illegal settlements on Palestinian territory follows the acceptance by the United States of the annexation of the Golan Heights. All of those things completely fly in the face of international law, yet the European Union does nothing about it. An Israeli lawyer came into my clinic in the past week who represents Palestinian children who are locked up. He explained in detail how an apartheid legal system is in operation. I do not know why the Taoiseach is smirking. Palestinian children, almost always, are arrested in and around areas of illegal Israeli settlements. They are arrested in the middle of the night, tied with plastic ties, blindfolded and their parents are not allowed to go with them. They are dragged into cells and interrogated under military law. In the same towns and areas, Israelis who might be accused of the same crimes are brought to civil courts where none of that sort of mistreatment and abuse of children is allowed. It is illegal to do that to an Israeli child, but it is done every single day to Palestinian children because a different set of laws applies to Palestinian children than to Israeli children even though they live in the same place. That is the definition of apartheid. What is being done is appalling. Thousands of Palestinian children are arrested every year and at any point, hundreds are in prison. The Israeli lawyer explained that those children are marked forever by that experience. They are damaged and traumatised forever but nothing is being done about it. Similarly, adult prisoners commenced a hunger strike on Sunday. Some 30 Palestinian prisoners initially refused food and water and it is going to escalate to 1,500 because conditions in Israeli prisons, in particular Ramon Prison in the Negev, are deteriorating. Conditions are so appalling and obnoxious that the Palestinians simply cannot take it anymore. According to human rights groups, 1,800 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons are very seriously ill and are not getting the medical treatment they need. Hundreds more have chronic illnesses and in some cases they are life-threatening illnesses. That is going on under the nose of the international community and nothing is done. Israel sticks two fingers up to Europe when it comes to Europe putting money into projects in Gaza and in the West Bank which the Israelis just go and blow up. They blow up projects that are funded with European money and Europe does nothing. While I welcome the statement the Tánaiste issued yesterday, it is not good enough. Countries like Germany, and in particular Merkel, have a hands-off attitude to what Israel is doing to the Palestinians and do not want to take any action. We continue to give preferred trading status to Israel under the Euromed association agreement. The agreement contains human rights clauses which mean it should be suspended, but we do nothing about it. When will there be sanctions over the systematic, ongoing, unacceptable human rights abuses, including most horribly the systematic abuse of children's rights who are being treated in the most brutal fashion? In the case of Ahed Timimi, a family relative of hers was shot through the skull and permanently damaged by an Israeli soldier. Following her protest at what happened, she ended up in prison and was treated in the same way that hundreds of other young children are being treated by the Israelis. I appeal to the Taoiseach to do something about that and to demand that, finally, Europe shows a bit of moral backbone and imposes some real sanctions on Israel for its systematic ongoing brutal suppression of human and civil rights in Palestine.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is utterly dishonest and frankly surreal for the Government, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil to declare their commitment to neutrality and then move quickly to stating why they are going to oppose this Bill and defend our current relationship with the evolving European military machine. They do not mention our ongoing complicity with the US war machine. It is a little disappointing to hear a slightly diluted version of the same surreal narrative from the Labour Party, which states that this Bill is not necessary. What about Shannon Airport? That is the reality that blows a hole in the nonsense we just heard from the Government and Fianna Fáil about their commitment to neutrality. Some 2 million US troops have passed through Shannon Airport since the onset of the US-led slaughter in Afghanistan and Iraq. We have facilitated that machine in conducting that slaughter with utterly disastrous consequences and in defiance of any meaningful definition of neutrality. Members can play around with all the legalistic nonsense they want and try to dissect the Bill in a legalistic way in order to deflect attention from that reality, but they are not going to get away with it. The people of this country do not believe it for one solitary second. They know the reality. They expressed their feelings on that reality when the Irish political establishment facilitated war in Iraq in 2003 by coming out on the streets in unprecedented numbers. That was probably the biggest demonstration that had happened in the State since its foundation. The only demonstrations that even came close to the one that happened on 15 February 2003 were the recent protests against water charges. The numbers were so great that we still do not know how big the demonstrations were. One of the organisers, Mr. Roger Cole, is sitting in the Gallery. He, Mr. Brendan Butler, Mr. Gearoid Kilgallen and I met others several months in advance of a war we knew was going to happen in order to plan those protests for 15 February 2003 in the hope that this demonstration, as part of the global mobilisation that happened on that day, might force the US, Britain and their allies not to proceed with the military assault on Iraq. The world spoke in the biggest demonstration in human history. There has not been a bigger demonstration on a single day before or since. People begged political leaders in this country and across the world not to support or in any way facilitate that military onslaught.  I remember writing an opinion piece for The Irish Times a few weeks before the war started. I quoted some NGOs' estimates of what the casualties of that war would be and wrote that up to 50,000 people might die in Iraq if that war went ahead. As it turned out, more than 1 million people were killed. I ask Members to think about that. This was the absolute destruction of Iraqi society. Some 4 million people were displaced in the worst displacement in human history until the war in Syria. The latter conflict is a direct consequence of the war in 2003. There would be no Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, ISIS, if it was not for that war. We facilitated it, we justified it, we defended it and we allowed it to happen. The NATO military assault on Afghanistan which preceded the 2003 war continues. That occupation is a humanitarian disaster for Afghanistan. That war was justified on the basis that NATO had to respond to the horrific atrocity of 11 September 2001, but the majority of people who carried out that horrific assault were from Saudi Arabia. Last year, Saudi Arabia overtook Russia as the world's third biggest spender on arms after the United States and China. Where does Saudi Arabia get all its weapons? It gets them from Britain, France and our friends in PESCO. Some €1.8 trillion was spent on weapons last year. I invite Members to look at the list of spenders - the United States, China, Saudi Arabia, Russia, India, France, the UK, Japan and Germany. Are these countries with a great history of peacemaking? Come on. These are imperial and sub-imperial powers with a bloody history of using their military power to crush colonial peoples and grab their resources, and to fight savage wars against each other in order to control markets and resources on a global level. That is what we are involved in when we facilitate the US military at Shannon Airport. That is what we are involved in with the Partnership for Peace, whose Orwellian name belies its nature as a structured alignment with the NATO military alliance. It is headed up by precisely those powers who account for two thirds of all global military expenditure, who led the war in Iraq and who led the disastrous assault on Libya that destroyed yet another state. NATO has a first-strike nuclear policy. That means that it will fire nuclear weapons at other countries even if they do not shoot first. That is the policy of NATO. We are now aligned with it through the PfP and the PESCO arrangements, every hand's turn of which is about establishing interoperability between the evolving European military structures and NATO with its bloody history. Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour state that we do not need something in our Constitution to vindicate the views of the majority of people in this country who opposed the use of Shannon Airport for the war to which I refer and who oppose our involvement in military alliances or to vindicate the history of this country, whose neutrality flows from the fact that the State was born in a fight against empire. We need this in our Constitution in order to vindicate that history and the view of the majority of Irish people.
