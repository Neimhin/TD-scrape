RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am delighted that TASC is here and welcome the emphasis the delegates put on the counter productive nature of austerity and cutting one's way out of recession.  They also made the important point that social equality is a question of good economics as well as fairness.  To this end TASC's submission calls for taxation to be focused on those with wealth.  From the point of view of fairness and sustainable economics, all of that is to be welcomed.  We need to stimulate the economy through capital investment and investment in people.  I only hope somebody in Europe or the Irish Government is listening.While I agree with the general principles in the submission, some of the proposals may be somewhat timid.  I understand the point about a maximum programme and a minimum programme because it is a concept with which we are very familiar in the socialist movement.  What we might like to achieve in an ideal world can be different from what we think we can achieve in the short term.Even if we are not to solve the problem immediately, those who understand the crippling implications of our debt should perhaps say it is not good enough simply to reschedule it.  It is not our debt and it is robbing us of the funds we need for the stimulus that is needed if we are to get out of this catastrophic situation.The big problem which we are facing is a massive collapse in investment.  Levels of investment have decreased by approximately two thirds since the onset of the recession.  To restore growth and employment, we need to bring investment levels back to where they were previously, albeit targeting them at strategic projects rather than property bubbles.I welcome the emphasis on educating people because ultimately people are creative.  Education is a long-term investment, as are innovation and upskilling.  The cost of losing a job is estimated at €20,000.  If 350,000 people became unemployed since the recession began, the cost would amount to €7 billion.  The structural deficit is only €10 billion.  If we put those 350,000 people back to work in public works programmes, we would get rid of €7 billion of the deficit.  All we would need to do is top up their incomes because people should not have to work for dole money.  We could find the money to top up their incomes by taxing wealth.  What do the delegates think about that simple equation?While innovation and education are important we should also invest in certain old-fashioned activities.  I came across a simple example in the aftermath of last week's floods.  Serious flooding occurs because leaves are not swept out of gullies.  This is a basic job which depends on the availability of manpower.  It is not highly skilled but it is very important.  The fact that we no longer have large numbers of people doing simple, old-fashioned tasks like pulling leaves out of gullies means that we pay more in terms of unemployment and in terms of not doing these jobs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just asking a question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will make my last point.  Would TASC agree that the carbon tax and residential property tax run the risk of becoming regressive stealth taxes?  Residential property tax will apply to people on low incomes or in negative equity.  Even if one wanted to be discerning in terms of low incomes, the means testing, administration and billing involved will be more costly than focusing on income taxes whereby the wealthy pay more.  Why does TASC choose means testing rather than taxing the wealthy, which appears fairer as well as cheaper to apply?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not quite get that point.  While I accept some of the points made by Dr. O'Connor, I think of many little old ladies in Dun Laoghaire living on their own who happen to have houses that might have a relatively high value but their income is negligible.  I do not see how it is beneficial to impose a property tax on them or on people in negative equity or with large mortgages who are seriously struggling to manage.  Even if one was discerning in dealing with those problems, one would create a bureaucracy which has to means test people and that would be wasteful.  Dr. O'Connor said it is more damaging to go after income.  I do not see how it is damaging to go after high incomes because such incomes are not being spent at the moment.  I do not refer to low and middle income earners who are spending because they have to.  Can high income earners who are saving not afford to take a hit?  Is that not fairer and easier in the context of the revenue system?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be brief because many of the points have been made.  I welcome the fact that TASC is explicitly adding its voice to the criticism of the EU-IMF deal because, we are banjaxed unless we break from this deal.  We need to develop a common front of opposition to it.  The points have largely been made to TASC.  I definitely think the property tax is problematic.  It does not convince me that if the money is just put against the house and payments are deferred that it is a particularly good way to deal with the problem that emerges from it.  It is ironic that on this issue at least Social Justice Ireland and TASC seem like the real communists.  It summons up the spectre of seeing home ownership as in itself problematic and somehow inherently associated with being wealthy which is not true.  Tax must be related to income.  The bottom line is that if one does it that way I do not see how it can be done fairly without unintended consequences of hitting people who it should not hit.On a wealth assets tax as the other alternative, what the United Left Alliance proposes is that we should put a 5% wealth levy on assets over €1 million, excluding principal private residence, as well as proposing income tax bands of 50% for income of more than €100,000, 60% for income of more than €150,000 and 70% for income of more than €200,000.  How would the delegates respond to that as an alternative approach to taxes on such things as text messages, nutrition and property that all have the potential at least to affect the people they want to protect?While I welcome the idea of getting 100,000 off social welfare and paying them some extra to work - I think most people want to work and I suspect many people would take up such a proposal - is there a slight danger that we are creating a cheap labour force and we should be a little more ambitious in how much extra people should be paid for taking up 20 hours a week or whatever because of the danger of such a proposal being abused?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.  Notwithstanding my other differences with the Labour Party these days, the Senator was right in what she said on the fees issue.  The imposition of fees would act as a disincentive to young people considering entering third level education.  There are other ways to deal with the funding issue and the fair way is by way of incomes.Speakers referred to a property tax and to a proposed nutrition tax, about which I have not thought very much.  I agree with Dr. Healy's proposal regarding financial transactions.  That is a good idea and that proposal should be implemented instantly.  I have no doubt about Dr. Seán Healy's good intentions and in his world or the world of TASC there would be no abuse of property taxes, nutrition taxes or carbon taxes and they would be poverty-proofed and any anomalies would be dealt with.  However, what Dr. Healy fails to fully take into account is that once these type of taxes come in they become a tap that governments turn on  regardless of the purpose for which they were originally intended and waivers and allowances made for the less well off disappear pretty quickly as soon as there is pressure to find extra funding.  That has been the experience, most notably, in recent times when there were bin charge waivers for the least well off, but they have been removed, as we predicted they would be.Nobody has answered a question I put that relates to a bigger issue of bureaucracy that needs to be highlighted more.  It would relate to the Government's proposal to have universal health insurance in the health system.  The issue is the failure to take into account the cost of creating a bureaucracy to means test people and having hundreds of people issuing letters, reminders and demands for money.  That is an issue that has not been taken into account in the health service.  It is the same principle to which I refer.  Once one gets into the business of billing, a massive bureaucracy is created and money that should go into directly providing services goes into billing, demands, chasing money, and that is a waste of money.
