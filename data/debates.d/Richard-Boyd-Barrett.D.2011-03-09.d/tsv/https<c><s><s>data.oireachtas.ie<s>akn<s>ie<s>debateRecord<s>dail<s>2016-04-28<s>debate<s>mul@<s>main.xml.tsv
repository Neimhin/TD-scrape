RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The work of the CSO is very important to allow for planning in key areas like housing, health and education. The information it gathers in the course of the census and the various other reports, publications and surveys that it carries out are of huge importance and make a great contribution, which should help to underpin proper planning by politicians and other Departments. I fully understand the need for the Revised Estimate and I am happy to support it. I have one question about the cost surrounding the census. When the census of 2011 was taken, I raised the issue of CACI International, which had been contracted by the CSO to do some of the work on the last census and a number of previous censuses, which I think was described as "capturing the statistics". I believe that in the 2011 census, it was a subsidiary of CACI International, CACI UK, that was contracted to assist in some of the work of the census. As I pointed out then, I was quite alarmed. It was brought to my attention by the fact that CACI International was implicated in providing interrogators - 60 employees, to be precise - to work in Abu Ghraib in Iraq doing so-called "interrogation" between 2003 and 2005. These enhanced interrogation techniques that were used in Abu Ghraib are, for most people, generally understood to be torture. There were huge scandals around what went on in Abu Ghraib. I myself was involved in bringing a whistleblower who had been an interrogator for the US military, a young man called Joshua Casteel, to this country to speak about his experience working in Abu Ghraib, where he exposed the shocking torture tactics that were employed by the US military, the CIA and contractors that they had brought in to torture people in Abu Ghraib. CACI International were involved in this. CACI International subsequently said that the people involved were no longer employed by it and so on but, for me, that certainly puts a very serious question mark over this company and its ethical standards. I would like to know whether it is involved in the census again. The fact that it was a UK subsidiary of CACI International was also used as an excuse, but it is wholly owned. It is the same company. I believe that in doing something as important as the census, we should have very ethical criteria and parameters when it comes to deciding what companies we would sub-contract to do work. I would like to hear reassurances from the Minister of State and from the CSO that this company is not being used again in the 2016 census. We should not give sucker, support or legitimacy in any way to companies that were implicated in torture in Iraq or anywhere else. I wish to make a point regarding EUROSTAT and the CSO. This is not to take away from the outstanding work the CSO does and some of the excellent reports, information and statistics that it provides. However, it is a mystery to me how the CSO concluded that Irish Water was going to pass the EUROSTAT market test while EUROSTAT decided otherwise. We need an explanation of what happened there. This is hugely important. It is at the centre of the dispute around Irish Water. It was referenced by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, yesterday, when he said that it was unprecedented that the CSO was at odds with EUROSTAT when the CSO was effectively the Irish subsidiary of the European statistical system. This all might seem very technical but there is a very important issue at stake at the centre of it. Who is right and who is wrong? The answer to that tells us who is telling the truth about the likely privatisation, or otherwise, of Irish Water. What EUROSTAT said was that the State subsidy to Irish Water was at such a level that it was not really a commercial entity and, therefore, could not borrow off the balance sheet. The whole rationale for setting up Irish Water was that it could borrow off the balance sheet. That is why we needed it so that it would not go on the books of the State in terms of our debt and deficit. However, EUROSTAT said this was not possible. The level of State subsidy required to provide the conservation grant and to put a cap on the charges was such that it was not a commercial entity and that it therefore had to go on the State balance sheet. Critically, therefore, if Irish Water is or was to continue, in order to pass the EUROSTAT test it would have to be privatised. It would have to increase the charges so that the revenue stream coming in from user charges would be higher while the level of State support, public ownership and control would have to be reduced.This is the argument we always made. Even if, for political reasons in the face of mass popular protests, the Government put in the conservation grant, a bribe, and claimed it was going to retain Irish Water in public ownership and put caps on charges, in reality those things would have to be got rid of two or three years down the line in order to pass the EUROSTAT test and to get it off balance sheet, and it would have to be privatised. That is the truth and EUROSTAT confirmed it. The Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, the Government and everybody else in the House knows that damn well. It could not pass the market test unless State support was removed and it was, effectively if not wholly, privatised with the charges being jacked up. Absolutely, the CSO has questions to answer. The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe, can shake his head all he likes but the people were fooled once on the issue of bin charges when we were told that introducing charges would not lead inevitably to privatisation as we predicted it would. Of course, it did. EU market rules were cited by private companies that demanded to get into the market, undermine the public system and force its privatisation. It was absolutely inevitable. Indeed, it is written into the EU treaties as anyone who wishes to read the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and its state aid rules can see. There is a question for the CSO as to how it was at odds with EUROSTAT and did not flag that fact. Its analysis of Irish Water seemed to comply with what was a political imperative for Fine Gael and the Labour Party to try to sell Irish Water to a very sceptical and oppositional public. My last point is on the use of statistics. Notwithstanding the criticism I have made, the CSO produces brilliant statistics but does anybody pay any attention to them? Does the Government pay any attention to these statistics? Clearly, it did not pay any attention to them when it came to demographic trends and housing need. We had that confirmed by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in documents recently publicised in the media which showed that the housing crisis we now have was eminently predictable. Anybody looking at the demographic trends, population growth and so on could have seen it coming. The failure to properly explain statistics often allows a certain trick to be played by Governments which say that, year on year, they have spent more than any other Government on housing, health and education without explaining that it is because the population is growing. It is not really more expenditure when one breaks it down across the number of people for whom that expenditure is being spent. Let us be honest, read the statistics, plan on the basis of the statistics and be honest about their significance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The British based writer and journalist, Richard Seymour, recently wrote an article about the refugee crisis entitled "When is a Tragedy a Massacre". In that article, with which I agree, he lays the blame for the massacre of human beings trying to get into Europe at the door of the European Union. That this is a massacre, let there be no doubt. Since 2000, 22,000 human beings - I agree with Deputy Eoghan Murphy that the people about whom we are speaking should not be called migrants or refugees - huge numbers of them children, have died while trying to get into Europe, some of them having drowned in the most awful of circumstances. Children trying to get into Europe have been washed up on beaches. Since 2013, approximately 8,000 people have died while trying to get into Europe. I keep repeating the phrase "trying to get into Europe" because we need to dwell on the significance of it. The reason people are dying is because they are trying to get into Europe and the European Union does not want to let them in. It is as simple as that. There would not be smugglers were it not for the fact that the European Union does not want to let people in. The European Union would rather risk children dying and families drowning than let them into Europe. Maintaining border control is more important to the European Union than ensuring that not one more child or family dies. That is the simple, cold, brutal fact.  I welcome that in this Parliament - possibly the only one in the whole of Europe - we do not have any filthy, nasty racists trying to exploit people's fears in regard to refugees but we need to go further if we are not to be seen to be simply cleansing our consciences. We must raise our voices and highlight that the policies of the European Union, of which Ireland is a member, are resulting in the needless death of thousands of human beings, many of them children. We must highlight that at every level the European Union and the so-called civilised western world has the blood of these people on its hands, not only in terms of their refusing to allow these people into Europe or trying to keep them out of Europe but in terms of their having contributed directly to the conditions which drove them from their homes in the first instance. We all know the countries from which the largest numbers of human beings are fleeing to Europe, namely, Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria. The European Union and the United States are responsible for the humanitarian crisis that is unfolding before our eyes. As a member of the European Union, Ireland is responsible, directly or indirectly, for this crisis. We have facilitated the US war machine in its continuing war in Afghanistan. We have put troops into Afghanistan, working with the NATO forces who have effectively destroyed Afghanistan. As an anti-war activist and somebody who has been campaigning against the Afghanistan war since it commenced in 2002 it came as a surprise to me to learn that the number of civilian deaths in Afghanistan was at its highest level last year and continues to increase. The situation there is worsening. The number of deaths attributable to the pro-Government forces, including NATO, increased by 42% last year. NATO and the political forces we are supporting, as well as the Taliban and ISIS which are reactionary, horrible political forces, are responsible for an increasing number of needless, brutal, innocent deaths, yet we say nothing about that. We do nothing about the fact that the troops that are responsible for this, that caused the war in Afghanistan and caused the situation there to worsen through the killing of innocent civilians, are passing through Shannon Airport every day. We also permitted that in relation to the Iraqi war. Anybody who is being honest knows that there is a direct line between the US war in Iraq and the crisis in Syria. It was obvious that when the infrastructure of Iraq was decimated in that war there would be a knock-on effect for Syria. It was predicted by everybody who opposed that war that it would destabilise Syria and so it did. ISIS would not exist but for the war in Iraq and we were complicit in that. It goes on and we continue to back a Government in Iraq that is ruthlessly sectarian and has deepened the divisions between Sunni and Shia who used to live happily side by side in the same towns and villages.As a direct result of the war and the political forces that the West backed in Iraq, we have turned it into a sectarian nightmare that has fuelled the growth of ISIS. That went on to spill over into Syria, another regime which was ruthlessly crushing the Syrian population and with which the governments of the likes of Germany, France and Russia sold arms and did business. We are responsible on every level. Others have mentioned Palestine. The ruthless oppression of Palestinian human rights, the brutal treatment of them, the successive assaults on Gaza, the rounding-up of people without trial, the destruction of people's homes, the occupation and the ethnic cleansing of Palestinian land; it just goes on. Yet we still treat Israel as if it is a normal state. We conduct normal diplomatic relations with these people. Would we let a known ISIS fighter into this country and welcome them? Of course we would not. Would we have normal diplomatic relations with ISIS? Of course we would not. We would be right not to. Why is it okay to have normal diplomatic relations with the Saudi regime, the Israeli regime and some of those other rotten regimes in the Gulf? Let me also mention the Egyptian regime. I do not have the time to read the report, but I want to mention the name of a socialist who has just been arrested in Egypt. He is a human rights lawyer caught up in the round-up of thousands of innocent people who were involved in the protests against the latest turn in Egyptian policy by the el-Sisi regime in which it is planning to sell off a series of Egyptian islands to the Saudi dictatorship. There are peaceful, civil protests going on and thousands of people are being rounded up, including a young lawyer named Haitham Mohamedain. I want to make a particular plea for our Government to speak out on his behalf. He has been arrested because he supposedly joined the Muslim Brotherhood. This man is a socialist and has nothing to do with religion. He is a civil rights lawyer but he was one of the organisers of peaceful protests that were taking place on the streets of Egypt in the last while. Along with hundreds of others who have been arrested in their beds, he has been locked up in prison and accused of trumped-up charges. Let us not forget the young Irishman Ibrahim Halawa who is also being treated like this. Why do we conduct normal relations with Egypt? Why are we selling them beef when this is what they are doing to their own people? Where is it going to lead? How long is it going to be before Egypt becomes a disaster and we have thousands of Egyptians fleeing Egypt across the Mediterranean and drowning in the Mediterranean Sea? To that we would say, "No, we are not letting you in. We cannot manage it. But we were quite happy to do business with the dictators that created the conditions which led you to flee in the first place." This hypocrisy has to stop. So many people who support the EU project do so because they believe that Europe is some sort of progressive place. They believe that it is about trying to end conflict and to not repeat the horrors of the 1930s, 1940s, Nazism and so on. Then we look at the reality and it is quite different. Fortress Europe is brutal and inhumanitarian and its policies are leading directly to wars and to the deaths of innocent people fleeing those desperate situations.
