RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is weak.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In addition to endorsing Deputy McDonald's comments, while it is reasonable to say the matter will be discussed here in the Dáil and that the Dáil takes precedence, the problem is that the structure of the debate is such that we will not be able to properly scrutinise the different items.  We should be able to ask questions about the specific carry-overs from particular Departments-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not if we just have a set-piece speech.  That is what we have - a set-piece speech.  There is no interaction.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government announced that the referendum on the Treaty on Stability, Co-ordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union will be held at the end of May.  Government spokespersons have on a number of occasions stated that if this treaty is not passed we will not be able to access-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking about the European Stability Mechanism legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister, Deputy Howlin, will be aware that that is not the case unless the relevant legislation is not passed by the Dáil.  Perhaps the Minister will tell us when the legislation on the European Stability Mechanism will come before the Dáil and can he assure us it will not come before the Dáil until after the referendum is passed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As mentioned by the Minister of State, this motion addresses what is primarily a technical issue to do with the carryover of unspent moneys.  I will discuss that point but, given the fact that he referred to the capital programme, I will make an equally brief comment.According to the Minister of State, the capital investment programme remains substantial at €17 billion, but it is important to state that the significant cuts in capital investment are particularly disastrous in the current economic climate.  Investment is desperately required, but these cuts come at a time when private sector sources of investment have collapsed.  As such, any cut in the capital programme is disproportionately damaging to the possibility of economic growth.A significant amount of money was poured into Europe's private banking system, supposedly in an effort to get banks lending to and investing in the economy.  According to announcements made this week, however, there has been no investment and the banks are hoarding money in the vaults of the European Central Bank, ECB.  This situation makes the cut in Ireland's public expenditure on capital investment all the more depressing and damaging.  We need a significant increase in that expenditure if we are to have any chance of restarting economic growth and returning people to work.As Deputies have stated, it is quite sensible that last year's unspent moneys be carried over as opposed to having them surrendered to the Central Fund.  I agree with the Minister of State that multi-annual budgeting makes sense.  Many projects roll over several years and restricting planning to an annual budget framework would be foolish.  That said, €114 million is a significant sum in the current economic climate.  As Deputies and public representatives, we must scrutinise how every cent and euro of public money is being spent or unspent if we are to know it is being spent well, efficiently and to maximum effect and advantage for the public and the economic and common good.In this context, it is a matter of concern that the only information we are given is a list of Departments and headings and a bald figure.There is no explanation for why the underspend occurred and, more specifically, the areas or projects affected.  There is no information in either the original note on the deferred surrender or in the Minister of State's speech on whether the money carried over will be spent under different headings and, if so, the original headings.  The Government owes it to the House and, more importantly, the public to explain fully the underspends, the headings under which the money will be spent and the reason for any changes that might have been made.As the biggest single issue facing the country is the employment crisis, it is critical that we spend money to maximum effect in creating jobs.  In that context I note that part of the €15.8 million carried over by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is to be spent on retrofitting.  Does this mean the retrofitting programme had an underspend last year or is the money being moved from elsewhere?  Targeted expenditure in this area could create tens of thousands of jobs and the measures could be self-financing in that the State would make significant savings in energy efficiency.  Is there a problem with investing in an expansion of the retrofitting programme?I cannot tell from the figures whether there was an underspend in micro-finance last year or if we are shifting money from other areas.  If there was an underspend in this area can the Minister of State explain the reason for it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I look forward to his explanation because the Government has spoken at length about the importance of this initiative and its potential for job creation.  It is odd that we have not spent the money allocated to this area.  The biggest figure is €26.9 million for agri-food and the rural economy.  This is an area in which we have the natural resources, ability and tradition to produce food to high standards.  We have the capacity to generate badly needed employment and revenue for the State.  I ask the Minister of State to explain why there is an underspend in this area and how the money will be spent this year to maximise the effect of investment.It appears from the lack of information on underspending and changes to the carry over for next year that the parties opposite changed their attitude after coming into government.  The points being now raised by Opposition Deputies are the same as those made by Fine Gael prior to the election.  In 2010, the current Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, stated in a debate on a previous deferred surrender to the Central Fund:With the greatest respect, if this is supposed to be an exercise in transparency I give it a poor D rating.  That we have been presented with a list of capital sums without any information as to the project concerned, the reason the projects were not delivered in the year in question, whether it was a question of cost overruns that are being carried forward, what projects have been lost, may fulfil some letter of some obscure law, but it does not shed any light on the efficiency, effectiveness or value of our capital programme.  It is pointless bringing us in here to approve a 10% carryover when we do not know any of the background as to the reason the projects were delayed or whether the projects delayed continue to be worth pursuing.Given that Fine Gael was critical of the previous Government's failure to provide adequate information on the use of public funds, one would have expected more transparency and information from it in Government so that we can properly scrutinise the figures and any changes that may have taken place.  Instead, however, we get the same limited list with insufficient information to allow a proper debate on the significance of the figures and the headings under which the money is to be spent.I ask the Minister of State to provide us with further information.  When carry overs and deferred surrenders are discussed in future I hope we are given adequate information on them.  While I welcome that the Minister of State will have five minutes to respond to our concerns there should be an opportunity for an exchange that would allow us to inquire about the various headings so we can fully scrutinise and understand the figures.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State is talking about bidders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister allow for statements?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is an issue of national importance meriting statements.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister or Taoiseach could indicate now-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This cannot go on.  Consider Jane Norman, Lagan Brick, Le Senza, Vita Cortex and now the 121 GAME workers.  That employers or administrators can chew workers up and spit them out is not acceptable and has gone on for too long.  We need Government action.  Where is the legislation to ensure that employers and administrators cannot treat workers in this way?  Where is the legislation to prevent a company that operates and makes profits in Ireland from hiding behind the fact that it is based in another jurisdiction and not discharging its responsibilities to its employees?  Will the Government state today that it will demand that PricewaterhouseCoopers treat the GAME workers properly and provide redundancy payments and entitlements?  Allowing this situation to continue would not be acceptable.I pay tribute to the occupying workers.  I encourage them to stay in occupation, as it is their only leverage to demand justice.  The Government cannot cry crocodile tears.  It must introduce legislation to prevent a similar situation from recurring and it must exert pressure on the administrators.All of these cases show that austerity is destroying demand and our domestic economy and massacring jobs.  They should give the Government pause to consider investing in the economy to end the jobs massacre instead of making us prey to employers and multinationals who treat workers like dirt in this way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is running out of excuses for not acting on this issue.  It could hide behind the law the first time it arose but this is the fourth or fifth incident in the last six months.  Game's workers want to know what the Government intends to do about their immediate plight in terms of putting pressure on the administrators and assuring them that their applications for statutory redundancy will be fast-tracked.  I spoke to one individual who has worked for Game for 20 years.  During all those years this individual has been producing profits for Game, which can walk away after sucking profits out of its workers.  It is possible that, as in the case of Jane Norman, the stores will reopen after being sold off and these workers will be left with nothing?  What is the Government going to do about it, in the immediate term and more generally?
