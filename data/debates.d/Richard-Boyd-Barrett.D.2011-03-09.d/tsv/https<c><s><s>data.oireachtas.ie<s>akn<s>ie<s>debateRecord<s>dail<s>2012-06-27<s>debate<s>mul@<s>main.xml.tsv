RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----yet the Taoiseach's Government has continued this disastrous policy at a terrible cost to ordinary citizens who have lost their jobs and seen their incomes and services butchered. The Taoiseach has extended that policy by continuing to pay off unsecured and unguaranteed bondholders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yet no matter how much the Taoiseach grovels to the troika and to Angela Merkel she snubs her nose at us and insists that we take more pain and now she wants to do the same to Spain and Italy. Yet against this background this week the Taoiseach's Government is in the process of paying over €1 billion to Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide bondholders. Is not the equation in terms of this transaction very simple and very cruel? Somewhere in the Mediterranean or the Caribbean a multimillionaire speculator will be cracking open a bottle champagne to celebrate his profits bonanza and the stupidity of the Irish Government-----

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why does the Taoiseach not save these vulnerable people more suffering by refusing to enrich the multimillionaire speculators in Anglo Irish Bank bonds and go to the European Council and tell Angela Merkel that we have had enough-----

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I understand the Taoiseach correctly, what he is saying is that maintaining our good reputation with some multimillionaire on a yacht who is celebrating tonight his good fortune-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----over the decision to pay back bonds is more important than the future of children with intellectual disabilities------

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what the Taoiseach is saying.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Today and tomorrow the Taoiseach intends to pay €0.5 billion back to these bondholders in order that our reputation is good with them. Is that what the Taoiseach is saying?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of course, the bondholders must love us; Angela Merkel must absolutely adore the Taoiseach at this stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is our reputation with those people more important than the future of vulnerable citizens and children and ordinary people in this country who are being crucified with the cuts that are having to be made in order to repay these speculators-----

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last week, I raised with the Tánaiste the deepening crisis as a result of cuts in the rent allowance, which has seen more families being made homeless or threatened with homelessness. In that context, when will we discuss the housing Bill on the legislative programme? Despite asking several times, we have been given no specific timeline for when that Bill will be discussed. Given the serious crisis of homelessness or threatened homelessness for thousands of families across the country-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----can the Taoiseach say when the Bill will be introduced? Can he accelerate the process so we get a chance to discuss this most serious issue?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill. I am pleased that the Government and Deputies on all sides of the House have made it clear in recent weeks and months that there is an urgent need to do something about this issue. In light of the horrific revelations that have emanated from the Ferns, Ryan, Murphy and Cloyne reports in recent years - and most recently the report on the deaths of children who were in contact with the social services - it is long overdue for a way of protecting children from such horrors and abuses to be put in place. This Bill, which compels people to report arrestable offences to the Garda Síochána, is to be welcomed in that context. Essentially, it will criminalise the withholding of information on offences that have been committed against children or vulnerable people. While that is to be welcomed, we need to do a little more than simply making it a crime not to report knowledge or suspicion of such offences. There needs to be a link between our efforts in this regard and the whole question of the welfare of the child. The HSE website states that a person who is aware of a case of child abuse or neglect needs to report it to the HSE's child and family services. If this Bill is passed, will such a person be required to make that report to the Garda Síochána? Such a report would not be enough because it would focus on penalising the offender without doing anything to uphold the obligation on the social services of the State to take action to protect the child in question. It is clear that offenders need to be reported but the stated aim of this Bill is to protect children and vulnerable adults from serious offences. The reporting of perpetrators really only does half of that job. Where is the Children First Bill? The initial Children First guidelines were published in 1999. We need legislation to be passed to ensure the very good recommendations in Children First are put on a statutory footing. That should lead to the real implementation of the Children First guidelines. It is crucial that our efforts to protect children have this sort of legislative back-up. The big question is what will be done when a problem is reported. How will children or vulnerable people who are at risk, or who are victims of abuse be assisted? If resources are not available to offer real support to vulnerable or abused children, all the legislation in the world will not really solve the problem. That brings us to the issue of cutbacks in front line services like social work, psychiatry and psychological assessment. All sorts of cuts are affecting the provision of such services. In that context, it is important to note what the Children First guidelines have to say on the issue of neglect:Neglect can be defined in terms of an omission, where the child suffers significant harm or impairment of development by being deprived of food, clothing, warmth, hygiene, intellectual stimulation, supervision and safety, attachment to and affection from adults, and/or medical care.Carers, family members and even individuals can be guilty of neglect. Surely, by that definition, this Government is guilty of such neglect. The imposing of caps on special needs assistants, their removal from many schools throughout the country, leaving some of our most vulnerable without the necessary support, is surely an instance of neglect, whereby the State should be-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am well aware of that but the problem is we also have more children than at any time in the history of the State. There are 10,000 extra children entering the primary school system every year. In absolute terms, the question is not about how many SNAs we have; it is about the ratio of SNAs to the number of children in the education system, specifically to the number of children with special needs, a number that is increasing. The fact is, by imposing caps the Government is reducing the level of support provided to the most vulnerable children. That is neglect, and if we are serious about protecting children that level of neglect should be criminalised. Similarly, there is the removal or threatened removal of measures such as the domiciliary care allowance, again for parents of children with special needs, disabilities and so on. This is an instance of State neglect. Is the Government going to held legally responsible for that level of neglect, which is being inflicted on some of our most vulnerable children? There are the cuts imposed on disadvantaged schools and the cutbacks to front-line services. Some child mental health services are seeing only emergency cases and are turning away everything else. Waiting lists for speech and language therapy are extremely long; the availability of psychologists to do assessments is woefully inadequate. One of the parents involved in the DCA Warriors protest outside the Dáil the other day told me there are now no psychologists in County Cavan to provide assessments for children with special needs. That sort of situation is being replicated all over the State. As I pointed out to the Tánaiste in the Dáil the other day, if we are serious when we talk about protection for children and preventing neglect and abuse, the most obvious obligation the State has is to provide housing, a roof to go over the heads of children that is of decent quality and secure. The State is failing abysmally in that. I do not know whether studies have been done on it but I would bet my bottom dollar that if one looks at the most vulnerable children, the victims of abuse and neglect, who have ended up in various institutions, there will be a correlation between that and coming from poor and inadequate housing conditions, housing insecurity, and so on. That is blatantly obvious. Yet the way in which the State is failing in its obligation to provide housing for some of the least well-off families and their children is getting worse by the day. Every week the cuts in rent caps are forcing dozens of families with young children into homelessness. Is that not neglect on the part of the State? Is it not a recipe to ensure that in certain cases those families will break down and the children involved will end up in very vulnerable situations where they could be victims of neglect and abuse?  That is a major failure of the State. I want to know whether, if this Bill is passed, the State will be guilty of a crime if it fails to provide the necessary supports, protections, resources and services for all our children, but particularly for our most vulnerable children, those with special needs, disabilities and from poor backgrounds. The State should be liable for those sorts of failures. Will it be a crime for us in this House, or for members of the public, not to report the Government for its criminal negligence when it comes to the protection of our children? One must wonder whether the raft of legislation coming through, all, on the face of it, formally and nominally good, all heading in the right direction and well-intentioned, is not just window dressing if we do not actually provide the resources and services required. The policy in regard to the provision of those resources and services, housing, psychological assessment, all the things that would protect children, is that they are being systematically cut and will be cut again in the budget of December and the one after it. I ask the Minister and the Government to be consistent. This Bill is fine, as far as it goes. I would like to see the Children First Bill introduced as well but it will mean very little unless it is backed up with the resources and services our children, our most vulnerable citizens, require in order to be genuinely protected.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We could start by not paying the-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We could get ten special needs assistants from the salary of the head of the VHI.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the opportunity to debate the vital importance of arts, culture and our heritage. Arts and culture are not optional extras and should not be measured by financial or economic metrics. It is not too grandiose to say that arts, culture and heritage are what make us human and define us as creative beings. They are what separate us from every other species on the planet. Treating arts and cultural institutions like just another quango or as just an opportunity to cut costs, threatens the essence of what we are as human beings and is misguided. This is even more true at a time of recession. It may be of interest to the Minister to know that the first theatres in ancient Greece began in healing centres and it was from this that we got the term "catharsis". Theatre was about therapeutic healing and it was from that theatre developed. Never has that role been more important and necessary than now when we are faced with a huge economic recession. This recession resulted from straying away from human priorities and focusing purely on economic and financial interests. This has led us to the current impasse. Faced with this situation, there has been a significant return to the arts. More people are visiting galleries and museums and more people are getting involved in poetry and visiting the theatre. Therefore, the last thing we should be doing is making cuts in the culture area or to cultural institutions. This error is repeated in the Government's motion, in that all the language is the language of corporate and commercial speak, such as "customer service", "service delivery channels", "reducing our costs", "better value for money" and "implementation and delivery". That is not the language we should use to talk about the arts, culture and heritage. They are not about those things, nor should they be. It is a tragedy that we ever have to charge for access to the arts, culture or heritage. With regard to the institutions the Minister proposes to merge for cost-cutting purposes - treating them like quangos - access to them is free. Therefore, the proposal to merge them on the basis of achieving short-term cuts is a grave error. As somebody said in a meeting on this issue yesterday, it is like saying we should merge the FAI, the IRFU and the GAA, because they are all sports that use a ball. Of course, they are distinct sports and should not be treated and lumped in together as if they are the same on the basis of cost-cutting. These proposals are more galling because all of this cost-cutting is being done to bail out bankers. I will finish by citing the poet Bertolt Brecht who said the crime of robbing a bank was nothing compared to the crime of owning one. He was right. It is a tragedy that our society, our arts, culture and heritage should face cuts in order to bail out the bankers and bondholders who brought our country and Europe to the sorry pass it is in now.
