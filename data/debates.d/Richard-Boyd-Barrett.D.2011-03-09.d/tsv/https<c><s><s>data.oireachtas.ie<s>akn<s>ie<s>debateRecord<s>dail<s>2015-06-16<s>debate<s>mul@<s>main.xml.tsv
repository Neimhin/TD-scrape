RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The reason we are asking the Taoiseach about the frequency of the meetings of the Cabinet sub-committee on housing and mortgage arrears is because this is the most serious crisis facing our citizens and the entire economy. However, there seems to be no sense of urgency from the top of Government as to how bad the situation is. It is no exaggeration to say we are at the edge of and heading right into the eye of a storm that will rip apart the lives of tens of thousands of families and children and now represents a serious threat to the economy as a whole. Today, the Central Bank produced a report which states the rise in property and rental prices across the whole commercial and property sectors is a major domestic threat to the economy, probably the major domestic threat. At a human level, the situation is beyond appalling. I am not exaggerating when I say that every day and week a trail of families relate heart-breaking family stories in my clinic, and I know the situation is the same for other Deputies. The stories go on and on and it is evident from them that the crisis is reaching further and deeper into society. Every spectrum of society is affected. Students have to share accommodation with strangers because they cannot get accommodation. Families and children are being evicted because landlords are seeking higher rents and now dozens and hundreds of them face homelessness. We are moving towards a situation where thousands of people face the same fate. The situation is disastrous and getting worse. The Government is not even scratching the surface in terms of its response. I do not have time to go into the figures, but as I have pointed out on a number of occasions to the Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, who is sitting beside the Taoiseach, the targets are a mirage and will not materialise, because the Government hopes to get 80% of the social housing it proposes to deliver this year from the private sector. That is not going to happen. Figures released this week show there are 10,000 extra families a month seeking private rented accommodation. These are people who are working, but even on average wages, they have extreme difficulty sourcing affordable accommodation. They cannot buy and are completely crowding out anybody on a low income or who is social welfare dependant.  Therefore, the idea that local authorities will source the necessary social accommodation from private landlords or developers is fantasy. Any serious look at the figures makes this clear. The target for 2015 is 15,800 units. Some 8,400 of these are due to come through HAPs to private landlords, some 3,000 are to come through leasing from private landlords and some 2,000 are to come through RAS, again through private landlords. Therefore, we are not delivering social housing. We are not delivering council housing. We are hoping against hope that we will get the housing from private landlords, when all of the evidence shows that private landlords are moving away from people on low incomes who are dependent on rent allowance and social welfare. The private landlords are looking for high prices, which are unaffordable, even for people on medium earnings. A three bedroom apartment in south Dublin now rents for from €1,500 to €1,800. The average net after tax income for a worker is approximately €2,400 per month. Therefore, people are expected to pay two thirds of their income to put a roof over their head, leaving them with very little to pay the rest of their bills. This is the case for people on the average income, €35,000 a year. Imagine what it is like for somebody who is social welfare dependent, dependent on rent allowance or for someone on a low income or working in Dunnes Stores. Paying such a rent is not possible. The purpose of our questions is to appeal to the Government to get into emergency mode on this issue. As the Taoiseach rightly said, bricks and mortar must follow. At this point, this must be done by the State. Otherwise, we will not even get close to the targets. If the Government depends on the private sector, it will not happen.  Rent control must be introduced as a matter of urgency. Based on the figures of 10,000 extra people moving into the private rented sector and the chronic shortage of accommodation, one does not need to be Einstein to work out that rents will continue to rocket. They have already risen by 20%. We will face a catastrophe in six months' time. Rent controls, not rent certainty, must be introduced now so that rents will be related to the ability of people to pay them. If the Government does not introduce rent control, it is consigning people directly into homelessness. I appeal to the Taoiseach to get into emergency mode. We did it for the liquidation of IBRC. I plead with him to do it for the most urgent social crisis facing the State.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not know where to start given the mess we are in. Unless we grasp how bad the situation is, we cannot even judge the legislation in any meaningful way. We must grasp the scale of the problem we face and the absolute certainty that if things remain the same, the situation will be much worse next year and in the coming years. Nothing in the legislation or in what the Government has announced in the past year, since it finally admitted there is a crisis, will address the fact that the situation will be worse in a year's time and even worse still in four or five years’ time. That seems difficult to imagine when one considers how bad the situation is now, even with all the Government’s trumpeting of the great plans, proposals and new legislation in the past year or so. I do not know where to start, but let me outline a few facts which bear out what I have said. There are 96,000 people on the housing list. In 2008 a total of 4,900 council houses were built. In 2013 the total number of council houses built was 293. The year 2008 was a disaster in terms of social housing. The lists were getting longer and had been getting longer in the years prior to 2008. Even when we had a boom in the construction industry and record levels of private sector construction, the housing lists were getting longer and longer. That puts to bed the utterly insane notion behind this Bill, namely, that if we stimulate, induce, cajole or bribe the private developers to build again, that it will solve the problem. It will not. How do we know that? We know that because it did not solve the problem during the greatest private sector construction boom in the history of the State. The housing crisis got worse during that time.Prices increased, rents increased, housing lists got longer and the number of homeless people increased. The legislation is built on a fundamentally misguided notion that stimulating the private sector will solve the problem. Sorry, it will not even begin to. The Government is asking people who built houses to make profits to provide housing for people who do not have enough money to make profits for private landlords or developers. This is the point of social and affordable housing. They do not have the money to make someone in the private sector rich. They need subsidised housing, given that their income is not sufficient to make some landlord or developer a profit. If the Minister of State is asking the same landlords and developers to deal with a crisis in which hundreds of thousands of families do not have enough income to put a roof over their heads by buying it or by paying inflated private sector rents which have gone through the stratosphere, he is deluding himself. It is absolute and utter nonsense. I slightly disagree with Deputy Stanley's argument that the Part V affordable and social housing scheme worked for us. It did not work. The affordable housing scheme was a disaster. Given that people who bought so-called affordable housing ended up in negative equity after the crash, it turned out not to be affordable at all. It was a massive albatross around their necks. The Part V scheme did not deliver anything like enough housing to make any impact on lists that continued to grow longer. It was estimated that we needed 18,000 housing units per year between 2011 and 2021. Given that we are already four years behind on this target, we need approximately 30,000 units per year to make any impact on an absolute disaster. In Dublin, 8,000 houses have been needed per year since 2011, whereas only 1,360 were delivered in 2013. Figures that came out this week showed that 10,000 extra people per month are entering the private rented sector. The numbers of people in private rented accommodation have doubled since 2013, which means people on higher incomes are crowding out those on lower incomes in so far as some of them can afford the inflated prices. A catastrophe is unfolding. How will we address it? Given that the private sector did not address the housing problem during the boom period, the idea that it will do it now, when banks are afraid to lend money and the developers are interested only in making profits, is nonsense. The Government, in the Bill, is attempting to induce the landlords and developers further by cutting down the obligation to provide social housing. Even during the boom they fought to get out of their obligations by giving over cash and even argued about the amount of cash and housing and where they would give it. They fought it at every hand's turn, and our answer is to get down on our knees even further by reducing their obligation to deliver social housing. There will be very concrete consequences. In my area, there is a second phase of a NAMA development in which the same private developers who got us into the mess are back running it under the auspices of NAMA. Under the legislation, in a situation in which our housing list is growing by 1,200 per year, a development will happen in which we would have got 20% but will now get only 10%. The development contribution the developers must give to the council will be reduced. The very developers who got us into the mess will be put back in business and what they will deliver in terms of a social dividend for social housing for the huge numbers on the list will be even less and the contribution in development levies will be less. It is a flipping disgrace. There is constant pandering to and reliance on the private sector. The Clerys debacle is linked to this. The person who has just bought Clerys was in NAMA. I refer to Deirdre Foley of D2 Private. D2 Private was given a massive write-down on money it owed to NAMA, and the same people have been resurrected and have managed to scrabble together money to buy Clerys and put all those workers, some of whom had been there for 30 or 40 years, out of work. This is urban regeneration. People whose massive loans were discounted by NAMA – in other words by the public – are back in business, have bought Clerys and workers have been shoved out the door with nothing. We need a major emergency, State-led housing programme and we need the State to build tens of thousands of houses. We cannot hope or wait for the private sector to do it. It will not, no matter how much the Minister tries to induce it. This means we must get the capital investment to do it. It is a priority. Even today’s macro-financial review by the Central Bank says rising rents and property prices and what is happening in the residential and commercial property sectors constitute a major macroeconomic domestic threat to the entire economy. If we cannot house people, the economy cannot function. The cost for families, children, the economy and the future is dire. I am sorry to say it, and I wish I could say otherwise, but the Bill is rubbish. It is the sort of rubbish that got us into the mess before and we need to shift policy radically towards a State-led emergency public housing programme and the immediate introduction of rent controls.
