RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is important to highlight the fact that the proposals for the Order of Business were changed an hour or two ago from those we had originally received. The changes relate to a correct decision made by the Government which had been prompted by a telephone call made by me to the Chief Whip’s office, about an original proposal to have a European directive on country by country reporting on corporate tax requirements transposed into Irish law and the decision by the Standing Order 112 Select Committee on subsidiarity for the Dáil to vote on it today without debate. This is an important matter to do with dealing with corporate tax evasion and a recommendation of the select committee that we not debate it. I am glad that the Government conceded, on foot of the representations made by me, to a debate on it tomorrow. However, the House needs to know that this important issue was not going to be debated. Everyone needs to understand how significant it is because we are dealing with the controversial and significant issue of country-by-country reporting and attempts by the European Commission to deal with corporate tax evasion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is welcome that it has. However, it was only because representations had been made. Deputies need to know that a subject of great significance will be decided on by the Dáil tomorrow.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, a Cheann Comhairle, I believe you are right with the original proposal. If we are to manage the time, people will have to be brief.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Back and forth-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Almost everything that comes into my clinic every week involves housing. No matter how much talk we hear from the Government or how many announcements, of which there are many, are made, it just gets worse. This week, I had a woman come into me who had a stroke three years ago, is partially paralysed, suffered a septic aneurysm and septicaemia recently, has epilepsy and is deaf in one ear. Her husband is her carer and they have been living in a car for the last four months. Another case involves a woman with mental health difficulties going to Cluain Mhuire. Her child has been put into care with her mother in order that she would be able to get on the single-persons emergency housing list. She lives in Dún Laoghaire and is told she has to accept a hostel in town, away from her family support network, or find HAPS. Both of these people, and they are just two examples, have no chance of getting HAPS - none, zero. We put a proposal to the local authority that it would set up a specific team to support people like this in finding HAPS, which they cannot find. The CEO of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown just said "I am not doing it, full stop", even though a motion had been passed. Why not? If one believes in HAPS, the least one could do is ensure that teams are put in place to go out and find HAPS for people like that instead of them having to live in cars. I ask for that to happen. Even if one does that, the average rent for a three-bedroom house in Dún Laoghaire is now €2,200 a month. Even with the flexibility the Government is providing on HAPS, it is nowhere near enough. Forget it. There is no chance that HAPS is going to work. Of the 110,000 housing units the Government proposes to deliver, 75,000 are HAPS. It is not going to happen in Dún Laoghaire at all. That fantasy has to be dispelled with. I appeal to the Taoiseach in that regard because I will not even say what one might as well tell someone who is sick, old, disabled or paralysed as to tell him or her to go out and find HAPS. It is a nightmare that the Government is offering such people. How is the Taoiseach going to get rents down from €2,200 if he is depending on the private sector? It is twice the cost of an average mortgage that people are being asked to pay. It is not just a question of rent certainty. We must go further than Sinn Féin's proposal. There must be rent control that is linked to affordability. This is impossible.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking the Minister that and I am also asking for the following basic thing. People who are in the absolutely desperate situations I have described must get every support and resource and the staffing necessary to deliver for them within the local authorities. They must have help to find something dignified rather than to just be thrown to the wolves and told to go out and find something themselves.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They have been in a car for four months but she has been very ill for the last three months and in a housing crisis for the last three years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister will be aware that, for some years now, I have been questioning the policies, status, governance and operations of Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company. I note that, at the weekend, the Minister spoke out, as he has tended to do over the years, against quangos and on his determination to deal with the quangos under his remit. Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company is a quango, and a choice will be made soon as to whether it will continue to be a quango or whether it will be dissolved. In so far as the Minister has influence on this decision, who is the Minister going to meet? Is he going to meet just the board and council officials, or will he meet stakeholder groups and public representatives in order to try to move towards the dissolution of this quango and bring the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company under democratic public control?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the positive response about meeting people. I am concerned the decision about the future governance of the harbour is, according to the Minister's scripted response, a decision between the existing harbour company executive and the council executive. This is not good enough because on all of the major issues, whether it is cruise berths, executive salaries of crazy amounts, such as €160,000 for the CEO, and other plans, the harbour company and the council have alienated and are at odds with wider public opinion, harbour users and stakeholders. The Minister should meet not just the harbour company, which will want to save its own skin and save the quango, or the council officials, but also meet the real stakeholders and public representatives so that their voices are heard. The Minister will find their view of how the harbour should be run and what its priorities, policies and future plans should be are at radical odds with what the harbour company executives and the full-time officials of the council think should be the case. I ask the Minister to meet a different group of genuine public stakeholders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I attended the public meeting organised by the parents of 162 children in St. Augustine's special school two weeks ago. It was an incredibly emotional, distressing and angry meeting of parents of children with mild and moderate intellectual disabilities who, incredibly, had letters put into their schoolbags by St. John of God telling them the vocational services that are the critical component of this special school are to be removed completely over the next three years, starting in the summer and in September. The services are to be phased out. There are 27 members of staff providing services that give meaning to the commitment in the programme for Government to give support to young people with disabilities in gaining access to independent living and education and in having an equal opportunity in life. The removal of the services is unconscionable. The reason almost all the parents had sent their children to St. Augustine's is precisely because of the vocational services that were provided there, which included all sorts of training for life supports and programmes. Staff included speech and language therapists, psychologists and social workers. All of these services are to go and families are absolutely devastated. We cannot get a straight answer from St. John of God. I want to know the extent to which this is the decision of the HSE or St. John of God. Whichever it is, it is absolutely unacceptable and has to be reversed. It will damage the future prospects of a vulnerable group of children, in direct contradiction of the Government’s commitment to increase support, particularly for young people, and to give them a chance so they will not have to depend on adult services. All the parents testify to the fact that the children are flourishing in the school.If the cuts are not reversed, the children will be knocked back and into further dependency on adult services and their life chances undermined and ruined.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While I welcome the Minister of State's willingness to meet the affected parents, the reply is the same bureaucratic answer we are getting from St. John of God community services. Special needs assistants are not a replacement for residential services. The whole point of the school was that it provided vocational supports, which are not provided by special needs assistants who provide support with the mainstream academic curriculum. That is not the point of St. Augustine's special school. All of the parents stated in the strongest possible terms that the reason they sent their children to the school was its vocational aspect, in other words, the training for life provided by the staff employed by the Health Service Executive, as opposed to staff employed by the Department. The parents want this service retained. They have been robbed of the basis on which they sent their children to the school. All of them made it clear that their children would have been eaten up - that is how they put it - in mainstream school, whereas they were flourishing in St. Augustine's special school. It is not acceptable that all of the things that have helped them to flourish and are giving them the opportunity to participate equally in life will be lost under the plan. I hate the word "streamlining" because it is always a euphemism for cutting and scaling down rather than scaling up. Any badly needed improvement in other services in Dún Laoghaire should not be made at the expense of vulnerable children in St. Augustine's special school. New services must be additional and not result in services being taken away from young children in the school.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be opposing this motion. Let us state it boldly as it is: the war on drugs has failed and the war on gangland criminality via the Special Criminal Court or other repressive legislation has failed. We are just as concerned as the Minister and, in many cases I suspect, more concerned in that some of the Deputies on the left represent some of the poorest and most disadvantaged areas where the problems of drugs and gangland crime are felt most acutely. We do not believe that increasing or retaining very repressive powers for the State - which include eliminating the use of jury trial or extraordinary powers in terms of the right to detain people, to infer guilt and so on, which go beyond the normal process of justice - are justified or effective. They have not been to date and there is no reason and no evidence to suggest they will be in the future. Mark Kelly of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties rightly described how "some electioneering politicians" were using the Regency attack as a "political football", and that is what is going on. We are all appalled by the gangland killings that we have seen recently and we are all acutely concerned for the communities, the families, the areas and so on that are affected by these problems and terrified by them and by the deeper, underlying problems of drug addiction, disadvantage, deprivation and so on that fuel this kind of gangland activity. However, none of this will deal with the problem. It has not in the past and there has been no serious evidence provided by the Government, even though it supports the retention of these powers, that it has done so because no such evidence exists. If we are serious, therefore, and if we are going to move beyond political posturing or, as Mark Kelly said, "electioneering", then we need to recognise that a radical departure in policy is necessary. To me it is blindingly obvious. The Mafia in the United States was created by the prohibition of alcohol. The Mafia came from the misguided belief that prohibiting the sale and consumption of alcohol would eradicate it, and it did not. Instead it produced a massive criminal network which continues to dog the United States to the present day, and eventually in the United States they realised prohibition was not the way forward. That does not mean advocating excessive alcohol use or believing alcohol is a wonderful thing or not recognising that alcohol addiction and all the problems that come from it are a major problem. However, there was a final recognition that trying to ban it did not work and made the problem worse, and that is exactly the situation with drugs. There is no question about it. I am not even sure if hippies believe that drug use is a great thing. Nobody believes that. Trying to ban it, however, and driving it underground and into criminal networks has failed and has produced a worse problem in terms of the criminal networks that it has spawned and the gangland violence that is associated with it, so we need a bit of political courage and political honesty to say we need to move away from that failed policy. Similarly, the only argument that is put forward for the Special Criminal Court is the intimidation of juries, and that is a serious issue.Across the world, there are plenty of examples of how we can retain jury courts, which are a hallmark and benchmark of the most advanced form of justice we have. To disregard it is very dangerous while there are other ways to retain jury courts which can safeguard the safety of juries. This is the road we must take and it is why we oppose the motion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also support the Bill, although, as Deputy Coppinger said, we need to go a hell of a lot further and we need to do it very fast. I do not understand the reticence being expressed by the Government and Fianna Fáil about the committee and so on. If this can roll in to highlight the issue, further indicate the urgency of it and roll into any good that comes out - I certainly hope something good comes out on Thursday - that is all to the good. However, it seems this is a minimal measure against which it is impossible to argue. I do not see what the problem is. In any event, after Second Stage it will go to further Stages after Thursday and we can discuss it there. I say now to our Sinn Féin comrades that we need to go a hell of a lot further on rent, because this will not deal with the fact that rents are already out of control and need to be scaled back. We need models such as the Scottish model whereby something like a beefed-up PRTB goes into a place and specifies that a landlord cannot charge more than €1,100 for a specific dwelling. The Minister and Fianna Fáil keep referring to the market. The market has failed. Markets cannot be allowed to set rents. This model has failed. It is not a theoretical discussion any more, one that we can debate in university debating chambers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just telling the Minister that he has to reach the point at which he acknowledges that the market cannot be allowed to set rents, because the market is setting rents that are absolutely unaffordable for the vast majority of people. If there is no recognition of that, we are going nowhere. The situation is worse. The first time I brought homeless people to the Dáil was in 2012. I brought in about ten or 15 families. I warned then there was a crisis and the then Government laughed at me because, at that time, for a very brief period, rents were decreasing, as were property prices. I warned then - because in Dún Laoghaire they did not go down - that they were going back up everywhere and that there would be a crisis in a year or two. I was laughed at by the former Minister, Mr. Pat Rabbitte, and others. In Dún Laoghaire now it is disastrous. Rents for a three-bedroom house are €2,200 on average. That has nearly doubled in the past two years. The HAP scheme is a write-off - it will not happen in Dún Laoghaire. Unless we ratchet up the provision of social housing and scale back rents to affordable levels that are related to people's income, we are going nowhere. Even the most cursory examination of the situation in parts of this city would tell the Minister that. He needs to get with reality. The Minister needs to stop with the mantra of the market. I do not know what this obsession is. The Minister is still referring to the 75,000 units he will deliver through the HAP scheme. It will not happen. I also hear ideological claptrap that supply will solve the problem. Does anybody's memory stretch back even to 2006 and 2007? We had supply to beat the band. Did it make rents affordable or property prices affordable? No. Supply does not bring rent down and it does not bring property prices down. We know that from 2006, 2007 and 2008. It did not do it. We had the biggest level of supply in the history of the State, and rent and property prices went up because the people who were building them were interested in profit and the market was setting the rate. So even if the supply is increased via the private for-profit sector, I guarantee it will not solve the problem. Without controlled and subsidised low rents and housing, including affordable housing - I heard mention of the squeezed middle - we will not solve the problem. We should support any measure that moves us in that direction, but we need to go a lot further.
