RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach may have noted that Prime Minister Trudeau's Canada has today decriminalised cannabis and that follows the fact that in Canada, cannabis for medicinal use was previously decriminalised. In light of the Taoiseach's great admiration for Canada and all things Canadian, might that prompt him to stop trying to sabotage Deputy Gino Kenny's medicinal cannabis Bill which is being buried by his Government in what I think is cynical game playing with completely inaccurate references to it being poor legislation-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is relevant to the discussions that were had with Prime Minister Trudeau and whether we might learn something from Canada in its attitude towards the issue of cannabis and specifically medicinal cannabis given that there are thousands of people out there suffering from pain and other conditions who could benefit from it. His Government has cynically tried to bury that Bill rather than progress it and accept the amendments that Deputy Gino Kenny has proposed to deal with some of the so-called concerns that have been raised.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked the Taoiseach if he talked to Prime Minister Trudeau about it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome expanding diplomatic trade and cultural links with countries around the world. Undoubtedly, that is a good thing to do in an increasingly globalised world, especially in a world where people like Donald Trump are trying to dig people back into nasty little nationalist trenches. In tandem with those links, our reputation is important. I heard the discussion earlier about Trump and I welcome the criticisms of the barbaric treatment of young children being separated from their parents. Some 12,000 of these children are now encaged in the most horrific conditions. The Taoiseach did not answer Deputy Coppinger's question about whether he considers this as a line that has been crossed or action that goes too far. She asked whether the Taoiseach should withdraw the invitation of the Government to Donald Trump to come to this country if we want to improve our international reputation. Reference was made to our humanitarian reputation and our reputation for humanitarian values. Is it not time to make a firm statement that Donald Trump is not welcome in this country and will not be invited to put his footprint, to use that term, in this country while thousands of children are encaged in a most barbaric fashion, separated from their parents and criminalised for simply being migrants?
