RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yesterday, the Taoiseach received a stinging rebuke from the trade unionists of this country to his pay proposals. Lo and behold, today the Taoiseach seeks to ram through the Dáil what appears to be a pre-emptive strike to cast in stone, before any negotiations or reflections, his agenda for imposing pay cuts on public sector workers. Any Revised Estimates that have a bearing on the discussions that may take place regarding public sector pay should be fully debated and scrutinised in this House. This appears to be a sleight of hand and pre-emptive strike to get us to rubber stamp something that should be fully debated and, most importantly, negotiated with the public sector workers of this country. I absolutely oppose the attempt to push this through.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We debated this matter at length on Committee Stage. I restate my opposition to what the Minister is doing. There is no reason to change something that has worked well. Gambling is not something I endorse or promote. When the lottery was first introduced, many of us were concerned about the State's involvement in promoting gambling, but at least it was controlled and the proceeds of the national lottery have gone towards funding many good causes. If there is going to be gambling in society, and we probably cannot do much to prevent that, most people believe that it should be done in a controlled way and that the proceeds should go towards society and good causes so that sports, the arts and so on might benefit. Moving the national lottery further away from direct public control to a more privatised model, with the likelihood being that private companies, quite possibly foreign, will seek the contract to run it, is a retrograde development. The only carrot that the Government has used to package its proposal is the idea that this move would be used to finance the children's hospital. We all want that to be financed. As stated on Committee Stage though, there is no reason that an element of the funds currently intended for good causes on an annual basis could not be ring-fenced to fund the children's hospital without the necessity of a privatised national lottery, one that would begin to focus more on making profits and expanding online gambling as well as the entire lottery compared with its currently controlled form. I do not see the necessity behind this move. We can have a children's hospital and retain the national lottery's current model. Will the Minister reconsider his proposals under this legislation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The fact the Minister is setting up an office of regulator really is the giveaway that the Government is going for privatisation of the lottery. His line on this legislation and on this new development in terms of the lottery is that not a great deal is changing except that the State will get money up-front for the children's hospital but the setting up of the office of the regulator belies that fact. The Minister needs a regulator because he is letting off the leash the lottery, and potentially gambling, previously controlled by the Minister and operated by a semi-State company controlled by the State, and putting it very likely into the hands of private for-profit companies. If not much was changing, the Minister simply would not need a regulator. I support the amendment in the same context as I oppose the entire move and the Bill itself. The history of regulators is not a good one. That is linked to the fact that regulators seem to be set up precisely when we are letting important sectors of the economy off the leash and they have failed, time and again, to control the sectors that they are supposed to control. The most obvious example is the Financial Regulator's abysmal failure to control the banking and financial sector with devastating consequences for the economy but another example I cite is the Taxi Regulator.Few taxi drivers have a good word to say about the Taxi Regulator given the utter failure of that regulator to control the taxi industry with pretty devastating consequences for that industry, which was deregulated from its previous position. That is another strong case for the establishment of a regulator and the Minister has not really done that because he does not want to acknowledge that something is happening in terms of the privatisation of something that has rightly been controlled up to now by the Government. It goes against the grain of the Government's commitment to reduce the number of quangos when here we are setting up another one. Why can this not be policed as has been done in the past? With people being hit left, right and centre with austerity measures and cuts, it will grate with people to establish yet another quango.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The points have been largely made. Regulators dealing with market forces deal with a different type of regulation and we could certainly examine issues in this regard. One must think carefully when giving market forces freer rein in sensitive or critical areas or sectors of the economy or society. The reason the Minister needs a regulator in this instance is precisely because he is moving from a much more publicly controlled form of gambling to opening up a potentially dangerous area of gambling. I am concerned, as are others, that this is what the Minister is doing and he needs a regulator to do it. The experience has been where free market forces have been left off the leash regulators have failed. I accept the Minister's point that certain consumer areas have done okay, although I would like to see evidence to debate this wider issue. The more I hear what the Minister says what seems to be implicit is that we want to see the gambling sector grow. If this is what we are saying I have grave concerns about it, and it should be debated as an issue on its own before we decide we are moving, perhaps out of economic desperation because of the state of the economy, to open up an area such as gambling. It does not seem to be a very sustainable way to deal with the current climate. I do not see why, if what we are trying to do is continue to control gambling and have a lottery which will be a controlled form of gambling to finance good causes as has been the case in the past, we must shift from direct control by the Department to a regulator. It can only be happening because we are opening up the area to privatisation, which is potentially dangerous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is linking the regulator to it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Calleary said one would not get gatherings outside the front of Leinster House on issues such as science funding. Having read the Bill and listened to the debate on it, I believe there probably should be gatherings outside Leinster House. I do not claim to be an expert in the area, but then I suspect most of us speaking in this debate are not experts in the area of scientific research. Therefore we can only go on the views put forward by people in the research area and affected by this debate. Having done that, I am more than concerned about the implications of the Bill and unless someone here can give me a very convincing argument to the contrary, I will be appealing to Deputies to oppose the Bill. There is not much to welcome in it and the thrust of it is deeply alarming. It is not just I who believe this; most importantly in so far as I have gathered an opinion on it, I have gathered it from people in the science area. Dick Ahlstrom wrote in The Irish Times:The Government is causing serious and possibly irreparable damage to Ireland’s national capacity to conduct scientific research. Its persistent demand that any State investment in science must deliver a return on investment has placed it on a path that could erode the undoubted reputational and qualitative gains in science that have been made here over more than a decade.That is at the beginning of an article where a range of scientists in a number of areas of scientific research slate the direction in which this legislation is taking science. Science Foundation Ireland, as I understand it, was established to fund basic research. In the article Dr. John Walsh, chairman of the Irish Research Staff Association is quoted as saying: "The reality on the ground is that researchers are leaving Ireland to take up jobs elsewhere, influenced by lack of jobs and by the absence of any serious process for career development within the Irish system". Writing about SFI's Agenda 2020, Dick Ahlstrom wrote:It has angered members of the science community, particularly those involved in exploratory or so-called “blue-skies” research. They fear their disciplines will no longer receive support in the absence of a commercial payback. Professor Lorraine Hanlon, an astrophysicist is quoted as saying "I am disappointed. I view it as a short-term view, it is very short-sighted. In some ways it is quite cynical". Professor Tom Ray of the Dublin Institute for Advanced Studies is quoted as saying: "The Government uses the appeal of astronomy and particle physics to raise student interest in the sciences - and then the foundation refuses to fund these subjects". I could go on. Mathematicians are saying that under the new direction the Minister of State is pushing they are being refused funding when they previously got it. Pure science - basic science - which the foundation was established to support is now being skewed and distorted in the interests of multinationals. That is what this is about. I might be somewhat convinced it was otherwise if there was an increase in funding, but there is no such increase. The Minister of State has obviously not read the digest - he can shake his head all he likes. I believe these eminent scientists rather than what he has said for all his head shaking. If the Government wants to establish an applied research centre, it should give it extra funding. The €150 million budget, which has already been cut slightly, is supporting nine centres similar to the additional ones the Minister of State is proposing to set up. It is also supporting smaller research clusters and the Charles Parsons Energy Research Programme. If the same amount of money is now to fund an additional six large-scale - as the Minister of State described them - research centres, something has to give. What will give is the basic research and there is already evidence this is happening. The Government has stated mathematics is very important but the school of mathematics in Trinity College, one of the schools of mathematics with the best reputation in the world, is being refused funding by SFI because it does not fit into the new commercially oriented bringing science closer to the market approach being adopted by the Government. Do we think Einstein would have come up with the theory of relativity if he were working for a multinational? I do not think so. Would Copernicus or Galileo have learned about the proper movement of the planets if his policy objectives and priorities had been set by the feudal state of his day? I do not think so. Messing around with the objectivity of science and setting out its priorities in the way the Minister of State has done is wrong. What should be done by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the IDA and other such agencies, is to provide extra funding for applied research in the area. The Minister of State should not mess around with basic objective scientific investigation and exploration. His case is not convincing unless it is accompanied by extra funding, which it is not. The key provision set out by the Bill is bringing scientific research close to the market. It should not be brought close to the market and it should not be dictated by what the market wants. Of course we all want jobs and investment which can deliver jobs, and we also want research in areas such as renewable energy, although serious areas of research are missing from the 14 listed. We should expand on these. Why is only marine renewable energy included when we could develop so many other renewable energy areas? Recently I spoke to people working in science about the fact that working generators in the area of cold fusion now exist. This is very experimental and is on the cutting edge of science. The Minister of State's narrowly focused demand for commercial return linked to what multinationals want, or mapping 14 areas which he believes are priorities, will mean pulling funding from more experimental areas of research. Government backbenchers can laugh all they like because I take much more seriously what scientists, mathematicians and astrophysicists say. If the Government is serious about backing research and creating more jobs it should provide extra funding instead of reducing it and spreading it over a wider area at the expense of basic research. In the end there will be no effective applied research, which the Minister of State claims he wants, if basic research suffers. Applied research is constructed on top of basic research. If basic scientific research and endeavour in areas such as mathematics, which we already see are suffering as a result of this emphasis are not supported then everything on top of it will not happen. We will become prisoners of multinationals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is already happening. Evidence exists that it is already happening. I oppose the thrust of the Bill. It is another way of dealing with the fact that the Government is cutting funding for science research.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, that was not the case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is another extraordinarily dark chapter in the hidden history of this State. It only came to light as a result of the struggle of these women to bring to light the mutilation visited upon them by a medical profession influenced by a Catholic ethos which claimed to represent some notion of spirituality or holiness but under which they were treated barbarically. Some 1,500 women underwent this utterly barbaric procedure and only 200 of them remain alive. This means that 1,300 women who suffered through the procedure will never obtain justice in respect of what was done to them. I reiterate that this is just an appalling chapter in our State's history. Redress for these women cannot come soon enough. This matter was brought to the attention of previous Governments and it is a shame that it has taken until now for action to be forthcoming. It is as a result of a long struggle on the part, crucially, of the women themselves, of those who have supported them and, finally, of people in this Parliament that we have reached this point. I commend Sinn Féin for tabling this Private Members' Bill. The fact the Government has agreed to support the legislation is obviously a positive development. It is critical that it moves quickly to ensure the women involved receive the compensation to which they are entitled and all of the supports they need and deserve. For those survivors who are still with us, these developments have come very late. In that context, there should be no foot-dragging or delay when it comes to ensuring they receive the support and redress they require. We must ensure this type of horrendous treatment of women - as Deputy Clare Daly indicated it continues to this day - is brought to an end and that the pernicious influence of a certain ethos, which can still lead to the mistreatment of women and which still lingers, is overthrown. We must ensure this sort of thing never happens again.
