RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not want to take away from the importance of any of the issues that have been raised to date but I would add that at the last two Whips' meetings we have asked for a debate about industrial relations issues. Luas industrial action continues and, at this stage, it appears to be a very intractable dispute. We brought Luas workers in here the week before last to meet an all-party group of Deputies. They put a very different slant on this industrial dispute, a dispute which is having an enormous impact in this city, is affecting commuters in a serious way and looks no nearer to resolution than when it began. Those workers said the real basis of the dispute is being badly misrepresented by Transdev and they were keen on having the full story heard and a proper discussion in this House so that we can try to move towards a fair resolution. Other issues also came up including the Tesco dispute and low pay. We are all aware that, in the negotiations between Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Independents on the formation of a government, the question of pay, pay restoration and the financial emergency measures and legislation are being discussed. All of these things will have a serious impact, given concerns about winters of discontent and so on. It seems to me quite crazy that against this background, for the third week in a row, and despite a request that these matters be discussed in this House, we are not discussing them. Will the Taoiseach tell us whether he will allow for a debate on these extremely important and pressing issues?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a Dublin TD, obviously I am not as familiar as some other Deputies with the problems on the ground and the challenges that face rural Ireland or the agriculture sector. However, I have listened intently to this debate and many previous debates in the area of agriculture and I have started to develop some understanding of the problems facing our farmers and rural Ireland. I still do not pretend to be an expert, but a very definite picture is coming into view for me when one looks at the problems faced by farmers and rural Ireland generally. It starts with the fact that agriculture is our biggest industry - it is a truly enormous industry, with billions of euro of exports every year, 230,000 jobs linked directly or indirectly to the sector, and a fairly staggering amount of money coming in from the EU. The figure I have is €1.2 billion, but I heard the Minister talk about €1.4 billion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is really quite a staggering amount of money, and shows the importance of this sector to the State and our citizens. However, there is a big contradiction between an industry of this scale - we are the biggest exporter of beef, lamb and dairy in the whole of Europe, the biggest exporter of powdered infant formula and the UK's largest supplier of food - and farmers' incomes. It is a really gargantuan industry, with a lot of money coming in from the European Union, but there is an enormous contradiction in that 40% of farmers earn less than €10,000 per year directly from farming. Against this background of an enormous industry with exports worth billions, huge numbers of farmers are struggling, and struggling badly. They are facing very significant threats coming down the tracks, particularly in the form of TTIP. Some of us have been talking about this for some time, but recent leaks have clearly exposed the enormous threat posed by TTIP for many sectors, and most particularly for farmers and the agrifood sector. Having listened to the previous contributors - this connects with the concerns about TTIP - I believe there is a dominance of the industry by the big agrifood processors and the big multinational and retail chains. Their domination of the whole sector and their effective control of pricing is putting small farmers in an extremely precarious position. Added to that are our old friends the banks. In both cases the Government really does not want to exercise any serious control.It may meet these people but it shows no willingness to interfere with the market. It shows no willingness to exercise control over these banks or clip the wings of the big agrifood processors and retail chains which just want to squeeze the farmers as much as they can to ensure their profitability, thereby threatening the livelihoods of thousands of small farmers and, ultimately, connected to that, the future of small towns and villages in rural Ireland. All that is further compounded by the closure of post offices, small schools and Garda stations. One can go on through the list. It is a huge industry but there are enormous contradictions-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Following what Deputy Penrose said, and the figures bear it out when one looks at the grants and subsidies, it seems incredible that some of the biggest ones are getting these massive sums of money when small farmers are really struggling to survive. We have already had testimony about how, if things get any worse, many of these people will be bankrupted.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. Therefore, I have two and a half minutes left. Do I?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, seven and a half minutes each. Is it not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One other thing just strikes me in all of this. Another big contradiction is that we have 600,000 people in this country suffering from food poverty. Is that not an extraordinary contradiction as well? We are one of the biggest producers of food in the world and yet 600,000 people, mostly elderly people, children of the less well-off and so on, are suffering extreme food poverty. It seems to me that it is in those contradictions and in recognising those contradictions that, in a way, some of the solutions are to be found. One of the amazing contradictions of the Famine was that people starved while food was being exported out of the country. Is that not something on which the State should intervene? Should it not buy, at a reasonable price, the good quality food that is produced by our farmers? The State in the interests of farmers and society could set the prices and make directions on that decent quality food. This is decent quality food as opposed to the sugared rubbish produced by multinationals that is causing obscene levels of obesity among our young people and, in particular, the less well-off who have to rely, because of price factors, on the worst quality food when this country actually produces some of the best quality food in the world, although the farmers who are producing it are struggling to survive and are being driven out of business by the big corporates and the multinationals. My final point concerns the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, TTIP. I have not got time to go through the list of the dangers that TTIP represents in terms of food quality, standards and so on. However, to cut a long story short, small and medium enterprises and the quality of farming and food produce will be destroyed if we do not stop this TTIP juggernaut right now.
