RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is precisely because I am concerned about putting people before profit that I am deeply concerned about the fact that the Taoiseach has failed to heed the objections raised yesterday about ramming the Bill through in such a short time.  If ever there was an example of putting profit before people, this Bill is it.  The people deserve a proper debate and proper scrutiny of this Bill, which provides for nothing more than ordinary policyholders and the wider economy in terms of higher insurance costs being asked to pick up the tab to bail out Mr. Quinn in a labyrinthine deal with Anglo Irish Bank, its bondholders and a multinational company that will walk off with the profitable bits of an insurance company after the people have picked up the tab for Mr. Quinn's shenanigans.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Nothing in this Bill provides for going after the €200 million that was handed to his kids in 2008 before everything collapsed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I urge the Taoiseach to extend the debate to allow Members to scrutinise every aspect of the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We want to protect the jobs as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So take Committee Stage tomorrow.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the dire and escalating crisis in accident and emergency departments throughout the country and the uncertainty and threat that hangs over those in Loughlinstown hospital in my constituency and others that have been mentioned today, will the Taoiseach allow a debate in the near future on the situation of our health service and accident and emergency departments?  It is a pressing issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is an issue for a debate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is disgraceful that this important piece of legislation is being rammed through in two days.  Frankly, it makes a joke of the Government's pre-election talk of transparent government, renewing democracy and all the other hyperbole we had prior to the election.  The legislation has far-reaching consequences for probably hundreds of thousands of policyholders for many years to come.  It will have damaging and far-reaching effects on our already crippled economy.On the substantial legislation and what is being proposed, the Taoiseach today in responding to concerns about the legislation and the speed with which it was being pushed through suggested that what was motivating it was a desire to protect the 1,600 jobs in the Quinn Group.  From the point of view of the United Left Alliance, and I suspect the majority of those who are critical of the Bill, we are just as concerned to maintain the jobs in the Quinn Group as anybody else is, or at least the jobs of ordinary workers and their families who depend on them.  The issue is not about who is most concerned for the jobs and families of ordinary people, it should go without saying — from our point of view it does go without saying — that we are as committed as the Government is to protecting those jobs.The question is whether what is being done is the best way to do it from the point of view of the cost to the public and the effect on the wider economy.  I attended a briefing in the Department of Finance yesterday and have been trying to follow the labyrinthine twists and turns of the Quinn debacle in recent years.  Frankly, one's head would be fried by the complexity of this whole business.  Perhaps part of the purpose of the legislation is to obscure something behind veils of complexity, which is in reality just another shafting of the members of the public and policyholders who end up picking up the tab.  My summary of what this is about is that it is yet another mechanism to ensure that ordinary people pick up the tab for the sharp practice, probably criminal practice, of corporate tycoons such as Mr. Quinn, the people running Anglo Irish Bank and the political system that allowed it to happen.  In the face of the rampant greed of those people, yet again the ordinary citizen is being asked to pick up the tab.  That is what the legislation is really about.The bottom line of this rather complex piece of work is that for the next ten years, or possibly longer, ordinary policyholders will have to pay higher insurance.  It is money they cannot afford when they are already being hit with higher ESB prices and gas prices, levies such as the universal social charge and the impact of unemployment for the hundreds of thousands who have lost their jobs, and the impact of welfare cuts.  People are already being hit by those costs and on top of that they are going to be hit with higher insurance costs.The small and medium enterprises the Government says it is so committed to assisting will be further hit, damaged and crippled by higher insurance costs which they simply cannot bear.  The other costs they have to shoulder at the moment are already driving hundreds and thousands of businesses out of business and the proposed legislation is likely to do further damage in that regard.  All of that is being done to cover the losses of Mr. Quinn.  I am not an expert in the legal and financial side of these matters but with my relatively untutored eye it looks as if what he did was criminal.  There is no other way to describe it.  The assets of Quinn Insurance, which were supposed to cover claims by policyholders were being used to essentially cover other loans, speculative loans such as casino gambling on property, other deals and of course on the Anglo Irish Bank debacle.  Ordinary people are being asked to pick up the tab for that.Meanwhile, we have a situation where all the burden is being shouldered by ordinary citizens and the economy but we are going to get nothing out of it.  As if that is not bad enough, we cover Mr. Quinn's losses, nurse the potentially profitable bits of the company back to health and then we give them away to a multinational.  It is absolutely extraordinary.  Liberty Mutual would not be interested in the profitable bits of Quinn Insurance, primarily operating in this State, if it did not believe a lot of money could be made.  If one takes out the gambling and sharp practice of Mr. Quinn and the mismanagement, malpractice and gambling that led to the losses there is underneath it all, at least in this country, a fundamentally viable business.  That seems crazy in the extreme.  If we are going to cover the losses, give €200 million to Anglo Irish Bank bondholders then at the very least we should own something at the end of the process.  If, for the cost we are bearing, the public owned Quinn Insurance it would guarantee the jobs or would give us a far better chance of guaranteeing the 1,600 jobs.  In that situation we could also have some control over insurance premia so that they do not do further damage to the economy and we could potentially generate revenue for the State.Instead what we are doing is covering Mr. Quinn's losses, protecting the bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank, unbelievably giving them €200 million, and an important fact for the public to digest, paying consultants enormous amounts of money to manage the heist against the people.  One of the consultants currently at the Quinn Group to advise presumably on this sort of deal is Mr. McKillop, who is being paid €915 an hour, €7,000 a day.  If it is a five day week, that is €35,000 a week, adding up to nearly €2 million a year.  Who is paying for that?  We are.  The policyholders and public are paying for it.  It is unbelievable.  It is like a honey pot for those over-paid consultants.  Members of the Quinn family are still in situ.  There is no provision in the Bill to go after the €200 million given to Mr. Quinn’s family or to go after the other means by which the family is trying to syphon off its personal wealth.It is unbelievable that in 2008, before the whole collapse took place, Mr. Quinn — who may have been in the know about what was going to happen — could give €200 million to his four children to increase their personal wealth portfolio.  These euphemisms are about taking vast amounts of money from us to give to his children and protect and insulate himself against what was coming further down the line to make them obscenely wealthy.  Where is the Government's will to introduce emergency legislation?  I would be happy if the Government rammed through such legislation designed to go after the Quinn family's wealth and other assets, instead of making ordinary people pay for the greed of Mr. Quinn, while also protecting bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank.  It is shameful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Nationalised.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What date did it appear?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the fund cover only the losses of the Quinn Insurance group in the UK or will it cover the future losses of Liberty Mutual Direct Insurance Company Limited and Anglo Irish Bank, who are taking over as part of the deal?  As I understand it, the business will be broken up into two parts, one of which is the big loss making business primarily in the UK which is to be run off by the administrator and the potentially profitable part which Liberty and Anglo will own?  For instance, are we giving a guarantee to Liberty that, if things go bad and it makes losses in the future, we will cover them?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify that point.I have a few other questions to put to the Minister.  Will I do so now?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to make a few other points.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is in the speaking note?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would prefer to make my points first because I am not sure how they relate to the different sections.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister said that the new better resourced regulatory regime in terms of the Central Bank should guard against this type of situation developing again and that there should be proper provisioning against claims by insurance companies.  I am not that familiar with the insurance industry.  Is it an offence for an insurance company not to make proper provision against claims or not to have or maintain sufficient assets against claims?  If not, should that not be the case and should it be part of this legislation or are we simply relying on there being a little bit better regulation by the Central Bank?  The Minister stated that there is now in place a little more regulation and that while it is hoped this will not happen, he cannot be sure it will not.  That worries me.  It is bad enough that people are being levied in this way because of what happened.  Surely, in pushing through this legislation, which provides that people will pick up the tab for the malpractice of Quinn Insurance, we should be providing serious sanctions or measures to ensure this does not happen again and that where it does it will be a criminal offence.It is right and proper that we should step in and cover policyholders who took out insurance with Quinn in good faith.  We must ensure we can discharge any claims made.  However, where is the logic of us covering all those losses and nursing back to health or cleaning up Quinn Insurance only to hand it over to a multinational that will obviously have an interest in it because it will be potentially profitable?  If policyholders are covering the losses and paying for the clean up, why then should we not own the company at the end of this process, thus ensuring that any future profits generated from it will come back to the Exchequer or benefit policyholders in terms of lower premiums and so on?  Why are we handing the cleaned up company to Liberty?  I do not understand the logic behind that.If the levy has to be imposed, can measures be taken to ensure the full extent of the cost is borne by the company's future profits rather than unloading it on to policyholders through higher premiums?  Liberty Mutual would not have an interest in Quinn Insurance if it did not believe it was going to make much profit out of it in the future.  Notwithstanding Mr. Quinn's malpractice, speculations and failure to manage his business in a conscientious way, underneath it all there is a potentially viable and highly profitable business.  Liberty Mutual must know this and it is getting the company for a song.  We should at least ensure a quid pro quo for policyholders coughing up for the compensation fund is a mechanism whereby the company’s potential profiteering on the back of policyholders is kept in check.The Minister claimed the introduction of this legislation is not linked to the wider issues in the Quinn group.  I hope the departmental officials, Mr. Sheridan and his colleagues, will pardon me if I admit I did not take in everything they said at the briefing the other day on this matter because it is all quite complicated.  If I understood their briefing correctly, some €200 million will come indirectly out of the compensation fund to go to Anglo Irish Bank bondholders.  The officials suggested this still worked out good for the Exchequer because in exchange for this €200 million, the bondholders would relinquish their claim on securities and assets of the Quinn group.  Whether this is a good deal for the taxpayer is debatable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister satisfied they are sufficient, given what has happened?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister expect Mr. Quinn to be suitably prosecuted then?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is about to answer Deputy Doherty's question.  Although I asked the officials about the matter, I want to be clear.  If the insurance industry is regulated to ensure companies have sufficient assets to meet claims and so on, how can the claim of the policyholder on the company's assets be trumped by the claim of the bondholder?  I cannot figure it out.  If the insurance company's assets are specifically intended to ensure sufficient provision to pay out on policyholders' claims, surely they have some protection and cannot be used subsequently as security for other loans.  It is extraordinary that these assets would be misused to acquire loans to cover Mr. Quinn's speculative gambling behaviour and that the bondholders could have a stronger legal or other claim over them than the policyholders.I ask this question because the Minister is presenting it as not being a bad deal, since the bondholders would have a claim on the assets.  How is their claim legally stronger than that of the policyholders?  If it is, surely something is amiss with our insurance law, as it would give priority not to the policyholders, but to the bondholders who lent to Mr. Quinn.  In return, they demanded securities that he should not have been able to provide, since they were assets to be used to secure against policyholders' claims.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not because of us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We do not have anyone in opposition in the Seanad.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Believe me, if we did——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the record, the Technical Group used all of its speaking slots.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why does the IOU to the bondholder carry more weight than that to the policyholder?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When the Minister is answering that, could he not tell us who the bondholder is?  He must know the identity.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could the Minister ask Mr. Alan Dukes for the identity of the bondholder?
