RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for providing highly educational perspectives on the credit union movement.  As the meeting proceeds, I am learning a great deal about issues affecting the movement.  I have great sympathy for the views being expressed by Mr. Owens.  If I understand his argument correctly, the one-size-fits-all approach to credit unions, which essentially amounts to over-regulation, could undermine the fundamentally democratic ethos of the movement.  That is a compelling argument.  On the question as to whom we trust to regulate the credit unions, I am happy to have the State step in and regulate the banks much more thoroughly than was previously the case.  It appears, however, that the credit unions are about to suffer a backlash arising from what the banks did when they were not subject to regulation.  Despite not being guilty of the types of reckless behaviour in which the banks engaged, the credit unions are being placed under serious threat.  While it is preferable that the State regulates the banks rather than having the banks regulating or failing to regulate themselves, as was previously the case, I would prefer the credit union members rather than the State to regulate credit unions because I trust the former more than the latter to perform this function.  I need to be convinced of the need to regulate credit unions or permit the State to interfere in them in such a way that may undermine the democratic control of the membership.  I am very sympathetic to that point of view.  The arguments made by Mr. Owens are extremely compelling.   The other issue that appears to arise is size.  This is partly an issue of defending the principle of members exerting democratic control over their credit unions.  However, it also appears to be the case that a different perspective is taken depending on the size of the credit union in question.  I have sympathy on the need to address the issue of conflicts of interest because it is one which arises.  Again, however, are credit union members not the best people to decide on this matter?  If there is a potential conflict of interest, I presume the issue can be raised by members at the annual general meeting.  Are members not the most appropriate people to make a decision on such matters?  If one chooses not to allow members to make such decisions, it may not be a major problem for larger credit unions which have larger pools of people but in smaller credit unions it could have the inadvertent effect of hampering their ability to function because they cannot draw on a sufficiently large pool of individuals to allow them to engage in rotation.  The point about maintaining experienced people in the credit union is a valid argument because one must build up skills and knowledge.  I am also sympathetic to the idea that ordinary people can decide to elect people who they believe to be competent and those who they elect can then educate and train themselves in the relevant area and build up a skills base.   Does Mr. Owens agree that the credit unions are suffering a backlash arising from the actions of the banks?  The irony is that the credit unions could become more like banks as a result, which is the last thing we need.  We need the credit union model to continue because credit unions provide the type of financial services we need as opposed to the chaos we had in the for-profit banking sector. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  I apologise for missing the first of them, but I had another meeting to attend.  I am fresh to this matter.  Hearing the different perspectives of those involved in the credit union movement has been illuminating.  However, I am curious about how sharply the witnesses' perspectives on the more controversial issues differ from those of the Irish League of Credit Unions, ILCU, as well as the small and medium-sized credit unions.  Why is there a difference?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand.  I was about to move on to the specifics.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was going to use it as a general lead into some of the more controversial issues.  The witnesses see the term limits as a positive aspect on the basis that they would promote renewal at board level.  Some of our other contributors saw it as problematic because it lessened the democratic right of members to decide who they wanted.  Is there a problem with renewal?  The witnesses went on to state that many of the problems experienced by credit unions stem from their governance.  Is there a connection between the two issues?  Are the lack of renewal at board level and the lack of clarity between the board and people on the front line contributing to problems?  Will Ms Gilleece elaborate on this matter?  Other contributors seemed to be very concerned about the role of treasurer, in that they viewed maintaining members' direct line into what is happening with a credit union's finances as being important.Ms Gilleece appears to be suggesting that it is better for the credit union if this is done by the front line professionals. Perhaps she will elaborate on that point and on her point that the problems which credit unions are having are as a result of poor governance. Is Ms Gilleece saying that, in so far as credit unions are in trouble, poor governance and not the impact of the current environment is the problem?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ms Gilleece appears to share that view.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps Ms Gilleece would also elaborate on what difficulties she foresees for credit unions as a result of the introduction of the personal insolvency legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not for bondholders.
