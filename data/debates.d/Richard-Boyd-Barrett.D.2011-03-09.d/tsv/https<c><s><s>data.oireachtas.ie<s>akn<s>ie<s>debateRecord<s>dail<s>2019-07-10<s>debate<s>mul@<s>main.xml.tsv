RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also express my continuing and ongoing dismay at the way in which the Taoiseach and the EPP continue to tolerate, collude with and co-operate with the vile regime of Viktor Orb√°n. There are farmers outside today protesting against an EU plan to do a deal with another vile regime, that of Bolsonaro and the Mercosur countries. With that in mind, I would like the Taoiseach to explain to me how we could in any way consider working with a regime that is accelerating a devastating programme of deforestation in the Amazon rainforest. The Amazon rainforest produces 20% of global oxygen, and in the last ten years alone, an area the size of Portugal has been cut down. Bolsonaro is systematically dismantling the Brazilian environmental protection agency, he has called for an extermination of the indigenous people of the Amazon to be carried out on a similar scale to the extermination of the indigenous population in North America and he told a political opponent that she is not worthy of raping. This guy is filthy. How can we give favourable trade status to regimes such as this in order to then destroy beef farmers in this country, with the devastating consequences they are facing? How is that in any way in tune with the progressive values the Taoiseach so often ascribes to the European Union? What about the transport emissions that would be involved in massively expanding the sale of gas-guzzling German cars and pharmaceuticals in Brazil and Brazil in turn cutting down rainforests in order to send beef back here? Does that not just make complete hypocrisy of the European Union's claim to be a progressive and environmentally forward defender of human rights and so on? Is it not just the purest hypocrisy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Taoiseach not seriously guilty of climate hypocrisy? I cite for instance the trade deal that he is talking about tweaking and making economic assessments of. Climate change is an international problem, although the Taoiseach often frames it in Irish terms saying, "if we do this or that". That is nonsense. Climate change does not know borders. If fossil fuels keep going into the air, the environment will choke. That is a fact. Unless the Taoiseach has a different view from the scientists, that is indisputable and there is no point in arguing it. How does that fact tally with a massive expansion of trade in cars going to Latin America? Aside from cutting down the rainforest, beef will come from Brazil to Europe and cars will go from Europe to Brazil. That will massively increase emissions. How can we take the Taoiseach or Europe seriously when they are doing trade deals to massively increase trade in areas where we should not be doing it, if we care about the climate. Similarly, the Taoiseach states the climate emergency measures Bill will make no difference to our emissions. I want the Taoiseach to answer my next question with a straight face: does he honestly believe that the scientists are wrong when they say that to deal with climate change, 80% of known reserves - never mind reserves we do not know about - have to stay in the ground? Are they right or wrong? If they are right, is the Taoiseach seriously suggesting that we could discover gas and oil off the coast of Ireland and that it would just stay in the ground? Is he suggesting that we would issue licences to explore for it but it will not be burnt and will not add to the overall quantum of choking emissions in the global environment, which are leading us towards a climate disaster? Does he expect anybody to take him seriously when he makes arguments like that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Globally.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The scientists are wrong.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why do we have a lower rate of water usage then?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I spoke about emissions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	By agreeing in principle to the Mercosur deal, the Government and the EU have stabbed the farmers of this country in the back. They have betrayed the fight to deal with the climate emergency. They are sabotaging efforts to deal with the horrendous destruction of the Amazon rainforests and betraying any commitment to human rights or indeed even to the aspirations and livelihoods of small farmers in Latin America. I do not say that as a bandwagon jumper. I was in Genoa in 2002 at the G8 summit where we were tear-gassed and batoned off the streets, standing alongside indigenous people from Brazil and farmers from France and Italy when this deal was first being hatched, protesting against the plans to bring in these deals, which would destroy the small farmers and producers of Europe, destroy the environment and drive a coach and horses through any commitment to human rights. That is our record and it was that which led us to oppose the Lisbon treaty because as we warned at the time, the Lisbon treaty signed away our veto to oppose this kind of trade deal.That does not mean opposing trade. Rather, it means trade should be fair and sustainable, not done in the interest of a tiny group of corporations but that is what is going on. Small farmers, the environment and human rights are being sacrificed for German car manufacturers, large pharmaceutical industries, a small number of large manufacturing industries and the financial services industry. Rural Ireland and small farmers are being destroyed in that agenda. The commitment that there will be safeguards for the Paris Agreement are nonsense because we have lost our veto. The Germans will say they want their cars to be exported to Brazil and none of the clauses will be invoked. We know this happens with human rights clauses in deals because the Government never calls out the Israelis. Despite the commitments to human rights in the trade association agreements, the Government never does anything about it because big business comes before any of those commitments. All that can be done now is for farmers to keep on the streets and link up with other farmers and environmentalists, throughout Europe and Latin America, who fight and resist the deal in order that it can be brought down. Otherwise, the environment and rural Ireland will suffer terrible consequences.
