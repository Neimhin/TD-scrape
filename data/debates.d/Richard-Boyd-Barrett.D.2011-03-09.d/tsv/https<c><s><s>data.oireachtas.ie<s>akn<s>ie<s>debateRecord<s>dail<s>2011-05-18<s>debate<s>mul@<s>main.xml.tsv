RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In answer to Deputy Higgins's question yesterday on the taxi industry, the Taoiseach indicated there would be a review of that industry.  Does he envisage legislation flowing from this to improve regulation of the industry?  Will he ask the Minister to consider checking the vehicles that were checked by the staff who have been suspended?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach clarify his response to Deputy Micheál Martin?  It is still not clear to me where the buck stops on the State assets we will have to sell at the behest of the European Union and the IMF as part of their package.  Who will make the final decision?  Deputy Brendan Howlin and other Ministers may have an input, make recommendations and examine the McCarthy report.  Surely, given something as serious and disastrous as a demand to sell State assets to pay off banker debts, the bottom line should be with the Taoiseach.  Is it not also necessary for the Taoiseach to define somewhat more clearly than he has in his response, strategic as opposed to non-strategic assets?  A couple of "strategic" examples are given but the Taoiseach referred to the McCarthy report, and the definition of "non-strategic" in it is preposterous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be brief.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For example, the report suggests that harbours and ports are not strategic assets in an island nation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is crazy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I find it extraordinary that a Government that prides itself on fiscal rectitude and the need for it does not have an estimate for the security and associated costs for the visits of the Queen and President Obama.  Should we take it from the Minister's response that the Government has essentially given a blank cheque to the Garda and any other organs of the State involved in facilitating this visit suggesting they can have as much as they want and we will count the cost afterwards?  At the same time vulnerable and impoverished sections of our society are pleading for some respite from austerity and cuts but are told again and again there is no money.I welcome the Minister's comments about allowing and facilitating peaceful protests.  In that regard I am somewhat bemused by the decision of Dublin City Council to ban posters advertising a planned demonstration by the Irish Anti-War Movement scheduled for this Sunday.  The Irish Anti-War Movement will be holding a completely peaceful protest — as was the one we held last night — against US foreign policy on Afghanistan, and Saudi Arabia and Bahrain where the US is financing regimes that are busy crushing democratic movements.  Can the Minister use his offices to intervene with Dublin City Council and ask it that we be allowed to put up our posters advertising our peaceful anti-war demonstration and that that demonstration be allowed to proceed unhindered?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last Saturday I was demonstrating against the Syrian Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have done that too.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely; the Minister is dead right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the Minister answer the question I asked him?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We all oppose that.  Can the Minister answer the question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We all agree with that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I abhor that kind of conduct.  The Minister has not answered the question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My apologies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am all ears.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is in short supply.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope the Minister in his responses will not resort to utterly false claims of anti-Americanism.  For the record, and in response to the claims the Minister has made today, I am very pro-American and its history, culture and people, but I reserve the right to be critical of the American Government's foreign policy and other matters.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just stating that for the record, given the earlier unjustified comment.What is the reason senior figures both in the Garda and from the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Defence are attending this conference with former directors of the CIA, former directors of military intelligence in the United States army and former senior figures from the FBI?  Bizarrely, the intelligence conference is also being attended by the director of Treasury Holdings, one of the developers that helped bankrupt this country, and Mr. Frank Daly, the chairman of the National Asset Management Agency.  Is it appropriate for high level officials from various Departments to attend such a spooks' conference with spooks from the CIA, FBI and so forth, as well as developers who have played such a malign role in our economic fortunes?  Is it in line with this country's tradition of military neutrality to be involved in such a conference?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of course some of the issues the Minister mentioned are legitimate matters on which we must co-operate with other countries.  However, there is a little more than that to the CIA.  Does it not concern the Minister that the CIA is involved in illegal kidnapping, so-called renditions and has been involved in all sorts of manipulations in places such as the Middle East?  It might well be involved in the activities of the Saudi regime, with which the US Government is so closely associated, in trying to crush a democratic movement in Bahrain.  Are these the intelligence services we should mix with given that history?  Why is there a requirement on delegates attending this conference not to write about their attendance or what takes place at the conference?  There are to be no blogs about it and journalists are not allowed to attend.  None of the content of the conference is allowed to emerge from it.  Can the Minister explain why that is the case?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In recent days there has been much talk, in the context of the Queen's visit, about new beginnings, putting a seal on past conflict, the need for reconciliation and truth and renewed and improved relations with our British neighbours.  All of these sentiments are admirable and ones we all share.  In that context, it is obviously very positive that there is an agreed all-party motion calling on the British Government to disclose all of the files and information it has available on the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, as well as other cross-Border bombings in the early 1970s.  Often there is a long way between word and deed.  Certainly, it has been a long struggle for the families of the victims of these terrible atrocities to get to the words calling for full disclosure to allow them to have closure and get to the truth.  In that context, it is unconscionable that we are not making more public and forthright demands of the British Government, particularly during the visit of the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, to release the files to allow the truth to come out.One must wonder a little about the seriousness and commitment of the British Government.  Despite all of the fine and noble sentiments expressed in recent days about the need for reconciliation and to put conflict behind us, it refuses point blank to disclose the information sought by the families.  It makes one wonder about its motivation.  I implore the Irish Government to move not only by way of words in the form of a motion but also to pursue this issue aggressively in a forthright manner by demanding that the British Government disclose the files to let the truth come out and allow the families closure on this matter.
