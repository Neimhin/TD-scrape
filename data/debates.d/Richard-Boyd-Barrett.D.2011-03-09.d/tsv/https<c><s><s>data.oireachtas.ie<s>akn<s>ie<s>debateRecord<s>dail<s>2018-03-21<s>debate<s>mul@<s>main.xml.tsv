RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the education section of the programme for Government the Government promised to establish "a new relationship with students" and also promised to improve accessibility to third level education. I wonder what the Taoiseach thinks in that context of the row that took place last week between students in Trinity College, who were forced to occupy college buildings over attempts to introduce absolutely extortionate repeat exam fees of €450; to increase on-campus student accommodation to €240 per week; to further increase, for the third or fourth year in a row, postgraduate fees and non-EU student fees as well as dramatic increases in registration fees in recent years. I went to Trinity College a couple of times last week and the students said their relationship with the college authorities was broken. They said trust had completely broken down and they were appalled at what this meant in terms of access, in particular for working class students, and they wanted to know that the Government and politicians would back the students in their fight against those extortionate fees.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also think the Taoiseach should respect the will of this House in this regard and he should answer the question on the position if the motion is passed. In passing, and I genuinely do not mean to be glib in this, if the Taoiseach is somewhat credibly saying that people should not make stuff up - I do not think the queries about the strategic communications unit are that, as they are genuine concerns about politicisation - he might also indicate some regret over making stuff up himself, as it would appear, when he was in Washington telling stories on the international stage about favours done or apparently done-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but the Taoiseach cannot, on the one hand, say people should not make stuff up and then go to Washington and make stuff up, and then subsequently deny it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach agree with the suggestion of People Before Profit representatives in the North that, in the light of the political paralysis, we need a new civil rights movement to break the logjam and from the failed paradigm of green and orange politics? Since the civil rights movement that it tried to quell in the late 1960s and early 1970s, that paradigm has paralysed Northern politics. The issues that could break through it include extending marriage equality and abortion rights into the North. These issues cut across sectarian divisions, as does that of the Irish language. It is not the case that support for the Irish Language Act is limited to nationalists and Catholics. Growing numbers of Protestants are learning the language and support having such an Act. Should we not start to discuss building a new civil rights culture in which these and other issues could break through the failed paradigm of green and orange politics that is locked into the North's political structures?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy. I primarily wish to raise the matter of the very worrying things happening in Israel, both in terms of its treatment of Palestinians and its wider stance in the region, in particular in terms of Iran, which I believe should be discussed at the European Council but was not addressed by the Taoiseach in his speech. On taxation, without getting into great detail, it is extremely disappointing that the Taoiseach stated that the Government supports the moves towards reforming the corporate tax regime when everybody knows the situation is absolutely unacceptable in terms of tax avoidance structures in both the digital economy and some other big firms. A person contacted me recently in regard to Paddy Power, the C&C Group and other companies that have subsidiaries in tax havens, yet the Government still holds out against tackling such practices. The Taoiseach has gone so far as to congratulate Donald Trump while in the United States for reducing tax on corporations. He essentially suggested that we have something in common with Trump's economic policies, which, to my mind, is pretty deplorable when one considers the agenda of the American President. The issue of Israel should be raised at the European Council. The Israeli admission in the past 24 hours that it carried out an attack in 2007 on what it claimed was a Syrian nuclear reactor is rightly being interpreted across the world as a very worrying warning of a ratcheting up of the situation and a possible threat against Iran. The logic is that the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and the American President, Donald Trump, wish to dismantle the nuclear arrangements with Iran and this admission of a previous attack suggests that they are willing to engage in military attacks if Iran is developing any kind of nuclear capability. That is very worrying. That must be considered alongside the Trump and Netanyahu axis in terms of the recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital, which is a direct insult to the Palestinians, and also in the context of a series of United Nations reports in recent weeks that show a very serious ratcheting up of illegal settlements by Israel in east Jerusalem and Area C of the West Bank. One of the reports suggests that children have been most affected by what is going on there. Hundreds of children are being held in administrative detention without trial or having been convicted of anything. Twelve members of the elected Palestinian Legislative Council are in prison. Parliamentarians are protected everywhere else in the world but in Israel those representatives are rotting in prison. Nine of them are in administrative detention without having been convicted or tried. The UN is not a radical left wing think tank and we should take what it says seriously. It has stated that Israel is flouting UN resolutions at every level and is denying services to Palestinians in areas it is annexing in east Jerusalem and in the expanding settlements in Hebron. It has further stated that the humanitarian situation in Gaza is reaching emergency proportions. Nothing is said or done and no action is taken by the European Union. If any other country took such actions, there would be outrage and condemnation but we say and do nothing and continue to treat Israel as if it is any other state while it essentially threatens other states in the region with military action, which would be a disaster, is doing unspeakable things in terms of its treatment of Palestinians and is becoming more aggressive, bold and audacious in its actions, all of which are encouraged by Donald Trump. Are those matters of concern to the Taoiseach or the European Council? Does the Taoiseach think we should be saying anything about them? Does he think the European Union should impose sanctions on Israel, which keeps edging forward in its blatant disregard for the most elementary provisions of human rights law, UN resolutions or respect for civilised behaviour in the region or world?
