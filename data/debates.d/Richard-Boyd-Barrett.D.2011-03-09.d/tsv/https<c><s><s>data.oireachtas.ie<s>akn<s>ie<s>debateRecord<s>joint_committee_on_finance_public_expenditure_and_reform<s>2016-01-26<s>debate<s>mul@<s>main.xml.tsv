RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank Professor Lane. On 10 January I received a communication, including a protected disclosure in respect of the Central Bank, from somebody who describes himself or herself as a whistleblower. I am assuming it is the same communication Deputy Mary Lou McDonald received prior to Christmas because they sound pretty similar. Obviously, the person in question is not happy with how the protected disclosure process is proceeding but it obviously relates to a serious matter. I would like Professor Lane to tell us what is going on. As he probably knows, this person is alleging that while conducting an internal audit within the Central Bank, they were instructed to delete parts of that audit. The person consulted the professional body of which they are a member, which told them that under no circumstances should they ever suppress any findings in a report. Nonetheless, those more senior to them wanted these findings suppressed and deleted from the report. I understand that, subsequently, this person was let go from the Central Bank. That person reports further that having been let go from the Central Bank, and he obviously sees a connection with what happened in the bank, he was warned he would find it difficult to get work elsewhere in the financial sector, having made a protected disclosure against the institution. He obtained employment at another financial institution but, shortly after he lodged his case with the rights commissioner, he was also let go by his new employer, at which a former director of human resources in the Central Bank was employed. These are pretty serious allegations. I wonder whether Professor Lane could respond, in light of the whole question of proper oversight, internal reporting, whistleblowing and so on is of enormous importance and everything that has happened and given the failings of the Central Bank during the period of the economic madness that, frankly, crashed this economy. In any event, it is a very serious matter. If Professor Lane-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have some more questions but I could-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not pursue it any further except to say I have read the Deloitte & Touche report and it did not shed any great light on the rights and wrongs of this situation. It does carry a lot of weight with me that a professional association would advise somebody not to suppress findings. If Professor Lane is saying that reforms took place subsequently in the areas identified in the audit, that gives more weight to the whistleblowerâ€™s allegations. Maybe we can pursue that another day. It is entirely justified to flag it. I have been involved, as have many Deputies, in trying to assist people in mortgage arrears as a result of the mad lending by banks and in many cases encouraged by them, including this case, during the period of economic madness. At the end of very protracted negotiations in the case, finally a deal was done, payments were made, arrears were written off and an arrangement was reached between the bank and the individual. When this person, who was self-employed, with a small business, went back to the bank to get a small loan to keep the business going, the bank said the person was blacklisted for further credit because the original terms of the loan had not been fully discharged. Is that common practice? People who were caught up in a situation, created by the banks with reckless lending in the period of economic madness, and who have done their best to negotiate deals with them and have come to a resolution with them are blacklisted when they return to those banks. Is this going on and if it is, should it be? Is it allowed? Is it fair? Do we need action on it because it seems absolutely unacceptable? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is reasonable advice, but are banks allowed to do this? Having done a deal, is a bank within its rights to blacklist a customer because of a failure to discharge the conditions of an original loan, a loan which everybody knows was problematic? This is not somebody who ran off and did not pay, this is somebody who has put in financial statements, who has made their precise economic position known to the bank, somebody who knows that in order to maintain the income and even repayments to the bank itself, certain things are needed to make the business function.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Having read over the Deloitte report again, as alluded to in the earlier round of questions, KPMG had done a quality assessment which identified problems in governance inside the bank. If I understand this correctly, this led to the setting up of the internal audit. The person who carried out the internal audit has stated that information is being suppressed and was then subsequently let go. It is a sequence of events that stinks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think it is quite worrying. The time lag is an issue. The whole process began in 2012 and yet by the of 2015, we still have not rectified the problems that were initially identified. It is still a work in progress.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is perfectly understandable that, given the dispute, we remain to be convinced. I view the Government's growth projections for the economy as fanciful, to put it mildly, given what has been said about the likelihood or possibility of an international recession. Is Professor Lane in a position to comment on this? Is it not a dangerous game to be playing, to be predicting very impressive growth figures and basing election promises on them when all of the commentary internationally is that big clouds are gathering on the horizon and so many will say this is a small open economy which is very vulnerable to what happens in the international economy?
