RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are two issues I have big problems with. There is the content, but before that is the process through which we make this decision. It is one thing to answer parliamentary questions, but it is only in the last few days that Members have been told that a vote was to take place on joining and participating in PESCO. Is the Minister of State seriously trying to suggest to me that the public is aware, for example, of the detail of the 20 different commitments? Let us forget about euphemisms like PESCO. We are getting involved in an advanced military co-operation across Europe. Is the Minister of State going to tell me, with a straight face, that the public knows about what the Dáil is deciding on this Thursday? The public does not know. The public does not know the details of this and does not know the implications. One of the reasons we protested so strongly is because civil society groups, NGOs with an interest in this area and possibly representatives of the Defence Forces should be in here giving testimony to the committee as to what all of this means. It is not good enough for the Minister of State to say one thing and us to say another; we need civil society actors and other stakeholders giving testimony to the committee. This is not going to happen. We are not taking a formal decision and there is not an adequate public debate. It is not satisfactory for the Government to tell Members, just at the beginning of this week, that there is to be a vote on this issue. The matter was not even discussed at the business management meeting that is supposed to order the business of the Dáil last week. How can the Minister of State seriously say that this is acceptable? Why was this matter not signalled at the business management committee? I have other questions about the substance of the-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not think it is acceptable or democratic to make the decision on this issue tomorrow. I believe the Minister of State deliberately buried the matter under the unfolding Brexit drama, albeit a very important drama. The PESCO topic has been tactically and deliberately buried under the Brexit drama. I now turn to the substance of the motion. The Lisbon treaty reference is a red herring. Most of the time during the debate on the Lisbon treaty, over a whole range of things, the Government's line at the time was to say Europe has been good to us so do not vote against Europe. Those of us who opposed the treaty constantly pointed to the military and defence elements of the treaty and those in favour of signing up to it denied the potential implications. In so far as there was a significant vote against that treaty it was due to concerns around this matter. The Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe knows very well that people in Ireland have a big allegiance to the idea of military neutrality and are deeply concerned about any move away from it. This motion is not a satisfactory justification for moving ahead with this. With regard to the substance of the motion, the Minister of State needs to explain commitment No. 1 in the PESCO commitment which reads: "Regularly increasing defence budgets in real terms, in order to reach agreed objectives." What does that mean? It means that agreed objectives are 2% of GDP. According to the last question the Minister of State replied to on this, I believe we are currently spending 0.5% of GDP. To meet those targets we would have to quadruple current defence expenditure. Please do not tell me this is to pay soldiers better wages. We do not have to sign up to a binding commitment to do that. We should pay better wages to soldiers who are on family income supplement, but that is not what this is about. This motion is about binding commitments to progressively increase defence spending exponentially. Is it not the case that the people who stand to benefit, and indeed who have actively lobbied for this, are those in the arms industry? The NGO website vredesactie.be,
submitted freedom of information requests to the European Commission. It discovered that between 2013 and 2016 there were 36 separate meetings between the heads of the arms industry and the Commission, all in the context of PESCO. We have had all this lobbying by the arms industry - whose lobbying budget jumped from €2.6 million to €5.8 million in the same years - while we are to sign up to a treaty with binding commitments to increase arms expenditure and to increase the proportion of that expenditure for weapons and not on soldiers or their wages. These are binding commitments and we are tied in to them. That is what it says in the motion. The motion makes several references to member states entering into commitments and there are constant mentions of binding commitments. This has huge potential implications. The Minister of State suggests that Ireland's participation in PESCO does not have implications for our neutrality, when it is clear that the architects of this proposal believe it to be part of developing the apparatus of, and a stepping stone towards, an EU army. In 2015 Jean-Claude Juncker straightforwardly said that the EU needed an army. I do not have all of the quotes in front of me but they say the same thing. The Franco-Prussian axis, sorry the Franco-German axis wants an army.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They want an army. The Minister of State can tell us it does not have implications but if the people who are driving this believe it is moving towards an army then that is what it is moving towards. Even the term "battle groups" implies battles yet we speak about peace making and all the rest of it. President Macron speaks of getting feet on the ground in Libya, where military action by the French and others has been a total disaster. The Minister of State spoke of some PESCO commitments such as maritime surveillance, as though they were benign commitments, and that there would be the triple lock and so on. Currently, maritime surveillance means a wall such as Donald Trump has not even managed to construct. Donald Trump promised he was going to construct a horrendous, racist wall to keep Mexicans out of the United States when in fact it is the European Union that has built a wall. This wall has resulted in 35,000 to 40,000 migrants drowning in the Mediterranean Sea because the EU does not want to let them in. The EU then wants to boost surveillance budgets to prevent the migrants getting in. This is what the EU is doing. It has built the wall that Trump wants to build, and the EU is repelling these desperate people who are fleeing. They are drowning in the Mediterranean Sea. Many of them are fleeing precisely the situations such as those created in Libya by the French. Why the hell would Ireland participate in this? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Minister of State was in charge.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You are not in charge.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister of State saying what Juncker said was rubbish?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not the point I made. It is about binding commitments-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He did ask me a question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State has managed not to answer the question put by me, Deputy Eamon Ryan and others. Perhaps we might receive a straight "Yes" or "No" answer. Is there any reason we could not join PESCO later? I know that the Minister of State wants us to join it and has said we will have more influence. That is his political perspective. On the formal process of joining PESCO, is it not the case that we could join next year?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We cannot join PESCO if we were to wait until next year?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not the only question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would appreciate a straight answer to the question asked.  Second, there are 20 binding commitments. There seems to be slippage between the terms "project" and "binding commitment". On what binding commitments mean, the Minister of State says we can opt out of whatever "projects" we want. I am not asking about projects but about the binding commitments to which we will sign up when we join PESCO. Is it not the case that we will be bound to increasing defence budgets in real terms? We will be bound to carrying out a regular review of these commitments. I am reading from the 20 points in the actual PESCO agreement which was agreed to at the Council. I am not paraphrasing. "Successive medium-term increases in defence investment expenditure [...] Developing interoperability [...] aligned with NATO standards". That is what we are signing up to in the agreement. We have no idea - the public has even less idea - what all of that means. The Minister of State keeps referring to the Lisbon treaty which does not require us in any way to provide for enhanced co-operation. What was signed up to in Lisbon was that there would be what was called enhanced co-operation. There are other parts of the foreign and security policy, or defence policy - I cannot remember the exact titles - which spell out what the policies are. When the people signed up to the Lisbon treaty, they did not sign up for permanent structured co-operation, a more advanced form of military co-operation. We are not required to sign up to it. The treaty simply provides for it, yet we are now making a leap. Most people will have thought that others in Europe may do so and that we would not. Now we are. When the people voted on the Lisbon treaty, most believed we would never do this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am asking about PESCO. In fairness, the Minister of State is not answering the question I asked.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On arms spending, what commitment are we signing up to in the PESCO arrangement, not the treaty?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That does not explain anything.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It does not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister of State is really not answering the questions. He answers different questions from the ones we asked.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, the Minister of State is just not answering the questions. We have asked four times if we could join PESCO afterwards and he has refused to acknowledge that we could. Failing to answer that simple question is close to misleading the Dáil and the public. I ask the Minister of State another simple question. When did the Government approve this PESCO document and decide that we would join? I think he said it was approximately 20 November.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is just-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely. However, the Minister of State is not admitting that we could just apply in January, February or March. He knows that it is a formality and that we would be accepted. There is absolutely no question of that. We would just apply and be accepted.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Nothing is prohibiting us from applying and being accepted next year. It was agreed on 21 November that we would join PESCO.There were two, possibly three, meetings of the Business Committee at which we discussed arrangements for the Dáil schedule. At no point in any of those meetings did the Government signal that there would be a vote on this matter. That was only indicated on Tuesday of this week. Will the Minister of State explain why this was the case? It is very suspicious. To underline this point, others at that meeting had asked about PESCO but there had been no comment from the Government to suggest this was coming. There was no comment last Thursday when the business for this week was being discussed. All of a sudden on Tuesday we were told that there would be a vote on Thursday. Does the Minister of State not think we could be forgiven for being deeply suspicious that the Government knew something since 21 November but had not bothered to tell the committee dealing with Dáil arrangements?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why did the Government not tell us?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was not referring to the Minister of State personally. I am very suspicious of his Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a matter for the Government representative.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How would the Business Committee know if the Government is going to bring something forward?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The fact that we were going to have a vote this Thursday was not on the Order Paper.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was the Government which was pushing for a vote.
