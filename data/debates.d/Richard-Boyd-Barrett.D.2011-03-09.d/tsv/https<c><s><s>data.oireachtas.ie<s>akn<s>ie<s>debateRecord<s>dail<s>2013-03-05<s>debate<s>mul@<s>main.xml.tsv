RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Bill for the Government's so-called property tax - in reality the home tax it plans to inflict on hundreds of thousands of ordinary struggling householders - is having its final Stages rammed through this House with yet another guillotine this evening. Just as the Government imposed a guillotine in the debate before Christmas, it is doing so again to foreclose proper debate and scrutiny of a Bill that will affect the lives of hundreds of thousands of families. The Government that promised us a democratic revolution is cynically shredding and manipulating the democracy of this House and this country to impose the diktats of the troika.Is this lack of proper debate and scrutiny of the property tax a deliberate attempt on the part of Government to hide some of the most obnoxious features of this Bill, one of which I do not believe most people are yet aware of? Section 1 provides that the value of lands and gardens over and above one acre will not be liable to the property charge, which is incredible. This means the sprawling estates and large gardens, which would significantly boost the value of properties owned by multi millionaires-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----will not be assessed for the purpose of the property tax while the small garden or back yard of a semi-detached house, owned by an ordinary citizen-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----will be liable for the purposes of the property tax. Is this not proof that yet again, when it comes to the property tax, the super-wealthy are being protected-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and the burden of this crippling austerity measure will be imposed on ordinary low and middle income families who are struggling to pay their bills? How can the Taoiseach justify this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We need sufficient time for proper scrutiny of amendments and the Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach has glossed over an important fact. The Government could easily have amended the legislation to provide that agricultural land being worked on for commercial purposes would be treated in a different manner. The effect of the Bill as drafted is that the value of sprawling estates owned by the super-wealthy in this country, and not used for agricultural purposes, will not be taken into account for the purposes of assessment of liability of the property tax while the small garden, back yard or, as mentioned by the Taoiseach, bit of ground owned by ordinary citizens will be. This means ordinary low and middle income people, whether in the city or countryside, will be hammered with this tax-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----while sprawling estates of 100 acres, owned by the super-wealthy-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----will not be assessed for the purposes of this property tax, proving yet again that this Government is protecting the rich.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the case that the reason the Government wants to ram through this Bill, and why it imposed guillotines on the debate on it before and after Christmas is that it does not want people to know the truth, namely, that it is protecting its multi-millionaire friends and the super-wealthy and yet again imposing the burden on families that have already been battered with austerity measures?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Section 1 of the Bill. The Taoiseach should read the legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should not be glib about this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am speaking of land which is over one acre.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach not realise that ordinary people in this country are sick of hearing constant announcements about progress on restoring the public finances and announcements such as we have had over recent weeks about great deals for stringing out the period over which we must pay these enormous debts, declared as victories and reasons to celebrate, when there is no commitment to anything to alleviate the burden of cuts and austerity inflicted on those citizens this year, next year and the year after? The truth is that extending maturities makes no difference to the fact that this year we will pay over €8 billion in interest on this massive debt on which the Government will not even ask for a write-down. We will continue to pay that enormous level of interest on this utterly unsustainable debt year on year for years to come. Almost as much as the education budget is being paid out in interest on a debt largely either not ours at all or not the responsibility of ordinary citizens in that it resulted from a collapse engineered by others. That is the problem and unless the Government addresses that we will be bled dry. The Taoiseach rightly suggests that we are facing into a decade of this misery, of bumping along the bottom with mass unemployment, negligible growth and no prospect of improving that situation if this money continues to be drained out of us year on year. In the Taoiseach's discussions with other European leaders and in his statements about likely improvements in our financial situation when he says we will meet the 3% target and that will be the end of it, then the worst will be over, why does he not admit that will not be the case because when we reach the 3% target we immediately come under the demands of the fiscal referendum? Even though there is a three year time gap we will be required under that treaty to move towards 0.5% and will be required to reduce this debt of €200 billion by half, paying one twentieth per year, requiring billions of extra cuts and austerity after we meet the 3% debt target. We are facing into a decade of further cuts to pay off these debts and to meet the deficit targets. Where is the relief? Where is the light on the horizon for ordinary people given the requirements to which the Taoiseach has signed up and committed? I do not think the Taoiseach should be light-hearted about the wine bill. Can he explain the wine bill that has been built up under his Government in the Department of Foreign Affairs? Why has the wine bill for the year that he came into office quadrupled? The amount spent by the Tánaiste's Department in the year that the Government came into office quadrupled. It appears that we now need four times more wine than we needed in the last year of the previous Government to entertain the great and the good of Europe. Is our strategy to get them a bit tipsy in the hope that they will give us the break in respect of our debt that we have not succeeded in getting from them? It is unconscionable that faced with the level of austerity being inflicted on ordinary people, we have to spend four times more on wining and dining delegates from Europe.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The bill has quadrupled.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not disingenuous to refer to the recapitalisation of the banks as coming out of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, when that was part of an overall package in which we were forced to hand over the rainy day funds of the State and its citizens as a condition for getting loans, all of which were to pay back the gambling debts of private financial institutions, our banks, or to protect the banks in Europe? The Taoiseach's reply was not an answer to the substantial question that I asked him on the debt mountain of €200 billion on which we must pay interest, draining the economy's lifeblood and taking from us the funds that we could use to invest in job creation and growth. Why is it that the Taoiseach will not address this issue with EU leaders?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach brought it up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach is making a mockery of this House and of the democratic process in the way he is guillotining these Bills. As I said to him last week, there is now an absolutely clear, deliberate and cynical policy on his part that where a Bill is not controversial and has all-party support, he lets it run on for days or weeks, but if a Bill is controversial, particularly if it inflicts further suffering on ordinary families in this country, working people and the unemployed - vulnerable sectors in society - he tries to ram it through without adequate time for debate, scrutiny or amendment. He is allowing just over two minutes each for 67 amendments. That is utterly unacceptable. He did exactly the same prior to Christmas when only three of 88 amendments were discussed. It is absolutely undermining and eroding the democratic process in the most cynical way. The Government Members smile like Cheshire cats when they do this because they think it is funny. However, undermining the democratic process is not funny. It is bad enough that the Government is doing this to the citizens of this country but to refuse to allow proper debate and scrutiny of the legislation by the public and the Dáil is outrageous beyond belief. What is the Taoiseach going to do? Is he going to honour the words in his programme for Government on the democratic revolution or is he going to shred democracy in order to impose the diktats of the troika?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We said we wanted more time for Committee Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is more cynicism. We asked for a vote.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not a rant, Taoiseach.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not a rant.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach is absolutely trampling on the democratic process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise to you, a Cheann Comhairle-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----but the Taoiseach is absolutely trampling on the democratic process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is trampling on the democratic process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You refuse to allow debate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You know quite well. I am sorry, a Cheann Comhairle
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is absolutely unacceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach is trampling on the democratic process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I cannot-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government is bringing this House into disrepute in the way it is dealing with this legislation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hundreds of thousands of families-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach can carry on with his cynicism but a line must be drawn on his manipulation of the processes in this House and the democratic process. What he is doing is a disgrace.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government, yet again, is trying to impose a guillotine to foreclose and prevent debate on probably the most important issue this House will deal with this year and maybe in the lifetime of this Government. Hundreds of thousands of families, people who are already struggling, will be driven into an impossible situation as a result of the measure the Government is proposing, and it will not even allow proper debate and scrutiny of that Bill. It is an absolute disgrace. It is the final betrayal of what this Government promised in terms of a democratic revolution and a new way to do politics. It is doing it in the old way but even more cynically and dishonestly than the last Government. Is the Taoiseach going to relent on this dismantling of serious democratic debate in this country and in this House?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach is making a mockery of this House.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is going from the bizarre to the ridiculous. The Taoiseach should not be allowed to answer serious points in this way. He is making a joke out of this House.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Cheann Comhairle-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, the Taoiseach is bringing this House into disrepute. He is manipulating the democratic process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach is trying to silence, in a dictatorial way, any dissent or even proper scrutiny of this Bill, and he should not be allowed to continue with this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This Government should be utterly ashamed of itself for what it is doing and the way in which it is trampling on the democratic process. At the best of times, huge numbers of people in this country have little respect for politics and for this institution. What the Government is doing, contrary to the promises it made prior to taking office, is bringing this institution into further disrepute. If there was any hope for conventional politics, it is fast disappearing down the drain because of the utter, deliberate, manipulative and smug cynicism that accompanies the way this Government does business, particularly in the last six months or so. Government Deputies smile as they ride roughshod over what should be proper democratic oversight and scrutiny of legislation that will affect pretty much every citizen in this State and which will impose further suffering on hundreds of thousands of families who cannot take any more. The fact that the Government will not allow this legislation to be discussed and debated properly or allow Deputies from all sides of the House to put forward amendments and alternative proposals is utterly shameful. The Government does not want a proper debate on this Bill for the same reason it did not want a proper debate on the original Bill before Christmas and does not want one on the Water Services Bill, which will be guillotined next week, namely, that its claims that it is fair and progressive would not withstand any serious examination or scrutiny. The Bill is not fair nor progressive. It is cruelly unfair and seems designed to be so. Despite the fact that this has been debated a great deal on the national airwaves and questions have been asked repeatedly by the Opposition, the Minister refuses to answer the most basic question about this Bill. How will people who are not able to pay their mortgage pay this tax?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has made a mockery of it already. What is the point?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a farce.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What have you heard?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister could remove the guillotine.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Prior to the adjournment of this debate I was asking the Minister to answer at some point this evening the question that his Government has failed to answer despite this issue being debated across the country and to some extent, although severely curtailed, in this House. How are people in mortgage distress who are unable to pay their mortgages supposed to pay this charge? They simply cannot do it. The Minister has not answered that question. We hear the Government talk about its desire to see people stay in their family homes but if it forces people to pay this tax when they cannot pay their distressed mortgages, more people will be forced into arrears and default. With the IMF breathing down the Minister's neck demanding that banks have the right to repossess homes, this is a recipe for more people to lose their family homes. How is any one of the 430,000 people who have no jobs, who are surviving on €188 per week, or someone surviving on the State pension, which is worth approximately the same amount, or even someone who has an additional modest occupational pension, supposed to pay this tax? It is a sure-fire recipe to drive people who are already living on the bread line into poverty, an unsustainable situation. It is coming up to Easter, the time of miracles, if the Minister believes in all that kind of thing, but unless he is proposing the economic equivalent of the miracle of the loaves and the fishes for the whole country, how are people supposed to manage this? They simply cannot. The idea that deferral of payments is somehow an acceptable concession on the Minister's part to deal with this problem is preposterous because what he is offering people is years and years of being in the appalling situation of trying to pay back mortgages they cannot manage, and maybe if they can get out of this situation, they will be faced with a massive debt. Is that really what the Minister is offering to people? I would like a response to the other important point I raised today, if possible. Our more general point has been that the alternative to this is a real wealth tax, levied on those with real wealth, the multi-millionaires, the billionaires, the people with very high earnings, in excess of €100,000, the many tens of thousands of people on high incomes, or an increase in tax on the super-profitable corporations which the Minister seems to view as sacrosanct. Whatever other sector of our society has to be battered with cuts, taxes and charges, the Minister refuses even to discuss the possibility of imposing an extra bit of tax on this super-profitable corporate sector. He has never really answered that question except to offer meaningless drivel about not taxing jobs, which I fail to understand when his taxes have helped sustain a level of mass chronic unemployment. As if to add insult to injury, this is not even an equitable tax, within its own terms, on homes, which the Minister says it is, or on what he calls a property asset. In the definitions of liable residential property in the Bill that was rammed through under a guillotine before Christmas, the value of gardens and areas adjacent to the house will be calculated in working out the amount of property tax people have to pay, but if the area is over one acre the gardens or estates that may surround the homes of wealthy people with big houses or mansions will not be calculated. The mansions and the super-wealthy are protected. How can the Minister justify that? The value of a small bit of a garden or a back yard will be taken into account when calculating the tax the Minister intends to impose but the large gardens and sprawling estates that many wealthy people have with their large houses will not be liable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know and I am pointing out that it is not, as the Government claims, a property tax because a considerable amount of the property of the very wealthy will not be taken into account. It is just a tax on the family home. Why does the Minister not just call it that? It will penalise people in a brutal and cruel way. We will discuss the details as we move through the Bill in the short time available but the Minister has never responded to the substantial issues put to him about the injustice of this tax and I wonder whether he will do so now or if this is why he has curtailed this debate in such an undemocratic way.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about the Government's tactics?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is utterly untrue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister's tax policy has not helped them one bit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So mansions with huge gardens do not get valued for property tax. Millionaires get off.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How does one pay while on social welfare? The Minister has not answered that question. How does one pay if one cannot pay one's mortgage?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is the Minister cutting them?
