RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I have said to the delegates previously, I enjoy these engagements with them because they are always interesting, even if I do not always agree with their outlook. To summarise, Professor McHale seems to be saying that things are more or less on target and that we should be able to begin to reduce the debt and should be over the worst of the big adjustments, the austerity budgets and so on but whether we are or not depends on growth and our forecasts in terms of growth are very unreliable and the risks of whether that growth will materialise are on the down side, to use his interesting terminology. In other words, he is not terribly confident that we will achieve the growth that will be necessary for everything to work out fine, as we are being encouraged to believe we will. That is not something that would inspire huge confidence. It is that a fair assessment of what Professor McHale is saying? Is it something that should give us confidence because it certainly does not give me confidence, particularly given the unreliability of previous growth forecasts and the failure of real growth to match the forecasts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to dig into the risks and also the dynamics of possible recovery which is also important. On the downside risks, is it fair to say that many of the risks emanate from what could happen in the wider European and international economy? If that is the case, and I believe that is the reason there is so much uncertainty because it is so unstable, does Professor McHale consider it is sensible that State policy and Government policy seem to be so focused on opening us even more to the vagaries of the global market and foreign direct investment, and we hear constant references to the fact that we are a small open economy and that is our future? Is that not opening us up more to the risks when, if what we need is insulation against the risks, we should be trying to shore up our economy to be able to better weather a situation where the downside risks materialise? To give an example of that, and I would be interested to hear Professor McHale's comment on this, property prices are beginning rise, perhaps somewhat surprisingly at present, and some of us are concerned that a property bubble is beginning to develop again. I note alarmingly that we have a property-based tax incentive, called real estimate investment trusts, which is technocratic language for enabling big corporate property investors to invest in the bottomed out property in the Irish economy and essentially speculate on making money out of it. That is driving up rents, which is causing a housing crisis, and showing alarming signs of a possible return to another property bubble. Is the advisory council not worried about that and is it not its responsibility to be worried about a possible return to a property bubble?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Or when times are good for some and not so good for others.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In my remaining two or three minutes, I will focus on that. At the heart of the Irish crisis, the European crisis and the global crisis was the issue of property becoming an area of speculation. I am seriously worried that what Professor McHale describes is a commentary on a boom-bust economy where we merely see which way it goes and where there are already signs that this area is becoming one for speculation again because there is no rational plan to balance supply and demand. My idea would be to build social housing which would put the unemployed back to work, provide affordable housing and regulate the market because it would keep prices from getting out of control. Instead, the Government is cutting back on all of those areas and handing over property, which was at the heart of the crisis, to big corporate speculators. That is terrifying. Would the fiscal advisory council be deeply concerned about that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would it be fair to say that a part of that policy failure was letting speculators in various areas off the hook and letting them run riot?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I welcome the fact that the witnesses have responded positively to the issues surrounding the dangers of the property bubble. I raised the issue of real estate investments trusts last year at the budget and again this year. Could the witnesses comment on that? As I understand it, this is a model that has essentially been adopted from the US where there are worrying signs it could be producing a bubble. I think this is a very dangerous development. It also relates to a larger conundrum discussed here and the issue of growthless jobs, which we also discussed with the Department of Finance and which I raised with the Minister for Finance during the budget discussions. What the witnesses have said in summary is that we need growth to hit our targets but we cannot get growth without investment and we are not getting much investment because of the austerity requirements. This begs the question of who invests. As Dr. Donovan rightly pointed out, the only people who really have the money to invest now are those who made a fortune and were left standing after the crash. They are the only ones with money. They probably have access to credit. The little guy has no access to credit but they have access to it. What they are doing is buying up bargain basement stuff left lying around after the crisis. The very people who caused it are now buying up everything at the bottom of the market so they can start the whole process again. Government policy is facilitating that. That is a very worrying development because it is a recipe for spectacular profits for them rather than investment directed towards real growth in the economy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that not a very worrying development and is it not happening? There is a very simple explanation for growthless jobs which follows on from the same logic for growthless jobs, which is that workers who have had their wages slashed or were unemployed are now being employed at bargain basement prices. As a result of having very low wages and all these schemes where they get 20 quid on top of their dole, the unemployment figures come down but they do not contribute to growth and high street demand.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Earlier we discussed the lack of credit coming from the banks. Do the banks have any interest in lending for productive investment when their capital position is being restored by the rise in property prices that is occurring? It seems to me that they do not.
