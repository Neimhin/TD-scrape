RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What we can say with certainly is that it is profit before people all the way with this Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Last night and again this morning in the way the business of this House has been ordered the Minister has shown utter contempt for the democracy of this country and for its citizens.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Incredibly last night a Bill of enormous proportions and significance for this country, which will echo for decades in the lives of the citizens of this country, was voted through when most Deputies had not even read the Bill. Is that not a shameful disregard of our democracy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are school students in the Gallery today. Would Deputy Quinn, as Minister for Education and Skills, advise them to do their exams without having read the textbooks? I bet him he would not-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----but yet we voted through a Bill----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----that is maybe the most important Bill any of us will ever vote on in our lifetimes and we were not even given a chance to read it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Again this morning, we did not know what the Order of Business was, we did not know if there were going to be Leaders' Question and I have just got a text on my phone stating that RTE is reporting that a deal has been done and there is no provision for debate on that matter in the Houses of the Oireachtas. That is shameful.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister going to at least allow a discussion on the deal on which I believe the Cabinet is meeting at 2 p.m.? Will he give briefings to the finance spokespeople after that Cabinet meeting to let the elected representatives of this country know what deal the Government is doing with the ECB?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Your Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, this is, by any standards, a very significant announcement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I ask the Taoiseach whether he is willing to answer questions in the House on the announcement he has just made?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Except interest is being paid all the way along.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister should tell that to the Saudi Arabian regime to which Europe sells weapons.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister not also taking Question No. 9?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister's narrative might be convincing if there was any consistency in it when he decries human rights abuses, violence against women and so on inevitably attached to the word "Muslim" or "Islamic". Where is the consistency when this type of abuse is perpetrated daily in a regime like Saudi Arabia to which the European Union, the United States and so on sell arms weekly? There is no problem in that and no military intervention there, even when it is crushing a democratic movement in Bahrain, because that particularly brutal Islamist regime happens to serve the interests of the Western powers in the region. This exposes the claim that these interventions are prompted by humanitarian concerns. There is a nasty civil war going on in Mali but the Malian state and Malian military are not the good guys in this. The Tuareg people have legitimate national aspirations which they have expressed in four different rebellions since 1960. They are an impoverished nomadic people who have suffered badly at the hands of that rotten regime. Let us not forget that the French, who are leading the military intervention in Mali, also backed the dictatorship of Ben Ali until it was overthrown in the revolution of the people. Also, they happen to be sitting on a lot of gold and uranium. The United States has forces in 35 countries in Africa. There is a scramble going on for the mineral resources of Africa and the Islamist bogeyman is being used as a justification for military intervention. Irish troops should not be involved in a 21st century scramble for Africa.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am annoyed because the Minister in his initial response to my question as to why Question No. 9 had not been grouped with these questions gave the rather disingenuous response that it was about battle groups when it also relates to military missions to Africa. The Minister knew precisely to what I was referring. The Minister is not being honest in terms of the manner in which he is dealing with the points being raised. The point being made is that this is not some sort of good guy-bad guy conflict in respect of which we should be training the military of the Malian State because they are the good guys in this. Atrocities against the Tuareg people have substantially escalated - I accept there have been atrocities on all sides - since the French military intervention commenced. It is worsening the situation and will drive ordinary Malians into the hands of the more obscurantist elements. This is not simply an issue of good guy-bad guy. This is a nasty civil war, in respect of which the French have their own agenda. We should not be involved in the scramble by imperial powers in African countries because the losers will be the ordinary people of Mali and Africa generally.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They chop heads off every Friday in Saudi Arabia.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said atrocities were being committed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps it was an innocent mistake on the Minister's part, but the reference in the question was to our military involvement in Africa. It is worth saying, and I have a later question which we probably will not reach, that there is an alarming drift towards greater involvement by this country since the Government has come into office in military affairs and supporting a militarist agenda, including, for example, the invitation to NATO's deputy assistant secretary general for political affairs and security policy to address a defence seminar as part of one of the first events in the EU Presidency. It was not mentioned that he is linked to NATO; mention was made of the UN and the EU, but he is one of the main spokespeople for NATO. This is indicative of the alarming closer synergy and relationship between NATO and the European Union which is not being acknowledged. It was not mentioned when he was speaking. It is in this context that we are concerned about so-called humanitarian missions which are often sold as humanitarian but involved in these missions are states and powers - in the case of Mali it is France and in the case of Africa generally it is the United States - who have interests and who tend to be extremely selective in what dictatorships and terrorists they oppose and which Islamic extremists they find problematic and which others they do not find quite so problematic. It is not invention or conspiracy on our part. President Jimmy Carter's main military adviser and his foreign secretary, Brzezinski, wrote a book in which he outlined in detail how the Carter Administration backed the Taliban and the establishment of what later became al-Qaeda, because it suited it in the strategic battle during the Cold War against the Soviet Union. As he put it, what is stirring up a few mullahs compared to the defeat of the Soviet empire. I put it to the Minister that the same carry on is going on in Mali and Africa generally, and a neutral country such as Ireland should not even consider being involved in this type of intervention.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did Brzezinski not say that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why was James Appathurai there?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I never favoured the Soviet Union.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Bang goes our neutrality.
