RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People Before Profit has been unique, clear and consistent in arguing that to deal with Covid-19 we need a strategy to eliminate community transmission, so we can avoid a constant cycle of going in and out of one lockdown after another, which is what we believe the Government's strategy is inevitably going to result in. We think the Government is wrong to ignore critical parts of the advice given by the public health experts in their letter of 26 November. In rejecting some of their key advice, in particular around the reopening of the hospitality sector, the Government in fact is endangering Christmas itself and risking the family gatherings, which is what most people want to protect. If we disagree on these matters, and we do, I hope we are wrong about where the Government's strategy will lead us. One thing is absolutely clear from the public health advice and the letter of 26 November, namely, that its caution about the strategy being pursued and some of the decisions being made by the Government is related to the ability and capacity of our health service to cope with further outbreaks and waves and particularly the resourcing and staffing of our public health teams. It seems there is absolutely no dispute about that. In this regard, the Government is singularly failing. It is not just that we believe it is wrong in the strategy being pursued but it is failing to provide the resourcing, support and staffing that is necessary for our public health teams and health services generally to be able to deal with further waves of infections and outbreaks. The public health teams that we praised and applauded are going on strike in January. These are the people on the front line. If we are to deliver an immunisation programme, we will do so with public health teams at one third of the recommended level of staffing and where we have treated them as second class citizens in term of their status as medical specialists. We have recruited contact tracers and testers, who we need to deal with outbreaks, on the worst temporary agency contracts, where they do not even get sick pay and they are essentially in a "hire 'em and fire 'em" position. It is not exactly the way to implement what the public health experts are saying is the much greater capacity, integration and cohesion that is required in public health teams in order to deal with Covid-19. Finally, there is the utterly disgraceful treatment of thousands of student nurses and midwives. NPHET has also expressed concern about the high level of infections in our hospitals but the Government has removed payment for these student nurses and midwives. They are working on the front line with no payment whatever. At the very least, will the Taoiseach accede to the demands of public health doctors? Will the Government put contact tracers and testers on decent contracts, pay and conditions? Will the Government pay the student nurses and midwives something instead of exploiting them and paying them nothing when they are working on the front line for all of us?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no doubt that the intense hardships people have suffered, and the collective solidarity people have shown have helped staved off the worst disasters in respect of Covid-19. However, the Government is taking a gamble in rejecting the NPHET advice, and it is very clear about that, in respect of the potential impact of opening the hospitality sector, which could lead to the family gatherings we all know need to happen at Christmas actually being imperilled. That is a serious gamble. However, when it comes to something that should be less controversial, namely, the support of our front-line healthcare workers and the resources, etc., that they need, the Taoiseach is clearly failing, because he did not answer the obvious question. Why are 98% of public health doctors threatening industrial action? Why are we in a situation with one third of the recommended level of staffing? How are we going to deliver an immunisation programme with that level of staffing, and with the people we need to deliver it threatening strike action because of the way they are treated?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How can the Taoiseach explain that 71% of student nurses and midwives said, in a survey, that they are going to probably leave the country after completing their training because they feel that they are so badly treated?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How can he possibly justify the fact that the testers and tracers that we need to keep on top of outbreaks have no sick pay and rubbish "hire 'em and fire 'em" contracts when they should be treated with respect with decent pay and conditions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be helpful to Deputy Kelly, I think one answer to how we deal with the vaccination roll-out is to have our public health teams at a level such that they are capable-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are the people who deliver immunisation programmes. As I mentioned to the Taoiseach on Leaders' Questions, they are taking industrial action. At a time when they have never proven their value to society more, they are being forced to take industrial action because the Government has shown them zero respect in terms of their status and giving them status as consultant specialists, but also in the fact that we have one third of the recommended public health staffing complement. How on earth are they supposed to deliver a vaccination programme as well as the contact tracing and testing that is necessary? To my mind, that is sort of indicative of the wider need for co-ordination in order that the left hand knows what the right hand is doing and they have joined-up priorities. Last week, I raised with the Taoiseach the issue of graduate entry medical students at a time when we desperately need more doctors, such as for our public health teams. I met them last week. They are paying €15,000 in fees. They cannot manage it and are all saying they may have to drop out and so on. They are experiencing major financial difficulties at a time when the State should be assisting them to qualify so that we have more doctors. I raised a similar issue with regard to student nurses and midwives. The Taoiseach did not really respond on this issue. When I met several hundred of them in an online meeting last week, one after another, the student nurses and midwives who we need and have been holding together the front line said they would not work for the HSE in a blue fit once they are qualified because it is treating them so badly. They said they will be leaving as soon as they are qualified. The State is haemorrhaging the nurses, midwives and doctors it needs because it is treating them so badly. When will there be a moment of enlightenment, as we face a pandemic, when it becomes obvious we need more health professionals, including more doctors, nurses and midwives? When will there be joined-up thinking and a realisation that we should stop putting obstacles in the way of these people actually training, completing their education and then wanting to work in our public health services? That is the sort of co-ordination that I think is very sadly missing at a time when we need it most.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not intend to speak on this issue but Deputy McDonald referred to anti-social behaviour. It is an issue we all encounter and it can be difficult to address, particularly during the pandemic. We get reports of people complaining of large groups of young people gathering and so forth. There are two ways to deal with that. We can blame the young people and take a coercive approach, which I do not believe works. On the other hand, we can recruit people directly from the community to work in community and youth outreach projects. This is an area in which we have failed spectacularly. In fact, I believe we have gone backwards and made situations worse when we could have improved and dealt with them in a way that does not cause problems and conflicts in the community. I can think of several such youth outreach projects in our area that were simply closed down. Often people who were from the community and knew the young people might not always have had certain formal qualifications and that was sometimes used as an excuse to get rid of them. Inevitably, the situation worsened when the projects were closed down. The people who were in the projects would say that there would be an anti-social problem in an area if a project closed down and, lo and behold, that is exactly what happened. As well as looking at the policing side of it, we need to consider seriously recruiting youth and community outreach workers from the community on a significant scale.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One of the key areas that it is necessary to address if one is to really try and strive towards equality is education. I wish to continue to put to the Taoiseach certain points I was making earlier, but just to focus them a little bit more. Fees are increasingly becoming a major barrier to equality of access to education. That is bad, not just for the people who have financial impediments put in front of them in terms of accessing higher education, but also for society because we are not going to get the talented, qualified professionals in key areas that we need if we continue to make life very difficult for them financially because of fees. I referred earlier to the graduate entry medical students, where people, in particular from less well-off backgrounds, have the potential to access medical training and to become doctors. What they tell me is that they are paying €15,000 in fees a year, so that by the end of their training, along with their living costs, they qualify with a debt in excess of €100,000. By the way, they can only get a loan from one bank, namely, Bank of Ireland. The rest of the banks will not even lend them the money to do it. That is crazy when we need doctors but, equally, the student nurses and midwives that we have talked about quite a few times, as well as not getting paid for working during their placements, also have to pay for the privilege of being exploited by paying €3,000 in fees or €7,000 if they previously did a degree. This is madness from the point of view of equality of access to key areas of education where we need qualified people.
