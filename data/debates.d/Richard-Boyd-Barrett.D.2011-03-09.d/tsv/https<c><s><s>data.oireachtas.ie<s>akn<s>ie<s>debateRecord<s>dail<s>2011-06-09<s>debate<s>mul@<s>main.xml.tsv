RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Wallace robbed some of my time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Deputy is right.  Like him, I think it is too early to lay the blame for the crisis in the provision of nursing home places at the Minister's door.  It is a bit rich for members of the previous Government to be giving out about this crisis, frankly, given that it is clearly a legacy of their policy failures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is obviously welcome that the Minister, Deputy Reilly, has come before the Dáil to try to explain this.  I am pleased that the immediate crisis, at least, is over.  Can the Minister assure us that the 500 people in acute hospital beds whose applications have been approved will get the places they need and deserve as a matter of urgency?  Can he ensure the 4,500 outstanding applications will be processed quickly?  Will the needs of those people be met as a matter of urgency?This issue raises serious questions about the provision of long-stay residential care to the elderly in nursing homes.  I am critical of the Minister in the sense that it is unacceptable, frankly, that one of the consequences of the manner in which this crisis has been dealt with is that long-stay inpatient charges will have to be increased.  If I understand it correctly, an extra charge will be imposed on patients.  It is not clear how much this unacceptable increase will be.  The Minister has said it will have to raise €12 million.  We need clarity on where the rest of the money to make up the shortfall will come from.  Will it affect other areas of service?  I refer specifically to the provision of the physiotherapy and occupational therapy services needed by people in nursing homes.I will conclude by referring to the review of the whole thing.  Many of the Minister's statements have emphasised the fact that the private nursing home sector is cheaper than the public nursing home sector.  However, this report informs us that part of the problem is that prices in the public sector are increasing.  When one considers the horror of the Rostrevor House nursing home in Rathgar and cases like Leas Cross, perhaps one will understand why the private sector is sometimes cheaper.  It seems that some nursing homes in the private sector are not providing the level of care they should to the elderly.  The Minister should review the idea that the private sector offers a simple answer to this problem.  The private sector is cheaper in many cases because it often does not provide the same level of care.  In addition, the public sector has to take patients with higher levels of dependency.  We need proper and fair funding of proper nursing home care of the elderly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was something of a non-answer.  Union recognition by employers is a basic issue of democracy and the right to representation.  Does the Minister agree, where employees come together for the purpose of securing their interests and protecting their conditions and are of the view that those rights are best served by being members of a trade union and selecting their own representatives to negotiate on their behalf, that they have the right to do so and that employers should respect that right?  Does he agree that employers should negotiate with workers on that basis rather than do as some employers, such as Mr. O'Leary at Ryanair, have done, namely, to deny and subvert that right and to make their employees' lives a misery for seeking to assert their right to trade union representation?  Should a Government which claims to care about ordinary working people and the vulnerable in society — if its deeds are to match its words — not ensure such a basic right for workers?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister's response appears to be that the Constitution does not require mandatory recognition of unions but nor does it prohibit it.  The question is what will the Government do and not what the Constitution states.  While the Minister may correct me if I am wrong, he has adverted to the existence of union-busting employers.  When such employers hear that employees of theirs are getting organised in trade unions, they sack them.  They get rid of them and make life unbearable for them, which is unacceptable.  The way to deal with this is for the Government simply to introduce legislation whereby in the case of workers who choose to join and be represented by a trade union, their employer is required to negotiate with them and not to victimise them.  Why can the Government not introduce such legislation and why must it defer to Europe or anywhere else?  It should simply bring in the legislation to give people the basic democratic right to be represented by those they elect to represent them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In regard to the Minister's previous answers on the same issue, I ask him to justify what I believe is a completely false connection that he is making between job losses in the construction and retail sectors and those sectors which coincide with the JLCs and REAs.  He seems to suggest that there is some connection between the two and that it justifies a review of the JLCs and REAs which will produce more jobs.I put it to the Minister that there is no connection between job losses and the operation of joint labour committees and employment regulation orders in construction, retail and other sectors.  Jobs have been lost as a result of the greed of bankers and developers and the failure of Governments to control it.  These factors crashed the relevant economic sectors and crashed demand in the economy.  That is the reason companies are going out of business.  It is false to suggest the problem is one of competitiveness or that wages must be levelled downwards by attacking pay and conditions via the JLCs and EROs.  The Minister is wrong to suggest that eliminating premium payments will create more jobs.  I ask him to respond to the argument that if one makes a bad situation worse if one takes money out of the pockets of low paid workers because it reduces demand and spending in precisely the businesses and shops he has in mind.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where is the evidence that lowering the income of the lowest paid workers — even by a marginal degree in terms of Sunday and other premium payments — will create extra jobs?  There is no evidence to back it up.  The Minister is cutting off his nose to spite his face because he will further constrict demand in the economy.  There is an alternative proposal, however.  Instead of trying to create jobs by taking from the earnings of the lowest paid, why not do something about differential rates?  In that case, struggling small businesses would pay lower rates, which would be compensated for by the bigger and more profitable business chains paying higher rates.  Would that not do a hell of a lot more to stimulate job creation, rather than taking earnings from low-paid workers who spend their money in those same shops and businesses?
