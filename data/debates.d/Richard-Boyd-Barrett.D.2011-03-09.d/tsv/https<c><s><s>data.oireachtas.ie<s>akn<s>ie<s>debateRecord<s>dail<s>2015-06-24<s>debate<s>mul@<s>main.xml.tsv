RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yesterday, the Taoiseach gave a master class in spin, dishonesty and plain old prejudice against lone parents in his response to questions on the impact of the cuts that the Minister has visited on lone parents since 2012 and that are planned with the discontinuation of the one-parent family payment this July. Despite what the Taoiseach said yesterday, is it not true that the Minister has reduced the incentives and benefits for lone parents who are working? Contrary to what the Taoiseach said, they have less incentive to work as a result of what the Minister has done to them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, it was on the number of lone parents working part-time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister did not read it correctly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will show the Minister the figures. The comparisons she makes are entirely dishonest. The real comparison is where lone parents who were working 20 hours per week on minimum wage in 2012 before the Minister started her cuts and where will they be after July and, worse, after July 2017. In 2012, before the Minister cut the income disregard, a lone parent with one child working 20 hours per week received €481, including FIS. Prior to the July cuts the Minister is planning, it had decreased to €453. After July, it will decrease to €402.60 and after July 2017, it will decrease to €372. It is a cumulative loss for a working person of €109. This does not take into account the loss of the rent allowance the person will suffer or the fact that FIS is calculated against rent allowance, another sneaky cut the Minister has brought in.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I challenge the Minister directly on those figures and I hope somebody out there watching has the energy to go and check hers against ours. Our figures are spot on. They are an accurate reflection of what has been lost. They are borne out by the CSO figures which show, contrary to what the Minister just said, that the number of one-parent families suffering deprivation has risen from 49% to 63% since she started her cuts.The number living in consistent poverty has risen from 17.4% to 23%, while the number of children living in poverty has increased by 137,000 since the Minister started her cuts, the overwhelming majority of whom are children of lone parents. The Minister is talking absolute nonsense. The cuts have reduced the benefit that lone parents received from working. In 2012, 60% of lone parents were working but now only 36% of them are doing so. The change has had the opposite effect of that claimed by the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My figures are from the CSO and Barnardos.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are well short of the money.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to ask about the Environment (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. We were told at a briefing that Report Stage amendments to this Bill would be brought forward. The deadline for us to put in amendments is tomorrow morning but the Government is going to bring in Report Stage amendments on issues unknown at the last minute. That is completely unacceptable. Are those amendments technical or do they deal with substantial issues, such as water and attachment orders? If they are substantive amendments, when will we see them? When will they be published, or will we see them at the last minute? If they are substantive amendments, will we get a chance to have a debate before we go to Report Stage, given that they were not in the Bill when it was debated on Second Stage? When will Report Stage take place? Can the Taoiseach be precise on that? Will it be next week or the week after? When will the Committee Stage of the Urban Regeneration and Housing Bill, for which the deadline for amendments was this morning, be taken? Will it be next week? Will the two Bills be in the same week? These are very precise questions about legislation and I would like precise answers and no fast ones being pulled.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will they be technical or substantive?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are they substantial? Is the Taoiseach trying to pull a fast one?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach is trying to pull a fast one. That is the answer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One certainly would.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is difficult to take seriously the Government's belated conversion to the cause of dealing with low pay just six or nine months before a general election, given the fact that the problem has been chronic and worsening for the four years that it has been in office. Compared with our European counterparts, our standing in this matter is stark and shameful. We have the second highest level of low pay in the OECD. We are the worst in Europe, with 22% of people being low paid and 16% of workers living in poverty. One might claim that all of this is down to the recession, but compare it with the rest of Europe. The digest provided by the library service was helpful, as it supplied a table of comparisons with minimum wage rates everywhere else in Europe. It is extraordinary that there have been significant increases in minimum wage rates virtually everywhere. Belgium's has increased by 15% since 2008, Bulgaria's has increased by 64% and the Czech Republic's has increased by 11%. Spain, one of the worst hit countries, has managed to increase its minimum wage by 8%. France's has increased by 14% and Latvia's has increased by 57%. Portugal, another country that we might be compared with, has seen an increase of 19%. The UK's has increased by 11% and the minimum wage in the US has increased by 50%. Here, there has been nothing, but four years into office, the Government has suddenly decided that it is worried about low pay. One must be cynical. Given what this Government has been responsible for, it suggests that the Government has been encouraging a race to the bottom or has failed to take action about factors that result in low pay. Gateway, JobBridge and the cuts to lone parents payments that I tried to demonstrate to the Tánaiste this morning have reduced the economic benefit and incentive to lone parents to work. They will lose money thanks to the cuts that the Tánaiste is imposing while Gateway and JobBridge displace and undermine jobs, although I will not say "well-paid jobs". Those schemes further encourage a race to the bottom, with people working for nothing when they should be paid proper wages. The consumer price index, CPI, is not increasing dramatically, but the largest outlay for workers is accommodation. Rents have increased by 21% in Dublin and property prices have increased by 41% in the past year. The cost of putting a roof over one's head has increased significantly, yet there has been no increase in wages. As a result, there has been a dramatic spike in the number of people living in poverty, including those who are working, and a spectacular growth in the gap between rich and poor. Meanwhile, the Government has done nothing about the spike in recent years in the wealth levels of those at the top. In the past 25 or 30 years, the proportion of national wealth that goes to wages has decreased by 10% while the proportion that goes to profits, shares and bonuses - basically, to the rich - has increased by 10%. The recession has accelerated this. There has been a transfer from workers to the rich, but the Government has done nothing about it. The idea that the Low Pay Commission will deal with it is ludicrous.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a topsy-turvy, upside down world in many ways. Nowhere is that more the case than in our attitude to banking. The commercial, for-profit banking sector dragged the country, Europe and much of the global economy to its knees because of its ruthless pursuit of profit. We bailed the banks out to the tune of the best part of €100 billion. Despite that, we continue to give them vetoes and to operate a so-called arm's length principle; even when we own the banks, we do not interfere in any way with what they do. They are doing things that are obviously detrimental when they refuse loans to people to whom they should have given them, and lend to others who should not be given loans. Meanwhile, the credit union sector had no hand or part in the financial crash, is not for profit, and has a democratic structure and a mandate which concerns the interests of the community and society.They are asking to contribute in a positive way to the economy, the community and our society, yet they have restrictions imposed on them. What sort of set of priorities is that? Have we learned nothing from the financial crash? Have we not learned that we need a completely different banking and credit model? In so far as any model of what that might look like exists, it is the credit unions. We should be bending over backwards to consult with them. When the credit union Bill was coming through, the credit unions were virtually pleading with the Minister and saying that they had money they would like to invest in social housing. Did the Minister ever go to meet them and discuss that? We have a massive social housing crisis and the credit unions are saying they want to put money into social housing, yet the Government can say it has no money for social housing.
