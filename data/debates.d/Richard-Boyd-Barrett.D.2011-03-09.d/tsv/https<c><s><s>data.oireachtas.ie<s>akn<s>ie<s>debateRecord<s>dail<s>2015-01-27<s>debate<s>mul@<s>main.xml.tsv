RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the section dealing with the economy, the programme for Government states that, "The parties to the Government recognise that there is a growing danger of the State's debt burden becoming unsustainable and [I want to underline this bit] measures to safeguard debt sustainability must be urgently explored". That is a clear injunction. Many of us are extremely disappointed and depressed by the Taoiseach's - to put it mildly - muted response to the election results in Greece. They are a beacon of hope to people who have been victims of austerity right across Europe. They have been battered for six years with what Paul Krugman rightly called "the fantasy economics of the troika". "Fantasy economics" is one of the Taoiseach's favourite phrases. Paul Krugman said it was the troika who were guilty of fantasy economics in believing that one could batter an economy, cut its public services to pieces, slash people's incomes, and have any other result than creating a nightmare for that society. How right he is.  When someone is finally willing to challenge the failed consensus of austerity, as the people of Greece have now been willing to do, and ask the question, "Can we explore debt sustainability?", the Taoiseach fails to endorse that call. In failing to do so, he is breaching his own commitment in the programme for Government to "urgently explore any opportunity to improve debt sustainability". We are effectively acting as the scabs of Europe in breaking solidarity with debtor countries which have been crippled by austerity. In doing so, however, the Taoiseach is also breaking promises made in the programme for Government. In light of his commitments in the programme for Government, I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider the question of a debt conference and urgently exploring debt sustainability. The consequences of that failure to explore debt sustainability are most acutely felt in sectors of society where the most vulnerable are at risk. As has been mentioned already, the state of our health service is one of the starkest examples of that. It is a serious breach in the Taoiseach's government commitments. In the programme for Government's section on health, it states, "We must reduce the cost of achieving the best health outcomes for our citizens and end the unfair, unequal and inefficient two-tier health system". How does the Taoiseach square that with the fact that the Minister for Health had to admit last week that, in order to deal with the crisis in accident and emergency departments, waiting lists will lengthen, including those for non-emergency surgery? People who are already waiting intolerable periods for important operations, will now have to wait longer. I do not know if the Taoiseach listens to his car radio but we are bombarded, literally every day, with advertisements from the Mater Private Hospital and the Blackrock Clinic saying, "Come to us. You can get immediate treatment. Whatever it is you need, you can get, if you can pay for it." Those who cannot pay, however, will be on public waiting lists for even longer because health budgets have been slashed.  That is a clear example of where the Taoiseach has failed in a commitment to end a two-tier health system wherein by dint of having money one can get decent health services, but otherwise one will languish on a waiting list or on a trolley. What will the Taoiseach do to fulfil that promise?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to repeat a question I asked the Taoiseach earlier. I did not get much of an answer. It has been asked again by other Deputies. Maybe the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, can enlighten us. Why on earth is the Government not joining Syriza and the people of Greece in supporting the idea of a debt conference? It is absolutely beyond belief. Frankly, it is economic treason, to use a phrase that the former Tánaiste once used in a different context. Next year, we will have to pay €8 billion in interest on a debt that was inflicted on the people of this country because of the activities of bankers, bondholders, developers and the political establishment here. That figure is slightly less than this country's entire education budget. Such moneys could be used to provide a decent social housing programme, reverse the cuts that have been inflicted on the health service and stimulate a real economic and job creation programme in this country. However, the Government has said it is not interested and would prefer to have to fork out this money, thereby starving the public services and inflicting misery and suffering on the people. The effect of what it is doing in the process is to scab on the Greek people's fight for debt relief. For the first time in a number of years, there exists a real prospect of a united front of the victims of austerity across Europe, particularly in Greece, Portugal, Italy and Spain, where very soon we will see a similar election result to the one we saw in Greece. The same thing applies to the so-called central countries. I ask Members to believe me when I say that most Germans are not to happy with Angela Merkel's economics and politics. There is a real chance of a revolt against what Dr. Paul Krugman has rightly described as the "fantasy economics" of the troika, which believed the imposition of cruel and vicious austerity would somehow produce economic growth and jobs. It has produced the exact opposite. It has produced Europe-wide stagnation and brought Greece to its knees. Now that we finally have a chance to look in another direction, the Government is saying it is not interested. How can it possibly justify saying that? It beggars belief. I wish to raise an issue that we will discuss again in the context of the motion on the association agreements. It is beyond belief that the situation in eastern Europe is getting close to terrifying. I refer not only to the serious political and economic crisis in Russia but also to the alarming rise of the far right in a number of places in Europe, including Ukraine. Figures in the far right have been included in the Ukrainian Government. Shock troops have been used to terrorise Jewish people and whip up ethnic divisions in Ukraine. On Holocaust remembrance day, we should be considering where all this stuff led in the 1930s and 1940s. We are seeing alarming echoes of all that happening again. What is the EU doing? It is involved in an expansionist agenda. It is competing with an equally rotten, corrupt, totalitarian and brutal regime in Russia. I do not think anyone who is criticising the policy of the EU and NATO with regard to Ukraine is a supporter of Russia or Mr. Putin, whose regime is rotten. The point is that two big powers are playing geopolitical games over the heads of the Ukrainian people. Sadly, this is happening against a background in which opinion polls in Ukraine in recent years had consistently shown that sectarian or ethnic differences between Russian speakers and Ukrainians were breaking down. The majority of people in the east and the west of Ukraine actually wanted independence. They were overcoming some of the historic divisions that existed in that country. However, the interference of the EU and NATO on one side and Russia on the other has stirred up a hornet's nest that threatens to worsen the alarming situation in Ukraine and right across eastern Europe. Why are we a party to this? As a neutral country with a credible reputation, Ireland should make it clear that it is standing not with either of these two expansionist powers, but with the self-determination of the Ukrainian people.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Did you go to Palestine? What about the fate of Gaza?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The last thing the people of Ukraine need is this agreement. The initial discussions on it helped to prompt the conflict in Ukraine and split the Ukrainian people apart.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not interrupt the Minister of State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In 1991, when there was a referendum on independence in Ukraine, 84% of people turned out. Even in the industrial regions in the east, where there are mostly Russian speakers, the vote for independence was never lower than 83%. Even in Crimea, a bastion of Russian influence, 54% were in favour of independence. As I mentioned earlier, the biggest linguistic category that has grown in recent years, up until the conflict started, comprised those who spoke both Russian and Ukrainian. Therefore, all the divisions were breaking down. What ruined this was the economic shock therapy of privatisation, which enriched a small number of corrupt politicians and the oligarchs, who gained fantastic wealth at the expense of a brutally impoverished population, to the point that in Ukraine last year income per capita was €3,900 per year, by comparison with Hungary, where it was €12,560. In Poland, it was €13,432 and in Russia it was €14,612.Life expectancy in Ukraine is almost ten years less than in Hungary, Poland or Russia. All of that is a result of the devastation of economic shock therapy of privatisation and neoliberal dogma that was enforced, benefiting the oligarchs, who had been former communist party hacks and apparatchiks and now become the new entrepreneurs of Ukraine, in getting fantastically rich at the expense of all of the Ukrainian people, whether they were ethnically Russian speakers or Ukrainian speakers. This agreement will only further that situation and encourage those on both sides who are turning the population against one another in the most horrendous way, whether by whipping up nostalgia for Stalinism or, on the other side, whipping up nostalgia for Nazism and creating heroes of those who collaborated with the Nazis during the Second World War. We should reject both Russian and European interference in Ukraine and let the Ukrainian people themselves sort this out.
