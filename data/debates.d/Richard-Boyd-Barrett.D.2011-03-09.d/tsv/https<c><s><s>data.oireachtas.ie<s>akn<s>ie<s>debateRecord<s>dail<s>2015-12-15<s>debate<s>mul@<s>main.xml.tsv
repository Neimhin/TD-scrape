RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are many health and environmental reasons to ban fracking completely and I will introduce a Bill to that effect in the House on Thursday. In the aftermath of the Paris summit and all the aspirations and promises to deal with and prevent further and dangerous runaway climate change, is it not simply a requirement that we ban fracking in order that Ireland does not contribute to generating more fossil fuels that will damage the global climate and environment? If we are serious about those commitments, should we not just grasp the nettle now, ban fracking and not progress this further?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In response to questions I put to them at a joint committee meeting last week, EPA officials made the extraordinary admission that following the survey that is being carried out, they will still be unable to tell us whether fracking is a danger to human health. That begs the question: what the hell is the report investigating? It is also extraordinary that on all the key environmental impacts that are being examined, CDM Smith and Amec Foster Wheeler - one an existing member, and the other a former member, of a pro-fracking coalition - are the lead forces in this study. It is hopelessly compromised by their relationship with the oil and gas industry. Is it not obvious that from a global climate and environmental point of view, fracking means producing more fossil fuels, which will do more damage to the environment and make it more difficult to meet climate change reduction targets and, therefore, if we want to be serious about contributing to preventing runaway climate change, fracking should be banned? The Government should forget all these useless compromise studies and just ban fracking.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amec Foster Wheeler is a member of a pro-fracking coalition. It has a hopeless conflict of interest, as has CDM Smith given it is a former member of that coalition and its primary business is with large oil and gas companies. How can the Minister of State seriously suggest they can give independent assistance in looking into this issue? Is it not beyond question that fracking, which will produce more gas, will contribute to global warming? Why would we not just stop it now?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to raise three justice issues that the justice sub-committee should seriously address, if it is not already considering them. First, there is the case of Ibrahim Halawa. The Taoiseach knows that today his trial has for the umpteenth time been postponed. It will now take place at the end of the month. From a justice perspective, we need to publicly say that the process of so-called justice that is being applied to Ibrahim Halawa is an utter sham. He is essentially the victim of a political show trial by a regime that has discarded any interest in the human rights of its own citizens or, in this case, one of our citizens. It is engaged in using a sham judicial process to eliminate and terrorise political opponents. In this case, it is one of our own citizens who got caught up in nothing more than a protest.It begs the question of why we are not being more robust in terms of calling out this injustice. The Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform needs to see it in those terms.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform considering the panel of barristers review of a number of cases where individuals are demanding proper public inquiries into very serious allegations of Garda malpractice? In particular, has the committee considered, or will it consider, the ongoing call of Cynthia Owen for a full public inquiry into her case, which I have raised a number of times? Cynthia Owen alleges she was raped as a ten-year-old child and that gardaí were involved in her abuse. Her baby was brutally killed and evidence about that killing disappeared. When I last spoke to her legal representatives, they told me they still had no indication that there would be a proper public inquiry into this appalling case where the most serious allegations were made, including those against gardaí. I draw the attention of the Taoiseach and the Cabinet Committee on Justice Reform to a question of international justice. This Thursday is the 28th birthday of Chelsea Manning, the imprisoned US whistleblower who did the world a great service in blowing the whistle on many of the nefarious and brutal activities of the US, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan, and who is languishing in prison-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are justice issues.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In fairness, all of the previous contributions did a fair tour as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There will be events around the world on Thursday to highlight the ongoing plight of Chelsea Manning. This Government has championed the idea that it will support whistleblowers who do the public a service. It seems obvious that Chelsea Manning has done the world a great service and that we should speak out on the international stage on her birthday this Thursday in favour of her being released and not being punished for being a whistleblower on matters of global public interest.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not Messi.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	el-Sisi.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does that include Cynthia Owen?
