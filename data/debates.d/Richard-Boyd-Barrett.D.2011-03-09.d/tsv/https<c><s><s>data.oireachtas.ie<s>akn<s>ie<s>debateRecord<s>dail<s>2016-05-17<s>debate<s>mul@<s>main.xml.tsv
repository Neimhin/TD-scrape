RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I may not use all of them which the Acting Chairman will probably be glad to know. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Katherine Zappone, on her new post. She is taking on an important portfolio, that of children and youth affairs. While I may have my doubts about the capacity of her allies to deliver for children and youth, I wish her the best of luck in trying to do so. I must apologise, as I will not be able to stay for the full duration of the debate. I must speak at a public meeting about James Connolly that I committed to a number of weeks ago. Mentioning Connolly makes me think about one of the lines in the 1916 Proclamation that was almost certainly inputted by Connolly and his cohort in the movement that led the Rising, namely, the imperative that we cherish all of the children equally. Connolly would approve of the general thrust of this Bill in so far as it is trying to modernise the law to move us a little closer to equality on a number of fronts and towards placing the rights of children centre stage. That is to be welcomed, as it is long overdue, but we will still have a long way to go after passing the Bill if we are to vindicate the rights of children truly. Without point scoring too much, we should say that the last Government failed pitifully to protect children. Children fared particularly badly even with the passing of the children's referendum, the most obvious example of that being the number of children who must now endure emergency homeless accommodation, which is an appalling indictment of the last Government and the entire political system. This point will be relevant to something that I want to say later in questioning aspects of the Bill. I will start with the positives. It is undoubtedly a good move that married parents can place a child up for adoption as long as both consent. It is positive that civil partners and cohabiting couples will be treated equally and have the same rights to adopt as anyone else. This is a very progressive measure and is to be welcomed. Step-parents being able to adopt is important. The removal of the anomaly whereby the biological parent must give up the child for adoption in order for the step-parent to become a parent through adoption is a positive move. I welcome these steps. Then we come to the passing of the Bill, the constitutional amendment on the rights of children and the right of the State to decide on whether to allow for the adoption of children without the consent of their parents. In any situation where children are being abused or neglected or where their parents are unable or unwilling to look after them properly, the rights of the child must take precedence. There is no question about that and the State has an obligation to protect children from abuse and neglect. The imperative alluded to in the legislation to listen to children in so far as they are able to articulate their views on these matters is important. The imprescriptible rights of the child as the constitutional amendment suggests are proper. While all of this is to be welcomed, I wish to sound a few notes of concern. For whatever reason, parents may sometimes let their children down through neglect, abuse or whatever. In that situation, it is right that the State should step in but what if the State is guilty of neglect and abuse? What if the State is responsible for creating the conditions wherein parents end up neglecting their children? This is an anomaly in the objective that we are trying to achieve, namely, to protect the rights of children. Consider what is happening in Irish society and the issues that I have mentioned: homelessness, major housing problems and addiction problems that arise from deprivation, the State's neglect of particular areas, its failure to deal with poverty and inequality and its responsibility in many cases for exacerbating homelessness, poverty and deprivation to the point that they break people mentally, emotionally and physically.How often has this arisen because of the failure of the State or the political system to intervene, as it must, to prevent the emergence of the conditions that lead parents to fail? I suggest it has happened in many cases, although not all. A colleague has already mentioned the suggestion made by the incoming Government that it would link child benefit with school attendance. This is a really shocking proposal and Deputy Bríd Smith was the first to mention it in the House. She did so in her opening speech on the day the Government was formed because it was the point that had jumped out at her when she read the programme for Government. It is an absolutely shocking proposal that shows a complete failure to understand the difficulties some families have in getting their kids to school. Difficulties arise not because they do not want to get them to school but because of all sorts of obstacle associated with poverty and deprivation and issues concerning homelessness. One should consider the psychological and emotional impact on the children living in emergency accommodation or whose parents are pushed from pillar to post and who, on being evicted from one unsuitable, private short-term unit of rental accommodation, must move into another. They experience squalid living conditions, as is the case in much private rental accommodation, and are then evicted, whereupon they must move into emergency homeless accommodation. There are people who have been on the housing list in Dún Laoghaire for 18 years and who have, therefore, never had a sense of permanence and security of residence. What effect does this have on children? It is absolutely disastrous. How can we expect children to respect any authority of the State or a school when they must live in such intolerable conditions? This is not to mention the same effects on the parents. The overlap between mental breakdown and homelessness is huge. I know this from those who come to my clinic who are in desperate circumstances and on the point of breakdown in many cases. They are on the point of breakdown because of their housing circumstances. It is the most basic factor.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely, but I am making the point that it is precisely children like those whom I have mentioned in respect of whom the State might conclude, given the effects on parents-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a bizarre intervention by the Chair, but let me-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed, it is. It depends on whether one looks at it from a Fine Gael or an holistic perspective.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am making the point that legislation that empowers the State to take children from their parents without their consent and to have them adopted is very problematic if the reason the parents have failed their children is the State has failed to provide them with the basic things they need to look after their children such as a house. It is not very easy to look after one’s children if one does not have a house. It is very easy-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am going to protest formally.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hold on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am going to protest formally to the Ceann Comhairle tomorrow because of the Acting Chairman’s intervention. There is no one in the House who believes that is unsuitable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will decide how much of a contributory factor I believe it is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I certainly will. The Acting Chairman is not going to tell me what I think; I can absolutely assure him of that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is why I believe the Acting Chairman’s intervention is bizarre.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Acting Chairman read the legislation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Acting Chairman read it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Have you?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	About what section am I talking then?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not believe the Acting Chairman has read the legislation because, if he had, he could not possibly have intervened.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I certainly will.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will. The point is that if the Acting Chairman examines the Bill, he will see that one of the most important things it does is give the State the right to take children from their parents and put them up for adoption if it considers that the parents have failed their children. That is a very serious point. Does the Acting Chairman understand how serious it is?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Right. It is absolutely logical to go on to discuss, in the context of the Bill, the reasons parents might fail their children or the State might consider they have failed their children.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is unbelievable. It is absolutely unbelievable what the Acting Chairman is now doing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I certainly will.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not out of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. On a point of order, I am perfectly entitled to point out that provisions included in the Bill could be problematic and, therefore, must be considered, that amendments may be required and that the legislation should be passed only if there is also a commitment to deal with the other circumstances which affect children or any contributory factor that might lead parents to fail their children in so far as the State has responsibility for this. That is an absolutely valid and relevant point to make on this legislation. Frankly, the Acting Chairman is out of order for questioning me on it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I consider the issue to be far more important than the Acting Chairman’s concerns about the rules of the Chair.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While the Acting Chairman must manage the House and prevent Deputies from speaking about irrelevant issues, I take very seriously the point I made which I consider to be very relevant. As such, his intervention is out of order.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What he has done is-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can spend half an hour talking about it if I want.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can; this is Second Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of course, I want to proceed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also want to proceed without intervention by the Acting Chairman.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, is it a ruling of the Chair that I am not allowed to spend as long as I like discussing a particular section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does that mean I am not allowed to discuss-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will do so. I will also continue with the argument I was making, which is my main argument.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will continue my contribution and if the Acting Chairman continues to interrupt me, people can judge the matter for themselves.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, intervene or interrupt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As Deputy Catherine Connolly pointed out, section 23 addresses the specifics of the issue. It provides a timeline of 36 months in which the State can make an adjudication that parents have neglected or failed their children. If I understand the Bill correctly, the child may have been fostered for 18 months of this 36 month period. Potentially, this means that he or she may have been with his or her parents for only 18 months and the State could decide, based on that period, that the parents had failed him or her. Let us take the example of a person who has experienced a mental breakdown because he or she went through a particularly bad period such as being homeless. As Deputies are aware, homelessness can last for years and in many cases those affected have no idea where they will live. This can have serious psychological effects and impact in many ways on their capacity to look after their children. Are adequate safeguards in place to address such circumstances? This issue must be given serious consideration. Mental health problems and homelessness are frequently not fixed. A person who goes through a bad period may come out the other side as a different person and may be in a position to look after his or her children. Perhaps the parent secured a home and his or her mental health improved as a result. A person with drug or other addiction problems who is housed will be in a better position to obtain treatment, achieve rehabilitation and so forth. However, an adoption may already have taken place. In such circumstances, the State, the judge who made the ruling and the foster parents who subsequently adopted the child may have been acting in good faith and trying to do the right thing by the child. However, the circumstances will have changed. We need to consider complexities such as these, particularly where the children are very young because adoption may appear to them to be the best possible option. For example, a young child who is homeless may believe the best possible option is to tell a judge that he or she wishes to go somewhere where he or she will have a roof over his or her head and a proposed adoption is, therefore, okay. However, the child may feel differently a few years later, at which point the legal relationship with the parents will have changed. We must take these factors seriously.  As the next issue I propose to raise genuinely goes beyond the scope of the Bill, I will make only a passing reference to it. In parallel with implementing this legislation, steps must be taken to fully implement the Children First guidelines to ensure the State will provide all necessary supports to prevent family breakdown in the first instance. The provisions of the Bill should then apply at the point where family breakdown, neglect or abuse means the position is irretrievable, nothing can be done and adoption is the best way forward. Serious, difficult and sensitive issues arise. Deputy Joan Burton spoke about the adoption triangle and there is a complicated triangle at work. I am not sure if the Deputy has seen the Ken Loach film, "Ladybird Ladybird", which is about a poor and deprived young woman who is experiencing problems and has several children taken from her. It is an appalling case, but the film is certainly worth watching. It provides a particular take on these cases and highlights some of the points I have made, for example, the belief on the part of the State that it is acting in the best interests of the child when that is not necessarily the case. It also leaves open the question as to who is monitoring or overseeing the State to make sure it is not guilty of neglect and abuse. As Deputies are aware from our history, both recent and further back, the State failed miserably in many cases and cannot be trusted to be the best body or institution to protect the interests of children, unless considerable safeguards are first put in place.  I say all of this in the genuine belief the objectives of the Bill and most of the measures provided for in it are absolutely correct. However, we need to think carefully about the issues I have raised. I am not sure how one would amend the provisions, but one possible change the Minister should consider is to the timeline provided for in section 23. There is a legal quagmire in respect of what should be done once a legal adoption has occurred and an adopted child decides he or she does not want to be adopted and may wish to reverse it. What right does the child have to a legal relationship with his or her birth parents?He or she still has a right to trace his or her parents, but what if he or she wants a legal relationship with his or her parents because he or she now feels the position has changed? These are serious considerations.
