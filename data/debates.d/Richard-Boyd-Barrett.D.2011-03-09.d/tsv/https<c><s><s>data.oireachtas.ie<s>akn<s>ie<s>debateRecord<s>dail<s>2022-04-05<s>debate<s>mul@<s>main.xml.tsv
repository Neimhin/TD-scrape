RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	After a very brief respite during Covid-19 on the homeless situation because of the temporary eviction ban and the ban on further rent increases, now that those measures have been lifted, the family homeless situation is once again spiralling out of control. We need to address it in this House as a matter of absolute urgency. The figures are back up towards 10,000 people. In the past few days, I have been informed of 60 families who are going to be evicted from the Shannon Arms apartment complex in Limerick. Yesterday, I spent most of the day on the telephone with a mother of three, whose husband works 12-hour shifts in a Dublin hospital, who was sitting in a park and had nowhere to live. This is someone whose husband protected us on the front line and now the family are homeless. They have been looking for tenancies for six months but they cannot find them. I am hearing story after story. The situation is getting decisively worse. We need to address it in this House as a matter of absolute urgency and have a discussion about what additional emergency measures we will take to stop the homelessness crisis spiralling out of control.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is all getting worse, though.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When one thinks about all of the tribunals and commissions of investigation we have had, how long they went on for and how much they cost, they are quite telling about the history of this country. A commission of investigation into NAMA related to the housing crisis and what developers did to this country; a commission of investigation into the IBRC, a dodgy bank that lent money to developers who helped to wreck the economy; planning tribunals to do with dodgy planning decisions; and investigations into mother and baby homes and the scandal of the mistreatment of women and children for decades. I could go on. There is one lesson that we should take from all of these. I do not know exactly what the model for investigating past scandals is but one thing we could learn is that it would be best for these scandals not to happen in the first place. I want to warn the Taoiseach today about a scandal that we are going to be investigating very soon, namely, the scandal of children who are homeless being put through the trauma of being made homeless and living in emergency accommodation or direct provision for years. Indeed, we may well be investigating the state of some of the accommodation that Ukrainian refugees are being put into now, judging from early reports. There is a serious problem with putting vulnerable people, particularly children, into totally inadequate housing, into emergency accommodation, direct provision centres, hostels and elsewhere. I promise the Taoiseach that we will be investigating the damage and the trauma caused in years to come. As I did earlier today, I ask the Government to prevent having to set up a commission of investigation in a few years and to take emergency measures in this area now. Families and children, wherever they may be from, should not be in these absolutely dire and inappropriate situations.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not saying it is simple.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is totally beyond doubt that Putin's forces have been committing war crimes. We have seen the latest horrific scenes in Bucha but the targeting of civilians by Russia in a number of Ukrainian cities is very obvious and it should be prosecuted for those war crimes. Does the Taoiseach have any trust in the ability of the international community to pursue war crimes? The United Nations dropped the investigation of war crimes committed by Saudi Arabia after an intense lobbying campaign by Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Interestingly, that campaign was supported not only by the Americans who are arming Saudi Arabia but also by Russia. The United States and Russia found common cause in shutting down an investigation into war crimes in Yemen. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have been appealing for the war crimes investigation in Yemen to be resumed but there has been no support from the western powers, Russia or Saudi Arabia. Similarly, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International allege that war crimes have been committed by Israel because of its use of white phosphorous in Gaza, imposing a collective punishment on Gaza through an illegal siege and the ongoing ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from the occupied territories. Does the Taoiseach think there is any likelihood of these war crimes actually being pursued? We should have consistency and not double standards in the prosecution of war crimes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not a word.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yemen. Palestine.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yemen, Palestine, Iraq. Forget it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are a different order of crimes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are all war crimes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They have not been in Yemen.
