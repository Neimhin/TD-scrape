RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our hearts are bleeding, Taoiseach.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I propose to share time with Deputies Clare Daly and Shane Ross.  Is it not time to admit that the routine of being the best boy in the European class is not working?  The mounting evidence, whether in Greece, the latest figures on Irish bond yields, the downgrading of Irish growth forecasts or the growing awareness that the European economy will contract, means that this is not working.  No matter how much the Taoiseach submits, promises to be the best boy and imposes austerity, it is not working.Is the postponement of the European Council meeting not symbolic of what is going on in the EU?  Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy postponed the meeting so they can hatch a plan that suits their interests.  President Barroso, who is an unelected Commissioner, orders the Taoiseach to Brussels to tell him what they have decided.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The European Council meeting will just be a rubber stamp for what they have decided, which is that they want the power to ram more austerity — more economic shock therapy — down our throats and those of other European states.  It seems the only thing the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste are worried about is that the people of this country might have a say about that.  They are not worried about the fact the European leaders want more power to ram austerity down the throats of workers, the vulnerable and the poor, they are not worried about the fact they are demanding the sale of our State assets, but they are desperately worried that there might be a referendum in which the people of this country would have some say, because they know that if there was the people would say "No".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach had his chance to speak.This strategy is shameful and humiliating.  It might be forgivable if the strategy of the EU, the ICB and the IMF was showing any sign at all of working, but it is not working.  This week we saw all the evidence.  The austerity in Greece is crucifying its economy.  Its growth has collapsed and because of this, its unsustainable debt is even more unsustainable and unpayable.  Because of this, the contagion will spread to France and across the rest of Europe.  More bank bailouts will be required for the big European banks and therefore more austerity will be required as ordinary people in Europe are expected to pay for it.  This will result in further contraction of the European economy, and the Government's hopes of an export-led recovery will disappear like snow off a rope.  The markets are now saying that is what they think will happen.  The Government's beloved markets are saying that Ireland cannot have the growth it hoped for because the European economy is going to contract due to the continued policy of austerity and bank bailouts.There is a contrast to all this, as we have said over and over for the last few months, and that is what is happening in Greece.  The Greek people have fought back and, as a result, the bondholders did get burnt, to the tune of 20%.  They got what we did not get.  It might be a 50% burning of the bondholders.  Today, they got their €8 billion, even though they did not implement the austerity measures because of the Greek resistance.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We submit and impose shock therapy and we get nothing, while the Greeks, because they resist, get something.  Is it not time to stand up and say "No" to this economic madness?  We should do what the people in Greece and in Wall Street are doing, which is to protest and resist and demand a strategy that puts jobs and economic growth first.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He did not deny it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not going to happen?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Many of us on this side of the House believe that the move to sell State assets is a shameful betrayal of the public interest.  However, given that the Government and the troika are determined to go through with it, can the Minister of State be more specific about the jobs created from this process?  From the answer to Deputy O'Dea, should I take it that we do not know many jobs we will create, what projects we will engage in and the funds available to NewERA until the troika gives us permission and gives us the answers to these questions?  Can the Minister of State be more specific on his role in deciding the projects, the amount available for the projects, and the number of jobs created?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We would like the Government to hear what we have to say.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not that it really listens.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Apparently, we cannot call a quorum.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is extraordinarily disappointing and pretty outrageous that the Minister has not bothered to turn up for this debate, which is about defending and protecting one of the most vulnerable sectors of our society.  The Government amendment is a scandal in that it has diluted to nothing a very good motion put forward by Sinn Féin which articulates the views of the tens of thousands of people working in and benefiting from the community sector in this country.  It is important to note that this motion essentially arises from what some of our most vulnerable communities and sectors of society have asked for, namely, protection of community employment, services and projects that are so vital to sustaining those communities.  The Government's indifference to this motion and its dilution of it is indicative of its contempt for some of our most vulnerable sectors of society.We are speaking here about projects and employment schemes that provide services for children, young adults, mothers, people with literacy and drug problems, immigrants and all other vulnerable sectors of our society in our most advantaged areas.  These projects and employment schemes are a lifeline for those communities.  Our society will be picking up the tab for years to come if the Government does not give us assurances that there will be no further cuts or, indeed, a reversal of cuts, in this area and that workers in this sector will be given the right to engage in proper negotiations so that they can at least have some chance of defending themselves against the brutal cuts that are being imposed on them.  It will cost society and our most disadvantaged communities if the Government persists with the bludgeoning of these projects and workers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why has the Government then tabled an amendment to delete completely the Sinn Féin motion?
