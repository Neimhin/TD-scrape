RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have never sanctioned Israel.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That approach has not worked so far.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Working people and the least well-off in our country are being absolutely crucified by the rising cost of living. The cost of energy is going up and there are unaffordable rents and real pay cuts for people, with inflation running way ahead of the pay increases received. People Before Profit has been very clear. We think that there should be controls on the cost of energy and on rents and that workers are entitled to a pay rise. The minimum wage should be increased and workers should put in pay claims. The Taoiseach set his face against all these things and said they would make the situation worse. Why does the Taoiseach say nothing about the price gouging and profiteering of the energy companies? The ESB made €616 million in profits in 2020 and that figure is expected to go over €700 million for 2021.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Energia saw its profits go up by 46% last year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why does the Taoiseach not ask those companies to pay for the cost-of-living crisis by giving workers a decent pay increase and by controlling the cost of living?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are not working.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The average cost of retrofitting a house is approximately €53,000. It can be €70,000 or €80,000 for older houses to get them up to the highest building energy rating, BER. If someone is wealthy, the mooted changes in grants will benefit him or her. They might allow someone to cover the difference between €25,000 and €53,000 or more. However, the hardest hit by the energy price hikes will simply not have the money.The social housing retrofit programme is a joke. In my area last year, 1% of the social housing stock was retrofitted. There are similar targets for this year. For those in private rented accommodation, this offers absolutely nothing. Why does the Government, therefore, not get the State to invest in the retrofitting of all homes on a much bigger scale, upfront, so we will generate savings further down the line that benefit both the climate and the householder?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tax the profits of the energy companies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Economic recovery means very little if you cannot put an affordable roof over your head. In my area, average rents are now €2,200 a month and average house prices are in excess of €600,000. If you are on HAP, you are goosed, because the most they will give you is €1,900. So, what are you supposed to do? I would like to know what the Taoiseach thinks I should say to people coming into my clinic who are saying they have no place to live and they cannot afford to pay those sorts of rents. Of course, social housing should be the answer. However, figures just revealed by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council this week will really shock Members. Does the Taoiseach know how many council houses were delivered in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area last year? Zero. Next year, the number of council houses that will be delivered in the area will be in single digits. It is just beyond tolerable. Seriously, what does the Taoiseach expect me to say to people who are coming into my clinic and who are faced with homelessness because there is absolutely nothing for them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The council.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a Fianna Fáil-run council.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is a Fianna Fáil-run council.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fianna Fáil runs that one with the Green Party.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fianna Fáil and the Green Party run that council.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have not been opposing council developments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tell that to the low paid.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If we are going to protect and improve biodiversity and increase forest cover as part of that, something radical has to change in Coillte, the State forestry company. The Riverstick forest sale is an absolute disgrace. Before Christmas I had to help the local community in the Enniskerry area to ring alarm bells about Coillte’s plan to sell a public forest in that area, which is a public right of way used by the local community. Luckily, we were successful in that campaign but what is going on in Coillte? We need to address its mandate. Part of the problem is that it is driven, a bit like the ESB making all the profits from the energy crisis at the moment, by profit. It is not driven primarily by a concern to expand the forest estate but by making money. That has to stop and we need to change the mandate of Coillte.
