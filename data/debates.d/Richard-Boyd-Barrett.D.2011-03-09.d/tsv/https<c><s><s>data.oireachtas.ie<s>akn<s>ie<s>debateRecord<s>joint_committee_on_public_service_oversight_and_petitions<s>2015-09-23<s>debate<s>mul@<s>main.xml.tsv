However, the delay is unacceptable and has gone on for too long. Obviously, the suspicion is that the issue is just being fudged so as not to have to deal with it this side of a general election because it could be controversial. That is the suspicion one might have, given the incredibly slow movement on this issue. We identified a long time ago the complex conundrum which we discussed here at length. It seems quite amazing that although the process has gone for so long, we still do not actually see anything we can assess. All I really wish to ask for - I know Mr. Breslin cannot answer because this is political - is assurance that what I describe is not what is taking place. Perhaps he might elaborate on the process and the interaction between the Department, people doing this work and the Government. I do not know what he can say about it, but can he tell us the date on which we will see the result of all this labour?
