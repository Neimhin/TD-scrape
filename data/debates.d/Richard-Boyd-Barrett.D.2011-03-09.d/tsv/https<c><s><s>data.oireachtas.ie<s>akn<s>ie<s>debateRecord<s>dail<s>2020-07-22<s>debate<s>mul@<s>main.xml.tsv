RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Our arts, music, live entertainment and events sector is facing an absolutely dire crisis as a result of Covid-19. Our artists, performers and skilled crew see no roadmap to recovery and have seen their incomes absolutely devastated. What has the Minister asked of her Government colleagues in the July stimulus to respond to the crisis being faced by arts, music, live entertainment and events?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I certainly hope that is true. The arts, music, live entertainment and events sector will be watching closely to see if it is true. While I welcome the fact that an additional €25 million was given in response to campaigning by the National Campaign for the Arts and the Minister alludes to some supports for small businesses in the events sector, some of the signs are not very good. The truth is that the cuts in the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, have already impacted very significantly on many artists, performers, musicians and so on. Some of them did not even get the pandemic payment because they were not working at the time, even though it is obviously an episodic existence where employment and income is concerned, so that was totally unfair. We are getting indications that the Government plans to cut the pandemic payment from €350 to €300, which will further punish people such as artists, performers, crew and so on who are dependent on that. Is the Government going to respond to the key call, which is that the income supports should be maintained as a basic income for artists, crew, performers and musicians?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is slightly dodging the question because the reports are that the TWSS is going to be tapered, that is, reduced - I love these euphemisms - and that the pandemic payment is going to be cut. That is going to hit disproportionately the musicians, performers and live entertainment and events sectors. That payment should be turned into a minimum income above and beyond which people can earn something. Some of the other big requests that are being asked for are whether we can take measures to make sure people like Spotify and other online content platforms pay artists, because much artistic content is now online. Even though they make huge profits, they pay miserable amounts of money to the actual artists and performers. Can we ensure broadcasters are actually required to broadcast a minimum percentage of 40% or 50% of domestically produced artistic, theatrical and dramatic output so that we can give real support? Critically, the main demand of the sector is that the PUP is maintained, not cut and is extended to everybody in the arts, music and live entertainment and events sectors.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	According to the section on health in the programme for Government, the Government's priority is to protect public health by following public health advice. On the day that another front-line health worker has tragically lost his life as a result of Covid-19, does the Taoiseach really believe it is a good time to start abandoning adherence to public health advice of the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, on the issue of foreign travel? What is happening is quite extraordinary. This morning, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, stated that he would make things clear but then went on to muddy further already murky waters by saying that, although the Government did not want people to go and would prefer if they did not, they could do so. That is essentially the advice. It is like arriving at a set of traffic lights where the green and red lights are simultaneously illuminated.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is confusing and clearly not in line with the public health advice being issued by NPHET on foreign travel. How does the Taoiseach explain that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As has already been alluded to, NESC produced a paper in June on the implications of Covid-19 for housing and it was unequivocal in saying that the eviction and the rent increase ban should be extended. It was very clear from the commentary in that report that it did not mean for ten days. It correctly pointed out, as part of its argument, that the huge numbers of people who have suffered income loss or job loss may have built up arrears and therefore if the ban is lifted there is a real danger that many people who have been impacted through no fault of their own by Covid-19 could find themselves facing eviction if there is not a much longer term extension of that ban. I remind the Taoiseach that Fianna Fáil supported the People Before Profit-Solidarity anti-eviction Bill in the previous Dáil, which passed in the Dáil. The previous Government did not want to implement it but the Taoiseach's party voted for the Bill at that time, which sought to ban evictions on the grounds of sale to prevent vulture funds and unscrupulous landlords using eviction as a way of maximising profit at the expense of tenants. It is clear that the NESC is alluding to that. It also states clearly and categorically that homeless people have seen their situation improve because of public health measures such as getting own-door accommodation and that those measures should not be reversed. This is a body funded by the Taoiseach's Department. Will he heed the advice of NESC and have a long-term extension on the eviction and rent increase ban to safeguard tenants and not reverse the improvements that some homeless people have got as a result of the pandemic measures?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is one thing to have a lack of coherence and co-ordination about foreign travel and green lists before a Cabinet meeting, but it is something else to have that lack of coherence and co-ordination after the Cabinet meeting where, presumably, the matter was discussed. The Taoiseach is just not acknowledging that what the Minister, Deputy Coveney, said today did not clarify matters but confused matters more. He said that the green list included countries whose infection rate was at the same level as Ireland or below - I am paraphrasing, but accurately - and, therefore, that it was as safe to go to those countries as it was to travel in Ireland. The Minister then went on to say, "We think you should not go there but if you do go there, it is okay and you do not have to quarantine." Where is the coherence in that? Have the members of the Government now become the experts on health advice? For the Minister to say that it is as safe to go to the green-list countries as it is to travel here is, first of all, a signal for people to go to those countries. Why, if it is so safe, would the Government stop people from going and why is NPHET saying they should not go? Presumably, NPHET is saying that because it thinks it is not safe to go, but the Government spokesperson said this morning that it as safe to go as it is to travel in Ireland. If that is not a mess and a total lack of coherence and co-ordination that leads to absolutely understandable confusion on the part of the public, I really do not know what is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is the Government telling people not to go there?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To echo the sentiments of Deputies Duncan Smith and McDonald, of course we are cognisant of and sensitive to people and families in situations of difficulty and having to get back, essential workers and so on. That is not the point here. Indeed, the point is not just the green light symbolism and what that signifies, which Deputy Smith referred to, although he is absolutely right on that point. The Taoiseach did not answer my question. After all the controversy and in circumstances where it is clear there is confusion, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, stated on a radio programme this morning that, in the context of infection, it is as safe to go to these 15 countries as it is to travel within Ireland. How can that be tallied with the advice not to travel? If it is so safe, why is the Government stating that people should not travel? Why is NPHET stating that they should not travel? The two things do not fit together. There is a direct contradiction. Either it is safe and people can travel or it is not safe and they should not travel. In the context of the application of public health advice, since when has it been the case that the Government states it wishes for people to do something but they do not really have to do it? That is the message currently coming from the Government. When there was a 2 km restriction, the Government did not state that there was a 2 km restriction but that it did not really mind people going 3 km, 5 km or 20 km if they fancied doing so. This is the message that is being sent. Is it any wonder people are confused? The Taoiseach needs to clarify the position. People do not know what they should do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not what is stated in the programme for Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The green list directly contradicts the public health advice.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sharing time with Deputy Paul Murphy. I think the references to the frugal four or five, or even the stingy four or five, are too kind. These people are the hawks of austerity and neoliberalism. The fact that these hawks of neoliberalism and austerity have won a significant battle is indicated by the EU4Health budget, which was initially projected as being more than €9 billion, while after the negotiations concluded, it had been reduced to just over €1 billion. This EU4Health project was supposed to be the big response to Covid-19. The people who pushed for that and allowed that budget for health and the need for a dramatic response across Europe to a global health pandemic to be axed to almost nothing makes it clear that the people who run Europe have learned nothing from the pandemic that continues to grip Europe and threaten Europe and the world. They have learned less than nothing in deciding to axe that budget. That budget was for stockpiles of things such as ventilators, investing in and resourcing public health services across Europe and for early warning systems for pandemics. There was a brief moment in which they realised that we should change in response to Covid and then it was axed in favour of loans. What is the difference between loans and grants? Loans are about us financing the recovery of Europe by borrowing from rich people and allowing rich people to profit from those loans. That is what borrowing is. Sometimes we imagine that borrowing is some sort of abstract activity. It is really borrowing from already rich people and paying them interest. The alternative is direct funding, funded by progressive taxation where the rich people pay some additional tax, perhaps a digital tax or a financial transaction tax, and we use that money to invest in things like health, housing, infrastructure, educational capacity and childcare.That is the difference between loans and grants. It is clear that the neoliberal hawks who favour austerity and who want to disarm us in the face of a global pandemic - they did it before with ten years of austerity - have won out. Our Government's claims to object to that agenda are completely undermined by the fact that we are the worst foot draggers when it comes to actually imposing taxes on these very wealthy interests that constantly avoid tax. We are the ones blocking and opposing digital taxes, we are the ones who do not want a financial transaction tax and we are the ones who act as a tax haven for some of the biggest tax avoiders and the most wealthy corporations in the world. Ireland's concern about the frugal five of austerity hawks is hollow in the extreme. This is terribly important because all of it reflects on our July stimulus and what is coming up. All the discussion is about the stimulation of business. Do not get me wrong. A total of 1 million people depend on small and medium businesses for employment and we must absolutely protect and sustain those jobs. Why, however, do we not understand that investing in health, education, childcare and infrastructure is not just urgently required to deal with the post-Covid-19 world, it is a stimulus in itself? It is the basis of a sustainable and transformed economy in the post-Covid-19 world. It was needed for Covid-19 but now it is absolutely a matter of urgency to invest in a healthcare system, which means recruiting people so we can deal with Covid-19, to resource our education system, which is desperately overcrowded, to have a childcare system that works and to have a nursing home sector that works. This is a good thing for society and also an economic stimulus that is far more sustainable and which would move us to a more sustainable economic and social model.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move:That Dáil Éireann:notes that:— over 1,400 workers in Debenhams Ireland faced mass lay-offs when the United Kingdom parent company announced it would no longer support the Irish subsidiary in April of this year;— the company has not negotiated with the workers’ representatives since and that liquidators have been appointed;— the workers have a collective agreement with Debenhams that guarantees an enhanced redundancy payment package of two weeks statutory plus two weeks;— initially workers were informed that the company had liabilities of around €19 million, but this estimate has since been revised upwards to around €225 million;— Debenhams Ireland had entered an arrangement as co-guarantor of a major debt facility of around £200 million utilised by the UK parent company in 2019;— the Bank of Ireland is part of the consortium that includes Barclays bank and two United States-based hedge funds that triggered this process and this consortium are now effectively the owners of Debenhams UK; and— workers are fearful that the insolvency of their company has all the hallmarks of a tactical insolvency which will leave them as creditors with nothing other than statutory entitlements;further notes that:— five years ago, Clerys department store closed and its workers were made redundant with no notification by their company;— the Oireachtas responded by commissioning a report into the causes of the closure, and the manner in which workers were abandoned;— the subsequent ‘Expert Examination and Review of Laws on the Protection of Employee Interests when assets are separated from the operating entity (Duffy-Cahill report)’ made several suggestions for legislative reform to ensure workers would not be abandoned in any subsequent closure or liquidation process; and— to date the Oireachtas has failed to legislate for any of the areas examined by the Duffy-Cahill report;condemns:— the failure of past Governments to legislate to protect workers in these situations; and— the actions of the consortium now in control of Debenhams and specifically the role of the Bank of Ireland, which were bailed out by the Irish State in 2008;sends a message of support to the Debenhams workers for the stance they have taken to protect their livelihoods;recognises:— the plight of the Debenhams workers and the decades of service many have rendered to their company;— the threat of mass redundancies facing many other workers in many sectors and industries in the coming period; and— in the case of Debenhams, the State is the first creditor that the liquidators seek to settle with on amounts due for various taxes and rates owed;calls on the Government to:— legislate as a priority to strengthen the rights of workers facing redundancies and layoffs, and specifically to legislate to:— reorder the priority afforded to workers as creditors in any liquidation process by amending section 621 of the Companies Act 2014;— amend the Protection of Employment Act 1977 to increase the compensation for workers from four weeks to two years in cases where their employer has contravened sections 9 and 10 of the Act; and— amend all appropriate legislation such as the ‘Protection of Employment Acts’ as called for in the Duffy-Cahill report to ensure that where agreements for enhanced redundancies have been negotiated with workers, these are honoured as preferential creditors in any subsequent liquidation process; andin recognition of the failure of the State to act in this area and to protect workers like those in Debenhams, calls on the Minister for Finance, Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and the Taoiseach to:— notify the liquidators in Debenhams that the State will forgo its priority as a creditor and instruct the liquidator to use funds realised instead to pay the enhanced redundancy payments agreed between the Debenhams workers and the company;and— immediately initiate negotiations with representatives of the Bank of Ireland to ensure the workers receive the full collective redundancy package previously agreed with the Debenhams company.I am sharing time with Deputies Gino Kenny and Mick Barry. The treatment of 1,400 Debenhams workers by Debenhams, a very large company that continues to make profits in this country through online sales and which continues to operate in the North of this country and operate and make money in Britain, has been nothing short of despicable. We have heard descriptions from workers about how, essentially, they were tricked by the company using the cover of the Covid-19 pandemic to suggest that various things it was doing, such as stocktaking in stores and movement of goods etc., were related to the Covid-19 issue. These had nothing to do with Covid-19 but instead were related to a tactical liquidation, using the cover of the pandemic to dump these 1,400 workers, most of whom had worked for the company for decades. These workers gave loyal service in Debenhams stores all across the country but were dumped in the most cynical way. Our motion seeks the justice that should have been given to these workers if previous Governments had acted to tackle similar actions in this country over recent years. The most recent case is that of Clerys, which had a similar liquidation process and where workers were dumped. Before that we have the examples of La Senza, Vita Cortex and Thomas Cook. They are just the cases I am familiar with, although there are probably others that people can remind me of. Time and again, and particularly in the retail sector and department stores, retail workers have been treated in this absolutely outrageous way. After the Clerys dispute, the Duffy-Cahill report was produced, which suggested that there should be a reordering of the priority of creditors in cases of liquidation in order to ensure that workers could not be treated in this way. This would ensure workers would become priority creditors when it came to the liquidation of assets, companies would not be able to run away with assets and other people could not take priority over the workers who generated the wealth, as Debenhams workers have done over many years. Successive Governments have failed to do this. Five years after the Clerys dispute, this has not been done and the Debenhams workers find themselves in their current position. The cynicism of Debenhams goes on as clearly this was orchestrated well in advance of Covid-19. This company has significant assets and we only need to know what is in the stores around the country to see that it has tens of millions of euro in assets. It also has an online business. Essentially, the company tried to take the assets off the balance sheet by making Debenhams Ireland co-guarantors in a £200 million debt taken out by Debenhams UK. This is just an accountancy manoeuvre deliberately designed to lay the ground for the liquidation, leaving the workers with nothing. Quite rightly, the workers have not accepted this. There is no doubt Debenhams hoped workers would be shell-shocked and demoralised and in the context of the pandemic that they would just take this lying down. To their eternal credit, this inspiring group of workers, mostly women, have stood up, fought for their rights and refused to be treated in this despicable way. They are now in their 104th day of protest and at Henry Street and other stores round-the-clock pickets are being mounted to prevent the liquidators, KPMG, from moving in and taking those assets when those assets should be liquidated to the benefit of the workers. The Taoiseach said he had great sympathy for the workers. When I and others raised this in the past number of weeks, he told us he was greatly sympathetic and the treatment of Debenhams workers was disgraceful. He said he would look at legislation going forward but there was nothing he could really do. That was the implication for this particular group of workers. In this motion we are making a concrete proposal that can be achieved. It is something that arose from a meeting of the workers and the liquidator, when it became clear the Government is a priority shareholder. Therefore, the Government can waive its priority and instruct KPMG to give a better redundancy deal to the workers in the form of the four weeks of pay per year of service and ensure they are the top priority in the liquidation of assets. The workers do not want tea and sympathy but tangible action to give them the justice they deserve. We also want the legislation to ensure similar cases do not arise in future with similar groups of workers. The workers are marching here later this evening because they were not aware of the change in the Dáil schedule. If we want to send a message of solidarity and hope to those workers, the Government should accept this motion and drop its amendments, which other speakers will address.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government and Deputy Lahart tried to muddy the waters and to deflect to absolve themselves of responsibility for giving a direct answer to the questions that this motion asks of them and to cover the fact that they have deleted our entire motion and replaced it with vague promises of reviews, no tangible commitments and, essentially, a recapitulation of existing legislation, which implies there really is no problem at all. There is a big problem. Deputy Lahart should note the motion does not ask for a socialist republic. It asks for the Government to implement the Duffy Cahill report into legislation in order that what is being done to the Debenhams workers can never be done again. The Government cannot commit to it. It will not commit to it. If we are sceptical it is because it is five years since that report and the Clerys incident. As I said previously, this has gone on for years under previous Fianna Fáil Governments. I refer to Vita Cortex, La Senza and Thomas Cook. It goes on and no action is taken. The Government can hardly blame us for being sceptical. We ask that something we learned from the liquidators, not dreamed up in some left-wing textbook, be done. The liquidators said that the Government as priority creditors could instruct them to dispose of the assets in favour of the workers. The Government has still not responded to that point. It should give the instruction. It should give the commitment to engage with Bank of Ireland, which is directly involved in triggering the process for its own interests and for the profits of its shareholders that has led to the cynical dumping of 1,400 workers. Will the Government tell Bank of Ireland that this is not acceptable and insist that proper redundancy is paid to workers by the consortium to which it is a party and in which it almost certainly was involved in engineering the dumping of debt onto the Irish company in order that the assets could be taken off the book?  I say to the Debenhams workers, "Do not listen to Deputy Lahart when he downplays protest". I was talking to the shop stewards earlier. They are hopeful. They are hopeful because the issue is being debated in the Dáil tonight and because they have met Ministers. The reason any of that has happened is because they have been determined in their protest for 100 days. It is the protests of those workers and their inspiring determination, bravery and courage that has forced this issue onto the agenda of this House and forced the Government to meet them. It is that determination, that inspiring heroism by the Debenhams workers that will see this battle to a successful conclusion, which conclusion, if it is victorious for the workers, will be a victory not just for the Debenhams workers but for every worker in this country who could face similar treatment in the future.
