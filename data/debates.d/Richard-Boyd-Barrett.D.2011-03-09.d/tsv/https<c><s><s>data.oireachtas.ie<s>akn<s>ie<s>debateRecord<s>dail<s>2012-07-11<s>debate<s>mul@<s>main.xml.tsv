RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I second the amendment.  I will simply reiterate the point made by Deputy McDonald.  People are scandalised by top civil servants and politicians walking away with obscene pension pots when the rest of the country is being crucified by austerity and cuts.  It is particularly galling, as the Minister will be aware, that some of the people whom many would hold responsible for the current economic crisis are walking away with obscene pension pots while ordinary people are left to pick up the tab for the reckless behaviour that took place.  Sinn Féin's proposal to cap pension entitlements at €60,000 per year is very reasonable.The Minister has indicated that the problem with this is technical in nature, that is, in terms of what €60,000 will mean a few years hence.  I do not accept that as a reason to oppose the amendment.  The Minister can always adjust the figure upwards as time goes on.  It would be a relatively easy thing to do.  The Minister has given himself discretion in other matters relating to the new scheme so I do not see why the figure could not be updated as time passes.  It would go some way to showing a serious commitment on the part of the Government to do something about these enormous pension pots of top public servants.  In addition, although it is not directly related to the amendment, I do not accept that we cannot do this to some of the people who have walked away because there are other ways of doing it if there is a will.  The tax system could be used to go after some of the enormous pension pots that some people have walked away with if there was a will to do so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am a little confused about what we are discussing.  What amendment is it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How does that amendment relate to the subjects we have debated?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If we are having a discussion about those matters, I would like to contribute.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will make a brief contribution.  Until now, pension entitlements were dependent on increases in public sector pay and the automatic link has been broken, meaning we are into a much more vague metric involving the consumer price index, with all the potential ups and downs in that.  I heard Deputy Fleming state that public sector pay was ahead of the consumer price index but I do not accept that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The figures mask how people at the top can benefit from percentage increases to a much greater level than people at the bottom.  Percentage figures do not tell the complete story about how these issues affect everybody.  It is also wrong to say that pay is ahead of inflation, as people seek pay increases in order to deal with rises in the cost of the standards of living.  The consumer price index does not always reflect this fully, particularly how the rise in the cost of living affects people at different levels in society.  It is a much more vague process that is subject to factors other than the automatic link that currently exists between pension entitlements and pay in the public sector.In other sections it is made clear that all of this, in any event, is in the gift of the Minister.  What is the connection between the consumer price index and increases in pension entitlements?  There is no automatic link and it is up to the Minister to decide if and when any increases in pension entitlements are given.  That is a serious deterioration in pension entitlements for future pensioners from the public service when compared to the current guaranteed system.I disagree with some of the details in the way Deputy Fleming made his contribution but the substantial point is correct.  The bottom line is that the Government will make a massive saving on the back of future public sector pensioners who will see a very serious degradation in pension entitlements.  As has been stated by me and Deputy McDonald, among others, we would have no problem if this was the case for the very highly paid public servants who walk off with very handsome public sector pensions.  These are politicians, Secretaries General, etc.  The bulk of these savings will be made on the back of degrading pensions of people who are, for the most part, low and middle income earners and whose consequent pension entitlements are not that generous.  It is another austerity attack to make life worse for future pensioners.It is a severe indictment of our society that not only will the young people in future be worse off than their parents but the pensioners of the future will be worse off than the pensioners from the last generation.  It is a rotten indictment of what is happening in our economy and society and the way in which we are heading.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to reinforce the point.  Everybody accepts that firefighters, prison officers and Army personnel do extremely difficult, arduous and sometimes very dangerous jobs and that it is entirely fair and reasonable that they retire earlier.  They should not be penalised more than others because of the nature of their jobs.  Judging from the tone of the Minister's response when this issue was raised on Committee Stage, he somehow seemed to think that because they have a shorter working life, they are getting an easier ride than everybody else and, consequently, it is somewhat more justified to put an excessive penalty on them in terms of the impact the new legislation will have on pension entitlements in the future.The unions were very clear when they appeared before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service that these categories of public sector workers would be disproportionately hit in terms of their future pension entitlements after the passing of this Bill.  They have not heard a convincing response to the contrary from the Government on that matter.  The Minister should have taken this on board and engaged more with the unions.Maybe the Minister of State can tell us definitively if the case they are making is wrong.  This concerns their pensions so I would say they have a fair idea how they work and how this Bill is likely to impact on them.  Is the Minister of State telling us that this is not the case and that they will not be disproportionately hit because they are pretty certain they will be, which would be unfair?  It is bad enough that many low and middle income public sector workers will see the quality of their pensions degraded but it is even more unfair if particular categories of people, who do difficult and dangerous work, are excessively penalised by the measures contained in this Bill.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to correct a comment made earlier.  Not all of us are in favour of a two-state solution.  Some of us believe the two-state solution is a recipe for ethnic cleansing of precisely the sort we have seen and continue to see by the rogue Israeli State.  At what point does the international community realise that Israel is a rogue state, that it is involved in ethnic cleansing, that it has no interest in a reasonable settlement with the Palestinians and that it must not just have the products of the Occupied Territories boycotted but should be treated in the same way as apartheid South Africa was and isolated by the international community as a whole?  It is not possible to separate what the Israeli military forces are doing in the Occupied Territories from the state itself because the decisions to allow further settlements, military incursions or whatever it may be are being taken in Israel proper.  They are being taken in Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and the headquarters of the Israeli defence forces.  At what point does the world say we will not allow Israel to do this anymore and boycott it until it treats Palestinians as equal citizens?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to make it clear that I have no time for the Iranian regime, nuclear weapons or nuclear power.  Can the Minister explain the extraordinary double standards that apply when it comes to the treatment of Iran as against the treatment of Israel?  Israel is ethnically cleansing Palestinians, illegally occupying their land and territory, denying them rights at every level, has launched more wars than any other state in the Middle East, has a nuclear arms arsenal, has refused to sign up the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and flouts all international laws in this regard but no sanctions are imposed on it.  However, Iran has signed up to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the International Atomic Energy Agency has said it is not developing a nuclear arms programme, and sanctions have been imposed on it.  I do not understand it.  Iran has never launched a war against anybody.  The supreme leader of Iran, no matter what the we may think of him, has said that nuclear weapons are an evil and that they should never be developed in Iran.  Why is it the case that all these sanctions and pressure are put on Iran and no sanctions or pressure are put on Israel which has 200 or 300 nuclear weapons and refuses to sign up to the nuclear anti-proliferation treaty?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 33:
In page 45, to delete lines 28 to 43 and in page 46, to delete lines 1 to 22.We are opposed to the switch to linking pensions to the consumer price index.  It will leave public sector pensioners worse off in the future.  The current scheme includes a guaranteed link between public sector pensions and public service pay.  That link is to be broken and pensions are to be linked to the more vague and volatile consumer price index.We are also concerned that the Minister is to have discretion as to when increases related to the consumer price index will be paid.During the debate on Committee Stage, the Minister gave an assurance that this would not be a problem.  It seems, however, that the legislation allows the Minister not to grant pension increases.  The power is entirely in the Minister's hands.  There is, at least, the possibility of a lag between a rise in the consumer price index and the granting of a public service pension increase.  Pension increases will not be automatically linked to the CPI but will be at the whim of the Minister of the day.  That is a problem.The savings the Government expects to make from this change are significant.  It is difficult to see how such significant savings could be projected from this measure if it did not mean a worsening of the pension entitlements of public sector pensioners in the future.We are opposed to anything that would degrade the quality of the pensions of ordinary public sector pensioners.  We would not have a difficulty if these changes were aimed at the top earners in the public service.  In fact, we would welcome that.  This is going to hit ordinary public and civil servants and degrade the quality of their pensions in the future.  This is unacceptable and we oppose this measure.  We believe the  status quo should be retained.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The State squandered it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister appears to be suggesting that this is favourable from the point of view of future pensioners in that any changes to future entitlements will be upward only.  He has stated also that there is nothing about this change about which we should be concerned.  However, section 4 - this point has already been made so I will try not to labour it - provides that the Minister shall decide when an increase in pensions under this section is to be paid having regard to movements in the consumer price index, including the timing and means by which any increase is paid.  This gives the Minister and any future Minister total flexibility in that he or she could chose not to pay because of particular circumstances which he or she believes justifies delaying payment.  It certainly creates the potential for a lag behind the increases in inflation or those which would derive if the current scheme was retained, under which there is no automatic link between salary and pension increases.  This provision provides for an opt-out by the Minister.  I accept that might not be the Minister's intention.  However, in my view the Bill as drafted gives the Minister enormous flexibility.The Minister may say that the Government has no intention of degrading the pensions of existing public servants.  I am sure the Government wishes to avoid any confrontation with the public service unions and that that is the reason these changes apply to new entrants only.  However, under the section which gives the Minister the power by order to extend the application of this new regime, under which pension increases will be linked to CPI rather than salary increases, the Minister or a future Minister could apply this change to current public servants.  This could happen given the fairly extraordinary times in which we are living, where dramatic fluctuations are occurring in the economic and financial environment.  Once the Minister has the power to apply this new mechanism of calculating pension entitlements and increases, he or any future Minister could impose that on existing public servants.  The Minister knows that he or a future Minister could do that.  It is a serious prospect.  For that reason, I oppose this measure and believe workers and trade unions should be well aware that this threat exists.Given the pressure which I suspect the Minister will come under from the troika to meet targets over the coming years and the strong likelihood of the economic situation deteriorating further, the possibility of the provisions of this Bill being used to attack and degrade the pension entitlements of existing public servants is very real.
