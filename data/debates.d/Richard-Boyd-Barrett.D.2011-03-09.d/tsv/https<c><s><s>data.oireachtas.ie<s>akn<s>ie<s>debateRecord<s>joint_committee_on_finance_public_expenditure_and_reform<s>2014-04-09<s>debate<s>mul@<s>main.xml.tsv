RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise for being in and out of the meeting but I had to go elsewhere to talk about something else.  In the first instance, I wish to ask the witnesses about the buy-to-let sector and Mr. O'Connor's comments on the majority of buy-to-lets in arrears.I think if I heard Mr. O'Connor correctly, he said that 90% of buy-to-let properties could ultimately end up repossessed, or is it just those that have gone down the legal road?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So that is 10% to 15% of all buy-to-let properties, but 90% of the 2,500.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Based on experience to date, what does Mr. O'Connor think will be the breakdown of the rest of the buy-to-let properties when the bank decides whether they can be restructured or whether it can go the legal repossession road?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are not the individual buy-to-let investments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The reason I ask this is because something has come to my attention in the last few weeks when I was contacted by several people who are tenants and who are the innocent bystanders in all this.  Their landlord has gone bust and is insolvent, and then they get a letter from the receiver saying that the receiver will be selling the property and the tenants have 30 days or 110 days to leave, depending on how long they have been there.  Many of those people are finding themselves in difficult or dire circumstances, because they have nowhere to go.  What is happening with AIB on this front?  What consideration has been given to the innocent tenants who may have been paying their rent faithfully all along and then find themselves in this situation?  How is AIB dealing with them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think it really needs to be examined.  Can I take it that Mr. O'Connor does not really know how the receivers are dealing with-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would appreciate it.  Yesterday I asked Ulster Bank representatives the same question and they gave me very positive reassurances, which were similar to those I have heard from the witnesses today, which is that if the person is paying the rent, it makes sense to leave the tenant in there even if the property is being sold on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know.  The tenants I was dealing with were in Wicklow, Sligo-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Ulster Bank representatives gave me positive assurances.  I did not know at the time that one of the cases with which I was dealing was with Ulster Bank.  Therefore, there was a flat contradiction between that and the reassurances I got yesterday.  Mr. Duffy obviously cannot be held accountable for what Ulster Bank representatives have to say, but they were very firm in saying-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not making an accusation.  It seems to be straight from the hip from them to say that this is the way we would sensibly deal with it, but then I dealt with somebody who received a letter from the receiver telling them to leave by a certain date and they told me that Ulster Bank was the bank involved.  That leads me to believe that maybe Ulster Bank does not know what is going on with the receivers it appoints and the tactics it is deploying.  I am just hoping that is not the situation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	One way to deal with this is that the banks should have to follow a code of conduct similar to that used for mortgage arrears.  Given what the witnesses have said, which is the reasonable approach whereby someone who is paying the rent should be kept and should not be told to get out, is there any way that AIB could adopt this approach voluntarily and tell its receivers to act accordingly?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is where the nub of the issue may be.  In a situation where rents are rising and where property values are rising, a receiver seeking the best value for the bank may well decide that the person is only paying €1,100 and the receiver can get €1,500, so it is better value for the bank to kick the person out and get in new tenants who can pay more.  The people who will be the victim of that are the people on the lower incomes.  This is contributing in the wider context to quite a significant degree of homelessness.  I would like to hear from the witnesses that this is not the sort of mercenary attitude that will be employed in situations involving AIB.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will follow it closely.  I appreciate the clarification.  Can I ask about the unemployed, people who have very low incomes or who are dependent on social welfare?Is AIB offering them solutions that do not involve handing over the house, if that is what they want to do?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is fairly general.  One could draw from that response that if somebody is out of work and solely dependent on social welfare, what he or she can afford is pretty limited.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the mortgage to rent solution, AIB states it has offered 300 of them.  Are people looking for a mortgage to rent solution, particularly those who are unemployed or on low incomes and so on?  What is the level of interest in this solution?  It seems it is the best last resort option for many of those on low incomes who do not know when they might get back into employment.  Also, could AIB be a little more specific about the hold-up and what can be done about it?  It seems to be stating the issue is very complicated and that this is what is slowing it up.  What are the complications and what can we or the Government do to eliminate them in order that this becomes a more workable option?
