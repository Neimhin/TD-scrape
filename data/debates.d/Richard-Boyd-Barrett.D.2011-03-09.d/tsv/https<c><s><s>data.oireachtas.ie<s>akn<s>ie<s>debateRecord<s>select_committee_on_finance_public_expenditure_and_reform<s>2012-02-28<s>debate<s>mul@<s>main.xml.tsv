RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would like to comment on one issue and ask a question on another.  How is research and development defined for the purposes of this tax credit?  It seems to me that it would be possible for people to define all sorts of things as research and development in order to avoid tax.  What safeguards are in place to ensure that this is not just another way for the corporate sector which, in my opinion, already pays ridiculously low taxes, to pay even less tax?  Unless there are clearly defined criteria in regard to what constitutes research and development, this could be used as a tax avoidance measure.Just as in the case of the special assignee relief programme, SARP, which we will come to later, this is pretty nauseating given huge numbers of people, who one could just as easily argue deserve incentives, be they in the public or private sector, have had incentives robbed from them in the form of the universal social charge and have had all sorts of cuts, including cuts in income, imposed on them.  Is there not an enormous double standard here?  High-fliers or whizz kids, or however the Minister of State chooses to define them, will be given financial incentives to work harder, but vast numbers of others are having disincentives imposed on them, even though we require them to work just as hard.  In fact, to use the Minister of State's famous slogan, he wants more for less.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is the Government's - it wants more for less.  Hundreds of thousands of public sector workers are being asked to work more for less.  Where are the incentives for them?  They have been taken from them in the form of the universal social charge and other levies.  Why is there is no consistency in the application of the logic of incentives, as set out in the Bill?  Why does one group deserve incentives, while others do not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am referring to the tax breaks for research and development.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.  The same logic applies to the SARP which we will discuss later.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it specifically defined as scientific research and development?  A big emphasis has been placed by the Government on financial services.  Are we going to reward people for coming up with ingenious or dastardly financial instruments such as those that helped the economy and the global economy to crash?  Could it be defined as research and development if someone comes up with new variations of hedge funds, derivatives and futures?  That might be seen as a plus for the financial services sector but a minus for the rest of the economy.While I am absolutely in favour of research and development, it should be applicable across the board.  I do not agree with making a distinction in incentivising one group categorised as being involved in research and development and not incentivising teachers whose contribution to the future development of society is every bit as important as that of those engaged in research and development, nurses or street cleaners.  All of the people concerned are equally as deserving of financial incentives if the Government believes that is what needs to be done to advance society and encourage people to be creative and come up with new ideas.  Why should we single out one narrowly defined group rather than apply it across the board?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wanted a response to the question on the financial instruments in particular, but to all of my questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Although I think I have the answer, can it apply to, for example, financial whiz kids coming up with new financial instruments?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just worry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think I have a legitimate worry in that we will all be aware that these obscure financial instruments which not many fully understand played a significant role in destabilising the entire global economy.  Somebody sat down and thought, "This is a brilliant idea", and somebody else said, "Yes, this is a great idea.  We can make a lot of money out of it".  However, the macro effect of these great ideas was disastrous.I would be quite concerned about a definition of research and development that provided an incentive to persons in an area which, notwithstanding our differences, almost everybody agrees must be more regulated and controlled.  It is a reasonably serious concern to provide an incentive to come up with new and devilish ideas for making more complex or innovative ways of making money on the financial markets.The Minister of State did not really answer the question.  I think I know from where he is coming but as it happens I do not agree.  I half-glibbly said it but the more I think about it, the more I think it is true.  To my mind, a street cleaner who is creative in his or her job is contributing potentially as much, if not more, to job creation in this country by contributing to the tourist potential of the country as somebody who is in a white coat and has a degree coming up with whatever it might be - some technological development.  I do not see why the Minister of State distinguishes between one and the other, especially as he cannot quantify what jobs may be created or he states there will not be any real cost-benefit analysis as to what jobs may be created as a result of this kind of incentive.  Arguably, if we had more motivated street cleaners and the streets were cleaner as a result, that would yield as much in terms of tourism jobs as somebody who happens to be wearing a white coat and has a degree.
