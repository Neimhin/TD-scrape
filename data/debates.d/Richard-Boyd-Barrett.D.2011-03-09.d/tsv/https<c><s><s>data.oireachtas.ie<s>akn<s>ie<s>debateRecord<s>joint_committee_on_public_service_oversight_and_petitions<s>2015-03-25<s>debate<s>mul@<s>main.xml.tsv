If the station is to be truly reflective of Irish society, we would want to see the situation improve. I take the point made by RTE that it complies with equality legislation and tries to recruit people based on merit. What springs to mind is the issue of gender quotas, although one wants to improve gender balance on the other hand, one wants to recruit on the basis of merit. That is a reasonable response. It is positive that the petitioner has said that since the petition was submitted and the committee has engaged with RTE, some improvement has been detected. RTE seems to be saying that it will bear in mind the concerns of the petitioner and we could ask it to make a little extra effort and reach out more to the new communities by advertising posts in some of the newspapers that the new communities read, such as Metro or the Polish newspaper. People in the new communities might not be aware of the post beings advertised and could be made aware of the jobs if they were advertised in the media they read. I hope that RTE will bear in mind the general consideration.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If I could comment, I met the petitioner on a number of occasions. As I explained to him, neither I nor this committee is in a position to adjudicate on the specific events that occurred with him. However, he seems to raise some legitimate concerns and a legitimate issue as to whether there is a level playing field when a student - one could more generally say "an individual" - is dealing with a large institution with all the resources, particularly legal resources in cases of dispute, that it has available and whether there is an independent dispute resolution mechanism where both sides have equal resources at their disposal to adequately represent themselves and ensure fair adjudication of any dispute. The petition is strengthened in raising the issues in that it references the Hunt report produced by former Ms Justice Catherine McGuinness which has independently identified that there are issues to do with governance and properly resourcing and supporting students. The report deals particularly with third level, but the issues could apply to other levels as well, for students to have the support necessary to ensure the best experience and a fair interaction with college authorities, particularly in situations of dispute. These are serious matters. As the recommendations from the secretariat indicate, we should ask the Department of Education and Skills precisely what are the procedures and also to look at what goes on in third level institutions to deal with situations of dispute or allegations of bullying or malpractice.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Have we a schedule of the big ticket items that are coming up in the next while and what slots are available? The reason I ask is because there is one particular petition of which I am aware that was submitted recently from representatives of the taxi drivers and it is time constrained. There is a new regime of charging and also to do with the metering in taxis which requires them all to get new meters. They feel they have not been adequately consulted on this change. They have submitted a petition to look at the consultation issue. The time constraint is towards the end of April and they were hoping they might get a chance to put their case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is towards the end of April which, I accept, is a short timeframe for us. However, it is a fairly substantial issue affecting a lot of people. They deserve their opportunity to put their case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That would be great.
