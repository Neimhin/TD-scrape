RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On our productivity figures, how distorted would Professor Clinch say Irish productivity figures are by the presence and domination of a small number of information technology, IT, multinationals? We have had to develop a new measure of the economy, namely GNI* because of the distortions created by their predominance. I put it to Professor Clinch that we need a "productivity*" measure of Irish productivity because we cannot rely in any shape or form on the productivity figures as they are so distorted. I would like to hear Professor Clinch's comment on it. Is any work being done on some kind of accurate measure of productivity that strips out the distorting effects of those companies and gives us a real measure of productivity?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As a follow-on from that, would Professor Clinch say that too many of the tax credits, tax reliefs and supports are essentially benefiting that 10% of firms and that we need to radically and dramatically shift supports and expenditures into areas that will boost the domestic economy and reduce those costs, unlock those bottlenecks and so on rather than continuing to direct an awful lot of it towards those 10%? If research and development tax relief is taken as an example, the vast bulk of that is going to a tiny number of firms as against any real benefit to the domestic sector. Would Professor Clinch agree with that? How radical is the shift that we need on that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Much of it is about education and investment therein. While that is a broad brush-stroke comment, we need a hell of a lot more money to be invested in our universities and we need to develop and tailor our education system, without making it a completely utilitarian education system because I do not like that either. Much higher levels of investment in that regard are nonetheless part of the answer. Professor Clinch suggested that prices have not risen a great deal, although he is slightly worried about labour cost increases. To what extent does he believe that labour cost increases relate to particular costs that workers are incurring? Notwithstanding Professor Clinch's more general comment that prices are not rising, he has identified high costs in particular areas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It seems these are significant problems, leading workers to have no choice but to make pay demands. Housing costs are off the charts. Childcare has been identified and the professor pointed out that transport is another area where there has been a consistent rise in costs, which seems to go against any attempt to deal with climate change or congestion. How does Professor Clinch expect those areas to be addressed? Workers have no choice but to make pay demands if they cannot meet those costs. In all those areas, it seems the market is just not capable of reducing those costs. In housing, it is clear the market is not reducing costs and there is no sign it will do so in the near future. I do not see how transport costs will fall if they are left to the market, while I do not see, realistically, how childcare costs will decrease. Does Professor Clinch agree that is the case, and if so, what are we going to do about it? Do we have to invest far higher levels of subsidy in these areas if we are to reduce those costs?
