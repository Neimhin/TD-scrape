RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are staying on Coillte.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Minister knows and I have made clear, even considering a plan for selling State forests is repugnant and should be abandoned. Will the Minister give straight answers to my questions? As I understand it, he committed to selling the harvesting rights to the troika, but he now says he is considering it. Is that a change?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Under the troika programme, the Minister committed to selling the Coillte harvesting rights. Is that true? If he now says he is considering this, does this mean he is backtracking on that commitment or that there is a possibility of changing the agreement with the troika? The lack of information and transparency around the proposed or considered sale of the harvesting rights stinks to high heaven. There is no information on the value of the harvesting rights. In recent years some â‚¬108 million worth of forestry has been sold, most of which we believe has been sold to banks. Why was that forestry sold and to whom was it sold? What conditions surrounded these sales in maintaining the sustainability of Irish forestry? The Glennon sawmills indicated that 1.5 million cu. m of forest were cut down last year, although the forest strategy stated sustainable forestry would be based on a maximum of 1 million cu. m and guaranteed replanting of 25,000 ha. We cannot obtain information on how many hectares have been replanted, but I understand only 5,000 acres have. This suggests we are already in a situation where there is deforestation or unsustainable forestry production. Can we have the facts? Where are the annual reports of the forest service? What happened to the review of Irish forestry initiated by the previous Government and abandoned by the current Government? What valuations are being made of harvesting rights? Without this information and proper public consultation - we do not even know what the Minister is considering selling - we cannot work out whether the sale of harvesting rights represents asset stripping.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no proper information on these areas.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For example, why have so many harvesting rights been sold by Coillte in recent years? Was there a tendering process in each of those cases, as required under EU law? What conditions applied to those sales? These are serious questions, particularly given that one of the main beneficiaries of those sales was the Irish Forestry Unit Trust, which consists of Bank of Ireland, AIB and Irish Life. We know that banks like the Chinese state bank, the Swiss banks and possibly the Irish banks are lining up to take over our State forests. The Minister referred to the planting of 7,000 ha, but the forest strategy says we should be planting 25,000 ha.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not according to the website of the Forest Service, which I looked at today.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Forest Service does not produce proper annual reports. According to its website, the target is 25,000 ha. The Minister has said that the current rate of planting is 7,000 ha. We have evidence that 1.5 million cu. m of forests have been cut down. When all of that is added together, it is clear that we have deforestation in this country. We are not meeting our targets. We need a comprehensive analysis of this. I am not the only person who wants to know what is going on. All sorts of stakeholders want to know. All of this information should be in the public domain. Why are we not organising an independent assessment like that done in the UK, with open and transparent public consultation as part of the process? When that happened in the UK, the plan was abandoned.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These questions are coming from people in the forestry sector.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has said this question has been asked previously and getting an answer to it is particularly important in the context of the possible, or proposed, sale of harvesting rights. No doubt the Minister will say that is a different issue and that we are not selling the land, just the harvesting rights. In that context, if the profitable bit of State forestry is taken over by private interests and we are left with responsibility for the maintenance of the rest, the pressures on whatever agency is left running the rest to be sold further down the line because it will not have the means to generate revenue will become very great. I certainly believe we will be on a slippery slope towards full-scale privatisation of forests. That is the reason we should not even consider starting down that road.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given that 7% of the landmass of the country is in the hands of Coillte, would it not be a priority to ascertain what is under that forestry and those lands in terms of mineral deposits such as oil, gas, sand, stone, gravel and so on which potentially could be very valuable? We need to know what valuable resources we have in the State, particularly at this time.Should the Government not take a more urgent interest in this, just as it should take more interest in the detail of what is happening in such an important company? Does the Minister believe we need to know more?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In any of these matters, I am for weighing up the risks and benefits. Putting an oil rig 6 km off the coast was all risk for the public and of no benefit given the licensing regime. That is also true if the Minister is making an oblique or not-so-oblique reference to fracking. We need to examine the environmental dangers. In any event, given the licensing and taxation regime, there is nothing in it for us. Therefore, why would we even dream of taking a risk in that context? What we and the public need to know are the facts. Who wants what Coillte has, and what does it have? To make any informed judgments on these matters, we need to know what we have. I suspect that some people know a hell of a lot more about what we have and its potential than we do. It is in this context that I am asking my question. I certainly believe that the sorts of people who might buy the harvesting rights or, at a later stage, State forestry will just be interested in the quick buck rather than the sustainable management of natural resources in the interest of the people and country as a whole.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister's most recent response is the most worrying I have heard yet. He said he is giving assurances and then he said that things might change in the future. How can we be confident of his assurances that public access to State forestry will be protected if the profitable part of Coillte's business is sold off and the State is left holding the baby in terms of the public amenity element? If the revenue-generating element of State forestry is sold off to the private sector, it seems that either we will forced to sell the public amenities later or we will be forced to start charging for admission to those amenities, both of which would be utterly unacceptable. To my mind, the best thing the Minister could do is abandon this sad and sorry plan.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How will we fund them?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is vital that there be transparency and accountability in terms of the influence of this extraordinarily privileged group of bankers and financiers who have unprecedented access to the Department of the Taoiseach. The clearing house group is made up of J.P. Morgan, Citibank, State Street Bank, Barclays, Bank of Ireland, KPMG, Bank of America, Deloitte, AIB, Ernst & Young, PricewaterhouseCoopers and others. The fact that the Secretary General of the Department chairs the group, that it and its sub-committees meet in Government Buildings and that following last year's budget, the group had an effect on 21 sections of the Finance Bill to the benefit of the financial services sector is something the public needs to know. The public and I might well ask where is the group for the unemployed or pensioners-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a simple question for the Taoiseach in the aftermath of the wipe-out of senior bondholders in Cyprus. Is the reason senior bondholders never took a hit in this country and that the Government will not introduce a financial transaction tax, instead of imposing a property tax on ordinary householders, the influence of the clearing house group? Is that the reason senior bondholders were never touched? Is it the reason the Government will not introduce even a small extra tax on the financial sector and just keeps hitting ordinary people? Is it the people in the clearing house group who are dictating financial policy in this country?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach agree that the level of influence and privileged access given to the Clearing House Group is completely disproportionate to that given to other sectors? I ask that question with particular reference to what has happened in Cyprus. The people of Cyprus have learned to their cost what can happen as a result of over-reliance on a financial services sector that is involved in trading money across global markets, etc. We have also learned from Cyprus that it is possible to burn senior bondholders. We were told that could not happen here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not a dangerous strategy for this country to give privileged access to a group that has clearly had a major influence on policy, for example, in the case of the proposed financial transactions tax? A new tax exemption in the area of derivatives and securitisation was introduced in the recent Finance Bill. Some 21 amendments were made to last year's Finance Bill. This group gets more privileged access to the Department of the Taoiseach and the Government than other sectors of our society. Is that not an accident waiting to happen?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The claim that there would be a democratic revolution in how government was conducted has not translated into reality. It appears as if the cronies of one tribe are replaced with those of the other. The hope was that there would be a genuine opening up of the process to allow people who were outside the cliques and the networks, outside the existing organisations, to have a real input into how the different agencies and sectors linked with the Government were overseen, managed and developed. I have deep concerns about the management of the harbour company in my area.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, the process employed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He has a role in the process through which-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He sets an example. I was just giving it as an example of the process through which selections for State boards occur and saying that it is the case that it does not match up to the promises of a democratic revolution. I do not want to cast any aspersions on the people the Taoiseach himself appointed. I am sure all the people the Taoiseach mentioned are very capable. It is interesting, however, that almost all of them are full-time officials or academics. They are full-time officials of NGOs and unions, academics and business people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are important sectors and that is civil society. While I accept that it is right and proper that they should be represented, where is the opening up of appointments to those who are not within those loops? I am talking about ordinary people who are a bit further down society's hierarchy and who might have a real interest in and knowledge of these areas. They may work on the shop floor and the front line but they never get access to boards. They never really have input into these areas. Until people see a change there, the perception will continue that the cronies of one political tribe or another dominate these boards.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I mean people who are not full-time officials or part of the academic elite.
