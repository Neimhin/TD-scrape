RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be gone after 7 p.m. as I have another engagement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 7, between lines 16 and 17, to insert the following:“2. In the case of public service pensioners who are not in receipt of a contributory social welfare pension, universal social charge will be reckoned on their gross total public service pension(s) less the amount of contributory social welfare pension commensurate with their length of pensionable service.”.I am moving the amendment on behalf of Deputy Seamus Healy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I stated, it is Deputy Healy's amendment. I merely wanted to get the Minister's response for the record. Is the Minister saying it is primarily for technical reasons that he cannot accept the amendment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Minister have a figure for how expensive it would be?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I presume Deputy Healy will come back to this issue on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister's first comment was that in some ways the view on these matters depends on the overall view of society. In some ways it is a philosophical discussion that is probably wasted in this type of forum and dealing with this Bill. Just for the record, it is worth putting the alternative view. The first issue is the immediacy of these measures. I do not see how anybody can justify giving anything to people earning in excess of €70,000, €100,000, €150,000 or €200,000 if it comes at the cost of being able to assist people now living in poverty in getting out of poverty. In other words, even if I accepted the Minister's philosophical view that we need to incentivise people at the top, and I will make a point about that later-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not agree with the Deputy on certain issues at all, although I agree on some matters. At a basic level, there are people who are working but who cannot afford to pay rent. There are civil and public servants coming to my office who cannot pay rent and who are using homeless services or sleeping in cars. When that is happening, regardless of ideology, every single bit of available relief should go to helping such people.Let us forget about ideology, philosophy and incentivising people at the top. I maintain there is simply no justification for giving to those on €70,000, €80,000, €100,000 or more in this way. Whatever else one may say about those people, they can pay the bills. They are not in danger, for the most part, of losing their homes. However, the vast majority of people on low pay are in a situation where they are actually having difficulty keeping roofs over their heads. We have this problem and it is getting worse. The take-home pay of people is insufficient to cover the bills and keep a roof over their heads. Against that background, does the Minister not accept that he simply must engineer tax changes such that every cent is directed at bringing that group up to the point where they are not coming home after a week's work unable to pay to keep a roof over their heads? Whatever way the Minister wants to do it is fine - I do not care. It is self-evident that we should do this and, against that background, what the Minister has done is simply not good enough. The Minister may argue that he has capped the benefits that may have accrued otherwise. I accept the Minister has done that, but in the current scenario whereby we have the phenomena of the working poor, far more radical measures are necessary, and I do not believe they are contained in the budget. Does the Minister recognise the connection between growing wage differentials among top earners and low and average earners? That gap is growing all the time. It is connected to growth in inequality generally and wealth inequality in particular. Any serious studies undertaken on the subject confirm that the wage and salary hierarchy contributes over time to a growing gap between rich and poor. In other words, if a person earns €100,000 or €150,000 per year, he need not spend all of it to stay alive. The person can save and invest. That money makes profit for him and it accumulates over time. By contrast, the person on low income who has to borrow to pay the bills or do most things is getting poorer on a cumulative basis over time. Wage differentials contribute to growing wealth inequality. There is a significant if not a majority consensus now to the effect that the wealth inequality flowing from income inequality is one of the biggest problems we face. This is clearly evident in Irish society, just as it is a pattern throughout the world. In approaching budgets, we should seek to address that and rebalance things. We should have taxes that are redistributive, Robin Hood taxes, if I can put it that way. They should take from the rich to give to the poor because the gap is too big. I will offer an obvious example. The Minister might hold that we have to incentivise the man at the top, for example, a banker, who may be on €500,000 per year or more. I struggle to see why a banker should get paid ten times or 11 times what a nurse gets paid. Is it because of the length of hours worked or the level of responsibility? I am afraid I see no great difference in that regard. Arguably, the nurse is doing far more of a service than the banker. I do not see how one can justify a differentiation by a factor of ten between what one and the other earns. Perhaps the Minister disagrees with that, but I struggle to see the justification. Against that background, if I were Minister for Finance, I would hold that we need a tax system which at least reduces the gap in net income between those two groups because it has grown spectacularly. Moreover, it contributes in the macro sense to a growing gap in wealth inequality. It is summed up by some of the biggest billionaires in this country who at this point make money because they have money. Do we not need to do something about that? Is there not something wrong with that? Let us suppose a person has €1 billion. He can add to his personal wealth, probably by 5% per year or perhaps 10%, not because he works longer hours or because he is more educated but simply because he has a great deal of money to start with. Any fair approach to taxation would recognise that there is something wrong with the idea that people get richer simply because they are rich while other people who are working their backs off are struggling to pay the bills. Is that not correct? I put those points to the Minister. I can guess what the answer will be. Nonetheless I believe these are serious issues which are not being addressed. In fact, I believe they are not even recognised by the Government as issues that need to be addressed. A growing chorus of voices maintains that these gaps between rich and poor in terms of income and wealth have to be addressed for the sake of justice and for the sake of macroeconomic stability as well.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I imagine those people would not be too happy with our wealth tax proposals.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is about the multiple properties they own.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be brief. I do not want to labour this point because we fundamentally disagree on it. The Minister has not addressed the question I put to him about wealth inequality. Does he see it as a problem? He will be aware that many people - including Thomas Piketty most famously and David McWilliams more recently in this country - have argued that growing wealth inequality is a problem. Obviously, we have been making that point for a long time. It is a problem at the social justice level and it is becoming a macroeconomic problem because too few people control too much money. It is estimated that the personal wealth of the richest man in Ireland has increased from €2 billion in 2006 to €6 billion this year. At a time when the rest of the country has been getting poorer, his personal wealth has trebled. Does the Minister agree that such a level of concentration of wealth, which is echoed around the world, is a problem? I am asking a straight question. I am one of many people who see it as a problem. I suggest that the only way for the Minister to address this problem is to introduce radical redistributive tax measures which are Robin Hood in nature, to put it in simple terms. I do not say this to encourage a vendetta against middle class people or anything like that. I say it in the context of the recognition that there is a level of inequality that cannot be justified because it is dangerous for society and the economy. Does the Minister have any sympathy with that view, which is a growing one? To my mind, it is obvious. For the record, we have said that taxes should not be imposed on the family home. As the Minister knows, we have said that wealth taxes, including taxes on property, should apply to all other assets excluding the family home over a certain threshold of wealth. I ask him to believe me when I say that someone who owns multiple properties or who owns a mansion would pay a hell of a lot more under our proposals. We do not agree with a property tax that hits the family home and fails to take account of the income which may be coming into that home. The Minister is very familiar with this argument, so it is a bit disingenuous of him to misrepresent it. In my constituency, there are many cases of people who happen to live in properties that are valuable because property prices are high in their local areas. The Minister knows that many people live in houses with values that bear no relation whatsoever to the incomes coming into those houses. Many pensioners on very small pensions - sometimes the State pension - are being taxed excessively on the basis of the value of their houses. That is the injustice that led us to oppose the Minister's property tax and to propose a different type of wealth tax. I ask the Minister to be honest when he is characterising the position we have put. The Minister could double, treble or quadruple the second home tax and it would be okay with me because it would get at multiple property owners. We would not be talking about someone's primary residence. I emphasise that a tax on somebody's primary residence that does not take account of income is just not fair.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I did not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think "disingenuous" was the word I used.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Cheaper accommodation would go a lot further.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am trying to get my head fully around this. On foot of lobbying by foreign direct investment companies, which we can understand to be large multinationals which already make extraordinary profits and pay very low levels of effective tax, we will concede yet another tax break. This follows the SARP tax break.There was also a tax break for these executives to send their children to private schools, and now we have another one. I struggle to find a justification for this because it seems wide open to abuse. It seems that yet again we are subsidising these corporations. How does the Minister respond to this? I do not see why these companies should not just foot the bill and the costs, and make their own arrangements in some way with their employees. The idea that we are giving a tax break to them seems like a hidden subsidy to the companies themselves or to their better paid personnel. Would the Minister think of capping the amount that could be charged to travel and subsistence expenses so that we do not give people a tax break to use the most expensive forms of transport and the most luxurious and plush hotels and milk the expenses in this way? There is no guard against this in the measure the Minister is introducing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is to stop people just flying in for holidays and handing it in against expenses?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not convinced.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This section deals with health insurance. Are the provisions of the section related to the lifetime community rating for health insurance?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is the Minister incentivising young people to take out private health insurance? Is that not a case of the State acting on behalf of private health insurance companies?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am in favour of greater investment in forestry. We need to do more than we are at the moment. The largest block to our having the levels of afforestation that we require is the fact that the State forestry company has effectively been ruled out of engaging in new planting, which is ridiculous. I see the Minister's logic in this case. In the harvesting year, one's income is high. A high income in a harvest year would not necessarily reflect one's income every year. Should there not be a ceiling or the like whereby we could distinguish between someone who had large amounts of forestry and was making mega-profits and a small or medium-sized farmer who had only one year in which his or her income went over the line? I understand why the Minister would not want to penalise the latter, but should he not distinguish between such people and those who have much larger farms or ranches?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We should have them in cities. Seriously - we need it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have returned into the area of fundamental differences and perspectives. For the record, I think the lack of economic literacy is on the part of the Minister and not on our part. It is worth mentioning, in the context of what has been said about consistency, that the Taoiseach once said he was "morally" opposed to putting taxes on the family home. There is a lack of consistency there because it has now become the only practical method of levying tax. Strangely, that was not the Taoiseach's view a few years ago. If we are talking about consistency, I must point out that we have been genuinely consistent, and will remain so, in saying that we think taxes on the family home, as against so-called property taxes, treat huge swathes of people unfairly. That is the substance of our argument and it should not be mischaracterised. The Minister's incentives are primarily directed at the wealthiest sections of society. We are talking about the top 5% or 10%. Such people are the beneficiaries of the Minister's incentives, by and large. We are not talking about people on €60,000, €70,000 or €80,000, who are described by the Minister as the middle class. Approximately 5% of earners earn over €100,000 a year. According to the replies to our questions that we have received from the Minister, the average income of such people is approximately €185,000. We are also talking about the super profits of a small number of multinational corporations that have benefited from how this country's tax system is set up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will finish by saying that the Minister's current approach might lead to temporary benefits, but it stores up big problems in the long term. We saw that with property. We think the Minister is doing the same thing now by focusing on foreign direct investment at the expense of the rest of the economy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The elderly are not the only people who own such homes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is just a question of moving on the debt.
