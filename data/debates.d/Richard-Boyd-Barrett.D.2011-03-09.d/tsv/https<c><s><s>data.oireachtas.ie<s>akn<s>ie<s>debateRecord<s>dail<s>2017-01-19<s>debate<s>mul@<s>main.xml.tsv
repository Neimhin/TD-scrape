RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So, we are calling the Leaders.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Disability rights activists are outside the Dáil as we speak, and I am passing on their request to the Tánaiste. They want to know when the promised legislation to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will come before the House, be debated and ratified? One of those outside made a very simple point to me, namely, that North Korea, a tin-pot dictatorship, has signed the convention, yet we have dragged our heels for the best part of a decade. Could the Tánaiste provide me with the details so that I give those outside an answer as to when, precisely, the Bill to deal with this matter will come before the House and the timescale for it to be concluded?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure that is true of North Korea.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will give two minutes of my time to Deputy Brassil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise. I always get the two Deputies mixed up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I apologise.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the new politics at work, the left is giving time to Fianna Fáil, but it is taking the right position on the Bill. I commend Deputy Pringle for bringing forward this excellent Bill. Trócaire and a rake of other NGOs and environmental groups are campaigning in support of the Bill. It is a simple practical Bill to try to move in a serious direction towards addressing the danger of climate change, which is a threat to the future of the planet and the future of our children. I find incredibly depressing the Minister of State's speech, the Government's amendment and the general attitude of the Government when it comes to this most important of issues. What we get is scripted, dry and tokenistic lip-service paid to the issue of dealing with climate change, but when it comes to doing something, even something relatively modest such as this, which is getting ISIF, part of the NTMA's portfolio, to divest from fossil fuels, we do not want to do it. We pose in front of the cameras, go along to Paris and give pious speeches about how much we care about climate change, but when it comes down to the nitty-gritty of doing something the Government resists it. The dry tone and scripted speech just reflects this. The Government does not care. It does not take this issue seriously. In fact, whenever the need to do something about climate change impacts on the real interests the Government actually cares about, we see its true colours. That is what this is all about. It is about a Government that is, in actuality, protecting the very interests who do not want to do anything because they have a stake and money to be made by ensuring real action on climate change is not taken. We get all the pious words after Paris, but then we get a Government that cuts public service obligation bus routes. How the hell will we deal with climate change if we do not expand public transport?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not increasing. The Government wants to cut routes and privatise them. Several routes in my area have already been cut.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not interrupt the Minister of State.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The truth hurts. The Government overrides proper building standards when it comes to passive house standards and insulation because it would upset the developers. This is the reason. The Government has special pleading on Ireland's CO2 targets and we have no chance, according to anybody looking at it seriously, of reaching the targets necessary to meet our Paris commitment. The Government will not do it because it wants to protect the beef barons. It is as simple as that. The beef barons come first. Short-term profit of a particular group of people comes first. Here is exactly the same thing. It is all about profit. We will sell the future regardless of the consequences because we do not want to stand up to the vested interests. This is particularly important when we consider what is happening in the United States at present, with the election of Donald Trump. We now have a President who is putting people in key positions in his Administration who are actively out to sabotage the movement to deal with climate change. It is literally giving two fingers to the battle to do something about climate change, deliberate no doubt on Trump's part, to appoint Rex Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil, one of the biggest, if not the biggest, offender in the whole area of CO2 emissions, and in which ISIF has significant investments. It is one of four big culprits in which we have invested through ISIF. Scott Pruitt has already been mentioned with regard to the EPA. These people are declaring war on the environment in the interests of profit. At this moment it is critical that we stand up and push in the other direction and show publicly we will fight to do something about climate change. The Government states it will cost. Does the Minister of State not get it? We must deal with climate change, and even the Paris Agreement does not go half-way near. Most scientists now state even if we manage to meet the Paris commitments, and we probably will not because even the Irish Government is making special pleadings on those commitments, we will not deal with the problem. Some scientists now state we could be looking at an increase in temperatures of up to 7% within this century. If we think about the fact the ice age was caused by a 5% drop in temperature, think about the ice age in reverse. Life was extinguished during the ice age in huge parts of the globe because it was too cold. Think about huge parts of the globe literally being boiled alive, making parts of the planet uninhabitable and the desperate dire consequences for millions of people and our children. This is what I call a cost. It is a real cost. It is a cost which our children and grandchildren will suffer, but the Government protects on a short-term basis the profits and interest of people who do not care about this but want to make money in the here and now, regardless of the consequences for the future.This is an absolute no-brainer, a small thing. If he is not willing to support it, as he has clearly indicated is the case, it is all hypocrisy. The stuff about commitments to climate change is all hypocrisy. Since Trump has been elected there has been an interesting narrative that tries to compare the populist right, represented by Trump, and the left who are apparently similar, with the moderate, sensible, pragmatic centre which is apparently the guys in Government. When it comes to practicalities, they are with Trump. They say it in a nicer way but they are actually with Trump and the climate deniers. They are with the business interests that do not want to do anything to save this planet. That hypocrisy cannot stand but they will be beaten on this one.
