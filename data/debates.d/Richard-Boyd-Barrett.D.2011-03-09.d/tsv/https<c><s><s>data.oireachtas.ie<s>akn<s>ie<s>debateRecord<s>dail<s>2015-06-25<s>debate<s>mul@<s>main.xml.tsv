RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What does the Minister think the US troops do in Afghanistan? Eat cakes?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They did in Vietnam.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I listened with interest to the Minister’s definition of neutrality in the context of the worsening situation in the Black Sea area. The Minister was excusing the Fine Gael MEPs' decision to vote for this motion, which backs possible North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, NATO, military build-up in the Black Sea. What is the Government’s position on the NATO military build-up and the motion calling for increased defence spending in Europe specifically to support this initiative?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The motion that was passed calls for an increase in defence spending to 2% of gross domestic product, GDP, in the specific context of calling for greater military build-up in the Black Sea area, which is becoming the epicentre of a new cold war and where there is a constant aggressive build-up by the US and NATO. The European Union is now pushing to get involved. Does the Minister not think that our job as a neutral country is to stand up and warn against this, and say we should not be doing this? Is there a connection between this call to increase spending to 2% of GDP and the fact that the German Government is supporting a debt write-down for Ukraine but the Greek Government, which has called for a reduction in defence spending, is getting very different treatment from the German Government? Is this the sort of geopolitical manoeuvring that is going on and what is our view of it? Should we not be calling foul?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister not deeply concerned that the European Parliament has passed a motion calling for increased military expenditure across Europe, specifically to back a military build-up in the Black Sea? This has been done against a background in which the United States assistant secretary of state for eastern European affairs, Victoria Nuland, used the immortal words "Fuck the EU" in an eavesdropped communication. She was involved in manipulating----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was quoting Ms Nuland's words.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My apologies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was simply quoting the US assistant secretary of state for eastern Europe. The Minister stated he trusts the US Government, yet this is its attitude to the European Union. It was manipulating the political process in Ukraine.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have read it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a copy of the motion here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This document is a manifesto for a third world war.
