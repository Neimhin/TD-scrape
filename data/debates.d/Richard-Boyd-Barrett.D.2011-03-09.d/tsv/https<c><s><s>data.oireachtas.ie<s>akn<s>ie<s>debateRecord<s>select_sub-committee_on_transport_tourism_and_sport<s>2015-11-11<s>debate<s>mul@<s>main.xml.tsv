RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 6, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:“ “Stakeholder and Community Group” means a group comprising elected representatives of all bona fide harbour user groups as well as resident and community groups across the local authority area;”.I thank Deputy Fleming for tabling these amendments for me. This series of amendments goes to the heart of all the amendments I have proposed. There are 28 or 30 in total and they relate to who we will listen to when it comes to developing and managing our harbours and what their priorities are. I cannot speak about other harbours and I do not intend to do so. That is up to people from those areas and the various stakeholders in other harbours, such as Drogheda, and that is how it should be. From my experience in Dún Laoghaire, there is a big problem. Since I was elected, I have flagged it extensively with the Minister and his predecessor. People believe the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company is a law unto itself and that they have no real input into what goes on there, what plans are developed and what the priorities of the harbour should be.That has led to great controversy and great conflict, which we have seen manifest itself in the oral hearing that has been taking place for the past four weeks. The oral hearing has been very polarised. It is not my spin; it is a fact that the two sides in the conflict consist of almost every group representing the community, harbour users and the public pitted against the harbour company. It is not just about this development but it is important to say that the development, which is at the centre of the oral hearing, is part of the master plan that was developed. It is a very extensive plan produced by the harbour company in 2011. It sets out a number of plans for the harbour that include private apartments, a floating barge and swimming pool, and parts of the harbour have been put up for sale recently in connection with the master plan. The public did not ask for that. A total of 130 submissions have been made by groups and individuals. The overwhelming majority of them oppose, root and branch, what the harbour company is doing. In a previous non-statutory, so-called public consultation in 2011 on the development of the plan, almost all of the submissions at the time were to the effect that people did not like the plan or key elements of it. The plan was not changed or amended and the harbour company just charged ahead. That gets to the heart of the problem, namely, to whom are those people accountable. I also raised serious governance issues to do with what I consider to be excessive executive salaries, bonuses, payments for cars, expenses that should not have been paid out and cases where we are not sure if expenses have been paid back. The list just goes on and on. Huge amounts of money have been wasted on various plans that did not come to fruition, such as the plan for the Carlisle Pier. The list literally goes on. Even by the harbour company’s own admission, it is in a difficult financial position. It has reached a crunch point in terms of what will happen, following the removal of the Stena Line service. When we are at such a crunch point, the question is who will make the decision. The amendment seeks to include a stakeholder and community group as a key pillar in the decision-making process about what should happen in the harbour now and in the future. It tries to radically shift the balance away from an unaccountable executive in a quango that is at arm’s length from everybody and from any accountability to one where the general public has a say. The public is the biggest stakeholder. There is some reference to sailing clubs, boat clubs and other groups but arguably the biggest stakeholder in any harbour, let alone Dún Laoghaire, is the public. Every year, 1 million people walk the piers. More again look at the harbour vistas and enjoy the views and there are thousands of others, including fishermen, people who sell fish, fix boats, travellers and rowing clubs, who use the harbour but none has any input. The reason the oral hearing has been going on for four weeks is because this is the first time their voice has been heard. This is pretty much the first time ever that all of the stakeholders have been in one room and had their voices heard. What everybody was asking is why they were not listened to years ago. They also questioned whether they would be listened to now. Notwithstanding the conflict and dispute about the particular cruise berth proposal, the one thing that struck me forcibly, having attended the oral hearing in recent weeks, was why all those people were not in a room five or six years ago. A group was set up in 2009 and it is very telling in terms of the purpose of what I am trying to do. It was called the cruise ship stakeholders group. Who appointed this group? It was appointed by the CEO, Owen Keegan. A letter went to the chamber of commerce and it had a nominee. Subsequently, it became a business improvement district, BID. There was also the CEO of the harbour company. I described this as a cabal and I do not think it is an unreasonable description. The CEO hand-picked somebody from the chamber of commerce, in consultation with the CEO of the harbour board. That is the stakeholder. Those people then went on to spend €1.2 million on various activities in the harbour, much of which was related to the cruise berth plan and the master plan and they were accountable to nobody. The first time the elected council became fully aware of all of that was in 2013, four years after the stakeholders group was set up. The genuine stakeholders of the community and the public did not get an input until 2015 – six years after the group was set up and after €1.2 million was spent. I do not think that is acceptable. I appeal to the Minister in that regard. I genuinely believe I am representing the vast majority of opinion among the stakeholders and the public in Dún Laoghaire when I say that people want the situation to change radically. I wish to clarify something the Minister said, so that what I propose is absolutely clear. I am not proposing that we usurp the power of the elected councillors in favour of this group. What I am saying, and what is stated consistently in the amendments, is that wherever there are references to the CEO having the authority, that it should be vested precisely in the elected members who are accountable but that also those elected members will be required to consult with a stakeholders' group. That seems to me to be very reasonable. The decision on the future development, operations, management, priorities and so on of the harbour will be in the hands of elected members but they will be required to consult with a genuine, bona fide community and stakeholders group made up of all the user groups and representatives of the public and residents groups. That seems to be an eminently reasonable proposal and it is also in the interests of sustainable development, planning and management of the harbour and seafront, which I remind the Minister is the most precious asset in the county. It is arguably a national treasure. I appeal to the Minister to take on board what we are saying and to accept this series of amendments in the interests of democratic planning, oversight and management of a precious public amenity for the region and, arguably, for the country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That would be a matter that could be discussed at council level but to be honest, we pretty much saw who most of the groups were at the An Bord Pleanála hearing. Councils get representative groups and community group, for example, involved in SPCs and they engage with them at various levels. They set criteria as to who they consider bona fide. The detail of that could be worked out at council level.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a good point. My reference to "bona fide" was partially in anticipation that the Minister might say that any person could call himself of herself a stakeholder.I put it in in an attempt to smooth the way for the Minister’s agreement. It is a tactical amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fine, but we are midway through the Bill’s passage through the Oireachtas. If the Minister asked me to take out the words "bona fides" to make him happy and then hammer out the finer detail of who would be the genuine stakeholders at council level, I would be very happy. The key point is that stakeholders declared their hand at the hearing. We could draw up the list quickly now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister asks a reasonable question. I am very much in favour of strengthening the powers of local authorities. Whatever authority they have, however, is limited by the money available to them, but that is a different matter. I think there was a misunderstanding in our engagement on the parliamentary question this morning and perhaps the Minister has not had much of a chance to review my amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In that case, the Minister will know this because amendments Nos. 5 to 13, inclusive, have the same wording; they seek to replace every single reference to the “local authority chief executive” with the proposal that it be the elected council "in consultation with the Stakeholder and Community Group”. The amendments propose to take the decision-making process out of the hands of the chief executive officer and put it into the hands of the elected members.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of course, I believe he or she should play a role, but that role should be set out by the elected members in consultation with the local community. We are all familiar with the difference between reserved and executive functions, the reserved functions being those elected councillors have in a local authority, with the executive functions being those of the unelected directors and managers. I am proposing in this instance - it should probably be the case in other instances too - that the power should be vested in the elected members. Contrary to what the Minister suggests, this would involve strengthening the powers of the elected members and, by extension, the influence of the public and creating a greater line of accountability because in a democracy the people in question can be replaced. In respect of the stakeholder group, it should comprise elected representatives, in other words, if a boat club or residents association-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Absolutely. If any of the groups seeks to participate in the stakeholder group, it should have to elect people. That is why I mentioned the earlier stakeholders group, in contrast with the reality, that the former CEO handpicked the stakeholder group.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We genuinely seem to be at cross purposes because I cannot underline strongly enough that what I am proposing - it is very clear in the wording - is vesting power in the elected members. The amendment includes the words “in consultation with”. That is what I am proposing. The Bill, largely but not exclusively, gives decision-making power to the manager, not the elected members.I propose to replace the references to the manager with the words "Elected Council in consultation with Stakeholder and Community Group". It is clear, therefore, what I am proposing. If the Minister wants to argue that this needs to be worded carefully or that he likes the thrust of what I am saying but that we need to think about using words such as "bona fide" and so on, the people in Dún Laoghaire and I are open to this. The thrust of the argument is that we do not want power to be vested largely or exclusively in the hands of the unelected CEO and we do not want power to continue to be vested in the CEO and the board of the harbour company which is unaccountable to anybody.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry, but I would like to raise one other issue before the Minister replies. It is the role of primary legislation to set broad parameters. In other words, the finer detail of how the stakeholders would be decided should be agreed to by the elected members, which is what I propose. If the Minister believes from a drafting point of view that we need to slightly amend the wording to achieve this, I am open to that, but it is entirely reasonable for national legislation to state there is requirement on local authorities to consult genuine stakeholders in regional ports which have the characteristic of being central and integral to their towns and hinterlands. That is what I am trying to achieve. That is the overwhelming feeling and it is even the stated objective of the harbour company to be integrated with the town and region, although it has not achieved this, in respect of which I have set out examples. The Minister referred to People Before Profit, the Anti-Austerity Alliance and so on. I would be happy for legislation to structure an engagement with stakeholders. I learned so much at the oral hearing. I met people from the harbour whom I did not know existed. They had an incredible range of historical, heritage, financial and practical operational knowledge and expertise. It was brilliant in a sense; it was just tragic that it had happened six years too late. That is the thrust of what I am saying.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If at the beginning of Committee Stage, I did not say what I have said in Dáil, let me now say that the broad thrust of the legislation represents progress. Let us not be at odds with one another because it is a welcome development that these harbours will come under the remit of local authorities. That is a step in the right direction. There is no question about that. However, I think the Minister should be open to listening to genuine contributions in trying to achieve that end so that it really works. Those of us on the Left, are sometimes accused of being the naysayers, the people who are against proposals, but I wish to put a positive proposal to him. It could potentially unleash great creative energy to make these harbours - and I can speak largely for Dún Laoghaire - something great. My remarks are made in a positive spirit. We need to go the whole way in moving from a structure that is no longer appropriate, and in some cases has failed. Whether the structure was appropriate in the past is a matter that we can debate, but in the case of the Dún Laoghaire, the people are not happy with it and everything that happens in that harbour is controversial because the people do not have a say. I accept the Bill is moving things forward, but we should think about how we could move it fully forward. I understand there are two different options. I fully understand that the Bill sets out the options and at this stage is not prescriptive in terms of which option should be taken up because the Minister is absolutely correct to say that the option which is best applied to Drogheda, Dundalk, Wicklow or other ports may be different and it is up to the people in those areas to make their voices heard and to engage with him and hopefully come to an agreement. What I am arguing is that in the case of Dún Laoghaire, the overwhelming view is that we need the harbour to be an integrated part of the local authority and that we need to further strengthen public involvement in it by involving the stakeholders and the public. I think that is very much in the spirit of the legislation but is elaborating on it in a way that can really make it work. If we get just a nominal change, and I accept that it is more than a nominal change as now these people will have to come in front of the elected councillors, which is a good thing, I think we should go further than that. We can bring the banks before the finance committee, but we still do not get a lot of light as to what is going on in many cases. The fact that a person has to come before a local authority and answer some questions is better than them not coming in, but it is not the same as the elected members actually having a say over these things. It is not the same as the elected members having a body, a forum or whatever one calls it - I would call it a stakeholders' group - that they consult about the issues so that all the expertise and knowledge and so on of the community, the users and the stakeholders is inputted to allow the elected councillors to make the best decisions. Then obviously they should delegate that power to managers in the local authority. To me that seems the best way. If we do not do that, we will end up with an informal stakeholders' group that is hand picked by others. Everybody needs to consult. The Minister has to consult others. I do not claim to be an expert on certain things on which I have to take a stance and make decisions. What do I do? If I am dealing with an education Bill I start to ring teachers and others and ask them what they think about these issues. That is what we do. That is the reason for the committee structure. I believe we need that type of forum to assist the councillors in getting the full and rounded view and that the councillors should have more extensive powers to make decisions and then delegate responsibility to the management, rather than the management dictating to them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I know this has gone on for a long time but I would like to respond briefly as we are finishing on the stakeholders' group and will be dealing with other specific matters later. I will refer to one example in the Bill. I welcome the role councillors will have but that is if it is part of an integrated whole rather than a corporate subsidiary. In the case of Dún Laoghaire, of the two options, we urge the Minister, who will ultimately be making the decision, to make it an integrated part of the county council.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is no problem. I will give an example of the effect of my amendment on a specific area where currently the power is in the hands of the CEO. Section 6 deals with the temporary appointment of additional directors. In the Bill, as drafted, the Minister may in respect of the company appoint additional directors and the Minister may consult the chief executive of the local authority. I would propose changing that to "elected members". I believe the elected members should be deciding on the appointment of directors. They should be the voice of the council to the Minister on those issues. The elected members should also, in those instances, consult stakeholders and ask who they want on the board. That seems to me an eminently reasonable proposal and why I am arguing for this amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We can have the vote on Report Stage because I know the Minister is going to take on board what I have said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 2:In page 8, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:“(3) This section shall not apply to Dun Laoghaire Harbour.”.This amendment follows on from our earlier discussion. As set out by the Minister, the Bill has two options for these harbours. This amendment seeks that there would be just one option for Dún Laoghaire. The first of the two options is for the company to be a corporate subsidiary of the local authority with the existing board and company, in some shape or form, remaining in situ. The second option is to dissolve the company and for the harbour to become an integrated part of the local authority. We strongly favour the second option for Dún Laoghaire and do not believe the corporate subsidiary model is appropriate. I do not wish to speak for other ports, but in the specific case of Dún Laoghaire, we do not think it is appropriate. When I say "we", I think every manifestation of public interest in this issue shares the view and there are a number of reasons for the position. The Government's national ports policy indicates that the traditional operations and priorities of Dún Laoghaire are changing and that it needs to move more in the recreational direction. It still is a working harbour and I would like to see it remain a working harbour. I want to make that clear. It was a tragedy that the Stena Line ferry service went. However, this illustrates why the harbour should be an integrated part of the council rather than a corporate subsidiary. We do not know what happened. I do not know this for sure and I am not sure we will ever know if it remains a corporate subsidiary, but I have heard that Stena Line was willing to stay but wanted to pay less in annual berthing fees and the harbour company would not agree to the proposal. I do not know if that is true but that is what I have heard from a reasonably reliable source. I would at the very least like to know if that is true and I think the public would like to know too. I think they would like to know exactly what happened in those negotiations and whether we should have taken a different stance which might have resulted in Stena Line staying. More generally, the corporate subsidiary model is one which will push the harbour in the direction of privatisation. The evidence is there. The harbour master plan proposes a hotel and hundreds of apartments within the precincts of Dún Laoghaire harbour. I invite the Minister to look at the master plan if he has not already seen it. In connection with the harbour plan, a piece of land has already been put up for sale. This is land in a public harbour. The privatisation process is under way.This is what is driving matters such as the cruise berth proposal, under which €18 million was to be borrowed using the assets of the harbour as collateral. Any serious economist examining this issue would be of the view that the cost of building infrastructure such as a cruise berth would be much greater than €18 million. For example, the HSS terminal cost €22 million and this proposed cruise berth is much bigger than that. We do not know how they came up with a figure of €18 million because they did not provide any substantial answer on the projected cost of the cruise berth to the harbour company. A connected issue - this has been confirmed by the manager of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council - is what is described as the development of a hotel and apartments. In fact, St. Michael's pier, as set out in the Dún Laoghaire harbour company's master plan, is the financial driver of the cruise berth. In other words, if we get the cruise berth, we will get a hotel and hundreds of apartments. This will make a central part of the harbour that is now public, private and will fundamentally change the character of the harbour. Why is the harbour company doing this? It is doing it because it is driven by the requirement or mandate to be a profitable entity, which pushes it in that direction. We say that is not the direction it should be pushed. If we are going to revitalise Dún Laoghaire town, what we need is a view of the harbour that sees it as part of the town instead of a part at odds with and competing with the town. Currently, there are 85 empty units in Dún Laoghaire town. There has been a serious decline, but the retailers and townspeople are fighting to try to save the town and are being imaginative and energetic on that. However, one of the big problems is this schism between the harbour and the town, which is institutionalised in the model of the corporate subsidiary, a quango currently under the Department but, a little like the Cherrywood development, soon to be moved to the council while remaining a corporate subsidiary. The council's share of Cherrywood is a corporate subsidiary and the elected councillors do not have a clue what is going on there. The managers know what is happening but the elected representatives, although it is formally under their remit, have not got a clue what is going on in Cherrywood. For that reason, we say this corporate subsidiary model is not appropriate to Dún Laoghaire. Critically, if we take the second option and if that is the only option allowed for Dún Laoghaire, it could unleash positive forces not just for the harbour but also for the entire town. It would at last allow a holistic approach to developing Dún Laoghaire in a way whereby the town, harbour and seafront will mutually complement each other and be seen as an integrated whole. That is the spirit of what is being said here and I hope the Minister will take it on board. Regardless of whether he accepts this amendment, the decision will ultimately be made by him. I would like the decision to be made now, which is why the amendments are proposed. One way or another, however, the Minister will make the decision. I urge him to say the corporate subsidiary model is not the model we want and that we want a model that will be fully under the control of the council.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has said that the amendment I proposed pre-empts his decision and I fully accept this to be the case. It asks him to make the decision by the time the Houses complete their consideration of the Bill. It is in the Minister's power to make the decision but this matter has been debated at length for a long time. We have conducted extensive engagement at some of the biggest public meetings in recent times in Dún Laoghaire, so I believe I speak for a majority of stakeholders and for the public on this matter. There is an unprecedented number of submissions to the planning authorities regarding developments for the harbour. The people of Dún Laoghaire and harbour stakeholders of all shapes and sizes are very engaged with the process and have pretty much definitively expressed their views about where they want this to go. We are asking the Government, by this amendment, to make the decision as part of the Bill because it has gone on for too long. Perhaps the Minister would indicate the schedule for completion of Committee Stage. Will it be next week or the week after and when will it proceed to Report Stage? I wish to underline the fact that the inspector from An Bord Pleanála, and indeed anybody who has to make any decision about Dún Laoghaire, is in a kind of limbo at present. I would not be surprised if An Bord Pleanála delayed making a decision about the cruise berths until the legislative framework for the harbour is set and the relationship between the town and the harbour is established.People are operating in a vacuum. They have been aware for some time that a decision is due but it has not been made. Although the legislation has been introduced, it does not make a decision. If the Minister will not accept the amendment or make the decision as part of the Bill, which the amendment seeks to do, could he indicate approximately when the decision will be made, as it has a bearing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The phrase "promptly thereafter" is a little vague. It would be helpful for a number of reasons to inform the context in which we will be operating for that decision to be made relatively soon. In a way, I welcome the fact there are several weeks, or maybe a couple of months, to go, given that people will have the opportunity to make their views known to the Minister. The Minister is inviting them to do so, and I urge them to do that. The voice of the stakeholders, including but not limited to the elected representatives, must be heard in making the decision. We need real public consultation on it. I am confident that the public wants the dissolution of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company. I will explain why the Minister should choose the option proposed in the amendment. He referred to the finances and said if we get what we want, he will have to take the money issue and operating costs seriously. I accept this. There will be challenges. As part of his decision-making process, the Minister will be examining, if he has not already done so, the profit and loss account for 2013. The company made an operating loss in 2013 of €383,000 and a full loss of €890,000. It also made a loss in 2012. The company has axed the numbers of essential front-line workers, such as the harbour police and maintenance workers. I saw a fantastic table contained in one of the submissions to An Bord Pleanála, which I may submit to the Minister over the coming days. The table shows that the progress from profit to loss, in a consistent pattern over the past six years, coincides with the cutting of the workforce. If the cutting of the workforce was supposed to improve the financial position, it has had the exact opposite effect. There is an exact correlation between the axing of the front-line workforce and the company's move from a position of profit to loss. Although a number of factors have contributed to it, it is interesting. In contrast, for some time, I have alerted the Minister to the incredible waste in which the harbour company engages. Compiling the cruise berth plan cost the harbour company €625,000, which is almost the same amount as the loss it made. The Minister should read the council's very detailed report from May 2015 on the recent history of developments in the harbour. The council has contributed an extraordinary €1,217,000 to activities in the harbour. While many activities take place in the harbour, the bulk of the money was spent on subsidising the harbour company for the elements of the master plan to which people are opposed. The floating swimming pool received €156,000. The tender berth received €230,000, although given that we have no problem with the small cruise ships coming to the Carlisle Pier, one could argue that it was reasonable to spend this money. The council paid €250,000 for the planning for the giant cruise ship berth. Approximately €31,000 was spent on trips abroad related to the cruise berth and further money was spent on welcome events for the cruise ships. It adds up to nearly €1 million from the council over recent years, the expenditure of which was dictated by an unaccountable stakeholders' group comprising the CEO of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company, the director of services in the environment section and a representative of the Dún Laoghaire Business Improvement District, BID. These three people have decided that expenditure and the council has come to know about the detail of much of it late in the day. This is a lot of public money in a situation in which the public are at odds with all the key elements of what the money has been spent on developing. Before this hundreds of thousands of euro was spent on a plan to build a ten-storey apartment block on the Carlisle Pier. I do not know whether the Minister remembers it. There was a public consultation on four proposals, all of which involved high rise development on the site of the historic Carlisle Pier. The biggest group of people said they did not want any of them. The one the public preferred was not selected. The group selected the second least favourite and then nothing happened, although a huge amount of money was spent on it. This goes on and on. Another issue for the Minister to consider regarding all that money wasted on things the people did not want is the combined cost of the harbour board and the very high salaries and expenses of the executives. This is where the due diligence comes in. I estimate it to be approximately €600,000 per year. Did the Minister know the salary of the CEO of the Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company is approximately twice those of the CEOs of the other harbours of regional significance dealt with in the Bill? It is a waste of money. If one removed all that wastage, the company would break even. The company has been subsidised consistently by public money over the years. We would be in a better financial position if we dissolved the harbour company and brought the harbour under council control. It has revenue streams and property which generate revenue. People have not just said "No" to the harbour company's activities, but have set out alternatives. For example, there is great enthusiasm for a diaspora museum. People have been calling for it for years, going back to John de Courcy Ireland.It is an open goal, even as a national priority. Carlisle Pier was the exit point for the vast majority of those who were to form the Irish diaspora. The oldest suburban railway in the world extended to that pier, which was constructed in the 1830s. There is a wealth of heritage associated with the diaspora and emigration. It is an absolutely open goal and we could generate an enormous benefit, certainly locally and regionally but probably nationally, by developing a diaspora museum on the site rather than wasting it on madcap plans, excessive salaries and massive financial gambles. There is considerable enthusiasm for a State-run national maritime and sailing centre. The council has just passed a motion on this.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It should be State run because sailing would not just be something for people with a lot of money who can afford membership of yacht clubs. The facility could be opened to the people in the region and wider area so they could learn how to sail and about boats and the sea. Would it not be fantastic if every school in the Dún Laoghaire–Rathdown County Council area had the option of bringing its children to sail in the harbour and learn about boats? Would that not be absolutely wonderful?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, are we speaking to the amendment or to the section?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have no problem with what is being said, by the way. I think people should have a chance to ventilate their stuff. I am just curious.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have a serious point of order. I accept that the Deputies have the right to make these points. It is important that they get an opportunity to debate this issue fully. I do not mind how long they debate it for because it is obviously important to them. However, I would like to say as a point of order that this debate has absolutely nothing to do with the amendments we are dealing with at the moment, two of which relate specifically to Dún Laoghaire Harbour. Amendment No. 4 proposes to delete references-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. That amendment relates to Dún Laoghaire.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am just pointing out that this has nothing to do with Dún Laoghaire. We are sort of jumping ahead of ourselves here.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I genuinely do not want to disrupt this meeting, but I need to point out that the Chair has not responded to the point of order I raised. This discussion is relevant to the section. We have not come to the discussion on the section. We are dealing with an amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could the Chair respond to that point of order?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed. That is what should happen. I am not trying to cut across anyone. I am keen to help the discussion.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have not finished the discussion on the amendment. We had an intervention on a completely different matter. That is fine, but it should have been dealt with in the schedule.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister rightly spoke of certain cases - I do not want to make a comment about the discussion about Foynes and Galway, except they are both best fitted to represent themselves.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am in favour of an integrated approach to the whole country. The Minister stated the purpose of the Bill is for integrated approaches and his hope is this is what the Bill will achieve. I absolutely agree with him, and this is why we welcomed the broad thrust of the Bill. For Dún Laoghaire, at least, we need that kind of integration. What has been missing in Dún Laoghaire is the integration between the activities and operations of the port company and the town and the wider hinterland and arguably the region. This is a step in the right direction but, it is the big but and is the reason we are saying that if we are going in this direction, the logical follow-on is to dissolve the harbour company and in the case of Dún Laoghaire go for the second option. The harbour company has been in competition effectively with the town and is propelled by a competitive impulse, which is not helpful in achieving the integration that one wants. It is also being propelled by a competitive impulse to compete with Dublin Port, which is not helpful either. The two ports are now competing. If the Dún Laoghaire harbour company's proposal for this cruise berth succeeds, which I hope it does not, it will be competing with another public port for the same business. I have spoken to prominent economists, I will not mention their names but they are people we all know and are not left-wing economists-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will not. They think it is bananas that two ports within 5 km of each other are competing for the same businesses and are borrowing, very importantly in the case of Dún Laoghaire, using the assets of the harbour as collateral in a speculative venture where Dún Laoghaire will compete with Dublin. If one is talking about integration and an integrated policy, this is barmy beyond belief. It is a serious risk that could actually put the harbour under threat and could be a massive white elephant. Ultimately that decision will be in the hands of the Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am urging the Minister to recognise that in this case, integration and having a holistic approach to the development of Dún Laoghaire is essential, both in terms of the port's relationship to the town and in the whole raison d'être of the harbour in the national ports policy of tier 1, tier 2 and so on which the Minister is setting out. The logical conclusion of that is option B, that we dissolve Dún Laoghaire harbour company.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is stalled.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of information, in the latest answer to a question in the council about the due diligence, the county manager has told us that the due diligence, which I agree badly needs to be done and I know was under way, has now stalled. There are apparently legal or commercial sensitivity obstacles to it continuing. I wish to alert the Minister to that. In a way that speaks of the problem we have. That problem has to be resolved both in the short term and in the long term. This business where we cannot really know what is going on in the harbour company has been a persistent issue. It is now even blocking the due diligence process.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will put it to a vote on Report Stage.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do I need to withdraw it in order to reintroduce it on Report Stage?
