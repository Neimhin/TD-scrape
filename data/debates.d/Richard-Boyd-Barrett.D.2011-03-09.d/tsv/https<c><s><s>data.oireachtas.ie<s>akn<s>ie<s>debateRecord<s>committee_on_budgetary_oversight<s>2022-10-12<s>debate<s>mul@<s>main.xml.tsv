RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank all our contributors for their contributions so far. I do not have many questions on animation. Our job is to assess whether section 481 is delivering what it is supposed to deliver. From what I see of the animation industry, it is. They are companies, full-time jobs and industry development. The industry is supposed to be developing and growing and creating companies of scale and career opportunities. That is not to say it is perfect, because I have heard a few stories about particular companies, but it is obvious that there are jobs and an industry. My questions, therefore, are directed at the live-action sector, where I do not see the jobs. The credit is supposed to be strictly dependent on creating jobs. You either create quality employment and training or you do not, and you either contribute to culture or you do not. In fact, the European rules on this are very clear. You should not get state aid if you are not doing these things. I want the film industry to get state aid but do not understand the contrast. I do not understand how the animation sector can create jobs and companies of scale and how theatres such as the Abbey, Gate and Project can create jobs and careers when given public money while the live-action sector does not. To put it bluntly, the testimony we heard last week from the Irish Film Workersâ€™ Association was that every time a production ends, the clock goes back to zero from the point of view of the employee. In other words, an employee who has worked for successive designated activity companies, DACs, does not have an employer because that employer was his or her last DAC, which is now gone. Therefore, an employee starts from scratch. Even if he or she has worked for 20 DACs over 25 years, he or she effectively starts from scratch, meaning no recognition whatsoever of his or her service in the industry. There is no comeback if, for example, employees are blacklisted, as they say they are. Many of those who raised concerns about the industry with members of this committee in 2018 have not worked in the industry since.Some of the witnesses present know that they have not worked in the industry again even though they were never formally dismissed and there was no process through which they were dismissed. They just do not get to work again. I am not here to advocate on individual cases, but I see nothing in how the industry is structured to prevent that from happening. How does the industry prevent it? I am confused by the Screen Guilds of Ireland. I understand it is a private limited company with a CEO and it says that it represents 2,500 workers. According to the Department's analysis, we only have 2,500 people in the industry and, unlike in animation, only a few of them have full-time jobs, so it is not clear to me how the Screen Guilds of Ireland can represent people when they do not have jobs and it is a private company that I understand is wholly funded by Screen Ireland. I am confused about that. Who, then, does SIPTU represent? There is also the Irish Film Workers Association, although there are not many film workers left in the industry because they do not get jobs anymore. I do not understand how this works. Are people right in saying that the clock goes back to zero each time? Will the witnesses explain the process involved in someone getting a job on an Irish film? Who does the person go to? Who decides whether he or she gets employed? Members of Screen Producers Ireland, SPI, get section 481 relief under the explicit requirement that it creates quality employment and training, yet Ms Elaine Geraghty, SPI's former chairperson, told the Labour Court:I will give further evidence before the Court that there is no possible basis, having due regard to the realities of the sector, on which a relationship of employment can be said to have existed between the parties hereto. This is on the basis of the clearly established industry norms and practices governing working arrangements in this sector, including the operation of Section 481 Relief.There were similar testimonies from representatives of some of the large recipients of section 481 relief. The people who are getting this relief are saying that they have no employees and could not possibly have any, yet they are explicitly given the relief on the basis that they are creating quality employment and training. This is a contradiction and I would like it explained.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who decides whether they get on?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	HODs decide.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps Ms O'Sullivan will explain to the committee who the HODs are.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are they employees of the recipients of section 481 relief?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are not employees of the recipients of section 481 relief.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As contractors.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The HODs who make the decisions about who works-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay. If they are self-employed, they are not employees of the recipients of section 481 relief, which are the producer companies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Everyone is employed by the DAC. The person who gets section 481 relief is not the employer. Rather, the DAC is the employer. Is that right?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not the recipient of section 481 relief.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not mention individuals. Actually, I am sorry. I did mention SPI's representative.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not permanent employment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Recognition of service in the industry.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be clear, they are looking for recognition of service.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Do the production companies not just have it both ways? They want the intellectual property. The witnesses are saying it has to be signed over to the producer companies, and that is the standing company, so it has the intellectual property and, presumably, then benefits from the royalties from that. Maybe the witnesses could clarify that point. However, these companies do not want the employees. They are left with the DAC.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sorry to interrupt Mr. Hickey but I have so little time. Last week, I asked Equity directly if someone does not sign one of these contracts, will they get the job on the film and they said they will not get it. They also said, for example, of the film done by Disney recently in the RDS and various other places such as Wicklow, that people who worked on that here got lesser remuneration, contracts and conditions than they did when they reshot some of those scenes in the UK.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Equity has a very different view. Lastly, on the crews, is it the case - nobody is answering this - that if one works for designated activity company, DAC A, it is 100% owned by the producer company, DAC A disappears and exactly the same producer company sets up DAC B, but claims that it is not the employer of the employees of DAC A. That goes on with A, B, C, D. It is the same producer company employing the same people but, because the DAC is now gone, that producer can say that they are not his or her employees.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who determines whether they are good enough to be on the next project?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Always?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank our contributors. Who is gathering the database of crew?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Who is collating that database? I am curious. Is it Screen Ireland? It is not Screen Guilds of Ireland.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thought I had read in one of the documents that Screen Guilds of Ireland was playing some role in collecting the information. Is that not correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have called for one myself.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be clear, is it the case that anybody can register for it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it divided up into different grades? Is that how it works? Can someone just register?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would be interested to see how that plays out. It is necessary. There should be a proper register of employees and trainees. To follow on from our earlier discussions, my concern, as I expressed it to others and it is a concern that was expressed by people who work in the film industry at our hearing last week, relates to the question of who are the employers in the industry. The film credit is given to create employment and training. From what I gather, which was more or less confirmed by Mr. Hickey during the committee's earlier session, the DAC is the employer. DACs only exist for the period of the production and approximately a year thereafter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	However, the production company is the recipient of section 481.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How can the production company be given money to create employment if it is not the employer? I understand from an answer given earlier by Mr. Hickey that the DAC is a necessary-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----accounting tool but surely that should not absolve the production company from responsibility for its employees. We did not have time to drill into it further but Mr. Hickey said we need the DAC system as an accountancy tool for investors and to provide transparency about what happens financially on a particular production.I put it to the witnesses that it absolutely runs counter to the purpose of section 481 if the producer company that is a self-standing ongoing company can say it is not the employer of the people who worked on that film, even though that company set up the DAC, owns the DAC, but yet can disown responsibility for the people who work on the DAC.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry to interrupt. I understand that, and I understand the rationale of the DAC as an accountancy and financial tool. If a section 481 tax credit is given for quality, employment and training, the basic requirement for an industry and employment is that we know who the employer is and we know who the employee is. The problem is we do not. The DAC exists purely for the duration of the production and for one year afterwards. The DAC is a wholly owned subsidiary of the parent company, for want of a better phrase, which is the recipient of the section 481 tax credit.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not mean to interrupt Ms McGrane, but I understand all of that. I am getting back to the issue of employment and training. Once the DAC ceases to exist, who does the employee on a film production have recourse to as their employer?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If an employee is unfairly dismissed, for example, or an intern is mistreated or whatever, it takes around two to three years to get a case heard in the Labour Court or the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC. By the time the case reaches the court, the employer no longer exists, even though the company that got section 481 tax credit for that production on which the employee worked still exists, and that company says it has no relationship with the employee, even though the DAC was 100% owned by that company. To me, that is a problem because it means the employees and the trainees do not have an employer they can go back to once the DAC is gone. Therefore, all of the legislation those companies are required to sign up to is meaningless. The Protection of Employees (Fixed-Term Work) Act 2003 is meaningless if the only legal employer an employee ever had only existed for a year and a half or less, for example, six months. Do the witnesses know what I mean? I just do not understand how the workers or the trainees can have any kind of rights, continuity or recognition of their service if their employer disappears after a period, even though their actual employer that got the money clearly still exists, but says it is not their employer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am sure the producers do.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The HoDs. That is who we heard from
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We heard from three HoDs.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But they cannot get their cases heard in that time. That is a fact; they cannot. I have one last question, and I know I am out of time. Taking just one of the roles in the film that was mentioned, we had a witness who said they were a production manager. How many people have qualified and been accredited as production managers through the skills training structures that have been set up?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not believe there is any dispute among any of us, notwithstanding all of the debates, about the need to invest in Irish language film, to invest in the film industry and to invest in the very talented crew, performers and artists that we have in this country. There was no dispute about that. I would like to see more money going in, not less. The big question that I feel is unanswered comes back to this issue of work being project by project. At the end of the day it comes back to that notion. It is a mantra I hear repeated. I question it, to be honest. Of course it is project to project. So are plays. The plays that go on in the Abbey Theatre, are project to project. Just about every form of artistic endeavour is project to project at a certain level. There seems to be a unique conclusion drawn with regard to live-action film that because it is project by project, nobody can have a job. In every other area where work is project to project, people have jobs. Uniquely in live-action film nobody can have a job. I do not accept that, to be blunt about it. It involves two groups of people. From the point of view of the actors, I perceive we are saying "We know that because of the nature of acting we cannot have a permanent job but we want the full remuneration for our performance. That is what we want but we are not getting it." That is what Equity is telling us. Then there is the crew. There is an idea that the crew are in the same position as the actors but there are different requirements. It is different. There is an idea that one must get rid of set painters, stagehands, drivers or prop makers every time a project is finished with absolutely no security for them getting onto the next production. It must be remembered that much of this is funded with public money, which is in fact their money and taxpayers' money. Both groups emphasised that this is taxpayers' money. I just do not accept that. I do not see why it is necessary, based on the assertion that it is project to project. It is not the case anywhere else. This also relates to the question of trainees. I get that things have moved on; it is partly because some of those groups have come in here and raised these issues that things have moved on. If I understand it correctly, while Screen Ireland is assessing that there may be some training going on in film production, we do not know if those trainees will be employed on the next production by that same film producer. Am I right in saying that? Also, there is no accreditation for their training. Unlike an apprentice carpenter or bricklayer there is no point at which we can say they are qualified in a particular occupation.
