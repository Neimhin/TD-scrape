RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not know where to begin in trying to ask the Minister questions on these issues because his final comment in response to Deputy Pearse Doherty indicates how we view things in completely the opposite way from one another.  We live on different planets.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is something Deputy Pearse Doherty should worry about if that is the case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How, in all honesty, can the Minister state we have had a good month?  I find that extraordinary.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How can the Minister suggest we have had a good month?  The situation in Spain has got disastrously worse and we are facing a crisis the proportions of which we do not know, but it is certainly likely to be massive.  The Spanish people are being put on the hook because of the crisis in their banking system as a result of the gambling of Spanish bankers and developers in the same way that we were put on it.  The response of Europe to the Spanish crisis is a repeat of what was done to us with such disastrous consequences.  What we can take from the response of the ECB and Germany to the Spanish crisis is that no lessons have been learned.  They have learned absolutely nothing from the disastrous consequences in this country of a blanket bailout to meet gambling banks; there have been disastrous financial consequences for the State, with austerity being imposed.  Despite this experience and a similar experience in Greece, they want to do it all over again in Spain.  How is this a cause for anything other than despair?  I am amazed that the Minister, other European Finance Ministers and leaders are not looking at what has happened in Spain and admitting that they did not fully understand because of the pace of events.  The crisis hit so suddenly in 2008, which perhaps explains a little some of the mistakes made.  The reason countries are locked out of bond markets is they have been forced by European authorities and the ECB to take on the gambling debts of banks.  As soon as a country even thinks about doing so, it is locked out of bond markets.  That is what happens.  It is what happened to us and now it will happen to Spain and probably Italy.  At what point will people wake up and smell the coffee and realise this is a disastrous strategy?  The Minister mentioned that the Government's approach, with which I agree, was to disentangle the banking debt from sovereign debt.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps the chit-chat to the side could stop.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is no sign of the European Central Bank, ECB, or Germany being willing to entertain that suggestion in any shape or form.  At what point do we start screaming?  Even with the agenda for this meeting, there is a sense of fiddling while Rome burns.  Although a cross-European banking resolution process is to be welcomed at some level, surely it is just closing the door after the horse has bolted.  These are minimal measures to avoid a recurrence, yet we will still take actions in Spain and Italy that have proved disastrous.  It is difficult to understand why people are not screaming against the idiocy of this policy.The obvious conclusion is that, where debts have been wrongly imposed with disastrous consequences on states as a result of private institutions' activities, there is no road to recovery unless that debt burden is lifted from the shoulders of ordinary people and national economies and placed where it belongs.  Given the fact that our austerity is propping up the European financial system, we must begin to discuss controlling the banks, not just the putting in place of a system that would force banks to contribute towards a crisis fund.  Is this not the lesson?  We are financing them and should be controlling them and setting their lending and investing priorities instead of leaving everything up to the anarchy of markets and competition.In terms of financing our societies and economies, the financial transaction tax is the only half decent European proposal that even points in the direction of imposing some cost on the financial markets, the banks, etc., yet this small, minimal proposal is the one measure against which the Government has set its face.  The Government claims it is not and that it will consider the proposal, but it will not participate with enhanced co-operation.  While it likes the idea in principle, it will not go for it because Britain is against it, which means it will not be introduced.  Can the Minister state otherwise?  It is chit-chat about a nice idea.The Minister used the loss of IFSC business to London as his main justification for not supporting this tax.  If we place a small extra tax on financial transactions in the IFSC, through which vast amounts of money pass and where there could be a significant potential revenue to the State, what evidence is there to support the assertion that there will be a large outflow of financial services?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Has the Minister evidence to the effect that it would cost jobs?
