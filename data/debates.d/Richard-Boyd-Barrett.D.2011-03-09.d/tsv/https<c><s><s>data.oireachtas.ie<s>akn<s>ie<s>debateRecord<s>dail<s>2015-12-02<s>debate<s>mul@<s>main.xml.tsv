RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will be brief as we have had this discussion at length on earlier Stages. As I said before, I fundamentally reject the basis on which this entire Bill is constructed and the emphasis of this Government's policy on the private health insurance industry playing a useful role in developing a universal health system. The reason the Government used the term “universal health insurance” prior to the last general election is because it knew that is what people wanted. People want something that is available to everybody. Whatever about our ideological and philosophical differences on a range of issues, such as markets and whatnot, everybody believes health care provision should be universal. Everybody should get the same treatment because they need it as human beings, particularly when they are ill, disabled or whatever. That is what the majority think and Fine Gael used that term prior to the last election because it knew that is what everybody wanted. Everybody rejects the two-tier health care system. If we listen to what people say they want and if we are moving towards providing quality health care to everybody, regardless of income, position in society or whatever, then we must move to a universal system. The Minister has now acknowledged that trying to deliver universality, while incorporating the private health insurance industry, just does not add up.After five years of saying we will have universal health insurance, what the public heard was "universal" but what the Government smuggled in was "insurance". The second bit undermines the first. We all know it. The international evidence is absolutely clear. Once private health insurance companies are brought into the equation, hierarchies come into play straight away. Some people can afford to buy better packages than others. We do not get equality or universality. We get something else. We also get a massive waste and drain on resources. Money which is paid out of the Exchequer and the pockets of those who take out health insurance is wasted on things which have nothing to do with health care. Millions of euro are wasted on advertising. On a worldwide scale, billions of euro are wasted on private health insurance companies competing with one another. It is not spent on nurses and doctors or on building hospitals or primary care centres but on advertising and it is a waste. We see and hear the advertisements every day on the television and the radio, including one telling people to go to the Blackrock Clinic as it is much better in an emergency. People should know that there is an accident and emergency department nearby which they can access on a 24-hour basis, that they will not be left for days on trolleys and that money is not an issue. It should be paid for through central and progressive taxation. That is what people want. I have made the point before but there is something wrong when a debate on health starts with phrases such as "risk equalisation" and "lifetime community rating" and lots of technical babble which has nothing to do with health. When we hear these terms, we know we have done something wrong and are on the wrong track because that is not what health care is about. That is not what hospitals and sickness are about. It is techno babble and it arises from the fact that there are external, profit-seeking bodies that have nothing to do with delivering health care thrown into the mix. Massive billing operations, administration and all that kind of stuff has nothing to do with health care. The cost of providing health care is greater wherever this model exists. It will always be greater because it is necessary to add profit-seeking, advertising, administration, billing costs and all the rest of it into the equation.  The Government has sort of had to acknowledge that those are the facts because it has more or less abandoned a promise it made on this issue. The Government should listen to what people are saying and what all the evidence is saying. Let us have a national health system and let us fund and finance it because in the end, it will be cheaper, more efficient and fairer.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 1:In page 6, between lines 15 and 16, to insert the following:“ “Stakeholder and Community Group” means a group comprising elected representatives of all harbour user groups as well as resident and community groups across the local authority area;”.We discussed this at length on Committee Stage but I wish to take another opportunity in a more public Chamber, before the Bill passes, to summarise the concerns of the people of Dún Laoghaire, stakeholders in Dún Laoghaire Harbour and users of the harbour about its future and how this Bill will impact on it. I urge the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to respond to the concerns and aspirations of the wide variety of harbour users and stakeholders. There is a widespread public consensus about what should happen to Dún Laoghaire Harbour which, sadly, has not been shared by the people who make decisions. We have an odd situation whereby the dogs on the street and virtually everyone else shares a similar vision for what should happen in Dún Laoghaire but the plans for the development and day-to-day operations of the harbour are completely at odds with that. This group of amendments is seeking to reconcile that contradiction so that the development, management and maintenance of the harbour is genuinely reflective of the users and stakeholders of the harbour. The aim is to ensure that it is the public and its representatives as well as users and stakeholders who will determine the future of Dún Laoghaire Harbour. The Minister will be aware that there is a controversial proposal by Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company to develop a giant cruise berth which will effectively cut Dún Laoghaire Harbour in half. The development would involve a very significant incursion into the harbour in order to bring in giant cruise ships. The proposal has generated significant controversy but I would emphasise that the issue is not just with the cruise berth but with what comes with it. The cruise berth and cruise ships will have a significant impact on existing harbour users, including local boat clubs and sailing clubs. It will also have an impact on the harbour as a visual amenity and affect over 1 million people who walk the pier every year. The proposal could have a very significant environmental impact in terms of the dredging of the harbour, despite the fact that Dublin Bay has been designated a biosphere reserve by the UN. There are numerous potential implications, some of which are not explicitly stated in the plan itself.  The cost of this very significant plan to fundamentally change the character of the harbour is estimated by the proposers to be €18 million but I believe that this is a gross underestimate. The HSS terminal, for example, which was built over 20 years ago, cost €22 million. The idea that this giant cruise berth could cost less than that, 20 years on, stretches credibility to breaking point. The money for this proposal will be borrowed using the assets of the harbour as collateral, a very dangerous gamble with public assets which will put the future of the harbour at risk.We also know that in order to try to finance this big gamble, the Dún Laoghaire Harbour master plan has a number of other elements, most notably plans for hundreds of private apartments and a hotel at Dún Laoghaire Harbour. This is not included in the current planning application but it is clearly stated in the Dún Laoghaire master plan that the giant cruise berth is contingent on the other elements of the master plan, in particular plans for hundreds of private apartments and a hotel on St. Michael's Pier. That is a very dramatic intervention in regard to the harbour. I feel strongly about it, as I have no doubt the vast majority of people do, judging from the huge numbers turning out at public meetings and the huge number of submissions that have been consistently made around this application and previous applications to put high-rise apartment blocks on Carlisle Pier. At every single opportunity where members of the public have expressed their views, they have made it known they do not want large-scale private residential development at Dún Laoghaire Harbour. This is because they recognise it will fundamentally alter the character of the harbour as a public amenity and will make those parts of that harbour where the development takes place exclusive and not available to the public. It is just a simple fact. People do not want that and yet the plan being put forward by the harbour company for the cruise berth is contingent on that development. As I mentioned to the Minister on Committee Stage, it has been confirmed by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council that these two things come together and that we do not get one without the other. The report produced in May last year by Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company states:The proposed urban regeneration of St. Michael's Pier is set out in the harbour master plan. The harbour company contend that it will be essential to the economic viability of the harbour company into the future and it will be the financial driver of other projects identified in the master plan.In other words, the council is telling us it was informed by the harbour company that in order to deliver the cruise berth, it has to have the apartments, the hotel and so on at St. Michael's Pier and that one is the financial driver of the other. However, this is not wanted by the people. Although the Bill relates to more general matters, this is an example of why we need to develop plans for this harbour and every other harbour which are not dreamed up by a small cabal of unaccountable people but are developed by all of the genuine stakeholders - the people with knowledge of the harbour and the users of the harbour, who own the harbour, because it is a publicly owned harbour. I want to underline that we welcome the move to have the harbour integrated into the council and, indeed, see it as a victory for the people in the area who campaigned over many years. However, what this series of amendments is saying is that while welcoming the move, we want to make sure it is not just bringing the harbour under council control in name only. We want it to represent a shift to real public control of the harbour so that the plans that are developed for the harbour genuinely reflect the views, aspirations, wishes and needs of the public and harbour users. As against how the Bill construes the matter, what we want is that it should not be the CEO of the county council in conjunction or in collusion - whatever way one wants to put it - with the CEO of the harbour, which is a sort of quango or corporate subsidiary, who make the decisions, as has hitherto been the case. We want elected representatives who are accountable to the people to make the key decisions about the harbour and we want them to do it in conjunction with all of the harbour users, of whom there are many, such as fishermen, boat clubs, rowing clubs, walkers, people who are concerned about the seafront as an environmental amenity and asset and those interested in the heritage and history of the harbour. For example, one of the biggest societies in Dún Laoghaire is the history society, which has hundreds of people at its meetings because there is a very rich history, much of which centres on the harbour, which has an extraordinarily rich cultural heritage. That is by no means an exhaustive list. There are all sorts of people who have a real stake, real knowledge and real expertise in regard to the harbour. We want those people to have a say in all decisions about the harbour. I want to make it clear to the Minister, given there was some confusion during the Committee Stage debate, that in the end, it is the elected representatives who have to make the decisions because they are elected and accountable. What we are asking is that they should do so in conjunction with a stakeholders group, not just with the CEO, who is not elected. Much of this Bill gives much of the power to the CEO rather than to the elected representatives and the stakeholders group we are proposing. I want to draw a contrast between the approach we are proposing and the approach that has been followed hitherto, which has led to the sort of plans that are so controversial and generally opposed by people in Dún Laoghaire. For example, prior to the plan I have just referred to, there was a plan to put a ten-storey apartment block on Carlisle Pier and to put a floating barge from the canals of Berlin off the East Pier. This was crazy stuff. They wanted to put a barge with a swimming pool, taken from a canal in Berlin, inside a seawater harbour. This is the sort of thing they came up, which nobody asked for. In so far as members of the public would have any opinion about it, they have expressed opposition to this sort of plan. The amendments propose to have a real stakeholders group but in fact, there was already a stakeholders group that came up with these plans. Where did it come from? From what I can see, it was appointed by the harbour company and by the executive of the council. I thank the Minister for sending me the correspondence between his Department and the harbour company, which I just received yesterday and which I appreciate. One of the letters is from the CEO, Gerry Dunne, explaining the setting up of the stakeholder group in 2010. He simply says that "we have just set up a stakeholder group". By "we", he means that he has. This is presumably in conjunction with the county manager and included on that group is a representative of the chamber of commerce and the business improvement district. Is that representative? These are the people who have been driving the plans. A lot of money has been spent on these plans. Hundreds of thousands of euro, and possibly up to €1 million, have been spent without any real reference to the diversity and vast array of genuine stakeholders I have mentioned, who have not had any input and who, by and large, oppose the plans that have been developed. That is not a real stakeholder group.What I call for through these amendments is for the Minister to legislate to ensure we have a genuine stakeholders' group so that the process is open and above board. I want it to be transparent. We know who the stakeholders, the harbour users and the community groups are and I want all of them included, not just a select few dictated from the top. All of the groups should be included and all of their voices heard and they should try to reach a consensus with the elected representatives on the plans for the development, management and protection of the harbour. This is an eminently reasonable proposal that would go a long way to healing the alienation that is so widespread between the public and political, council and semi-State authorities. This sense of alienation is quite widespread. The people feel that they are always the last to know about plans, decisions and proposals, but they should be the first to know. The people should be first to be asked and consulted. They should be included at the ground floor in developing proposals. That is what my amendments propose and I appeal to the Minister to accept what is an eminently reasonable, fair and progressive proposal for how we manage our harbour. I believe this also applies to other harbours.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We welcome the broad thrust of this Bill. It reflects a long-standing desire of all sorts of groups, stakeholders and users of the harbour to have more involvement in its development, protection and improvement. I stated that on Committee Stage and the Minister acknowledged it. I do not want it to be just a nominal move in that direction but to be a tangible change. This centres on whether it remains in reality at a remove from any real public control by elected representatives, even if it comes under the council’s remit, which it has been. There was a bizarre situation at council meetings when the elected councillors who were on the harbour board walked out of council meetings when the harbour was being discussed because there was a conflict of interest when the board was a corporate entity. We did not have oversight. If we retain the corporate, separate, subsidiary model, then even though nominally the harbour comes under council control and is integrated with the town, which we all want, it is still a separate entity, that remains unaccountable, notwithstanding the reviews the Minister has talked about and the fact that it could come before the council, both of which I welcome. Let us make sure, in so far as there are always people giving advice and having an input into these matters, that we have a standing arrangement whereby there is a genuine stakeholders group that the elected councillors and chief executive officers, CEOs, should consult. I agree the selection of that group and who decides what is bona fide will be done at local level. I am asking that the legislation state that at national level - Deputy Deasy echoed this point - it should be a requirement that the local authority have such a users and stakeholders group informing the discussion about the future, protection and development of the harbours.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have debated this issue extensively. The decision to give precedence to the elected representatives in key areas of decision making around harbours, in this case, Dún Laoghaire Harbour, can only be made in this House. It is fair to say that kind of decision might have to be taken in conjunction with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government but we have well flagged this and every Government and every party is well aware that there is a desire and appetite for more power to be in the hands of elected representatives and maybe less in the hands of CEOs and county managers. I am of that view. In so far as this Bill concerns how we structure the relationship between local authorities and harbours, we want the pre-eminent say in that matter to be in the hands of elected representatives, who are accountable to the public. Those elected representatives should be required simply to consult with a stakeholders’ group. They will make the decision but will also have to consult. There are two aspects to this, as against the provisions in the Bill that many of those powers and the final decision making will rest in the hands of the CEO who, with no disrespect to CEOs, is not accountable to the public. This is a more thoroughgoing, democratic reform of a relationship between local authorities and, in this case, harbours.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To clarify, must Members now make a decision about the entire grouping?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 2:In page 8, between lines 17 and 18, to insert the following:“(3) This section shall not apply to Dun Laoghaire Harbour.”.I intend to call a few votes. There are many amendments before the House. An amendment on definitions did not seem to be the appropriate one on which to call a vote but I intend to call one on the issue of the stakeholders group to make the point that I believe Members should go that step further. This series of amendments is more specific to Dún Laoghaire. I am cognisant this Bill is not simply about Dún Laoghaire and while comments have been made about other ports, those areas must speak for themselves and I do not presume knowledge of those harbours and ports. As for these three amendments I tabled with specific reference to Dún Laoghaire, I note the Minister has included other sections in the Bill that have provisions which are specific to particular ports. Consequently, it is not unreasonable that there would be specific provisions regarding Dún Laoghaire.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I believe it enhances the Bill to have specific provisions that recognise the particularities and the uniqueness of particular ports because although this Bill groups together a number of ports within a particular tier, when one considers the ports under discussion and when one hears some of the contributions made on the ports affected by this Bill, it still is the case that there is considerable diversity in that group of ports. There are different histories, strengths and weaknesses, as well as all sorts of factors to do with location, etc., including the current balance of activities, commercial, recreational and so on, in each port. These specific amendments to do with Dún Laoghaire are being tabled with reference to the specific character of Dún Laoghaire and what I am reasonably confident in stating is the majority-held view about the way forward for Dún Laoghaire. I genuinely do not say this in a presumptuous way because although I did not attend the An Bord Pleanála hearing every day - I also was obliged to be in and out of the Dáil - I spent three or four weeks at that hearing. It was a highly informative gathering at which more than 130 submissions were made by individuals, groups and stakeholders, that is, by everybody really. It was a significant number and the fact the hearing went on for four weeks tells its own story. Originally, the An Bord Pleanála hearing on the application was due to take place over a couple of weeks but it went on for four weeks, such was the level of engagement by a wide variety of groups. There also was a major engagement with the county development plan. Incidentally, it is worth noting the spirit of these amendments is echoed to some extent by the decisions the elected members made recently in the context of putting together the draft development plan. For example, councillors have voted that cruise ships longer than 250 m should not go into Dún Laoghaire. This is what the majority of councillors have voted on and that reflects what I consider to be the majority opinion in the wider Dún Laoghaire area. Indeed, that decision by the elected councillors is an example of democracy working because members of the public expressed their views at public meetings and in lobbying and in engaging with their local representatives and so on. The local representatives of all parties and none listened to that and made a decision that I believe reflects what people do and do not want for the harbour. This is how democracy should work and what these opinions have indicated clearly is that people are not happy with the corporate subsidiary structure, which previously was under the aegis of the Minister's Department but which will move to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. One option that is set out in this Bill essentially will leave that company corporate entity structure in place, albeit now with a new owner, namely, the council. This, to put it simply, is not what people want. They want that structure to be dissolved in order that the harbour comes fully under council control. I believe the Minister stated that were my view on this issue to prevail, he would look forward to how those with that view would be able to work out how to finance the maintenance and development of the harbour. I would put the shoe on the other foot, as I believe a lot of money is being wasted because of the existing structure. I estimate that if one looks at the accounts, there probably is approximately half a million euro per year going on executive salaries which it would not be necessary to spend were the harbour a fully integrated part of the council itself. The front-line employees, such as the harbour police and the maintenance workers, simply would be transferred into the council and would become council employees, which I believe is what they want, and would retain their existing conditions and so on, as allowed for by the Bill and that is fine. However, the harbour board and harbour executive structure represent a cost one cannot stand over or justify. I have had many engagements with the Minister and his predecessor about bonuses, salaries and so on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry, a Cheann Comhairle, but I will just explain it. The Bill is rather complex in that two options are set out in it, one of which is it would transfer as a corporate subsidiary and the other the existing harbour company would be dissolved and would be transferred to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. If the Ceann Comhairle looks at-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a group of amendments and if the Ceann Comhairle reads amendment No. 29-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are discussing amendments Nos. 2, 28 and 29.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	So, may I talk to amendment No. 28?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Okay.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Amendment No. 29 proposes to insert:“(2) In respect of Dun Laoghaire Harbour, the Minister shall with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, by order provide for—(a) the dissolution without winding up of the company, and(b) the transfer of the company’s harbour to Dun Laoghaire Rathdown County Council,This proposes to dissolve the existing harbour company structure and put it in as a fully integrated part of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, effectively as a department of the council. That option may not be appropriate for other harbours. That is the point on the technical matter. I do not want to say that option should be ruled out for other harbours, but we are trying to rule out the option of retaining the harbour company as a corporate subsidiary for Dún Laoghaire. That is the purpose of it. I hope I am making myself clear on that. One of the things that was discussed at the An Bord Pleanála meeting but also more generally was a way to connect the harbour to the town. Everybody accepts that the town needs to be revitalised. Everybody also understands that Dún Laoghaire Harbour is the jewel in the crown of the assets of Dún Laoghaire. We somehow need to marry these things better so that they enhance each other and help revitalise a town that needs to be revitalised. If that is what everybody wants and people from all sides express a desire to do it in any discussion on it, the logical follow-on from that is not to have two separate entities and rather have one entity. If we retain the existing company structure, notionally the two bodies are under one umbrella, but in reality they are separate bodies. The Minister might say there would still be a little more oversight - I accept that - of the council, the budgets and so on, but there will still be two separate bodies. Cherrywood, as an example of this, will come into the frame fairly soon. Cherrywood is run by a corporate subsidiary of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council. So it is like option (a) as set out in amendment No. 29.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am talking about examples of corporate subsidiaries.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	And these are amendments-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Cheann Comhairle-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These are specific amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are amendments about whether we have a corporate subsidiary model for Dún Laoghaire Harbour or whether we have it as a fully integrated part of the council.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Cherrywood is a corporate subsidiary. It is an example of that model and so it is directly relevant. The problem is that on a day-to-day basis, when it comes to an existing example of a corporate subsidiary under Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, the councillors and the public really do not have much say. Once or twice a year they get a chance to talk about it and review it, but in reality they do not have much say or input. Many people, including public representatives, do not know what is going on there. This has been the problem with Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company; we do not really know what is going on. Plans have been hatched for years in the case of a cruise berth and master plans have been developed where we have not had real input from the elected representatives, the public, the stakeholders and the users. That is what we are trying to rectify with these amendments. The best way to achieve that is to dissolve the harbour company, forget about the corporate subsidiary model when it comes to the harbour and make it a fully integrated part of the council. I urge the Minister to accept this because it genuinely reflects the majority view in Dún Laoghaire among the public and stakeholders about what to do with Dún Laoghaire Harbour.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These amendments specifically relate to Dún Laoghaire Harbour. While the Harbours Bill is an appropriate place to discuss Foynes Port and all the rest of it, the amendments deal with Dún Laoghaire Harbour, not Foynes Port or anywhere else. I agree with the point made about the cost of inflated executive salaries and so on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am. In Dún Laoghaire the chief executive receives €136,000 a year, plus approximately €20,000 on top for various extras. The recommended salary for other-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A Cheann Comhairle, I have to say-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am the only one whom the Ceann Comhairle has reminded of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am speaking to the amendments. I do not know why the Ceann Comhairle cuts across me when I am speaking specifically to the amendments.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am speaking specifically to them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is because the Ceann Comhairle spent a minute of that time cutting across me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It works both ways.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was speaking to them.I was not going off them. The Minister implied in his response that there was no difference between the two options. He said he would not accept my amendments because he had them covered in the Bill, but that implies there are not two options. The reason he has two options is they are different. Perhaps we might discuss the differences.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In one a corporate subsidiary is retained, while in the other there is not a separate corporate entity. The Minister said there was not a separate corporate entity, but, if not, what is the difference? The difference is there is a separate entity. The existing separate, commercial corporate entity is retained under the umbrella of the council. I do not know anything about Foynes port in this regard-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----but in the specific case of Dún Laoghaire, we propose that this option be taken off the table. We want full integration of the harbour company as a department of the council.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor's question should be directed at the Minister because he has set out two options in his Bill. They are not described in our amendments. The passage of the Bill will mean that it will be in the Minister's gift to make a decision on which of the options will apply to Dún Laoghaire Harbour. The first option is that Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company will continue to exist within the remit of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, while the second is that the harbour company will cease to exist and be fully integrated into the local authority.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Under both models, the council will pay. That is what the Minister proposes and the Deputy should ask him who will pay for it, not me. In either case because of what is proposed in the legislation, whatever happens in Dún Laoghaire Harbour will be paid for by the public. It is a disingenuous red herring to suggest that if People Before Profit or Save our Seafront or whichever group gets its way, the public will be on the hook for increased local property tax rates because either way, that will be the case. The big issue is which vision for the harbour is more likely to cost the people of Dún Laoghaire or which more accurately reflects what they want. That is what we need to discuss. The plans that have been hatched for the harbour to date pose a much greater financial risk to the public than those for which the public have asked. They have asked for a diaspora museum and baths; they have not asked to have a floating barge, or for apartments and hotels or a cruise berth for giant cruise ships. The councillors have also not asked for a giant cruise berth. One of the reasons they do not want it is they believe these plans pose a significant financial risk to the public. It is estimated that €18 million is required to build the berth, which we think is an under-estimate because it is more likely to cost between €30 million and €40 million. The council and the public will cover the cost of the cruise berth under either proposal if it cannot wash its face financially. This is a serious risk and it is not one that the people want to be taken because Dublin Port, 5 km up the road, is building a cruise berth to capture the same business. Two publicly owned ports within a few kilometres of each other will compete for the same business and Dún Laoghaire is more likely to lose. The tab for the crazy gamble on this cruise berth will be picked up by the public under either model. Our alternative is not to financially gamble or speculate with the assets of the harbour. It is too risky and very likely to backfire on us in a big way, which will cost us.The better, more sensible and sustainable alternative is not to spend large amounts of money on madcap gambles but to give the people the things for which they ask which would cost less and pose less of a financial risk. A diaspora museum is a win-win proposal. People have asked for it and wanted one for years and it fits in with the maritime history and heritage of Dún Laoghaire. It would result in real and tangible extra footfall in people coming to a maritime museum in the area instead of people getting on buses and travelling to Glendalough. Schoolchildren and others would visit it on a regular basis and it could be a national tourist attraction that would actually bring people to Dún Laoghaire. Could we afford to have it or a national maritime and sailing school? We already have proof that Dún Laoghaire is capable of hosting international sailing events with a huge footfall and which bring huge economic benefits to the town. That has been proved. Developing and enhancing that situation would be a win-win. There would be far less risk, if any, involved with these proposals than with proposals that involve borrowing possibly tens of millions to gamble in a competition with Dublin Port for an international business that could go bang any day. The cruise berth business is on the way up, but it could go bang very easily. It is a big risk which is not worth taking and which nobody really wants to take. That is our point. Either way, it is the public who will finance and fund this. Should we gamble and speculate with the assets of a public harbour? Our answer is no.  The local authority has to make decisions about capital projects all the time. It has money for capital projects and the people of Dún Laoghaire and their elected representatives will debate what should be prioritised. There would be a lot of support for the capital projects for which the public have asked such as the baths, the diaspora museum and the national sailing centre instead of apartments, hotels and cruise berths. Where did apartments and hotels leave the economy five or six years ago? That is gambling. What we propose would not be gambling; it is about protecting, maintaining and enhancing the harbour in a sustainable way. That is actually what the people have asked for.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 3:In page 8, lines 19 to 22, to delete all words from and including “Subject” in line 19 down to and including line 22 and substitute the following:“Subject to paragraphs (b) and (c), a local authority chief executive may not sell, transfer, exchange, surrender or otherwise dispose of any shares vested in the local authority of which he or she is the chief executive by order made under section 8.”.This is a straightforward amendment to remove the power and right of the chief executive officer of the local authority to sell shares in the newly transferred company. It is an anti-privatisation amendment.It is an anti-privatisation amendment which arises from a concern that, if the corporate subsidiary model prevails, the borrowing of money by a semi-State entity, or off-balance sheet financing, as it is known, will lead to the divestment of shares and, ultimately, a process of creeping privatisation where, in order to finance anything, one will have to sell shares. We will be on a slippery slope.  At a local level there is evidence that the process is beginning to get under way. Certain sites and physical parts of the harbour are being put up for sale. I fear that if the harbour is pushed in this commercially focused and oriented direction, rather than being seen primarily as a public amenity, the pressure will be on to sell shares to finance projects within the harbour. This is the direction in which I think it will go, but, with this amendment, I am trying to preclude that possibility. These are vital pieces of infrastructure and amenities and we should not be considering their sale.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the company law point, that is true, but the bottom line is that it still falls back on the council either way. Even if, technically, the liabilities do not transfer directly to the council, ultimately, it will still pick up the tab if anything goes wrong. It will be the guarantor of everything. Have we not learned this at a macro level? When we give guarantees and so on, we end up picking up the tab. Even if the corporate subsidiary model prevails, the capacity of Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company to raise money will be substantially dependent and contingent on the fact that Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council is standing behind it. We will pick up the tab if anything goes wrong. I do not see the difference, except that in the corporate subsidiary model we take the risk, but we do not have as much say about the plans. In the model we are advocating the public would still be the ultimate financier, but they would have a more direct say on what we would invest in and the development plans and priorities for the harbour and the way it was run. It would be more transparent, accountable and democratic to do it in that way. On the Minister's point about public ownership and other pieces of infrastructure, we could have a general ideological argument, but let us not go there now. In the case of Dún Laoghaire Harbour, although the Bill relates to other harbours also, where there is pressure to come up with development proposals and finance them, one way to do it would be to bring in private partners. I think that is what the Minister is leaving it open to doing. If private partners are brought in, they will begin to have a significant say about what goes at the harbour. Otherwise they would not put the money in.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Their decision to put money in would be dictated by their ability to get a return. In the case of something like a harbour this would be a slippery slope towards the creeping privatisation of the harbour through the back door.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Let us do it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How do we get to the kernel of this issue? The Minister made reference to due diligence earlier and during the Committee Stage debate I pointed out that the due diligence process was obstructed. Local councillors were told recently that due diligence is unable to proceed because of commercial sensitivity. That is the kernel of the problem. The harbour is seen as a commercially focused, corporate entity which is why we cannot get full information about what is going on or about its assets and liabilities. This goes to the heart of the problem in Dún Laoghaire Harbour and explains why people are so angry about the plans the company has come up with and why they are so opposed to them. Nobody really knows what is going on. The company is unaccountable.  I cannot speak for the other harbours in the country. Perhaps this structure works there, but I have my doubts. Certainly, what Deputy John Deasy said about the situation in Waterford seems to echo what I have been saying about Dún Laoghaire Harbour. I will not comment on them because I do not know enough about it. However, in Dún Laoghaire Harbour, it has reached the point where the ability of the Bill to be effectively enacted is now being blocked because of so-called commercial sensitivity.  I thanked the Minister, quite genuinely, for sending me the departmental correspondence vis-à-vis the cruise berth. However, there was one aspect of that correspondence which I found very interesting and I ask the Minister to enlighten me on it, if he can. In the relatively recent correspondence between the Department and the harbour company, two of the three proposals the company made for the harbour are blacked out. The proposals are redacted. I do not know what they are but would argue that this is important information. I would like to know, as would those in the Visitors Gallery and those who attended hearings and public meetings, what the harbour company wants to do with the harbour. However, in correspondence I received from the Minister, he cannot tell me. Why? It is because of the corporate structure, and this is the price one pays when one sets up a semi-privatised entity.  The management of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has explained that the due diligence process has been prevented from continuing. I do not know how this issue will be resolved. The council has stated it is not sure how it will be resolved but that it is committed to resolving it. On the basis of some of the Minister's earlier comments, I gather that it will be some time before we get a decision because the due diligence cannot proceed at present and could take a very long time. In the interim, we do not know what the harbour company wants to do on some matters. What we do know, however, is that it wants to take a huge financial gamble. It has already spent €600,000 on a planning application to which there is huge public opposition. Things are happening, facts are being created on the ground and in the harbour which people do not want, yet we cannot get full information about the financial status of the harbour or the company's plans for it. That is not satisfactory or acceptable.  The Minister said all public assets must keep financial considerations in mind and must have the ability to wash their own face but Killiney Hill, for example, does not do that and neither does Howth Head.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Of course, a harbour is not Killiney Hill, but there is a mix of imperatives involved and the balance of these imperatives depends on the particular harbour. Dún Laoghaire Harbour has traditionally been half and half, so to speak. It has been a public amenity for heritage, sport and recreation as well as a commercial port. There is a balance to be maintained and I accept that this makes the question of governance a bit more complicated. I am not being flippant or glib about this, but it is not acceptable that the heritage and amenity aspect of the harbour, the Killiney Hill aspect if one will, which is sacrosanct for so many, is under threat. If the Minister suggested building apartments on Killiney Hill or Howth Head, people would tear his head off, to put it bluntly. They would simply say, "That's not on." There is that same feeling about Dún Laoghaire Harbour. People accept and indeed support the idea that the harbour has a commercial life but they believe that the balance between its commercial life and its historic position as an amenity owned by the public must be maintained in a sustainable and tenable way. However, that is not happening and the governance structures that exist in what is effectively a semi-State quango mean that the balance is being threatened and undermined. The public is being excluded. Getting rid of this corporate subsidiary structure and fully integrating the harbour into the council is the way to resolve this issue in order that we can have joined-up, connected thinking and prevent any possibility of the harbour being privatised.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 14:In page 13, to delete lines 9 to 18.As time is running out and the debate is to be guillotined, I will go through these amendments very quickly. This amendment is about the Minister being able to authorise borrowings by the harbour that exceed 50% of the value of the assets. The Minister has what he might call a safeguard to provide that one cannot borrow more than 50% of the value of the assets. Although that is a safeguard of some kind, I am worried about the borrowing already taking place and which may continue. We had a discussion about the shares and so on. This relates to my fear of a slippery slope whereby the assets of harbours would be put up for sale to finance risky and dangerous projects. I have talked at length about the fact that we think one such project is under way in Dún Laoghaire and could put the assets of the harbour seriously at risk. While I welcome some safeguard, it does not go as far as I would like. I do not think we should put public assets of this sort at risk. Having included some safeguard, the Minister is leaving open the option to remove it. I do not think he should do this in the Bill. We should not put at risk the assets of harbours and ports and the Minister certainly should not have the power to put at risk more than 50% of the value of these assets on dangerous gambles. This provision is a safeguard against privatisation, whether it be as a result of a conscious decision or inadvertently as a consequence of a dangerous financial gamble. Such a consequence is equally a great threat when companies are allowed to borrow lots of money to fund speculative ventures. We simply should not give the Minister the power to go over the 50% ceiling. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Time is against us and I know that Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív wants to contribute. I will just say I disagree with the Minister as I think it leaves the door open to privatisation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I am pressing it. I am trying to short-circuit the debate in order that we can move on to the next amendment.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I move amendment No. 22:In page 18, line 9, to delete "30" and substitute "10".This amendment relates to the representation of workers on the board of any company. As the Minister knows, I hope the harbour company will be dissolved. If that does not happen and the Minister ultimately decides to keep its structure, the question will arise as to whether there should be an employee representative on the board. The Minister is saying the threshold to be reached to have an employee representative on the board is 30 employees. In the case of our harbour company and I suspect that of others that might well mean ordinary workers would not have a representative on the board because staff numbers have fallen because of an aggressive offensive by the executives of Dún Laoghaire Harbour Company to axe jobs at a time when their salaries stayed obscenely high. As I mentioned earlier, it involves the CEO of a company with about 20 employees being paid €136,000 per year, plus a car and so on, but staff being axed. With this threshold, there would be no worker director on the board. We need people from the shop floor - front-line staff who are saving lives in the case of our harbour - on the board. Many attempted suicides in Dún Laoghaire have been prevented by the harbour police, the numbers of which have been slashed, while the number of maintenance workers has been reduced. These are the people who physically maintain the harbour. If the Minister is to maintain the company structure which I hope he will not, there should be worker representatives on the board and the threshold should be brought down to ten to ensure this would be the case.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appeal to any Government Deputies who want to speak on this to respect the fact that an amendment has been tabled and we want to vote on it, namely on the specific proposal to remove this obnoxious discrimination against children in our schools. Please do not talk down the clock so we are forced to vote on the Bill as a whole because we support it, but we want the elimination of an absolutely obnoxious and unacceptable discrimination against children included in it. The essence of discrimination is that one group gets precedence over others and that is happening in our schools. Young children are being discriminated against based on their religious belief or lack of religious belief or because of the family's religion or religious belief, which overlaps heavily with their ethnic background because of the new communities coming to Ireland. It is absolutely unacceptable.The Government has no excuse but to remove that discrimination if it means what it says when it claims it is in favour of equality. Will the Minister of State and the Government side please allow the vote to happen and not talk down the clock?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, I am grand. Just let us vote.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Time.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The availability and accessibility of a roof over a person's head should be a right, not a matter for the market. That is the point. People cannot exist and function in a meaningful way in our society if they do not have a roof over their heads, and that should be obvious.A government that is incapable of providing a secure roof over the heads of its citizens is not worth the name "government". It should be ashamed of itself, particularly if, at the beginning of the 21st century, we are still trying to succeed in achieving the most elementary requirement for existence and functioning in society. The Government has failed spectacularly on this because it does not want to upset people who are profiting from homelessness and the housing crisis. That is what this is about. The failure of the Government to tackle the crisis relating to homelessness and housing is due to the fact that it wanted to improve the balance sheets of the banks, the landlords, NAMA and developers and to put them back in business. Now, it does not even want to impose rent controls. This is utterly shameful. I do not expect the Government will do anything about this. While I support the Sinn Féin proposal, I believe we need to go further and introduce a differential rent scheme because, as a result of the dwindling number of council houses, rent is now related to people's ability to pay. We need an ample stock of council houses - the rents relating to which are controlled and linked to income - to be provided by the State. This should be standard, quality housing that reaches the proper standards. This housing does not exist currently and I have no real faith the Government is serious about delivering it.
