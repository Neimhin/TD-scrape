RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is very familiar with this case; I asked her about it several times since the middle of last year. I asked that she would do what she could to secure the necessary funding to avert what is now the imminent closure of the Cottage Home family support service in Shankill, which provides vital intervention and support services for vulnerable families and children to keep them out of residential care and foster care. It only needs €400,000, but it appears that Tusla is saying that it does not have the money. I really do not understand how it cannot secure that money in order to secure the future of the service.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not doubt that the Minister has tried, but I just do not understand this. Hundreds of millions of euro have been wasted on the national children's hospital, and we are looking for €400,000 to keep a service that we know works. It provides support for 50 vulnerable families and their children, which saves the State a lot of money down the road. If this service is closed, and the support provided to those families disappears, many of these children will end up in residential care and in foster care, which will cost the State more money. Why would it be allowed to close for the sake of €400,000? I just do not believe that the Minister cannot come up with €400,000 for a service that she and Tusla acknowledge works. It is frankly unacceptable. I cannot believe €400,000 cannot be found. We can find more than €400 million to pay builders who have ripped the country off, but we cannot find €400,000 for a service that is absolutely vital. It is not on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not doubt that the Minister has made efforts and I know she knows the value of this. However, in that context, I find it shocking that, although the Minister knows the service should not close, the service is going to close, almost certainly, in April, because €400,000 cannot be found. How many Supplementary Estimates have we had for health in current and capital spending? Could we have a few Supplementary Estimates for services such as this? I am serious. It does not seem like rocket science to go to the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, and ask for a small Supplementary Estimate for a measly €400,000 to save six jobs and provide this service to 50 vulnerable families. I do not think anyone in this House would object. It should be done on moral grounds but also on value-for-money grounds for the State. Without a shadow of a doubt, it will cost the State more if this service goes. I appeal to the Minister, if there is anything else she can do along those lines, to do it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Over the past year, I have repeatedly raised with the Taoiseach the income thresholds for social housing. The programme for Government makes extensive commitments on the provision of affordable housing to our citizens as an absolute priority. However, due to the failure to address the income thresholds, there has been a significant cull of people from council housing lists. Some of the examples I have include people who have been on a housing list for 15 years. I have three such cases. Due to working overtime, which they must do to pay the high rents on the private market, they are taken off the housing list and lose the 15 or ten years of waiting time on the list. They are left in limbo because their income could not possibly allow them to afford housing on the private market. I appeal to the Taoiseach to expedite an increase in these thresholds. He should even issue an instruction that people who are forced to work overtime should not be taken off the list and those who have been should be put back on the list. I strongly appeal to him to do that. Finally, I have a Valentine's card for the Taoiseach. In fact, I have a number of them. They do not profess my undying love for the Taoiseach but are from school children who were outside the Dáil today. The cards I have are from children in John Scottus national school, but there were also children there from Educate Together schools all over Dublin. The cards, for St. Valentine's Day tomorrow, make an appeal to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, to take more radical emergency action on climate change, something the Taoiseach also promised to do in the programme for Government. Those children feel he is not doing that. I wanted to let the Taoiseach know that and I will give him the cards afterwards. He might consider what the children who were protesting outside the House were saying.
