RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On Saturday, 11 March, United Against Racism, along with a host of other organisations, including trade unions, Palestinian solidarity groups, anti-war groups, women's rights groups, abortion rights groups, LGBT groups, environmental groups and pretty much anybody who has a progressive bone in their body, will be marching here in Dublin appealing to the Taoiseach not to go to Washington. This is not some sort of protest for its own sake. In fact, the scale of mobilisation in the United States and worldwide in response to Mr. Trump's agenda, policies and the threat people rightly perceive he represents to vulnerable minorities and all categories of people, including Muslims, Mexicans, LGBT people, women-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and the disabled. One can go through the list. President Trump has put whole nations in his firing line. People understand the mortal threat he represents and they are mobilising across the world on an unprecedented scale. The protests we are seeing in the United States are of a scale that has not been seen since the late 1960s. People understand that this guy represents an absolutely mortal threat, namely, the threat of pulling the entire political spectrum in the direction of the fascist and Nazi politics of the 1930s. I do not say that lightly. Let us be clear: I do not believe Mr. Trump is a Nazi but he is dangerously echoing the politics of the Nazis, and he has people who are openly sympathetic to fascist politics in his Cabinet. He has given a fillip of support to actual Nazis and fascists across the world, who were jumping with joy when he was elected because his policies have legitimised theirs. They are all cock-a-hoop over what he is doing, what he represents and the boost he has given to them, breathing life back into the politics that led to the Holocaust. We should not underestimate the threat this man represents. This is not just another nasty president or just another particularly right-wing and obnoxious leader; he is an existential threat to the whole world and has to be recognised as such.That is why it is imperative that we mobilise against him. He has pulled off an extraordinary trick by harnessing the legitimate anger of many working, poor, disillusioned and disaffected people in the US at the betrayals and failures of the Obama Administration and the Democrats and pretending to be an anti-establishment figure as if he is going to give the establishment a kicking in a way that will serve the interests of the American working people, when he is actually manipulating that and turning it in the most dangerous right-wing direction. It is important for us to say this because those of us who are opposed to Trump should in no way use our opposition to whitewash Obama's crimes and betrayals of promises such as, for example, keeping Guantanamo Bay going, 260,000 bombing raids in Syria, Yemen and elsewhere in the world and millions of refugees turned away from the US borders. If we do not recognise the hypocrisy, failures and betrayals of Obama, we will not be able to engage with the angry people in the US who look to Trump as an alternative. Trump is not an alternative. He is the extreme right-wing face of the establishment. I say this to anyone who has illusions to the contrary. His cabinet is the wealthiest in the history of the world. It is not a cabinet representing the little people. It is a cabinet of the 1%. Wilbur Ross is worth $2.5 billion, Betsy DeVos is worth $1.25 billion, Rex Tillerson, formerly of ExxonMobil, is worth $325 million, Steve Mnuchin, Secretary of the Treasury, is worth $300 million and Andy Puzder, formerly of Goldman Sachs and a CEO in the fast food industry who is hostile to the minimum wage, is the Secretary of Labor. I do not have time to go through the lot of them. His entire cabinet's personal wealth, not including Trump's own, is $4.5 billion. There is more wealth in his cabinet than in 63 of the poorest countries in the world. That is incredible. Trump is a representative of the 1% who is using the anger felt by people in America - the poor, the unemployed and the disaffected - and turning it in a vicious, racist direction against Muslims, ethnic minorities, gay people, women and anything that is progressive. He must be resisted. I will mention one other group in that regard. Today, Trump is meeting Benjamin Netanyahu. Since Trump's election, Netanyahu, who has smashed through any sort of serious attempt at trying to make peace with the Palestinians, feels that he is completely off the leash and, citing Trump specifically as the reason, can expand illegal settlements into Palestinian territory. If Trump moves the US Embassy to Jerusalem, it will be like throwing a grenade into the political process in the Middle East. Against the threat that Trump represents, for us not to go on St. Patrick's Day would be the sort of protest that would be felt. If the Government goes, it will be legitimising and endorsing him as some sort of normal US President with whom we can have normal political discussions. We cannot. We must resist his political agenda.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Despite overwhelming public opposition, more than 2.5 million US troops have been facilitated at Shannon Airport since 2003 with the support of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael to conduct bloody wars in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Yemen, killing hundreds of thousands of people. The public is paying for this. How much are the Defence Forces spending to facilitate the US war machine? Does the Government intend to continue to spend that money when we now have a racist warmonger in the White House intent on unleashing even more war on people across the world?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have long disagreed with Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil on the facilitation of the US war machine at Shannon and the bloody consequences of that for Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and Yemen and on the spending of money to facilitate that by the Department of Defence and others. Can the Minister of State tell me if the Government intends to continue to spend public money to facilitate the US military at Shannon when we have a bloodthirsty racist warmonger in the White House? It is unconscionable if that is the case. The US Secretary of Defence is a bloodthirsty maniac whose name is "Mad Dog" Mattis and who has boasted about how it is fun to shoot and kill people and about how he wants to go and shoot more people in Afghanistan. Literally, the stench of death from the horrendous activities of the US military and Iraqi forces in Mosul means people have to cover their faces in the streets because of the stench of rotting bodies. These people want more of this. Is the Irish Government going to facilitate the war machine headed up by these maniacs, warmongers and bloodthirsty killers at Shannon Airport and spend public money on it? It seems unbelievable that it is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I certainly am not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To hide behind the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade when the senior Minister in the Minister of State's Department is the Taoiseach on this issue is, to be honest, preposterous. Has anything changed in the mindset of the Government vis-à-vis the facilitation of the US war machine at Shannon given that there is now a president that even the Government has brought itself to criticise? The President of the United States has racist attitudes and a dangerous agenda. Mattis, the Secretary for Defense, said, "The first time you blow someone away is not an insignificant event. That said, there are some assholes in the world who just need to be shot." He carries on like that. That is the thinking of the new Secretary for Defense. Does the Minister of State think we should facilitate a military machine and pay money to do so at Shannon Airport when the head of that machine thinks that way? Has anything changed?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will not accept them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Despite constant announcements, promises and plans from the Government about its intention to deal with the housing and homelessness crisis as a matter of top priority, every time the Minister examines that crisis or talks about it and every day that passes, the crisis gets worse. It is a crisis that the Government promised in its programme for Government would be resolved within 100 days yet a year on it continues to get worse, not better, on a daily basis. Yesterday's news of the escalating crisis was the daft.ie report showing that the biggest increase in rental inflation ever recorded by daft.ie since its inception, 13.5%, occurred in the last quarter of 2016. Dublin rents are now rising at a rate of 15%. Rents in Dublin are up 65% from their lowest point and 14% from their highest point before the crash in 2008. Average rents in Dublin are now €1,643 per month. In Cork, they are €1,096 per month while in Galway, they are €975 per month. They are €875 per month in Limerick and €745 per month in Waterford. Even with the Minister's rent certainty measures, another 4% can be put on that. Another 4% on rents in Dublin will bring the average rent cost up to over €1,700. In every category of rental property and in every single area, the rent allowance or housing assistance payment limits are very considerably less than the average rental levels. We have now also record levels of people in the rental market, at 475,000, which is an increase of 150,000 over the past five years, yet there are fewer than 4,000 rental properties available for rent, and most of them are unaffordable to anybody on a low or middle income. The Minister's plan is not working. Even if his plan is to deliver increased supply - the magical mantra of the market - and that he will have 20,000 extra residential units a year, if I understand his plan, there will still be a massive surplus of demand over supply, even if his plan works, for years to come. That means there will be no pressure on landlords to reduce rents. For years to come, even if the Minister's plan works, rents will not decrease, and they are already unaffordable and continue to rise. The Minister has got to change tack or the situation will get worse. I want to know what the Minister intends to do about this problem. If the HAP limit in Dublin is €1,300 and average rents are €1,600, how is somebody supposed to afford that? What are they supposed to do when they have nowhere to live? It is just not doable. If we think about it, 60% or 70% of an average worker's income is required to pay rent if they can get a property, and they probably cannot even get a property. It is just not doable. We are asking for a radical change in tack to pin rents back to affordable levels, which means retrospectively reducing rents to something like 2010 and 2011 levels, and then have the rent certainty operating from there as well as a dramatic increase in council housing provision.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The problem is that it just gets worse. If there was any sign that things were improving, I would give some credence to what the Minister of State said. It is not that the debate started today or yesterday or even a year ago. When I stood at the top of the Chamber in 2012 and warned that there would be slum conditions similar to those in Sean O'Casey's time, I remember that I was scoffed at from the Fine Gael benches. There was laughter across the Chamber because it could not possibly happen, but it is. Last week there was a newspaper report on a property in Lehaunstown. Today there is a newspaper report that a three-bedroom property with 16 bunk beds is being advertised to young women and rented out at €400 per bunk bed. The journalist who went into the place said it was absolutely squalid. We are back to tenement conditions and none of the measures proposed by the Minister of State will address the problems immediately. For example, a simple thing that could be done is, as we proposed in a motion passed by Dublin City Council, that the local authority should have the power to take and use any property which has been sitting empty for longer than six months if the owner does not signal an intention to use it. However, the city manager stated he would not implement it. I propose that he be instructed to implement the measure. It is completely unacceptable. I also propose that rents in the rent pressure zones be pinned back to affordable levels - approximately 2010 levels - as an emergency measure to make them affordable in order that everybody looking for rental property would not automatically be in a crisis, as is the case because rents are too high and HAP and rent support levels are simply not sufficient. Will the Minister of State do these things?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the spectator sport that, sadly, politics often descends into, instead of dealing with the serious issues that affect people, the chat around the Dáil among journalists and politicians is that the crisis has receded, the Taoiseach will survive a bit longer and because of decisions made by the Independent Alliance and Fianna Fáil, the Government will hobble on for a bit longer. Those are somewhat interesting issues but, frankly, they pale into insignificance compared with the issues that are at the heart of this crisis. The crisis involves the utterly despicable treatment by the State of a brave man who had the courage to blow the whistle on wrongdoing in the institution of the State that is supposed to ensure justice. That person, instead of being commended and supported in his efforts to do what is right, was the subject of an orchestrated and savage campaign of vilification, intimidation and impugning of his character.  To me there is no doubt that there was an orchestrated campaign; that is beyond doubt. The only issue is precisely who orchestrated that campaign. That is to be decided. That there was a campaign is not in doubt. The Taoiseach said yesterday the inquiry is about finding out whether there was an orchestrated campaign. There was. Everybody knows it, and there was a campaign against other whistleblowers with similar tactics used. The fact that another Garda whistleblower, Keith Harrison, also had allegations about child abuse made against him at the same time that he was blowing the whistle is too much of a coincidence not to indicate a policy at the highest level of An Garda Síochána of dealing with whistleblowers in this way. It is shocking. If that is the case, it can only be the tip of the iceberg of an absolutely rotten culture at the heart of the State and the institution that is supposed to maintain justice. Has that crisis receded? Not at all. Maybe there is light at the end of the tunnel for Maurice McCabe because at least he, in the eyes of the public, is being somewhat vindicated, something that has been forced on the State, although it is not clear that he or Keith Harrison will get the individual justice they deserve. That is far from certain, and it is unlikely that the rot in the culture of institutions of the State that could have allowed this to happen will be dealt with by any of the major parties, either those in government or Fianna Fáil, which is propping them up. The proof of that is the extraordinary decision not to ask Nóirín O'Sullivan to step aside. She is entitled to due process, something the Taoiseach has used as justification for allowing her to remain in situ. We cannot prejudge the tribunal of inquiry. However, given the seriousness of the allegations and the substantial evidence that has been brought forward, the idea that she can remain in situ where, if she were guilty, she could potentially frustrate and interfere with the line of evidence that would allow the tribunal of inquiry to get the truth and justice of the matter, is absolutely unacceptable.If the Government was being any way reasonable and was committed to a fair and impartial tribunal of investigation into the matter, it would have to ask her to step aside without prejudice so that the investigation could proceed unobstructed and with no possibility of or potential for interference. Unless it does that, I do not believe that either the Government or Fianna Fáil, which has failed to call for it, is serious about dealing with the rot that produced this scandal. On every other front where the Government has set out its priorities to deal with key issues, such as, for example, the housing and health crises, it has failed. How could we possibly vote confidence in a Government that has failed on all of these fronts?
