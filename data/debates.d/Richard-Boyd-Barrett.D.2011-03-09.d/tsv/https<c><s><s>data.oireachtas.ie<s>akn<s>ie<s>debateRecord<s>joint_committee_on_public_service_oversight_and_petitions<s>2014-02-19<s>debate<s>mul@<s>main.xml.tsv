RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister's explanations just do not add up in the context of what we understand him to have known last week as against what he said in the Dáil. When addressing the House, the Minister used the phrases "I understand that no connection between any member of An Garda Síochána with any of these matters arose" and "While no information has been furnished to me by GSOC suggesting that An Garda Síochána was involved in any way in what gave rise to the concerns which arose in GSOC about its security". The briefing he received from GSOC - which he was in possession of when he made his statement - says that the investigation was launched on the basis that the acting director of investigations in GSOC was of the opinion that, to the extent that these threats could be proven, section 102(4) engaged and that such surveillance may have originated with An Garda Síochána. In other words, the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission told the Minister that it may be under surveillance and that such surveillance may have been undertaken by An Garda Síochána. That is why it launched the investigation. Why did the Minister not admit that last week? Why did he flatly deny that he was aware of those submissions and that the Ombudsman's brief had made him aware of them? Why did he try to kill off the story? All of this does not add up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am trying to ask the questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I clarify-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can I clarify it? What is indicated here is not definitive and the Minister clung to that phrase that there was "no definitive evidence", but what that hid was that there were substantial concerns on the part of the Ombudsman that they were under surveillance and that surveillance may have been conducted by the Garda. That prompted it to undertake an investigation and to bring in experts and when they came they found more threats, further adding to possible concerns that it was under surveillance. Nothing is definitive about that. We do not know definitively if it was bugged but there was substantial evidence that it might have been bugged and the security experts told it that one of the threats that was identified was Government level technology. Any reasonable person would look at that and consider that to be of serious concern, with a need to get of the bottom of it. One certainly would not respond to those facts by saying, "There is nothing to look into here; let us move on," which is essentially what the Minister said to the Dáil last week.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has repeated-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, the concerns that led to the investigation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Come on now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The only person recently who has suggested that the Minister is too close to the Garda Commissioner is Mr. Oliver Connolly in the transcript of his conversation with Maurice McCabe. I am not suggesting that; he suggested it in the transcript. Setting that issue aside, does the Minister not think the fact that a security firm that is expert in this area that investigated possible bugging of the commission's office and revealed a threat which it said is Government level technology is evidence of possible bugging and possible wrongdoing? It is not definitive evidence but surely it is worrying evidence that something needs to be looked into. Instead of the Minister saying he was worried about this in the Dáil last week, that we need to look into it and there are serious matters of concern here that need to be investigated, he decided to say there is absolutely no connection, there is no definitive evidence, end of story and let us move on. Does he think that was an appropriate and correct response to evidence that any reasonable person looking at it objectively would say, "I am concerned about that"? Will the Minister not accept that public confidence in the Garda and in his handling of this has been seriously damaged and that the public is not convinced that we are getting to the truth of this matter?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why not? They could be.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There could be.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is still unexplained.
