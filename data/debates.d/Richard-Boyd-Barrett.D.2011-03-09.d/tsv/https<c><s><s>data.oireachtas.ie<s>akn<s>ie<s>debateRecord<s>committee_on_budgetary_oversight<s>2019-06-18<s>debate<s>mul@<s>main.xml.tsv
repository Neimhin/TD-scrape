RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the different groups for their contributions. I simply do not understand the obsession with the carbon tax being imposed on households. If I understand the testimony given by the ESRI representatives correctly, it seems even though they favour it they acknowledge that it is regressive. Reference was made to a strong trend towards regression. It was stated that low-income households spend a far higher proportion of their income on transport and energy than high-income households. The ESRI also pointed out that more affluent households have higher emissions. That is in page 6 of the ESRI paper. The centrepiece of the Government strategy is to have a regressive tax that will hurt people generating lower emissions who are most vulnerable to the regressive character of that way of approaching it. I am keen to hear the response from the ESRI on this. I am arguing that it flies in the face of at least some analysis of the application of carbon taxes elsewhere. Notably, Food and Water Watch examined the British Colombia carbon tax. The organisation produced a report arguing that after the implementation of the carbon tax in British Colombia, taxed emissions increased while untaxed emissions decreased. The implementation of carbon taxes on certain emissions did not actually impact. Moreover, insofar as there was an overall slight reduction in emissions, it was more to do with the fact that there was a recession in 2008-09. Where is the evidence? In fact, there is counter-evidence to the effect that imposing what the ESRI seems to acknowledge as a regressive tax on people will not do anything. Then, I asked myself another question. Where are we looking at the alternatives? All of this has been about carbon taxes imposed on households. Where is the costing, economics and analysis of what the impact would be if we had public transport subsidies in this country up to the level of the highest in Europe? What would the impact on behaviour be if we had free public transport? What would the impact on people using cars as opposed to public transport be if we had 1,000 extra buses in the public transport fleet? I would like to see those data because I wager the impact would be far greater than-----

Let us suppose we increased current afforestation levels from 6,000 ha per year, which is well below our stated targets, to 10,000 ha per year and the move was based on more sustainable broadleaf forestry models. What would the economic impact be? What would the cost be? What would the benefit be in terms of carbon sinks and so on? Where is the analysis of all that? It seems heavily loaded in the direction of a particular approach to this that is potentially regressive.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	By the way, that is not the case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does Dr. de Bruin wish to respond before I ask a brief supplementary question?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not beyond question that carbon taxes are effective. All the witnesses have done is assert that their effectiveness has been proven by everybody, whoever they are. I cited the example of British Columbia, where the evidence shows that the taxed emissions increased and the untaxed emissions decreased. Rather than this tax being more effective, the opposite was the case. This sort of evidence needs to be scrutinised before we can make blank assertions that carbon taxes are necessarily effective. It has rightly been pointed out that our emissions have continued to climb even though we have a carbon tax. Are we recycling the money that is being generated at the moment so that it has an impact on our emissions? The signs are that we are not doing that, even though a considerable amount is being generated from carbon tax. The witnesses seem to have acknowledged that unless the revenue is recycled in a fair and effective way, it is regressive. The experience is that the receipts from our carbon tax are not being recycled in a manner that is effective or counteracts the regressive impacts of this tax.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the purchase of carbon credits to deal with the fact that we are overshooting our targets, is it not fair to say, in language that ordinary people understand, that what we are actually doing is paying for the right to pollute much more than we are supposed to? In that sense, paying for carbon credits to deal with our failure to meet targets is retarding the global effort to reduce emissions. Is that not a reasonable description of what we are doing? In that sense, it is pretty shameful from the global perspective of addressing climate change. I am also curious about a Government decision about which the departmental witnesses may not be able to say much; perhaps the ESRI representatives might be able to say more. I am shocked at the Government's response - I had to run over to the DÃ¡il to repeat this point to the Taoiseach - to the Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018 sponsored by People Before Profit which seeks to keep fossil fuels in the ground. Scientists are saying that 80% of known reserves must stay in the ground if we are going to address the climate emergency. They refer to "known reserves", never mind exploring for more. They do not limit this to oil either. They are talking about known fossil fuel reserves, 80% of which must stay in the ground. The logic of that is that one does not go looking for more fossil fuels and one does not facilitate that search. The Taoiseach's response, in opposing that Bill, was to say that it will not make any difference to emissions. That is a bizarre statement, given what the scientists are saying. The Taoiseach said that it will not make any difference to emissions if we keep fossil fuels in the ground. They cannot both be right. Is it not obvious that if we allow exploration for fossil fuels and they are found, then more fossil fuels will be burned, more emissions will go into the environment and more damage will be done? It does not really matter much whether the fuel is gas or oil. Indeed, I would question the positioning of gas as a transition fuel. The process of producing fracked gas, in particular, also produces a lot of methane. Taken in the round, fracked gas is as damaging to the atmosphere and to efforts to deal with climate change as oil. Surely, paying for and establishing the infrastructure to facilitate gas as a so-called transition fuel is investment that could be going elsewhere. There is an opportunity cost involved in investing in infrastructure for gas and not investing in our universities to develop renewable energy technologies, for example. One comes at the expense of the other.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Those are questions. They are very clear questions.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. I said carbon credits, not carbon tax. The purchase of carbon credits-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that not a bit disingenuous? Let us be honest.
