RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the witnesses for their presentations and for all the work they have put into their submissions, which are very helpful in informing our views for the upcoming budget.  My first question is addressed particularly to SJI - I congratulate it on all its detailed work on these matters.  While I agree with much of it, I am concerned that SJI includes the €500 million to be garnered from water charges in its budget arithmetic.  This will be very controversial, not just for SJI but for many as they frame their pre-budget submissions.  It may not surprise the witnesses to hear that I am completely against water charges.  To those concerned with human rights budgeting and so on, access to water is the most basic human right.  To charge for it and make it accessible only to those who can afford to pay infringes that right.  I am a little surprised that SJI includes it in its budget arithmetic and does not seek to raise revenue elsewhere because it is regressive.  I would like to hear comments on that point. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand the complications of budget submissions but do the witnesses think water charges infringe people’s right to water?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I take that point, which is a fair one but there was a major campaign across Europe about the right to water.  If there was a line one could not cross that prevented water being used to generate revenue because people must have it, governments would have to find the money elsewhere, through corporate tax, financial transaction tax or tax on high incomes.  Perhaps SJI does not wish to state its position on this but does it think access to water is a human right that should be free of charge?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will agree to disagree slightly on that point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chairman will have to wait till the right to water campaign takes off.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Even when these allowances are given initially they tend to disappear.  That has been the experience.There is a big danger of opening the door to a punitive tax. I shall ask three or four questions and hope to get one reply from each of the relevant people. A minimum effective corporate tax rate is something that we have championed quite significantly, and figures of 6% and 9% have been put forward. I would like to hear comments and the amounts sought by the witnesses. The rate is a big area of dispute; 6% has been proposed. Judging by my calculations on the basic figures provided by the Revenue Commissioners, out of a total of €70 billion, the generation of €4 billion equates to a rate of 6%. Therefore, a minimum effective rate would not raise revenue unless it is increased to at least 9%, or as high as 12%. What figures were used to calculate a 6% rate?  I am glad every organisation has underlined the importance of housing, but there was signification variation in their submissions on housing. How much do they think the extra investment should be? Social Justice Ireland suggested €250 million to create approximately 2,500 houses, Threshold suggested €1 billion to create 10,000 houses, and Focus Ireland suggested €500 million to create 5,000 houses. I think we need the higher figure just to begin to make a dent in this issue. I would like to hear comments from the groups on the matter. Some of the housing groups are pushing for REITs, or real estate investment trusts, to increase investment in housing. I fundamentally disagree with a REIT because it would incentivise speculation in property again. It would not incentivise investment in new housing but in the purchase of existing buildings.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Sorry; I did not realise the agency would be here.  However, I ask the witnesses to make some quick comments on housing.  The next topic is rural links.  Do the witnesses think planning issues, particularly planning permission for multiple discount stores, have an impact on small towns and villages?  Dún Laoghaire is on the edge of Dublin but it has too many large supermarkets and discount stores, which have drained the life out of the town and village centre and thus affected small businesses.  Do the witnesses think large multiples and discount stores threaten village and rural life?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is that the case even if it takes away from smaller businesses and displaces one job for another?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope the witnesses will give a couple of quick responses on the other issues.  Can the Chairman tell me how much time I have left?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When other witnesses are responding, can they also comment on the housing assistance payment scheme?  Some people have talked about it in positive terms while others are concerned about whether it will work, given that landlords seem to be moving away from rent support systems.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will have to agree to disagree on that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just know it will be privatised once it starts charging for water.
