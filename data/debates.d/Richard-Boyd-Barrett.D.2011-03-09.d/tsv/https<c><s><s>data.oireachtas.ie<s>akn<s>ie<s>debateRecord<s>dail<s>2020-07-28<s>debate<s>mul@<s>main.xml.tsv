RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. I intend to share time with Deputies Bríd Smith, Mick Barry and Paul Murphy, who I hope will be here shortly.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The slithering, sliding and U-turns of Fianna Fáil and the Green Party in particular have begun in earnest with this Bill. This is a shameful betrayal of tenants that opens the door to a new wave of evictions into homelessness in the midst of a pandemic. It allows for the unthinkable. We were warned yet again this morning on national radio by Mr. David Nabarro of the World Health Organization that a second wave is coming and, more than ever, we must ensure physical social distancing but this Bill allows for the resumption of evictions into homelessness, where people would be put in more vulnerable positions. They will be on the streets, in shared accommodation provided by homelessness services or couch-surfing in overcrowded conditions with relatives and friends. How can the Government stand over allowing evictions in such scenarios when the pandemic is still with us and the public health threat remains? It is absolutely disgraceful. Fianna Fáil has demonstrated an ability for contriving spin on a par with Fine Gael in the way it has presented this Bill, incredibly implying the legislation "extends" protection for tenants when it removes protection for tenants during this pandemic. Emergency protections that were introduced have been removed in this legislation, reopening the door to evictions that were prohibited as a result of emergency legislation in March. The betrayal by Fianna Fáil in particular in this regard, aided by the Green Party, is striking in that Fianna Fáil supported the People Before Profit and Solidarity Anti-Evictions Bill 2018, which specifically prohibited evictions on the grounds of sale, which are the type of evictions being practised by unscrupulous landlords and vulture funds. Fianna Fáil backed that Bill, Second Stage of which was passed by the Dáil, and condemned Fine Gael for its refusal to support the Bill but the party is now opening the door precisely for such evictions on the grounds of sales. The party's Members voted against such a practice in the previous Dáil. Fianna Fáil also voted for a People Before Profit amendment that sought to strengthen the emergency legislation to prevent evictions that was introduced in March. Our amendment specifically indicated that all evictions should be prohibited during the period of the pandemic. Fianna Fáil and the Green Party supported the measure but they are now betraying such action, leaving tenants to the wolves and vultures. It is important to say that is not rhetoric. I have cited for this Minister and his predecessors on numerous occasions the group of tenants in the St. Helen's Court complex directly across from my office.They will be evicted if this Bill goes through. I can see the Minister signalling. I hope he is going to intervene in that case.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did send the details. I emailed the Minister last week. If this Bill goes through, the vulture fund that has been trying for three years to evict those tenants will succeed in evicting ten households, including families who have paid their rent for years and have never missed the rent. They are working people who will be evicted into homelessness as a result of this Bill's passing which will allow the vulture fund which bought that complex to evict them on the grounds of sale. It is shameful and runs completely in the face of public health guidance. It is not just Threshold, the Simon Communities, and others who have said that at a very minimum - and we are tabling amendments to this effect - the eviction ban should be maintained for everyone until the pandemic is over, or at least until the end of this year, so that no one is evicted in the middle of a public health emergency. The National Economic and Social Council, NESC, which is under the remit of the Department of the Taoiseach, produced a report in recent weeks saying that overcrowding was incompatible with the protection of public health during the pandemic and that the emergency ban on all evictions should be retained for the duration of the pandemic. Even a body under the aegis of the Taoiseach is saying that the Government should not be doing what it is doing, yet the Minister is opening the door to evictions which will happen immediately. Homelessness has decreased as a result of the eviction ban, just as we said it would. It is now going to start to increase again as a direct result of the passage of this Bill. How can the Minister possibly justify that in any circumstances but particularly during a pandemic when the Government will directly endanger the lives of the people who will be evicted into homelessness because of the threat of Covid-19? The Minister is dancing to the tune of greedy vulture funds and landlords who want the right to evict tenants on the grounds of sale, refurbishment and other ways to maximise the value of their property. That is what this is about: putting the profit of landlords and vulture funds ahead of people. I ask that the Minster please not give us the legal excuse. All the public health agencies, including the World Health Organization, are warning of a second wave. It is almost inevitable we will face further spikes in Covid-19 until there is a vaccine. The emergency context that allowed the passage of this legislation in March continues. The suggestion that somehow this is incompatible with the Constitution is nonsense and, frankly, it is unacceptable that an Attorney General who is himself a landlord would not recuse himself from giving advice on this issue. We absolutely reject that contention. To assist the Minister, today I will introduce the right to housing Bill which seeks to amend the Constitution to give greater powers in the area of housing to override private property provisions and ensure the common good by protecting people's right to secure and affordable housing, in case the Minister wants to use that excuse, which is not acceptable. We will seek to amend the Bill to ensure that the protections are retained, but we will vote against it because it is an absolutely disgraceful betrayal of tenants which will directly lead to a resurgence of evictions into homelessness of families and individuals who have done nothing wrong. I do not know how the Minister can do this in the midst of a public health emergency.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tairgim:Go gceadófar go dtabharfar isteach Bille dá ngairtear Acht chun an Bunreacht a leasú. I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Constitution.This is the same Bill I introduced to the Dáil in 2017, and at that time it was narrowly defeated. It is worth saying that although Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael voted against the Bill at that time, the Green Party supported it. In the new programme for Government, the new Government has committed to introducing a right to housing Bill, so this is the Bill and all it has to do is support it. The Minister can nod if I am correct. It is important to introduce this Bill to amend the Constitution and include the right to housing. Time and again, when we sought measures to protect the rights of tenants, such as preventing unjust economic evictions and taking over property to house people who are desperately in need, we have been told with these and other housing-related matters that we cannot do it because of the provision on the protection of private property in the Constitution. Frankly, I have never accepted that. In the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, we discovered that things we were told we could not do by the previous Fine Gael Government because they were unconstitutional, such as eviction bans and control of rents to some extent - although not enough - could be done. It suggests some of the legal justifications for not introducing a right to housing or taking measures to ensure housing provision for people in this country and protecting tenants etc. were spurious in the first place. Nonetheless, it is important that this Bill be introduced when we think of the current efforts by the Government to dismantle the emergency protections for tenants that were introduced at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. Today's disgraceful move by the new Government to remove those protections for tenants is being justified by the so-called advice from the Attorney General regarding the ban on evictions and rent increases being unconstitutional because of a constitutional protection of private property. I reject that but just to be sure, let us have the referendum. Let us get it clear in the Constitution that people would have a right to housing and that this is under the definition of the common good; this common good of the right to housing should override protection of private property, particularly when we are talking about the private property of landlords, vulture funds and others who seem to think their wealth is more important than the right to secure and dignified housing for ordinary people. This Bill seeks to insert after Article 43.2 of the Constitution, which deals with the common good and private property, the following sections:The State, in particular, recognises the common good as including the right to secure, affordable, dignified housing, appropriate to need, for all the residents of Ireland and shall guarantee this right through its laws, policies and the prioritisation of resources.andThe State, accordingly, shall delimit the right to private property where it is necessary to ensure the common good and to vindicate the said right to housing for all residents of Ireland.This is what all the housing charities, non-governmental organisations and anybody concerned with housing have said is necessary. This right to housing is necessary to end the scandal of homelessness and private property being put before the basic human right to a secure and affordable roof over a person's head. There should be no reason the Government should not assist in getting this legislation through the Houses as quickly as possible so we can have the referendum and let the people decide if the right to housing should be a basic human right in this country.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tairgim: "Go dtógfar an Bille in am Comhaltaí Príobháideacha." I move: "That the Bill be taken in Private Members' time."
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is remarkable news that the Cabinet committee on housing did not meet in advance of the significant and hugely retrograde decision, made in the Bill now passing through the Dáil, to open the door for a resumption of evictions into homelessness in the middle of a pandemic. I find that extraordinary. I do not know if the Government does not understand or, worse, does understand the implications of the Bill now going through the Dáil. Let us be clear, however, that it removes most of the emergency protections that were put in place to prevent people being made homeless and evicted because there is a public health emergency. That public health emergency still exists and people made homeless now will have their health imperilled as a result of the pandemic, and the Government will be responsible. Yet, that issue has not even been discussed at the Cabinet housing committee. That is an extraordinary admission from the Taoiseach. I ask the Government, even at this stage, to pull back from that decision because the number of people presenting for homeless services has dropped dramatically as a result of the ban on evictions. By the way, when People Before Profit put forward a Bill to ban evictions in the previous Dáil, the Fianna Fáil party supported it. I do not understand why that party is now supporting a plan to lift that ban on evictions into homelessness in the midst of a pandemic, when it is really unthinkable to put people on the street, into shared accommodation where they are more vulnerable to the virus, or into overcrowded conditions, where they are also vulnerable to the virus.  I will quickly ask about one other issue. Walking about Dublin city during the pandemic, I met an elderly woman from the south inner city. She asked me to go and take a look off Aungier Street, where a row of beautiful old buildings is run-down and empty. That elderly woman said the situation was shocking because people in her area, including her children and grandchildren, needed to be housed, yet some landlord was sitting on those empty buildings. That story is repeated in towns, villages and cities across the country, where landlords, property owners and vulture funds sit on empty properties that could be used to house people. That is really taunting the people on the housing waiting lists and nothing is being done about it.  Does the Taoiseach have any plans to go on an aggressive campaign of getting hold of hoarded land and empty properties that could be used to house people impacted by homelessness and, more generally, to address the lack of social and affordable housing by getting that property into use in respect of the dire housing crisis?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The climate situation was an emergency that needed to be addressed before Covid-19. The urgency to address the climate emergency has now been multiplied very significantly by the advent of Covid-19. There is a very important natural intersection between the destruction of biodiversity and the proliferation of pandemics. Some serious scientists are, to some extent, suggesting and have evidence to believe that the frequency of pandemics in recent years is linked to the destruction of biodiversity. H1N1, swine flu, bird flu, coronavirus, SARS, MERS and Ebola are some of the more well-known pandemics. Why is this happening? One very significant reason is the destruction of biodiversity, given that biodiversity acts as a natural firebreak to the spread of virus and disease. The destruction of biodiversity, in particular the destruction of natural habitats and forests, creates the conditions where pandemics of this sort, and the jumping of viruses from animals to humans, become more likely. We need to grasp that very important fact. Where are the most naturally biodiverse areas in this country? They are the ancient woodlands which have been almost completely destroyed. Does the Taoiseach know how much ancient woodland is left in Ireland? Just 0.002%, and that is under pressure. The lack of biodiversity in our forests has an impact in terms of its version of a virus, such as invasive species threatening them in, for example, Killarney National Park. We need to protect and nurture the ancient woodlands and allow them to expand. We need a real focus on and investment in this area, rather than monoculture forestry and the forms of agriculture that are destroying our biodiversity in a way that is threatening not just the natural world but the ability of the planet to sustain our existence.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To allow for physical distancing, as well as refurbishments we need extra physical space. This was true prior to the onset of Covid-19, where we had the most overcrowded classes in western Europe. They were unacceptably overcrowded. Now that is completely intolerable and incompatible with human health. While I understand refurbishment using libraries and sports areas is not ideal because at some time we will need those spaces again, we need additional physical capacity. There needs to be an ambitious and aggressive plan of locating additional physical space. I am sure other Deputies could point to this. It is like the point I was making about empty properties. In the middle of Dún Laoghaire, a former further educational college has been sitting empty for six or seven years. It was a scandal before the Covid pandemic but now it should be used to provide additional space for schools. On the Merrion Road beside St. Vincent’s Hospital is a building called the Seamark Building, which has probably been empty for a decade. It is about as big as ten or 15 big school halls. That is how big it is, and it is just sitting there empty. It is outrageous. I think Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has significant empty space in Cherrywood. That is one administrative area, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, with which I am familiar. This is against a background where many of our school students are in prefabs. Gaelscoil Phádraig in Ballybrack has been using prefabs for decades. How can that school expand? Over the summer, as a matter of urgency we need to get out and get these spaces that are sitting empty and use them to provide extra capacity for our primary and secondary schools, and indeed for some of our universities.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Tánaiste and Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Varadkar, and the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, have been under the spotlight for the disgraceful move to cut pandemic unemployment payments, PUP, for people who engage in non-essential travel. The Minister himself has not been under much scrutiny but I put it to him that he is significantly responsible for this mess. The statutory instrument which the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Humphreys, is using to cut people off the PUP refers to the travel advice on the website of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade which actually says that non-essential travel to a whole list of countries is okay. Did the Minister discuss the advice with NPHET and did they agree with it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister saying he is now a public health doctor, an epidemiologist or a virologist?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not. However the Minister has ignored the advice of the virologists, epidemiologists and the public health experts. He did not answer the question because he knows it would not suit him and would show that the Government has departed from the public health advice, from the expert advice. The Minister is saying there is no threat of bringing the virus back from these countries because they have a lower infection rate but what about solidarity? We might be taking the infection to them. Has the Minister considered that? This is Ryanair dictating public health policy. That is what is actually going on and victims of that are the people who are getting their pandemic unemployment payments cut.They were understandably confused by the mixed messages, whereby the Department's website explicitly states the injunction against non-essential travel does not apply to 13 countries, including Italy, Greece, Malta and Cyprus. That is what it says. Some people followed that advice and then had their payments cut.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is shocking.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not make accusations lightly but the Minister has just misled the Dáil, just as he has been misleading the public. Under a heading that mentions general advice to avoid non-essential travel the website states, "In accordance with Government policy, which is based on official public health advice, the Department of Foreign Affairs continues to advise against non-essential travel" but then it states:as of 21 July, travel to a very limited set of locations is exempted from this advice. The security status for those locations to which non-essential travel can resume has been changed to 'normal precautions'.It is very clear that these locations are exempted. The injunction against non-essential travel does not apply. It says it in black and white. The statutory instrument that the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, has used to cut off people's pandemic universal payments refers specifically to this. It is the fault of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade that people believed it was okay to engage in non-essential travel because the Department's website said and still says that it is okay and the injunction against non-essential travel does not apply. The Government put out mixed messages and people are now getting their payments cut because of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Being dishonest does not make it clear either.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I must state that Deputy Costello is in the wrong Government if he is looking for legal action on Israel's flouting of human rights, international law or a Government that is going to fight in any serious way for justice for the oppressed Palestinian people, because the Government has stated that it will not pass Senator Black's Control of Economic Activities (Occupied Territories) Bill which would impose some sanctions. I do not understand why the Government will not do that, or step up and insist that the EU ends the Euro-Mediterranean trade agreement which gives preferential trade status to Israel or recognise a Palestinian state. Before the Minister states it is not possible for us to take unilateral action because we are part of the EU, it is worth stating that we have learned something else from the Covid-19 crisis, and that is that states within the European Union are able to take unilateral action on travel restrictions which are not uniform across Europe. If we can do that during the emergency of Covid-19, why can Ireland not do that regarding the emergency of the annexation of Palestinian land? 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Hello.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish I could be light-hearted about this Bill but unfortunately I cannot. This is disturbing evidence of the deceit and dishonesty that is starting to characterise this Government within a very short time of entering office. One of the first deceits is that the note that was provided on this Bill made absolutely no reference to the fact that the Government was changing the goalposts on the pandemic unemployment payment, as far as eligibility was concerned. Let us remind ourselves that this is a payment that was given to people who lost their jobs and incomes through no fault of their own. Public health measures initiated by the Government meant that they lost their jobs. The vast majority of people who continue to receive the payment are not at work because they cannot return to work due to Government health measures. Now the Government wants to punish them. Those necessary measures, which were correctly taken to protect society, led to people losing their jobs and income. They are the reason people cannot return to work. The Government now wants to punish, scapegoat and treat these people with utter contempt, to the point of humiliating them when they go on holiday in line with the advice on non-essential travel provided by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. That is what is happening. I know the answer to this and have been trying to blow the whistle on it since the weekend. Most people did not even get it because it is the intersection of the Minister's statutory instrument and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade travel advice. The Minister's statutory instrument says that getting the pandemic unemployment payment is conditional on following the travel advice but what the travel advice says is that non-essential travel to 13 countries is allowed. I would bet however that the Department is taking the payment off people who are travelling to those 13 countries. If they were to appeal, they would probably win and get the payment back because there is no legal basis whatever for taking it from them. Of course, prior to the introduction of the statutory instrument, in April and June, the Department was also doing this. There was not even a statutory instrument in place at that point. I have received emails from people who were stopped at the airport at that time. In one case, a man whose partner was going on holiday had her pandemic unemployment payment and child benefit cut. It is absolutely unbelievable what is going on. The Department had no legal basis for doing that at the time. What is behind this is naked class prejudice and racial profiling. That is what is going on because it is okay for the rich or those who have been lucky enough to be able to return to employment to go to the green list countries. I want to make clear, by the way, that as far as I am concerned we should all be following the NPHET advice of no non-essential travel. It is the Government that is departing from that advice. It is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that is departing from that advice. Even today, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, said it was actually safer to travel to the 13 countries than it is to stay here. This begs the question of whether we should perhaps all go to Greece, Italy or Cyprus because it would be safer, except it would not be safe for the Greeks, Italians and Cypriots because we would be taking the virus with us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Apparently that is okay but the Government is going to punish poor people, those who have lost their job through no fault of their own, for following the advice that is on the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade website. That is what is going on. It is shocking, as are the double standards behind it. If the Taoiseach were to decide that he fancied going to Italy, Hungary or Cyprus, would he have his salary, which is public money, docked? He would not. The Government is singling out people on social welfare payments. I got a message today from a carer who was stopped. This was a carer taking a bit of respite. This is sickening stuff. I suppose I should expect it from Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil but for the Green Party to do this is utterly nauseating. I would bet that if the Minister were to look at the list of 102 people, she would find certain common characteristics, namely, they would have foreign-sounding names or look a bit foreign, even though they are residents and citizens of this country. That is what is really going on. The other thing that is really going on in this Bill is an attempt to whip people who lost their jobs through no fault of their own as a result of public health advice into low-paid employment in other jobs. That is what the Government is doing. It is giving itself the legal right to put pressure on people who work in the arts, in live entertainment and music to go to work in a McDonald's. It is doing so to improve the employment figures and because deep in the soul of Fine Gael there is a hatred of people who, through no fault of their own in most cases, must depend on social welfare. It is a deep prejudice that is stamped into the DNA of Fine Gael and it is nauseating. It would seem there was no legal basis for any of this until now and the Government is desperately trying to rectify the situation by retrospectively bringing in this legislation to legitimise the measures. I would love it if the Minister would answer a direct question. Have recipients of the pandemic unemployment payment and other social welfare payments who are complying with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade travel advice and going to one of the 13 countries had their payments cut? I repeat that I am not suggesting people should go to those countries. I am pointing out that the confusion about travel starts with the Government's advice. It is the Government that is saying it is okay to go to certain countries in a departure from NPHET advice. It is members of the Government who should have their payments docked for breaching health advice because NPHET and the expert advisory group have made it clear there should not be non-essential travel. Ministers should have their pay docked for refusing to comply with that advice and endangering the public health effort.Crucially, and this is where it really is bad, all of the public health measures and the enthusiastic commitment of people to measures that meant they had to suffer significant hardship were dependent on the principle that we are all in it together. That is why there was such compliance, because the measures applied to everybody. Rich or poor, no matter what a person's station in life, we were supposed to be all in it together and we were all going to suffer the same hardships. People believed this but it seems they were fools to believe it. At the first opportunity, the Government reverted to type and started the discrimination, inequality and bias against the least well-off, the vulnerable and those who were unlucky enough to lose jobs and still not be able to get back to work because of the public health measures the Government imposed. This is the truth of what is going on. Really, I am at a loss for words as to what the Government is saying. I would love if the Minister got up and said the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is that people on the payments are allowed to go to one of the 15 countries on the list. I reiterate that I do not think anybody should be allowed to go but it should apply to everybody. I bet people on payments are not allowed and they are losing their payments. This was clear when the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade got up today and said the Government is saying nobody should go but the very same Minister states on the Department's website that it is okay to go to 15 countries. However, the Government will only impose penalties on certain categories of people, who tend to be the less well-off, the vulnerable and those who have lost employment. We will try to amend the legislation. I do have to say I am disappointed our other amendment was not taken, seeing as we facilitated a rushed Bill and guillotines but nonetheless we have tabled an amendment to take out this attempt to change the goalposts behind the pandemic unemployment payment and smash up, which is what the Government is doing, the principle of solidarity that underlay the public health measures. It would be better if the Government accepted this but we will put it to a vote later.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to speak to the section, which refers to the Title of the Bill. Lets us remind ourselves of the Title. It is the Social Welfare (Covid-19) (Amendment) Bill 2020. In other words, this is a Bill that is supposed to be a response to a public health pandemic. I put it to the Minister that she should change the Bill or its Title because it is clear when one reads the text and hears Government policy on the matters we have debated on Second Stage that the Government is not trying to address Covid-19 or assist in the battle against it in this legislation. What it is doing is actually a threat in our battle against Covid-19 in a number of ways. First, it has been put to the Minister on multiple occasions, and I put it to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Simon Coveney, again today, that the Government is speaking out of both sides of its mouth on the question of non-essential foreign travel. I believe there should be no non-essential foreign travel and that it endangers public health. I say that not because I am an expert but because the actual experts, namely, NPHET and the expert advisory group, say that. They say there should be no non-essential travel outside the State. However, the Government says, unless the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is somehow no longer part of the Government, and I think it still is, that non-essential travel to 13 countries is okay.The website states that the general advisory against non-essential travel does "not apply to those 13 countries." The Minister is, therefore, penalising a specific group of people in receipt of the PUP who heed that advice, and conclude from it what anybody who understands English would conclude, that is, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Government say it is okay to travel to those 13 countries. I do not think it is okay. The Minister claims, she says, it is not okay but the Ministry responsible for it, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, says it is okay.  The Minister then punished people who followed that advice by cutting off their payments but not rich people who do not have to depend on the PUP or workers lucky enough that their sectors have recovered and they are back at work. They can go to the 13 countries. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, even embellished it further earlier today by saying it is safer to go to those countries. He actually said that today in the Dáil. There is less likelihood of getting an infection in the 13 countries than here, which begs the question, why are we not all going? Seriously, why are we not all going? We are less likely to get infected if we believe the Minister. Luckily, he is not a virologist, epidemiologist, or a public health doctor, although he appears to behave as if he is because he is issuing advice on public health matters that directly conflicts with what NPHET and the expert advisory group said.  Deputy Coveney and the Government are breaking from the public health advice, sowing confusion and threatening the second wave which the Minister just said she was concerned about. She said if there is another wave, people will blame her. They will blame her because the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is telling people it is okay when NPHET is saying it is not okay. They would be right to blame the Minister. If she wants to do something about that, there is a simple way. It is not about selectively cutting off the payments of one cohort of people. It is simply about changing the advice of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to say it is not okay to go to those 13 countries and to further say that anybody who breaches the advice of the public health authorities will receive the same sanction, whatever that sanction is. We are all in it together in solidarity; an injury to one is an injury to all. She can put it whatever way she likes. There should be one law for everybody when it comes to protecting public health. The Minister has two laws and she is speaking out of both sides of her mouth on the issue of public health. It is fundamentally dishonest and fundamentally damaging to the fight against Covid-19. Frankly, the Minister should be ashamed of herself for it. The second issue whereby her actions are threatening the public effort is in selectively looking for the means to cut certain people off the Covid-19 payment which, as she rightly said, was introduced to underpin solidarity in the fight against Covid-19 in a financial way. The point of it was to ease the hardship caused as a result of people losing their jobs and income because of Covid-19. From the beginning, however, certain people were excluded and discriminated against, namely, the over-66s. I thought I misheard when Deputy MacSharry - because I presume, he is now going to vote against this Bill - said he wished the Government would do something about the discrimination against the over-66s. It is repeated in the Bill. A person does not get the PUP if he or she is over 66 or under 18 even if he or she is working. What did that do? That meant taxi drivers who were working during the height of the pandemic, and most of the taxi drivers who are still working are over 66. Precisely the people who should have been cocooning were working. The Government's discrimination was, and is, threatening the health of the most vulnerable group of taxi drivers and that remains the case. The inequity of it is threatening the fight against Covid-19.  Of course, one then begins to think about what is the real agenda behind the Bill. It has got nothing to do with the fight against Covid-19; it is about driving people off the pandemic payment. The Government was forced under pressure to raise the pandemic payment from her original proposal of €203 up to €350 because people rightly said it was not enough, and now it is desperately trying to unravel that. That is what is going on. This Bill gives the Minister the legislative armoury to do it and copper-fastens the distinction she has imposed that largely affects the self-employed.  Three major victims of this are artists, taxi drivers and people who work in the bar industry. All of them are being picked on and having their incomes cut even though they cannot return to work because of the Minister's public health advice. This is incentivising them to bang down the door of their employment and say, "Open the bars" because that is the only way they can recover their income when, of course, the public health advice is to keep the bars closed at the moment. That is the truth. The Minister can cry crocodile tears about the plight of the arts workers, musicians and all the rest of it, and then do absolutely nothing about it, or, in fact, do worse than nothing by slashing their income. That has happened and she is copper-fastening it in this Bill. That is undermining the public health effort. It breaks the solidarity that has underpinned that public effort and because she is breaking that solidarity she will be to blame if things go wrong.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is the section that arms the Government to harass people into whatever jobs it feels they should be forced to take up. This work will, in most cases, be low-paid and this measure will be directed against the people who have been hardest hit by the pandemic. These include groups some of us in this House identified as really getting hammered by the Government a number of weeks ago including taxi drivers, arts workers and those who work in music and live entertainment. The Minister says she is very concerned about that sector. Those who work in live entertainment have explicitly told the Special Committee on Covid-19 Response that their main fear is that people will be driven out of the sector if they are not supported. They will be forced to leave the sector because they will not be able to survive. The Minister is making that more likely. She is hammering a sector that is already on its knees. That is pretty shameful. She has not responded to the sector's pleas for help. Instead, she is whipping up bogeymen and scapegoats and encouraging the notion that there are many people out there scamming the system and that the State must arm itself against them. It is Fine Gael reverting to type. I am sorry to put it like that but there is deep prejudice at work. The vast majority of these people lost their jobs because of public health guidelines and want to go back to work in the sectors in which they previously worked. The Minister, however, wants to harass them.  It is already happening. Those in the arts were suffering a lot of this before. They were being pushed onto various courses and being hounded by Intreo and so on. We are now ready to step that stuff up again despite the important role these people played in sustaining us through this difficult period. A group of 4,000 musicians is now up in arms. Some have already had their payments cut. The Minister says this has not happened but it has. As a result of the way the Government has decided to calculate the reckonable income of self-employed people, they are deemed to have been earning less than €200 even though they were earning much more and their payments are consequently cut. That is what is happening to self-employed people such as lone traders, artists, musicians, taxi drivers and others. Their payments are being cut even though they were earning more than the threshold. People are being kicked when they are down. It is not fair and it is unjust. That is why we seek to delete this subsection.
