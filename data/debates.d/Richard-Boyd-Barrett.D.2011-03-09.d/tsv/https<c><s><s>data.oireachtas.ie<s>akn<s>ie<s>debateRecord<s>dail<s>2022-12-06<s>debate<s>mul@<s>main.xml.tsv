RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Saturday, 17 December is the day the new Taoiseach will be elected. The Cost of Living Coalition has called a demonstration outside the Dáil for that day. It is a very broad group of trade unions, students unions, disability groups, anti-poverty and housing groups and believes we do not need a new Taoiseach but a new Government. If there was not enough evidence of that need, we have had further evidence of it today with the Bank and Payments Federation Ireland, BPFI, report that shames this Government. It shows we have seen four and a half times the rate of increase in rents when compared with the rest of Europe. This has resulted in average rents in my area of €2,400 and average rents in Dublin of €2,200. These are totally unaffordable for a whole generation of young and working people, who are now being driven out of the country. On top of that, we had the Goodbody report last week that showed commencements of new-build apartments and houses have dropped very significantly in the last few months. I do not know how the Minister can say Housing for All is working. Apartment commencements have dropped by 29% and house commencements by 23%. We got another report today from Citizens Information and the Disability Federation of Ireland showing that people with disabilities, mental health problems and other very ill and vulnerable people are not being given anything like appropriate housing. I raised last week how it is taking about a year for a person in my area to get a medical assessment of housing need. Very sick and vulnerable people are not being housed at all or are being put in utterly inappropriate conditions. Against this background, it is beyond belief that at the end of this year, the Government will have underspent the housing budget by €700 million and it claims this is a success for the Housing for All plan. I got some figures from Mel Reynolds, the housing commentator, this week. I will put these to the Minister as questions he might wonder about the answers to. Does he know how many new council houses Dublin City Council built in the first half of this year? Guess.It was zero. Does the Minister know how many new council houses Fingal County Council built in the first six months of this year?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was zero. Does he know how many Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council built in the first six months of this year? Zero. Does he know how many South Dublin County Council built in the first six months of this year? Zero. Is the Minister serious in claiming his Government's plan is a success when it has failed to spend nearly €750 million against a housing crisis of this scale and when, in the epicentre of the housing crisis, the four Dublin local authorities built no new council houses?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Planning permissions are not the issue in the housing crisis. We have 80,000 planning permissions granted at the moment. The problem is that those in the private sector has no interest in solving this crisis. Why would it when it can command record house prices and record rents? It has a vested interest in not solving the crisis because if there was lots of cheap accommodation it could not make such big profits. The Minister claims, against that background where the State has to intervene, with catastrophic market failure causing human misery for tens of thousands of people affected by this housing crisis, that public housing is ramping up. I just gave him the facts. In the first six months of 2022, in the teeth of this crisis, the four Dublin local authorities built no new council houses. The Government has failed to spend €700 million that was allocated for housing. What is the Government going to do about that? What is it going to do to ramp up the construction of local authority housing? What is it going to do with that €700 million? Will it, for example, purchase multi-unit complexes like Tathony House, St. Helen's Court, the buildings on Rathmines Road Lower, or other places where people face eviction?Will it stop evictions happening while we face this emergency?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will it control rents and make them affordable? Will it deliver public housing via our local authorities whose job it is to do so?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the first time in 15 years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have little to add to what Deputy Smith said on the substantive issue except to encourage those in the Construction Defects Alliance, the Apartment Owners' Network and all those campaigning on this issue to keep up their battle. It is because they have campaigned that they are forcing this discussion in this House and that they will force the Government to give them the 100% redress they want and deserve, and accountability for those profit-hungry cowboys who were let off the leash by successive Governments. The fact that the Government let these people off the leash who were willing to leave the homeowners with the trauma of unsafe buildings and huge financial costs means the Government owes them. The Minister needs to give that commitment tonight. He needs to engage every step of the way with the people in the Gallery and the other groups to ensure at an absolute minimum they get the 100% redress that the mica campaigners and the pyrite campaigners fought for, and accountability for the rogues and cowboys who did this. In the brief time I have available, I will address another group and pose a series of questions which the Minister probably does not have the answer to. Information has been brought to me to the effect that the Housing Agency is now suspending payments and further leases to Home For Life, the private entity that was set up in 2007 and approved to do mortgage to rent for people with mortgages in distress, on the basis that it has not done repairs to defects in buildings. Hundreds of people had their homes bought by Home for Life and Home for Life is getting paid rent by local authorities. Those people are, therefore, now local authority tenants.As I understand it this is because defects were not being remedied and repairs were not being done. It poses the question as to whether hundreds of people in Home for Life are living in unsafe buildings. We need to find this out quickly. Did the local authorities that did the arrangements for Home for Life do the surveys they were supposed to do? They were supposed to inspect those houses within 90 days to make sure the repairs had been done. Certainly in the cases I have come across this did not happen. Are hundreds of people living in unsafe places? Were the local authorities at fault for not doing proper surveys? What was Home for Life doing? Essentially it had cornered the market for mortgage to rent but was not willing to put in the money to remedy structural defects and other problems that may render the houses unsafe. What will now happen if Home for Life is in trouble? The Minister needs to come back to me on this. I do not expect answers tonight. If the company is in trouble, what will happen to the 480 people approved for mortgage to rent to prevent the repossession of their homes and the more than 700 people in Home for Life who may have defects or problems that need to be remedied? The State has to remedy these defects and protect these people if Home for Life has let them down and if council and statutory regulations were not adequate to protect them.
