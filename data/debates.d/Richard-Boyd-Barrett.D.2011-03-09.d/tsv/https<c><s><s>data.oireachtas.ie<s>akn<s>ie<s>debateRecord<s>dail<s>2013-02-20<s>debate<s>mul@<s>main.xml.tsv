RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Indeed. As this relates to Deputy Mattie McGrath, he feels this issue, which concerns him, should not be taken without debate and that he should have an opportunity to make a statement in response to it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Out of any sort of due process, natural justice or whatever one wishes to call it, he should be allowed to speak in his own defence and the Government should allow that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Following yesterday's historic events, the Magdalen women highlighted the issue of human rights as being critical to their plight and experience. In this regard, will the Taoiseach consider moving forward as quickly as possible the planned legislation on human rights and an equality commission so that the momentum of yesterday's events can feed into it and we can strengthen our human rights legislation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The crisis of mortgage distress is a disaster that will soon turn into a catastrophe. More than 160,000 families are suffocated with an unsustainable debt burden and the number is rising by approximately 800 every week. Nothing has been done. After two years in government there is no let up on the deepening of this crisis. The Government refuses - for reasons I cannot understand - to assert the control it has over the banks that we bailed out and where the Government is the major shareholder to simply tell them to sort this problem out by writing off unsustainable debt. The economy is being utterly suffocated. It is not just the enormous distress and anxiety that the families directly affected are going through, but the entire economy is being suffocated because of the problem. If the Government is the major shareholder in the banks that we have bailed out why can it not simply tell them to write off the debt or restructure it in a sustainable way? It is inexplicable. I accompanied a family with a distressed mortgage to AIB last week. The bank accepted that the mortgage was unsustainable and that something should be done but could not tell us what it would be. Someone muttered something about long-term forbearance. It was said, unbelievably, three times during the course of the meeting that the family might win the lotto in the next few years. Is our policy for dealing with mortgage distress or the effect it is having on the economy to hope that the country will win the lotto or that all of the people in mortgage distress will win the lotto? They are not going to win the lotto; the Government must make the banks do the right thing and sort out the problem.
