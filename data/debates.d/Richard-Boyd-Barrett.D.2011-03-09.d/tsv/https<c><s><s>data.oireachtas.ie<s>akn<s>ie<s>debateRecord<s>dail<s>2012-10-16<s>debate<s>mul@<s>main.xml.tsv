RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The group of home helps, mostly low paid women workers, whom I brought to the Gallery for Leader's Questions two weeks ago will hold a demonstration tomorrow against the Government's moves to cut home help hours and privatise home help services. They decided to hold this protest because they were so furious at the Taoiseach's response to the concerns I raised on their behalf and the way he misrepresented their plight and that of elderly and disabled people for whom they provide services. The Taoiseach dismissed the idea that home helps are now working on an on-the-clock system, when they are. He also said people who need home help hours are getting them, when huge numbers of home help hours are being cut. A woman contacted my office today to tell me she has been on a waiting list for home help for weeks and now has to pay a private home help company €26 per hour to get the services the Government is not providing for her. That example is at the nub of the issue. Home helps who are working for not-for-profit organisations and earning approximately €12 per hour are being replaced by private companies that are charging €26 per hour. It gets worse. The person advising the Minister for Health, Deputy James Reilly, was until last year working for Sedexo, the parent company of one of the private home help providers that is benefitting from Government cuts in home help hours and the privatisation of the home help service. Will the Taoiseach reverse these despicable cuts in home help hours which are being directed at the elderly and disabled in our society? Will he halt the agenda of privatising home help services to the benefit of private companies that see the needs of the elderly and disabled as nothing more than an opportunity to make profit? Will he come out of the bubble of the Dáil tomorrow and meet the home helps when they arrive at the gates of Dáil Éireann and assure them that he is not going to sacrifice their jobs and their service in order to pay back the bankers and speculators who wrecked our economy?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope the media are taking note of this because I can show evidence that what the Taoiseach said is not true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope the Taoiseach will correct the record of the Dáil when I show him and the media the evidence that what he said was misleading the Dáil. I had never seen and certainly had no hand in writing the e-mail to which the Taoiseach referred.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, he did not.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He did not. That e-mail-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I discovered afterwards from the parents in the Gallery that the e-mail was sent by the parents themselves to the director of services at Dunmore House. It had nothing to do with me.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach has misled the public and the Dáil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In it they expressed their anger that they had contacted the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, the week before and he had not responded. He later refused a meeting which the parents wanted.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The question I asked the Taoiseach was about the cuts in hours for home helps and the moves to privatise the home help service. Does he not think it is a very serious conflict of interest to have somebody who was working for a private company, which is involved in the provision of for-profit health care services, now advising the Minister to privatise the home help services to the benefit of private for-profit companies?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not mention the individual, a Cheann Comhairle.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I did not mention the individual.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach tell the home help workers and the elderly and disabled people to whom they provide services that he will reverse these cuts and halt the moves to privatise home help services, where not-for-profit organisations are being replaced by profit hungry private companies that are charging much more from our vulnerable and elderly citizens and degrading the quality of that service by demanding that home helps work on the clock?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope the Taoiseach will apologise for misleading the House when I provide the evidence that he is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is the sort of dishonest spin that characterises the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In your dreams.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At this stage I am not sure whether the Taoiseach is being humiliated by the powers that be in the European Union or if he is playing some grand trick on the people with promises of debt relief and also some relief on the crippling burden imposed by the European Union in order to protect the bankers and bondholders when he knows well we are getting nothing. Whatever the truth of the matter, the people are being humiliated and crushed with the austerity that the European Union demands in order to protect the bankers and bondholders. It is insisting that they are protected at all costs regardless of the consequences for ordinary people, vulnerable sectors, workers, the unemployed, the disabled and the young. All of those things matter not a jot to the European Union so long as the bankers are paid back. All of that might be excused if there was some sign that it was working. We have heard from virtually every official source in the past week or two that what we have been saying on this side of the House for the past two years is right, that the impact of cuts and austerity will not help the economy recover but is doing critical damage to the economy and the European economy.The latest announcement was on the British economy. Its equivalent of the fiscal advisory council advised that its predictions for growth in the British economy and for the impact of austerity on Britain's economy have been exactly 100% wrong, just as the fiscal advisory council and the IMF have admitted that their predictions of the impact of austerity on this economy have been 100% wrong, which is precisely what we have been saying for the past two years. The Taoiseach can rubbish us as he does - it seems to be his standard tactic to rubbish the criticisms of the left. Is he now saying that the IMF, the Office for Budget Responsibility in Britain and the fiscal advisory council are wrong in saying that the impact of austerity over the past two years has been much worse - by a margin of 100% - than the Taoiseach told this House and the public it would be? At what point will he admit he and powers that be in Europe were wrong, and that the prescription to help the economy of Europe, including this country, to recover has turned out not to be medicine but poison that is destroying our prospects for economic growth? When will he take that message to Europe? When will he stand up and be counted, and side with the ordinary people, who are taking to the streets in Europe, saying that this is wrong, not working and is the road to disaster? Is there any point on the trajectory towards economic depression when the Taoiseach will finally put up his hands and admit this is not working and that we need an alternative strategy? Is it that despite the crocodile tears he sheds, secretly the Taoiseach, along with the Chancellor Merkel, is fully behind imposing austerity onto ordinary people because the real agenda is not to help the European economy recover or get debt relief but to asset strip countries, such as this, of its health service, education, natural resources, oil and forests, as is being done in Greece, Portugal and Spain? That is what is happening. Behind all the rhetoric and all the fine words at European Council meetings and in this Chamber, what is happening on the ground for ordinary people is a series of cuts and privatisation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When will he admit the truth and stand up in Europe to defend the interests of ordinary people in this country?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The situation is too serious for the Taoiseach to try to trivialise serious questions and serious debate with talk about fantasy economics. What has not been officially acknowledged by the IMF-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not the case that the IMF has now officially acknowledged that its forecasts were the fantasies? These were the forecasts on which the Government based its policies because the troika demanded it.The growth which the troika predicted has not materialised because of the crucifying level of austerity imposed on our people and economy. Not only has it not materialised in Ireland, the crippling effect of austerity is now spreading from the core into the centre of Europe, including in the United Kingdom, our biggest trading partner. Regardless of how competitive our export industry is, if people in Europe have less money in their pockets because of the austerity being imposed on them, our ability to export our way out of this crisis will be choked off. This is precisely the reason the forecasts are being downgraded, which throws everything off. That is a fact. I am not the only person saying this, as the Taoiseach knows.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Despite this, the Government proposes to continue with the same austerity. The Taoiseach is living in fantasy land in terms of his speaking about investment in jobs when there are 33,000 fewer jobs than last year in the economy, there is less overall investment than there was a few years ago and ordinary people are being hammered, with their living standards and purchasing power, along with the domestic economy, declining. Will the Taoiseach now admit what the IMF, the chief architects of this austerity, has admitted, namely, that austerity is not working, that we need an alternative path and that the myth that this level of austerity and growth were compatible, as peddled by the Taoiseach and IMF, is not correct? It is not possible to cut one's way out of a recession. That is official. It is not only the left but the mainstream parties who are saying this now. If this is the case, the Taoiseach needs to stand up and fight rather than meekly submit to the demand that we suffocate under debt and austerity. He needs to say that we will no longer do this because it is killing us, which means as of next year, we will have a primary surplus in this country, with the deficit being all interest on debt. That is the card we must play.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should tell them that if they do not write down the debt, which was incurred by speculators and imposed on the people of Ireland, we will not pay them next year, that we will give them until that time to write down the debt and that, otherwise, we will no longer play ball, thus standing up and defending the interests of Irish citizens and working people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I said we would have a primary surplus as of next year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is positive, of course.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I acknowledge that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not believe I am the one with whom they are disillusioned.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is my fault now rather than that of Fianna Fáil or the Government.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Deputy be joining the protest?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	And all the people heading to Shannon Airport.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the considerable fear and anxiety among many over the prospect of the knife of austerity being stuck further in-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A debate has been promised. When will the Government allow the pre-budgetary debate on the economy that the Opposition asked for?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How will the debate be arranged?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I suggest-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not finished.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have not finished.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to ask about the precise recourse available to a Deputy when another Member of the House has factually misled the House and impugned the character of that Deputy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach apologise for it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I can provide him with evidence of the factual misleading of the House and the defamation of the character of a Deputy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was not a dirty little trick.
