RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can the witnesses distinguish between the elements of what they have described that are in the regulation and those that are in the directive?  One, if it is agreed, will be directly enforced, while the other will have to be transposed into law, taking into account national circumstances.  Which parts will be in the regulation and which are in the directive?  If Ireland says "No" to this on subsidiarity grounds or any other grounds, what regulations will pertain with regard to matters such as capital ratios, liquidity ratios and so on?Will the witnesses refer to the status quo which pertained in these areas prior to the crisis and which, it is believed, failed or was inadequate to deal with the crisis?  Is it fair to characterise the position in this way?  Is this seen as a comprehensive effort to deal with the regulation of banks and their behaviour, activity and so on or is there more to it?  It strikes me that if this is it, then the proposal is grossly inadequate.  It is not sufficient simply to discuss capital ratios and the elements of governance referred to.  They are moving in a somewhat more onerous direction in terms of regulation but what is the thinking behind this?  It seems to be considerably short of the mark in terms of identifying what the banks did wrong.  It was not simply a problem with their capital and liquidity ratios or that directors were on multiple boards and, therefore, not focused.  Is this the extent of the analysis within the European Council about what was wrong with the banking system?What is the delegation's opinion about the divergence between the two camps on this question?  It appears those in one camp are seeking more onerous requirements in terms of capital and liquidity ratios, etc. and they believe those in the other Franco-German camp are diluting these requirements.  What does the delegation believe to be at the bottom of this divergence?I am no expert in these matters but is it the case that we are caught on the horns of a dilemma, that is to say, if one imposes excessively onerous capital or liquidity requirements on the banks, it retards their willingness or ability to lend?  Is this connected in terms of examining our domestic problems at the moment?  The banks have been recapitalised but they are reluctant to lend or to write down mortgage arrears and debt and this is having a significant dampening effect on the economy.  They are reluctant to do this is because they believe that the key priority for banks is to maintain sufficiently high capital ratios.  The point is that if one places excessively onerous requirements on the banks, then one limits the willingness, inclination or ability of those banks to lend into the economy with significant resulting macroeconomic effects.  On the other hand, if one does not do this, then one is running the danger of banks running riot again and creating bubbles.  I am keen to hear the views of the witnesses on this point.To my mind, the witnesses have suggested that the proposed buffers are buffers against bubbles and bubble circumstances.  This is concerning because it implies that we accept that bubbles will occur and that we will not address the circumstances that lead to bubbles.  Instead, we will simply place certain requirements on banks to ensure they do not crash with resulting consequences for us.  Is it not the case that it is the behaviour of banks that lead to bubbles?  Is this not the lesson we must draw from what has happened?  Should we not address the behaviour of banks which lent excessively into particular profitable areas purely because they believed they could make money in such areas as property or whatever?  That is what led us into this mess but it seems there is nothing envisaged in terms of requiring banks to lend on a rational basis.My question relates to another question I have raised several times in the DÃ¡il and which is beginning to be debated somewhat but on which there appear to be no moves, that is, the mandate of banks and central banks.  In 2009 the European Central Bank issued guidelines on bank rescues.  It stated categorically that in so far as states had to intervene in the banking system to rescue banks, they must do so in a way that absolutely does not divert banks from the goal of profit maximisation towards other goals, whether social or macroeconomic.  This seems an extraordinary policy for the ECB to hold in a situation in which profit maximisation led to the mess and the bubble in the first place and, arguably, this imperative is the problem now in terms of banks' unwillingness to lend-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am simply trying to understand whether this is it and whether the witnesses are considering these other issues.  The only points the witnesses mentioned specifically on governance issues relate to people being on boards of directors and there is some mention of remuneration.  Will the delegation elaborate on what is at issue?  Is there anything related to bonuses?  Is there any proposal to ban the use of bonuses in banks - this is necessary in my view - given the remarkably damaging effect that the bonus culture has had in respect of reckless lending?  Has this been dealt with in any way or is it envisaged here or elsewhere?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I asked what, in Mr. Carrigan's opinion, was behind the divergence between the Franco-German axis and the IMF on the question of capital ratios.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Chairman not to pre-empt what I will say.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am not trying to stray form the issues at hand.  Rather, I am trying to understand what these proposals are about.  I asked questions; I did not make statements.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am trying to understand the measures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will decide what questions I ask.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Chairman is way out of order.  I am trying to understand what is being proposed here.  The bulk of it is to do with capital ratios and liquidity ratios, but there are also governance issues.  I am seeking to clarify why it is only these two elements which are set out in the directives.  Mr. Carrigan referred to other measures, which is presumably a reference to some of the other proposals we will discuss in the future, as set out in this document.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes.  Specifically in regard to banks, I am not familiar with what was discussed and agreed at Basel.  My question is whether what is contained in these proposals is the sum total of what is proposed in regard to the regulation of banks.  It seems somewhat random to confine the proposal to liquidity and capital ratios and governance issues.  I am aware there is an ongoing debate on all the other aspects of the crisis, why it happened and so on.  I am not suggesting those issues should be included in these measures, but I am trying to understand the parameters within which they apply.  There seems to be a random focus on governance issues, including some reference to bonuses, and capital ratios.  Does this reflect a view that these are the only areas in which there is a problem with the banks?
