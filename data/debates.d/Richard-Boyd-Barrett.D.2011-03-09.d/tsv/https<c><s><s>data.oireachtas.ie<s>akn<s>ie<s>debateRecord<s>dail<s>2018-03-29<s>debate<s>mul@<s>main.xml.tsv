RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The role of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission is critical. It needs to be completely independent of Government in order that it can, where necessary, and independent of any Government pressure, make critiques of any Government failure to uphold human rights or equality principles. The State has failed very badly in many of these areas. I ask the House to think of the plight of children in emergency accommodation and how their rights are not being upheld; of Travellers, whom the State has systematically failed and continues to fail in many areas of equality and human rights; of the failure to secure the rights of refugees living in direct provision centres and of the completely unacceptable hardships imposed particularly on children in direct provision; and of the failure of the Government to deliver on its promise to take in 4,000 programme refugees, Syrian refugees, a failure highlighted by one of the unsuccessful candidates for the commission positions we are deciding today. I refer to Betty Purcell who, as part of her work for IHREC, had produced a conference on this matter. The Government was publicly embarrassed in respect of this failure by Betty Purcell. I have no doubt about the credentials and the bona fides of those who have been nominated. I welcome the fact that they include representatives of the disability community, people who work in the area of housing and so on. I am sure all the people who have been selected will serve well and be important voices. There is, however, a real problem with this process. It is not independent. The criteria which were established for the selection of candidates, and effectively for the exclusion of a whole range of candidates who had impeccable human rights credentials, were passed through the Minister's office in an email which, I understand, was not on what is called the shared drive - in other words, the formal process of communications surrounding issues relating to the selection and nomination process - but went from the commissioner's office to the Department and then back to the Public Appointments Service. The email stressed that the commission would particularly benefit from additional skills in finance and corporate governance and stated the commission had sufficient expertise in the area of gender equality. The thing about this is that having a preference for people with finance and corporate governance skills, first of all, has nothing to do with human rights. It also disqualifies people who, for example, may not have played such roles but who have impeccable and important credentials in the area of the advocacy of human rights and equality principles, particularly if they are from small NGOs. What if one is part of a small NGO that does not have such experience? I understand only one member of the interview panel asked questions about human rights and equality issues and that the overwhelming emphasis in the interviews was on corporate and financial governance. These are not acceptable criteria, nor is the interference of the Government in deciding these criteria when we are talking about a body that absolutely needs to be independent. It is worth noting that the United Nations Paris Principles state that the institutions set up to protect and uphold human rights principles should be absolutely independent from government, whereas the legislation as it currently stands states, "The Minister shall agree with the Service the selection criteria and process to be implemented in respect of the filling of any vacancy." This is wrong. It should not be the Minister who decides the selection criteria. At best, it should be the all-party Oireachtas committee, where these selection criteria would be decided in an open, transparent and public way, rather than with the potential for interference by the Minister depending on his or her particular views on these matters. I will not oppose the motion because I am sure the people who have been nominated are very good. However, it is worrying that people such as Michael Farrell did not even get an interview and that people such as Carol Coulter, Ursula Barry, Betty Purcell and so on were effectively excluded on the basis of some of the criteria that were included-----

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The truly appalling rise in homelessness figures, especially child homelessness figures, should lead the members of this Government to hang their heads in shame at the hardship and suffering inflicted by the Government's failed policies on the 10,000 people now suffering homelessness, particularly for the children who suffer. The numbers of children in homelessness are increasing month on month. The disastrous figures published recently are the bitter fruits of six years of failed policies by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, and then by Fine Gael and the Independent Alliance. The figures are the direct consequence of the policies the Government has pursued and the inevitable consequence of the policies that have favoured the interests of private developers, private landlords, speculators and vulture funds over and above the needs of citizens for an affordable and secure roof over their heads. This is the simple fact of it. It is unbelievably surreal and insulting that the Minister's speech highlighted all the achievements, as he sees them, of the Government. One of the most incredible phrases in the Minister's speech is "all this hard work is paying dividends." It is Orwellian to say this in the week that record figures are announced for child and family homelessness. It is totally beyond belief. At what point will the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, recognise that the policies are failing disastrously? Their failure centres on the fact that the Minister is trying to get the private sector to do something it is completely incapable of doing. For six years we have called for an emergency programme of direct public, affordable housing provision on public land. We have also called for evictions to be frozen completely and for rent controls to be imposed that bring rents to affordable levels, not for rent certainty as some of the Opposition has called for: that is not enough. Rent certainty is no good when rents have reached unaffordable levels. What is the point in linking rents to the consumer price index when the average rent in Dublin is €1,800? It is pointless. Rent has to be brought back to affordable levels. This would involve local authorities going in to rental accommodation and saying the landlord cannot charge more than a certain amount. The rents that landlords are allowed to charge must be based on what is affordable for real human beings on the incomes they have. Anything less than these measures and the problem is going to get worse, and on the current trajectory it will get worse.These figures do not surprise me, as appalling as they are.  I am not surprised but I am appalled by the proposals for affordable housing. When the Minister first announced the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, funding, which was intended to deliver affordable housing, the promise was that every project where there was LIHAF funding would deliver 40% of that development at €300,000 or less. He immediately backtracked on that. Now we discover, for example, that of the 8,000 houses to be built at Cherrywood, which have been financed with €15 million of LIHAF funding, we will get 5%, not 40%. In the best-case scenario there, a three-bedroom house will cost €357,000, and more likely significantly in excess of that. That is useless. What is the point in telling us that all these houses will be built if they are completely unaffordable for the majority of people, to rent or to purchase? The time for talk is over, and the time to get on the streets is now. Government policy will be changed only when the people affected and angered by this crisis get out on the streets and that means joining the national demonstration called by the National Housing and Homelessness Coalition on 7 April at 2 p.m. at the Garden of Remembrance. If people are angry about this, they need to get out on the streets because the Government is not listening.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is an absolute disgrace that we discover on RTÉ and in newspapers over the weekend that a key part of Ireland's cultural and cinematic heritage has been sold.We hear that the State has sold its share in a deal in which none of the details have been scrutinised and we have no idea about guarantees to protect the future of Ardmore as a film studio. Incredibly, €7 million has been written off in debts. The company has been sold, according to reports at the weekend, in debt. It has been sold to Olcott Entertainment, a company that was only set up 29 days ago. That company is headed up by Mr. Joe Devine, who is also involved in Troy Studios. The current chief executive officer, CEO, is also linked to Troy Studios and will continue as CEO. I understand Mr. Ossie Kilkenny, who is also involved in Troy Studios, is also involved in all this. We get the producers and the film board telling us that we have a booming film industry and there is not enough studio space and yet film workers tell me that for the past three years, Ardmore has been completely under-utilised and as we speak, only one stage is being used out of five. Where is all the money - the €60 million or €70 million - that is given in section 481 funding to production companies going? It is not going into making films at Ardmore. It is going into places such as the asbestos-riddled John Player factory on the South Circular Road, where a film is being made and as we speak, film workers are being forced into a sit-in protest because of the conditions they are being forced to work in. Moreover, "Into the Badlands", which is supposed to be produced in Ardmore, is being produced in the Dublin Sports Hotel, which is a NAMA-owned building and where there are also protests going on as we speak. Why is that filming not being done in Ardmore? The same people who have run down Ardmore will now remain in control of it, and incredibly, the State has sold its stake. It is a disgraceful ready-up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is absolutely disgraceful that we have sold off the State's holding in Ardmore. We have fully privatised it to the benefit of a company which appeared like a mushroom. That is a feature of the film industry where the companies that receive all the State money appear like mushrooms and then disappear just as quickly. The culture committee has heard testimony from representatives of the workers in the film industry that they have no proper training or accreditation structure for trainees, no pensions and no continuity of employment, yet millions of euro are going into the film industry. Incredibly, in Ardmore itself - which will be run by the same CEO who is linked to Troy Studios to run it down - there are four stages sitting empty while public money is being used to finance the production of films in NAMA buildings that are completely unsuitable. In the case of the John Player building, it is riddled with asbestos, the toilets are absolutely revolting and the place is freezing. Why is there not more public oversight of that, rather than the Minister relinquishing the little bit of influence the State had over the industry in terms of Ardmore?There should be more oversight, but instead the Minister has sold it without questions being asked about what is going on and whether Ardmore was being run down to the benefit of Troy in a situation which involved some of the land being put up for possible residential development. It is really not acceptable.
