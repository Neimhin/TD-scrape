RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think and, I hope, that when the names of taoisigh, tánaistí and Deputies who were in office over the past year have been long forgotten, the memory, inspiration and the legend of what the Debenhams workers have done over the past 15 months will still echo through the annals of working-class history. I have no doubt people will be singing songs, reciting poems and writing plays about what these workers have done, as was done in respect of the Dunnes Stores anti-apartheid strikers, because they were fighting in the most inspirational and determined way for something that is right and good, but not just for themselves although that is how it began. These people have been fighting against the shocking treatment they suffered at the hands of a company for which they had worked loyally for decades. What is truly inspiring about the Debenhams workers is that they continue that fight even though they now know that the Government is not going to do the right thing by them and ensure that they get their two weeks statutory plus two weeks, the redundancy entitlements agreed and which they should have got. Despite that, they carry on because they know it is important to fight for others, to make sure that what they went through is not inflicted on other workers. That is what heroes do. That is inspiration and that is what will be remembered long after the cowardice and inaction of the Government have been forgotten. There is no doubt but that the Government, in claiming there is nothing it can do for the Debenhams workers, is hiding its true priorities, which, always, are to ensure and protect the interests of big business ahead of the interests of working people. No matter what the Government says to the contrary, this is clearly the case. As stated by Deputy Barry, it is not as if this is the first time this issue has come in front of Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael. I refer to La Senza, Vita Cortex, Clerys and Arcadia, in respect of which, as in the case of Debenhams, there was no action. We had promises, expressions of concern and commitments to do things in the future, but nothing done. If one reads between the lines of many of the comments that were made in the pathetic excuses for the inaction of the Government, there is always the little whisper of "We do not want to do anything that would deter the investors." That is the truth of the matter. It is the reason for the Government's inaction. As with the housing crisis that we are currently facing and the cuckoo funds, lurking behind the pathetic excuses and inaction is the unwillingness to take on big business interests, to challenge them and say that justice for working people and fairness for working people should come before the hunger for profit of big business.  In the case of Debenhams and all the other examples I mentioned, we are talking about cynical, ruthless big business that is willing to just toss workers on the scrapheap regardless of the human consequences in order to guarantee its profits and interests. However, the Government is unwilling to do anything about it. That is shameful because who was it who generated the value in Debenhams, the reputation and the value of its brand? Who generated the wealth of that company? It was the workers, but they are at the bottom of the queue when it comes to actually benefiting from the liquidation of the assets. The Government is unwilling to change that. Even now, when it has said it will do something about the matter, it puts down a countermotion to defer the Second Reading for a year. Why? It is because it wants to make sure that we do not upset big business instead of just saying that Debenhams has finally shown us that we must put the workers first. It seems this thought is unthinkable for Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael. They have never done it before and have no intention of doing it now. The Minister can rest assured that while this particular phase of the Debenhams dispute may be coming to an end, these workers will not give up. It was truly inspiring to see Karen Guerin from the Dunnes Stores anti-apartheid strike standing with the Debenhams workers outside the Dáil a week or two ago. These are the sort of heroes who actually bring about change. It was a point James Connolly many years ago when he pointed out that it is the working people who have always brought the changes. It has never been the people at the top who did so. It was always working people who fought for progressive real change to benefit the majority. The Debenhams workers will undoubtedly stand in the great pantheon of workers who have fought for real change on behalf of the majority of working people in this country. If this Bill is eventually passed or any reform is achieved, and I have no doubt it will be, it will be because of the determination, heroism and grit of those Debenhams workers. It has been truly an inspiration to stand with these workers on the picket lines. They are some of the most remarkable people I have ever met. What they have done goes so far above and beyond the call of duty. They have shown utter selflessness, particularly in the past few months when it became so clear that this Government was not willing to do anything, and bravery in the face of the outrageous behaviour we saw in Henry Street and in Waterford in the past week or so when gardaí, some of whom were in paramilitary garb, were sent in to drag mostly women - mothers and grandmothers - off picket lines in order to facilitate strike breakers. That really says it all. The guardians of the peace are sent in by someone. I do not know who it is. Is it the Government or the Garda Commissioner? They are certainly sent in to do stuff they should not be doing. That involved facilitating the use of force against these workers who are fighting a just cause - a cause that even the Government has had to admit is just - to facilitate strike breakers taking away the stock that was workers' bargaining chip in their fight for justice. It was truly shameful but the shameful nature of that action and the Government's inaction when it came to intervening on behalf of these workers and, indeed, changing the law to ensure it never happens again to another group of workers is not lost on the vast majority of working people. I have no doubt that the Debenhams workers will prevail in the end but it will certainly not have been with any help from this Government, which has sat idly by while they have stood on picket lines in hail, rain and snow throughout this pandemic, fighting for justice and the right cause on behalf of every worker in this country. We know there will be more like them. There will likely be a retail massacre, with more workers facing the injustice the Debenhams workers have faced. At that point, the inaction and excuses of this Government will stand truly exposed. In the end, the Debenhams workers will prevail.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When it comes to the housing crisis, I am afraid the Taoiseach is living in a parallel universe. Every single day, evidence of the disastrous consequences of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil policies piles up. In the past few weeks, there has been evidence about cuckoo funds pricing ordinary working people out of being able to buy homes. Yesterday, evidence emerged of rents rising across the country by 7% and starting to rise again in Dublin. Today, there is report about house prices rising 3.7% last year and increasing by an incredible 90% since 2012. Walk outside the gates of Leinster House and there are tents with homeless people absolutely littering the streets. In my area, residents of St. Helen's Court are victims of a vulture fund that is now trying to evict them even though they have done nothing wrong. All the Government suggests is that maybe we will impose a little stamp duty on purchases by these profit-hungry entities or slightly limit the percentage of these cuckoo funds that are wrecking the market and pricing ordinary working people out of it in the context of rents and house prices. If we were dealing with the Bill put forward by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, these entities would still be able to buy 70% of estates. The truth is what the Government needs to do is exclude the cuckoo and vulture funds that former Deputy Michael Noonan and Deputy Howlin invited into the country in 2012, 2013 and 2014. They need to be excluded from the market altogether, as is the case in New Zealand. We need rent controls, not pressure zones or 4% increases every year, in order to make rents affordable. We need punitive taxes on any land or property hoarding or hoarding of vacant properties by speculators and investment funds. It is absolutely critical that we use the public land bank at scale to build public and genuinely affordable housing. The proof the Government is not doing that is the Land Development Agency, LDA, Bill going through the Dáil. What that Bill will do is open up the public land bank to the same investment vehicles that have wrecked the private housing sector and priced a whole generation of young people and working people out of the housing market or made them prey to the extortionate rents charged by these vulture funds. That is what the Government is doing. The proof that the Government's commitments to change the policy are nonsense is the fact that the LDA Bill is a plan for a heist by the very investment vehicles that have profiteered at the expense of all the people who are in the grip of the housing crisis we face.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For 15 years I have been campaigning to get public and affordable housing on the Shanganagh prison site, so the Taoiseach should not say that we do not want affordable housing. Fianna Fáil- and Fine Gael-controlled councils in our area have not seen one sod turned and now the Government wants to hand it over to the LDA. People need to read the Bill. The only mention of social housing in the Bill is in reference to concluding arrangements with commercial investment vehicles. All of that land is to be set up as designated activity companies. In other words, the privatisation of the entire public land bank. That is the agenda. The Taoiseach should not forgot that it was Fianna Fáil who set up NAMA, then Fine Gael and Labour flogged off €40 billion worth of assets to these vulture and cuckoo funds that have wrecked the housing market and priced ordinary people out of it. It was Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and Labour in government who effectively stopped the social housing programme. The Taoiseach says that the Government is building social housing. In four Dublin council areas last year, the first year of his Government, 239 local authority houses were built. That is all. There were 1,300 built in the entire country and that is when we have 70,000 to 80,000 families, hundreds of thousands of people, on the housing waiting lists. Then the Government refers to affordable housing as being homes costing €400,000 or €450,000. What planet is the Taoiseach living on?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not want the Government to sell off the public land bank.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree that we clearly have to find a cost-effective and more efficient way to deal with these important matters of public interest. While we absolutely have to do that, it should not deter us from facilitating necessary investigations into injustices or serious matters of public concern. In the context of the current housing crisis and the debates about that situation, we need to look at the experience of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, more generally and learn some lessons from it. In the case of George Nkencho, his family deserve an investigation into the circumstances of his shooting. The family of Terence Wheelock, who died in Garda custody in 2005, have been fighting for justice as regards how he died.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am simply saying that there are many issues that require proper investigation. The model we need to look at is one of independent public inquiries, rather than these commissions of investigation, which end up as a festival of moneymaking for legal people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The National Economic and Social Council has regularly referred to the issue of water quality and the need to address the very poor levels of water quality as a result of the discharge in multiple locations across this country of untreated sewage. In my area of Dún Laoghaire alone, untreated sewage goes into Dublin Bay at 11 points. I see the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, issuing figures suggesting things have slightly improved, but a large caveat must accompany those figures because testing only takes place during what is called the bathing season. My colleague, Councillor Melissa Halpin, moved a motion in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council seeking year-round testing. She was basically told the council did not have the resources to do that. Ringsend treatment plant has an ultraviolet treatment machine that can reduce the bacterial load of sewage going into Dublin Bay, but it is only used for a few months of the year. I presume that is for cost reasons. The decrepit state of the water infrastructure means that when it rains we get big discharges of sewage into the sea, because the surface water mixes with sewage and then overflows. That happens because we have not rehabilitated the water infrastructure. This is a pretty poor show from the perspective of all the people swimming, more now than ever before, but equally in respect of the damage being done to biodiversity in Dublin Bay and other places in the country where we have similar situations, such as in Clifden and Galway, for example. At the very moment all this is happening, workers in the local authorities are being transferred to Irish Water. They do not want to go, and their conditions of employment are threatened and undermined. That is occurring because Irish Water is failing in its duty to rehabilitate the infrastructure and to give us the water treatment required to prevent the pollution of our seawaters and rivers with sewage.Therefore, it seems to me that the Government needs to start to listen to the NESC on this and recognise the urgent issue of addressing the decrepit nature of our foul water infrastructure and water quality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach might look into the ultraviolet plant as well.
