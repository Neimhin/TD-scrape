RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When the Minister introduced the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, which is a subsidy to private developers to open certain sites, the initial circular indicated that we would get 40% of any LIHAF supported development in affordable housing and that affordable would mean, in Dublin, a price of no more than €300,000. Within a month of that announcement the Minister, I suspect under pressure from developers, abandoned that, so we now do not know what "affordable" will mean in a number of sites and what percentage we will get, although the signs are that in many places it will be utterly negligible. What is the Minister going to do about that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister always talks about social mix. In fact, his housing policy is one of social cleansing. In huge areas of Dublin his failure to secure adequate social and affordable housing on the developments taking place mean that people on low and middle incomes are being cleansed from, or driven out of, those areas due to the unaffordable housing. Cherrywood is a LIHAF supported development. Last October, Hines Real Estate Ireland Limited, the developer to which the Government sold that site for a song, offered the social housing element at the following prices: €243,000 for a one-bedroom unit, €358,000 for a two-bedroom unit and €442,000 for a three-bedroom unit. It is completely unaffordable. That was the discount price for the Part V element. There is no commitment to any level of affordability on the Cherrywood site and no idea of what the percentage of affordable housing will be. This is despite the fact that the Government provided €15 million in LIHAF funding. The Minister has allowed these guys to get away with murder and the effect is that people in the area on low and middle incomes, up to €40,000 or €50,000 per year, will not be able to buy houses on that site, even though it was a public site and it is subsidised with LIHAF funding. What is the Minister talking about?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Two people - a couple - earning €40,000 each can only borrow €312,000. I have just told the Minister about a LIHAF supported development in which two-bedroom units are being sold back at a discounted rate of €358,000, up to €442,000. They are not affordable for the average person who will be cleansed from the area. The local council only has plans to provide just over 1,000 social houses. People on those earnings cannot get onto the housing list because the Minister will not raise the eligibility thresholds. Middle income workers in swathes of Dublin, including the Minister's constituency and mine, Dublin South and Dublin Bay North, will be cleansed from these areas. There will be no social mix and it is social cleansing because nothing is being offered to middle income workers at levels they can afford because the Minister has let developers off the hook.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Which is true.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	From the bank of mum and dad.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To carry on with the discussion we had earlier, the Minister is not acknowledging the facts. Cherrywood is a strategic development zone. The Luas was extended to Cherrywood to develop the city. I am telling the Minister that we have no percentage in terms of affordable housing units in these schemes and have no figure on what constitutes affordable housing. The offer made by Hines, the company the Minister flogged the site to, is way in excess of anything that any of the announced schemes will assist people in purchasing. We are not getting any affordable housing that is actually affordable on one of the biggest development sites in the State on a site that is funded by the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, and which we flogged for a song via NAMA. What is the Minister talking about?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has not answered the question. We were told earlier that the 40% target for affordable housing on sites by the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF, was abandoned because it would affect commercial viability, that is, the profits of the developers. Affordability was abandoned. Neither the Minister nor Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council can tell me what percentage of affordable housing we will get back from LIHAF on, I repeat, one of the biggest development sites in the State, nor can the Minister tell us what the price of so-called affordable housing will be. Let me remind him and correct him on what he said earlier. Two people earning €75,000 between them can, including a deposit, borrow €288,000.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Two people on €40,000 would not qualify for the Minister's scheme. That is €80,000. It is over the threshold so they would not qualify. Two people just inside the threshold can borrow €288,000. Average house prices in Dublin are €350,000. I have just quoted what Hines is offering, which is two bedroom homes at €358,000 and three bedroom homes at €442,000, so this scheme will not allow those people to buy houses that we are supporting with State subsidies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is my third go at this. The Minister has an impressive ability to reel off statistics indicating the effectiveness of his programmes but to resolutely refuse to address the problems I am raising about particular sites and about affordability generally. I will repeat this for the third time. In whole swathes of Dublin and other areas, the Minister's affordable schemes will not work because he has not ensured that private developers set an affordable price that is actually affordable, or committed them to any percentage, having abandoned a 40% percentage. I would like the Minister to tell me what is the percentage on Cherrywood or any other site where the prices are currently way in excess of prices on any of the Minister's schemes. In addition, for the affordable schemes on public land, will the Minister guarantee they will stay affordable into the future or will "affordable" become a stalking horse for privatisation of public land? The only way that will not happen is if the Minister ensures that affordable houses on public land have to be sold back to the local authority and cannot be sold onto the market in the future. Will the Minister make that commitment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For a few months, maybe a year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about affordable housing?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am talking about Dublin.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Viktor Orbán is part of a dangerous political cancer that is growing in Europe, which is characterised by extreme racism, authoritarianism and anti-democratic tendencies, which in some cases is directly linked to fascist organisations.While it is reasonable to say we should talk to people even if we disagree with them which I know is the Taoiseach's standard line on these matters, there is a problem and a line in terms of what is acceptable. To take the obvious example, appeasement did not work with the fascist movement in the 1930s because it was not interested in democracy. It was interested in promoting a filthy, racist, anti-democratic, authoritarian version of politics. This week Viktor Orbán is meeting the Freedom Party of Austria which was set up by former Nazis. They are clubbing together as an extreme right-wing group which is promoting racism, flouting the UN Convention on Human Rights when it comes to the treatment of immigrants, suppressing press freedom and compromising the independence of the judiciary. At some point the Taoiseach has to recognise that when democracy, whatever stripe one supports, is under threat from people such as Viktor Orbán, we have to take a clear stand against those politics and begin to work out a strategy to defeat rather than conciliate it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am deeply critical of it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No; it was not.
