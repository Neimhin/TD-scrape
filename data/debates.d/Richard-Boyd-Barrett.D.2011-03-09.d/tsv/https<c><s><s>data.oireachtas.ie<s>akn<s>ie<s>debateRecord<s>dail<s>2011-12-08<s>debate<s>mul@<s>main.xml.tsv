RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not agreed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also object strongly to the proposal.  We have spent days, sometimes two weeks, debating Bills that had less significance than the Social Welfare Bill, which contains measures that will seriously hurt some of the most vulnerable sectors in society.  It is outrageous in that context that the Bill should be rammed through in such a short period.The Tánaiste has rightly backed off on the scandalous move to take away disability allowances from young people——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just a moment, a Cheann Comhairle.  It is about the reason——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is about the reason for the arrangements.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is about the arrangements, a Cheann Comhairle.  The Tánaiste did that because he considered the wider implications of the attack.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Could I also ask the Tánaiste to consider the request——
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	——to extend the time for debating the Bill on the grounds that the drastic reduction in the income disregard for lone parents, which is a direct disincentive to work for young women, makes a mockery of his commitment to jobs in the programme for national government?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Tánaiste should reconsider that and allow us proper time to debate the issue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, we are not arguing for that.  That is rubbish.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is important that we have this discussion.  Despite the fact that I disagree with much of what was said on the other side of the House, I welcome the seriousness with which some of the contributors on the Government side have engaged with the debate, which we badly need to have.  Some of the comments were glib and off the point, although that was not true of any Deputies in the Chamber at present.  There were several references to green jerseys.  That is glib.  This is not a football match.  There were also suggestions that Deputies on this side of the House are anti-European.  This is particularly misplaced with regard to the Deputies of the United Left Alliance, who have tabled an amendment to the motion.  I hope Deputy White has read our amendment because it puts forward positive proposals.  The starting point of the United Left Alliance is thoroughly and completely internationalist.  Our critique of what is going on in the European Union and of the eurozone crisis stems from a completely internationalist perspective.  This is why we have put ourselves on the side of the people of Greece, Portugal, Spain and, for that matter, Egypt, who are resisting what is going on in the global economy.It is important that we understand what is at stake in the current crisis.  We are facing the most severe crisis since the 1930s.  People should ponder what that means.  The depression of the 1930s led to the Second World War.  It does not overstate the seriousness of the situation to say we could be propelled to such a crisis if we get this wrong.  In that regard, EU leaders, including the Taoiseach, do not seem to get what is going on.  They are debating the degree to which we should dismantle democracy within the European Union to ram through a certain economic agenda — of bank bailouts, austerity and market measures.  Every statement they make is about the need to assuage the markets.  The issues at stake in the European debate are not the ones on which the media are focused, nor are they the ones that will be debated at the European Council meeting.  It is not what they disagree on, that the Government disagrees with them or that they disagree among themselves that is the problem, but what they agree on.  They all agree that we must continue to bail out banks, impose austerity — let us call it fiscal responsibility — and assuage the markets.  However, this fails to understand the fundamentals of how we got into the crisis in the first place.  If we do not understand how we got into it, we have no chance of resolving the issue.  It was the markets that led us to the crisis.  They were unregulated, frenzied and profit-hungry.  It was their trillions sloshing around in the international markets, looking to make the quickest buck, wherever possible, whether through speculation in property, derivatives or bonds, that brought us to the crisis and they are still doing it.Nevertheless, the policy being proposed by all sides of the European leadership, including the Government, is that we must continue to assuage the markets, that the issue will be resolved when the markets are happy.  However, even the markets do not believe this is possible, which is why they are downgrading European debt, even Germany's.  The European economy is being smothered in the bankers' debts and cannot recover with them.  Even the markets which caused the mess know this.  They also know something else — that austerity is crippling growth in the European economy.  The need to bail out the banks and the resulting austerity measures demanded of economies are crippling growth and making a bad situation worse.  None of them will debate this issue.  It is not being debated in the media and is not and will not be debated at the European Council meeting.  In fairness to Deputy Peter Mathews, in referring to derivatives and the craziness of the European and global financial system, he is pointing in the right direction in terms of the madness of the markets in the way they are operating.It is in this way that what is happening elsewhere in Europe intersects with the austerity being imposed here.  These are not separate issues, they are connected.  Many of the budget measures being imposed are directed at young women, single women living in poverty and their children, who want to educate themselves.  They are trying to get on community employment and FETAC schemes to educate themselves in order that their children will be able to contribute to society and they can help economic recovery.  These measures will drive them back further into poverty.  This is but one example.  If the Government keeps doing this to the people who produce the wealth in the economy and continues to deny them an education and does not invest in them in order that they can work, the European economy will not recover.The Government's hopes that the ECB will solve the problem are mistaken also.  It is a false debate.  If they print money — the solution being pursued by Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy — there will be inflation.  That is what happened in the 1930s.  If they just print money and there is no real economic activity, there will be inflation.  Both sides of the argument are wrong.  The only alternative is investment and the only way investment can happen is if the trillions now in the hands of the financial markets are taken from them and invested in rational economic activity, in infrastructure, strategic enterprise, industry and putting people back to work.  If we do not do this, there is no chance of recovery.To do this, we must consider redistributing wealth.  If the Government does not put the redistribution of wealth on the agenda, we will not be able to control what the markets are doing.  They are running amok.  If they are not happy with what comes from the summit — they will not be — they will start speculating again.  We must remove the power from them  This can only be done by redistributing wealth, which means measures such as wealth taxes, progressive income taxation and so on.  It also means democracy, with ordinary people deciding how resources should be invested.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government would want to wear some trousers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But the Minister has cut them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This will make it worse.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That will drive single mums out of work.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If we do not, we are banjaxed.  Did the Minister see the growth projections?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was the pressure exerted outside the tent that brought about the change.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister hit out at people with disabilities, the fuel allowance, rent supplement, footwear, clothing and back to education allowances, child benefit, hearing aid grants and lone parent support.  It is absolutely clear that when talking about protecting the vulnerable, the Minister has done the exact opposite.  She has hit every definition of vulnerable group, the disabled, the elderly, children, women and the poor.  This is from the Labour Party.  It is simply outrageous.  At this point, it is time for the Labour Party to take off its political paraphernalia and any reference to James Connolly or James Larkin.  James Connolly died for this country in a fight against control by empires.  James Larkin died in poverty although he could have become a Minister and joined the club of the Free State.  Instead, he died in poverty because he would not sell out.  That is the mantle the Labour Party has historically claimed.  They have decisively betrayed the mantle in attacking the very people that James Connolly and James Larkin dedicated their lives to protecting.When faced with this criticism, the Government continues to repeat the mantra that we do not offer an alternative.  We have comprehensively offered an alternative.  The Government will not answer the question of why it will not put a wealth tax on the €220 billion held by the top 5% of the population.  Why will the Government not do that?  We say it will derive €10 billion but maybe we are wrong and it will only raise €5 billion.  That would cover all of these cuts and even if it raised only €1 billion it would do away with all of the attacks on the elderly, the disabled, the young, lone parents and the poor in the Social Welfare Bill.I refer to one commitment of this Government, which keeps saying it is in favour of labour activation measures.  It has tried to justify some of these attacks as labour activation measures.  The transitional payments being cut, the concurrent payments and the income disregards are all aimed at lone parents and are a direct attack on lone parents trying to get back into work or who are working.  They are a direct disincentive for lone parents to be in the workforce and they will drive lone parents out of work, out of community employment schemes and back onto dependency on social welfare.  Most lone parents work and want to work but cannot survive without the support that the Government is cutting.  It makes a mockery of the claim that these are labour activation measures.  I ask the Minister to reverse these cuts.The one lesson we have learned in the past number of days is that people power can change Government attacks.  The only reason the Government reversed the disability allowance measure is the fear of public outrage against an attack on the disabled.  Lone parents, people on community employment schemes and other vulnerable groups who have been attacked should learn the lesson that protest and expressing outrage can get results.  They should get on the streets and force the Government to reverse these cuts.  If the Labour Party wants to save itself the trouble of that kind of public outrage, it can reverse these cuts tomorrow.
