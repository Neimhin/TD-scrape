RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In some ways, I share the Minister's concern about the seriousness of the situation we are facing. I do not want to overdramatise it, but I cannot understand why the Minister and the Government are stabbing the Greek people in the back. In the process we are stabbing in the back all of the victims of failed austerity policies, including in this country, by refusing their initial proposal, which is very clear, that there be a debt conference along the lines of the post-war debt conference, from which Germany benefited, with a 50% write-down of debt and an extension of the rest of the debt for such a period that it effectively wrote it off. This allowed for the reconstruction of Germany and, essentially, the rebuilding of Europe. It was a very good proposal and I do not understand why the Minister did not support it. Does the Minister accept that the election result in Greece stems from the fact that the policies pursued by the troika have been a disastrous failure in Greece? Is it not absolutely obvious that the policies have been a disastrous failure? We have seen the verdict of the Greek people against the background of a humanitarian crisis caused directly by austerity. It did not produce the growth the troika stated it would, led to a collapse of the economy and produced a humanitarian crisis, which is appalling. It turfed thousands of workers out of their jobs and slashed incomes, leaving 40% of young people in poverty and 26% unemployed. The Greek people have rightly said this policy is not working and that we need a radically different approach, saying the debt is unsustainable and needs to be written down and that we need an end to austerity policies. Does the Minister agree that they are right to say austerity has not worked? We should support them in saying, after six years, that it is clear it has not worked, that we need a different approach and that the proposal was a fair and reasonable one in order to start looking in different directions?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister seriously suggesting the reason for the humanitarian crisis we are witnessing in Greece is it did not impose vigourously enough the troika programme?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not a fact that even the IMF has acknowledged that the adverse and disastrous impact of the programmes was far worse than that predicted? They had a devastating effect. The initial prediction was that imposing this level of austerity on Greece would lead to a return to growth much quicker and that the adverse effects would not be as severe as they turned out to be. The troika was wrong - it has had a devastating effect in Greece.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----just like if the rich had paid their taxes in Ireland-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Angela Merkel is saying there will be no deal without conditionality, while the Greek Government has stated it cannot continue the programme and that it has no mandate to continue it because of the election result. It is stating it cannot do it anymore because the public will not stand for it, while Angela Merkel is saying there will be no deal unless Greece continues the programme with conditionality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister himself said it, saying there would be no bridging finance deal without conditionality.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I share the Minister's concern, as I noted earlier. We are at a very serious point. The Greek Finance Minister rightly stated that we could be facing a house of cards if Greece is forced out because the ECB, Angela Merkel and other Governments are insisting on this hard-line refusal of a write down and making any deal conditional on keeping with a programme that the Greek people simply can no longer take. I ask the Minister why we appear to be siding with Angela Merkel and the ECB rather than acknowledging that the Greeks have a point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On the one hand, the Minister is saying "no write-downs", which is what the Greeks want, but on the other, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine said that if the Greeks did get a write-down we would want one too. We are not going to help them to get a write-down but we want to benefit from any write-down they achieve. Is that not a shameful position to take?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If Greece proposes a debt conference and a deal similar to that agreed for Germany at the end of the Second World War, will the Minister say "No way"?
