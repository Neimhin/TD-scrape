RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	May I remind the Taoiseach that at the time he was signing off on secret payouts to people who had been forced to pay nursing home fees that they should not have had to pay, in order to contain potential cases being taken by other people who were entitled to refunds, ordinary people in this country were being absolutely crucified by the Government of which he was a part to pay off bondholders? The Taoiseach says he does not remember who briefed him or what the briefing was. I put it to the Taoiseach that owes it to the people of this country to find out what he knew, and when he knew it, when he was signing off. The same information is also required in respect of other Ministers. Statements are required from the Taoiseach and anyone else who was involved in signing off these payments, which were made on a condition of secrecy so that people entitled to other repayments would not be aware of them. Will the Taoiseach and the other Ministers involved in this commit to come in and clarify what they knew and when they knew it?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The programme for Government commits to a better quality of life and to addressing the cost-of-living crisis. One aspect of quality of life is access to sports events. It may be of interest to the Taoiseach to know that the biggest Republic of Ireland soccer supporters network is a group called the Ballybrack Seagulls, which has had an arrangement with the Football Association of Ireland, FAI, for the last ten years under which it buys season tickets and gets discounted tickets for young people. They are the fans we always see, even when there is not a full attendance and it may not be such a popular game. A big game with France is coming up and, interestingly, the FAI has pulled out of the arrangement it had with the Ballybrack Seagulls for ten years. Under the annual agreed arrangement, it cost €235 for a season ticket and €55 for a young person, which was discounted. The FAI has come back to the Ballybrack Seagulls and said a season ticket would cost €400 and there would be no discounts for young people. I ask the Taoiseach to ask the Minister of State with responsibility for sport to intervene with the FAI because this is letting the fans and young people down.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was involved in organising, along with the Save Our Forests Save Our Lands campaign, a protest last week around the debate on Coillte's outrageous deal with Gresham House to buy up large amounts of land and forestry. The demands of that protest were strongly echoed by the Citizens' Assembly on Biodiversity Loss when it expressed grave concern about the Gresham House deal. It has been said, rightly, that the Forestry Act and the mandate of Coillte need to be radically changed so that Coillte stops acting as a commercial outfit doing forestry in a way that is damaging biodiversity and instead starts to operate for the common and environmental good. The truth is that the Irish forestry model is destroying biodiversity. That is the actuality of the situation. That will be exacerbated by the Gresham House deal or any other such similar deals. I ask the Taoiseach to reconsider the Government's position that it cannot back out of the deal with Gresham House. The Government must back out of this deal because it will contribute to further destruction of biodiversity and move us further down the wrong road when we need to listen to what the Citizens' Assembly is saying about forestry in this country.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If one were to believe the ads the Government ran about the cost of living that stated people were entitled to various supports from the Government, one would think there was a lot of support for people who need exceptional needs payments and are struggling with the cost-of-living crisis. My clinic was absolutely overrun in the days coming up to Christmas with people in desperate situations and it has become worse in the new year. People are seriously struggling. People need money for food and to pay heating bills and pre-pay power. People are paying up to €10 a day for gas and so on. They simply cannot afford it. People are crying in my clinic. One of the things that is an obstacle to people getting support is that there is no longer a community welfare officer whom a person can go to see. When I asked a parliamentary question about this, I was told that there is a hotline and that people can make appointments. It is simply not true. A community welfare officer cannot be seen for love nor money at the moment and desperate people are finding it impossible to access supports they badly need.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Because of the State's failure and neglect, many children are literally having their childhood stolen from them. If the new subcommittee is to be of any use, it must do tangible things about that. I will provide two examples. On Friday of next week, a working family with two teenage children, one of whom has special needs, will be evicted from their home despite the eviction ban mentioned by the Taoiseach. The family has done nothing wrong. They have paid their rent and their taxes all their lives and they are going to be evicted from the home in which they have lived all their lives. When I go to the council or to the Minister, I am told there is no scheme for them. There is no scheme in which this family fits so they think they will be living in a car in about a week. Another case I have raised with the Taoiseach and others for four years involves a mother, who ironically works with Tusla and vulnerable children, whose child has lived with her in emergency accommodation for four years. His mental health is on the floor. His mother does not tick any of the boxes. She is slightly over the threshold for this, there is no scheme for that and so on. These children are suffering. One group of children will be suffering more in a week and there is no scheme to help them. Will this unit intervene in cases such as that and tell the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage or another Department that children are not suffering any more; they are not going to be forced to live in a car or if they have been in emergency accommodation for four years to get the children out of emergency accommodation because their childhood is being stolen from them?
