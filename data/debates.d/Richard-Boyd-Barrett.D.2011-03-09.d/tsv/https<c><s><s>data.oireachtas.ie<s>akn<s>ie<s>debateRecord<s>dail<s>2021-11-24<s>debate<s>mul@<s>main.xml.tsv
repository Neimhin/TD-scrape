RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How many minutes do we have?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We will take four each.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We thought we had more. I thank the Social Democrats for bringing forward this Bill on this incredibly important subject. I also commend the former Deputy, Ruth Coppinger, who brought forward a Bill with similar objectives in 2018, the Provision of Objective Sex Education Bill 2018, which tackled the issue in a slightly different way but had the same objectives.That Bill was passed by the Dáil and it required changes in the principal Act essentially to remove the right of the ethos that is protected in that Act from extending to anything to do with sexuality and that those things should be completely taught on the basis of evidence-based objective education. This Bill is trying to do exactly the same thing in a slightly different way and is very much to be commended.  It is worth contemplating the fact that this Bill was passed and was then buried with a money message by the Fine Gael-Fianna Fáil-Independent minority Government. That Government did not feel that it could oppose it but it buried the Bill with the cynical use of the money message. It is somewhat appropriate that this debate is happening in the same week that we are also debating the mother and baby homes. There is a direct connection between the religious ethos of the institutions which degraded and abused women, the persistence of gender-based violence, the mistreatment of women today and the mental health of our young people, which is often under a great deal of pressure, to put it mildly.  What did the religious ethos do? It essentially made sins of what are basic human needs. Basic human requirements were deemed to be sinful and wrong and to be a reason for shame. Once basic things, such as just being a woman, having a different sexuality or expressing one’s sexuality in any shape or form are deemed sinful, then those who are women or who express their sexuality or who have different types of sexuality become dehumanised and degraded. It becomes okay then to abuse and treat them in a lesser way. When that is legitimised, then the mental health of young people today is put under intense pressure because they are told that there is something wrong with things that are actually just basic human needs and expressions and so on. When we are talking about this, it
is not some sort of ideological debate but is one about the welfare and well-being of our children. To have anything less than scientific, evidence-based education is obscene and is a danger to our children. It perpetuates some of the worst abuses and continued mistreatment and abuse of women, of people with different sexuality, gender identity, and so on. It has to stop and we should not even be debating this but should be talking about the separation of church and State, full stop. There is certainly no excuse, however, for the Government not to accept this Bill and to pass it into law immediately.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have lost count of how many times I have raised the issue of reviewing the income thresholds for eligibility for social housing over the last four or five years. Whether it is the last Government or this Government, the stock response is that “it is under review” or “the review will be completed shortly”, and we have been told that for four or five years now. Of course, the result, let us be clear, is that thousands of people every year who go over the income threshold, who do not have the income to pay for the massively inflated rents and house prices, are thrown off the list and cannot afford to get anything through their own resources. The failure of successive Governments, including the Taoiseach's, to address this has reached absolutely unbelievable, incredible proportions. This is an email I got this Monday:Hi Richard,I just received this email from [a local authority - we can guess which one] requesting that I move out of homeless accommodation that I am in. There is weeks to Christmas and that is what I have just received. I'm so upset and stressed by this now. How can they make me homeless from homeless accommodation? That is the second case I have been dealing with. I brought one other to the attention of the Minister and he is looking into it, in fairness, but this is an unbelievable situation. The woman in question is the mother of a young child. She is a care worker, working, actually, in a State agency where they desperately need people to work because they are chronically understaffed but, because she did additional work for this chronically understaffed State agency working with vulnerable children, she is now off the housing list. The letter from the local authority is brilliant:Dear [I will not mention her name]I am contacting you in relation to your temporary agency homeless placement at [I will delete the reference]. Homeless services have been made aware by housing allocations that you do not qualify for social housing support as your application has been deemed over the income limit. You must make arrangements to move on from emergency accommodation with your own resources. This is just beyond belief. People are now not just homeless; they are punished for working and trying to improve their situation and get themselves out of that situation, but where they still clearly do not have their own resources to pay the rents - which in my area are an average of €24,000 to €26,000 a year of after-tax income - they are out of homeless accommodation in the teeth of Christmas. This is happening around the country. It is partially worsened by a change in the calculation method by the statutory instrument in March of this year, which based it on average income of the previous year, but also because of the failure to lift the income threshold. What is the Taoiseach going to do about this?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	First, will the Taoiseach give me a commitment that homeless families will not be evicted from homeless accommodation because they get a job and try to earn a bit of extra income? Will he give me that commitment now and issue that instruction to local authorities? Second, can I just point out that if they had been housed as they should be, or even got a HAP tenancy, they would not be evicted and their rent would rise with their income. People do not get evicted from a council house because of their income, but if they are homeless, they get removed from the list and evicted from the homeless accommodation because they have increased their income. It is beyond belief. Urgent action needs to be taken. Why has the review not been completed? The Taoiseach knows and I know, and it is hidden in what he said. The Department is terrified that if it raises the thresholds, more people will be eligible for social housing and then the numbers on the list will rise, which will not look terribly good for the Department. That is not acceptable. Once upon a time, ordinary working people of moderate and medium incomes, or even slightly higher incomes, were able to go into social housing, and there was nothing wrong with it. This will end up with social housing apartheid because the Department does not want to let people on the list in order to massage the figures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Why is there not a-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They will not be evicted from homeless accommodation.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach should make a commitment on that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	These people would not be able to afford those houses.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The protests outside by hauliers are just the latest manifestation of the huge problems large numbers of working people, people on lower incomes, hauliers, taxi drivers and many others are having with the cost of living and the cost of energy and fuel. The Taoiseach asked that we give some suggestions. We have given suggestions. Under section 61 of the Consumer Protection Act 2007, the Government can issue an emergency order and control the price of energy and fuel. It should do that. That is what is required to deal with these price hikes that are devastating people's ability to go to work or heat their homes as we enter into the coldest period of the year. Will the Government introduce caps and controls to reduce the price of energy and fuel?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The threatened sale of the Killegar forest in Enniskerry, which I highlighted and on which I am glad to say Coillte backed off, and the one raised by Deputy Cairns that the Taoiseach was talking about earlier on, indicate a fundamental problem with the mandate of Coillte, namely, that it is operating to commercial imperatives, rather than as a guardian of the forest estate and as the entity that is trying to expand that forest estate to deal with climate change and carbon sequestration and to enhance biodiversity. Something is fundamentally wrong with the way it is operating. That mandate needs to be changed to prevent the sale of public forests and in order for it to act as a spearhead in dealing with the spectacular, ongoing, decades-long failure to meet our afforestation targets, to deal with our fundamentally unsustainable forest model based on monocultures and Sitka spruce and the market conditions around that and to deal with the need to assist farmers in embracing afforestation by supporting them rather than as is often the case where they find themselves at odds with Coillte which commercially dominates a market rather than doing the right thing by our forest estate.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yesterday, I said to the Taoiseach that people cannot get a PCR test in Dublin for love nor money. Now that fact has been confirmed, although people in the Government's front bench were shaking their heads when I said that. Something else that the Taoiseach might consider is that, if people cannot get a test for a couple of days, they can understandably feel pressure to get a private test, which can cost up to €99. They can go to private hospitals to get a test and pay for it, which underlines the point about how unacceptable a two-tier system is when we are talking about the lack of capacity in our system. It is not just about the ICU and beds but the ability to test. If a person has €99, he or she can pop up to the Beacon and be tested today. That is the reality of what a two-tier system provides when faced with a public health emergency. All that Covid has done is highlight the inadequacies that exist with the two-tier system. We have an ongoing public health emergency with waiting lists and emergency departments. It is unacceptable on the issue with testing. The Government will not provide pop-up centres, which we asked for yesterday. If we nationalised the private healthcare capacity, we would be able to test people as quickly and urgently as we need them to be tested.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Over the past number of weeks, many taxi drivers were pushed off the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP. In fact, many of them could have stayed on it but voluntarily signed off because their sector was recovering. Now the sector has gone over a cliff because of the night-time curfew, the public health advice for people to reduce social contacts and the work from home provisions. Taxi drivers are being offered nothing. They have got it in the neck from the word go in this pandemic. Every measure that is taken impacts on their ability to make an income. It is not fair that they will again be punished financially and get no supports. We need to give them back the support such that they can earn a little from the bit of work that is out there, while having the income support of the PUP. Precisely the same goes for musicians, entertainers and people working in events and the night-time economy. It is not fair that, yet again, they get hit. They have been the longest affected and the worst hit - they have been repeatedly hit - but they are denied the right to the PUP. Indeed, while other business supports are maintained, the workers, who depend on the supports and were hit hardest, are hammered and their supports taken away, with no indication from the Government that it intends to restore supports for them and people in similar sectors that are particularly hit by the latest round of public health measures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some were.
