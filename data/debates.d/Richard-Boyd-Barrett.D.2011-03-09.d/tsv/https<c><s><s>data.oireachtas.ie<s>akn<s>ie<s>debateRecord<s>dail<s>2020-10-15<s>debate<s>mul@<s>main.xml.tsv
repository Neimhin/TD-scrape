RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The shameful behaviour of KPMG in sending a notice to the union representatives of the Debenhams workers stating it would not try to remove stock this week and that it would give two hours' notice, and then in the dead of night sending people in to remove stock, is absolutely shameful but typical of the way in which KPMG has treated these workers. The Government has said it has sympathy for the workers. I remind the Tánaiste that the Taoiseach said he did not believe there should be strike-breaking in respect of Debenhams. The Tánaiste should therefore condemn what KPMG has done. He should call on anybody who has any respect for these workers not to cross the picket line and not to put them in the position of facing possible jailing. He should immediately convene a meeting with the shop stewards and other union representatives and KPMG, chaired by the Government, in order to prevent these workers from ending up in jail.
