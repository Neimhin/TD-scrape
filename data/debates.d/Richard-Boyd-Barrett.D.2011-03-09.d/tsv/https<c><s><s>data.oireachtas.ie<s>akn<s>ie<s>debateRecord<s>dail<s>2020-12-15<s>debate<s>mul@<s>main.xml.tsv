RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend Deputies Eoghan Murphy and Duncan Smith on seeking this debate. The 50th anniversary of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is an important occasion to remind ourselves of the utter obscenity and horror of nuclear weapons.If the Nazi Holocaust was probably the greatest crime that was ever committed against humanity, a very close second is the decision of one of the most wealthy, powerful countries in the world, the United States - a country that claims to be civilised - to drop two nuclear weapons in the course of three days on top of two Japanese cities. A conscious decision was made to incinerate between 180,000 and 230,000 mostly completely innocent civilians. The barbarism of it is beyond obscene. The other Allied powers signed off on it and agreed in advance that those weapons would be used against Japan. The horror of it is hard to fully get one's head around. In the initial blast in Hiroshima, 70,000 to 80,000 people were killed in the first few minutes as a result of the blast and the firestorm that engulfed the city. Tens of thousands more people died in the following weeks. The consequences in terms of cancer rates continued long after. The Irish resolution, the role of Frank Aiken and the development of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons was a welcome attempt to try to rein in the obscenity and madness that was being pursued by the most powerful nations in the world. Even under this treaty, they are still legally allowed to hold these weapons and to dominate the UN Security Council to this day, and they can effectively veto efforts by any other country in the world to rein in their activities. It is also worth saying that while the commendable desire to prevent proliferation is in the treaty, we have seen very little sign of willingness on the part of those who, supposedly, legally hold nuclear arsenals to make a serious move towards the decommissioning of those nuclear arsenals. Many of those states continue to be part of the NATO military alliance, which has a first-strike policy on the use of nuclear weapons. The fact that any alliance would contemplate and continue with an official policy of reserving the right to have a first-strike policy on the use of nuclear weapons after what happened in Hiroshima and Nagasaki is beyond comprehension and exposes the lie that the states which dominate NATO are in any way guardians of civilisation, peace or democracy. They are people who reserve the right to use mass murder and terror against civilians in the context of war. In that context, it is also lamentable that we continue to facilitate the use of Shannon Airport by the US military machine when it continues to use depleted uranium. As well as being a possessor of a large nuclear arsenal, which it retains the right to use, it uses depleted uranium weapons to devastating effect in conflicts like the criminal war on Iraq that claimed the lives of up to 1 million people and where the consequences of the use of depleted uranium continue to give rise to high cancer rates and to birth defects in Iraqi children. It is quite shocking. There is the continued willingness to treat as normal states countries like Israel, which illegally possess hundreds of nuclear weapons and by doing so are further encouraging and inciting regimes like Iran potentially to want those weapons as well. It is right to ponder the horror of nuclear weapons and the efforts globally to deal with them but we should be under no illusion that the threat of nuclear destruction is, like the states that reserve the power to use such weapons, sadly very much still with us.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Ceann Comhairle will be aware, I objected at the Business Committee to the short amount of time available for the debate on the vaccine. I will add to the points that have already been made. This is a huge undertaking, and People Before Profit is very pleased that we have, or hope to have very soon, vaccines available. We have no doubt about their importance in trying to combat the pandemic, but significant measures need to be put in place to make this vaccine roll-out campaign a success. We need a major public health education campaign about the importance of vaccines and the roles they have played in the past. We need to address the huge deficit we have in our public health teams, which will be a part of the roll-out. I had a very alarming conversation with one of our public health doctors who described in grim detail the lack of IT, the lack of a vaccine register, the chronic understaffing of our public health teams and the lack of integration of those teams with the rest of our health system. Because of the lack of resourcing and staffing of our public health teams, we will have to co-ordinate many different moving parts in a fragmented system to try to develop what should be a cohesive and integrated vaccine campaign. There are therefore very many reasons to be concerned. There is also the issue of intellectual property rights in respect of the global roll-out of this vaccine to poor countries. If they do not get the vaccine, it could potentially undermine the efficacy of the vaccine everywhere. There are a lot of issues, more than I can enunciate in the short time available to me. We need a longer debate on this. The amount of time available to the small parties is ridiculous and unacceptable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Today is day 250 of the Debenhams dispute. Almost 1,000 workers, most of whom are women, and their families have suffered terrible hardship. They have endured a long battle for a just and fair redundancy and still, in the teeth of Christmas, they remain out protesting. I heard the Taoiseach's response to Deputy Barry earlier. He spoke about not engaging in a blame game. I want to be very clear that this Government and the previous Fine Gael-Labour Party Government have a responsibility for the failure to legislate after Clerys. Anyone who has been in government since Clerys has a responsibility, not just to implement the Duffy Cahill Report but to address all of the issues that can leave a group of workers like the Debenhams workers in a situation where they do not get a just and fair redundancy. That failure puts a responsibility on the Taoiseach to sort it out, which he has not done, and to ensure a just redundancy for them. I was on the phone to the Arcadia workers this week. They number approximately 470 and are employed in Topshop, Miss Selfridge, Burton and other outlets where liquidation is under way. They could find themselves in the same situation as the Debenhams workers. It is the Government's responsibility to ensure workers do not find themselves in that situation. The Taoiseach must take responsibility for the collective failure of governments to prevent this from happening in the first place.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will continue the earlier discussion. The welfare of workers is an economic question and an economic imperative. I refer to the Taoiseach's response on Debenhams and the possibility of another such situation unfolding with the Arcadia workers who, I believe, will be protesting outside Leinster House early next week. Unless Arcadia is bought out, it is also facing liquidation and the possibility that the two-plus-two contractual agreement the workers had with the Arcadia group will disappear and they will be looking for statutory redundancy from the State. We would not be in this situation if the Government had realised after what happened with Clerys, Vita Cortex and La Senza that this stuff had to stop and that workers could not be left at the bottom of the queue when it comes to the distribution of assets of companies that go into liquidation. Honouring redundancy arrangements and just entitlement for people who have worked for years is an imperative for Government. The Government has failed to do that - not primarily this Government, as it happens, but the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government. However, Fianna Fáil is now in government and the Taoiseach has a responsibility. He should say that this Government will sort it out because Government should have sorted it out, and then it will address the situation going forward to ensure it does not happen again.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As has been said, it is going to be many months before we can get the population vaccinated. Until then, and perhaps beyond, the front line against Covid-19 remains in our hospitals. I want to respond to the systematic misrepresentations on the Taoiseach's part of the issue concerning student nurses and midwives, arising from a motion which we tabled several weeks ago. Let us be clear what is at stake and try to address directly what the student nurses and midwives are asking for. During the Covid-19 pandemic, they have been covering the gaps of many sick and infected healthcare workers and they should be paid for that. The situation has not changed because Covid-19 is still with us and it will remain with us for at least another six to eight months, if not longer. Will the Government simply pay them for that work? I ask that because they are doing that work, and all the denial in the world will not change that. I refer to the ongoing situation.I have not met one nurse who said student nurses' education was ever protected under the degree programme. What they say is that they have always worked. They want a degree programme, but they also want to be paid for the work they are doing and for the denial to end. By the way, if Government were to pay them for the work they are doing, that would protect their education because they would not have to be doing other work on the side when they are supposed to be studying. The Government should add to that by not imposing fees of €3,000 to €7,500 on them.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach used the word "balance".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What of the student nurses?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It has been pretty much happening for years.
