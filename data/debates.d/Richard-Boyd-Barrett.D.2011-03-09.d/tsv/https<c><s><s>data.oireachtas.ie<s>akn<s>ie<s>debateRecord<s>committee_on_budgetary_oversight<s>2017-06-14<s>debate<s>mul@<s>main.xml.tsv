RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What is the figure for the gross manufacturing and non-manufacturing trading profits in 2015 or 2016? Amazingly, this document does not have it. It is inexplicable.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This, to me, is crucial. It is telling that we do not get that figure. How do we know whether a proper tax rate is being paid unless we are given that figure in their initial paper?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I would point out, in terms of the availability of this information, that we find out this information two or three years late. Maybe they could give me the average. They give the increase in trading profits by sector in 2015, all of which, interestingly, are up significantly. There was an incredible increase in profits, of 5% in health and social work, 10% in transportation, and right up to 110% in manufacturing, if I read that correctly.An extraordinary leap in profits is taking place, far in excess of, for example, what workers are getting in wage increases or increases in public spending. It is critically important that we know how much all of that is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some €2.5 billion in non-trading profits.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What was the figure for total manufacturing and non-manufacturing trade profits for 2015 and 2016, if Dr. Walsh has it?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Some €140 billion?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A total of €55 billion was manufacturing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Publicly available.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes. That is the opening gambit, as it were.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but to me, it is telling that it is not shown here. I have difficulty getting these up-to-date figures.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I appreciate that and thank the Chairman for his help. The figures were not presented initially, and to my mind the most important thing is how much profit is being made. Am I correct - to confirm for the public, who may be interested in these things - that profits are up considerably? Is that right? Yes, very considerably. Profits are up by percentages a good deal in excess of wages, for example.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Non-trading profits, but the vast bulk of profits-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----are trading profits and they are very considerably up. It is an upward trend. The percentages of increases are well outstripping wage increases over that period. Would that be fair to say?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, it is indeed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There is still a gap.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What I am trying to get at, because I think the public is owed this information, is that profits are going up very considerably and are consistently outstripping increases in remuneration for workers. That bears out what many of us see as a recovery for the few rather than a recovery benefiting the many. That is my point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No one could possibly dispute there has been increased employment, so we will take that as read.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. McCarthy said the gap in 2016 was not as great. What was the figure he gave me for 2016?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not the wage bill I am concerned with. I am concerned with how profits are doing versus how wages are doing. That is what I am interested in. Even in 2016, when Mr. McCarthy is saying it is slightly less, the gap is between 2% for wages and 7% for profits.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what Mr. McCarthy just said.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For workers it is the wage that is quite important.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The companies making ginormous profits will definitely not be heading out of business any time soon. From the latest available figures, we have €142 billion and €7.4 billion paid in tax. What is the tax paid as a percentage of gross trading profits? It would be useful for us to have that figure.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are about five different calculations of effective tax rate. I could work it out myself but I think the figures should be provided for the tax paid versus the gross manufacturing and non-manufacturing profits and what one is as a proportion of the other.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Mr. Rónán Hession made the point that we do not have that many allowances. That is somewhat debatable. It is certainly the case that the amount of taxable income that can be written off by the allowances that do exist is pretty extraordinary. Mr. Howard seems to be saying, if I understand it correctly, that many of the companies that account for much of the profits and allowances have moved from writing down their taxable income via paying patent royalties to themselves or other subsidiaries of their group, that is, to themselves, to getting allowances on the basis they have intangible assets which benefit from the machinery and capital allowances. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not understand why Mr. Howard is being so cautious about saying that. The graph provided shows there was an absolutely extraordinary jump from 2014 to 2015; the intangible assets benefiting from the plant and machinery capital allowances jumped from €2.6 billion to €28 billion in one year. To me, the extent of the allowance is absolutely mind-boggling.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have to be honest and say I understand Mr. Howard is under some constraints but businesses did not develop a whole lot of new intellectual property overnight. What they actually did is an accountancy exercise where instead of paying themselves royalties they relocated the intellectual property here and instead of avoiding tax by getting the allowance on royalties, they now do not pay tax by getting the allowance on machinery and capital allowances on intangible assets. That is what they have done. Let us be absolutely honest. It is part of the aggressive tax avoidance of these companies. That is really what it is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	When we are dealing with intangible assets, we are dealing with a whole new category - let us be clear about this - and a category that, in my opinion, these companies are exploiting to the nth degree. I believe that when a particular heading allows for allowances to jump by a factor of more than ten - from €2.6 billion to €28 billion - we need to know exactly what is going on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Precisely what is going on?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am probably out of time but-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just wish to comment that all of these, particularly where there are jumps in the amount of taxable income that can be written down under this heading, need to be, by our committee specifically, examined forensically and we need to know more than we currently know about what is going on here. There is a real problem regarding our ability to scrutinise what is happening under these headings on the basis of the information we are getting. Finally, can the witnesses say anything about what we can know or do not know about capital gains? What allowances or taxes are being lost or revenues forgone in the area of capital gains, given the whole movement in the property sector over the past year or two? What can the witnesses tell us about that?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Capital gains come under this, do they not?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is not the figure I was looking for.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I request that the delegates, in providing us with the figures on the effective rate, give us the figures for the various calculations. The delegates know precisely what I mean. There is the implicit rate, the aggregated version and all the other versions, which vary radically. Mr. Howard stated there was an effective rate of 9% in 2015. I calculate €6.8 billion paid as a percentage of €142 billion amounts to approximately 5.5%. I have not done the exact calculation. The delegates know that certain calculations would result in this figure as opposed to 9%, which involved a different means of calculation.That is my first request and I ask the witnesses to confirm that it can be done.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I do not want an explanation of how it was done. I want the different calculations provided.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is actually not what I want. The Department of Finance prepared a paper on the corporation tax rate. It is a very good paper which explained that there are at least four different ways of calculating the effective rate. That paper showed that one can get, for the very same year on the basis of the same figures, a variation in the effective tax rate. The rate can be around 6% if it is the implicit rate calculated in the way that the European Commission does such calculations. The rate can be around 11.9%, if the Department of Finance does its calculations. There was even an amazing calculation which had the rate higher than the nominal rate of 12.5%, which was a pretty extraordinary feat but nonetheless, somebody managed that one. What I would like, for all of the relevant years and particularly for 2015, is the different calculations so that we have the range of calculations of the effective rate. Is that possible?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I just want to point out to the Acting Chairman and the committee that this is a real problem. We have a paper produced by the Department of Finance that shows that there are at least four different ways of legitimately calculating the effective rate. The figures produced vary very significantly. One can have what is considered a legitimate method of calculating the effective corporation tax rate which puts it at 4% or 5% alongside another method which puts the rate at 11.9% or even higher than 12.5%. That is a problem in terms of our ability to calculate what is actually going on. Frankly, it is doing the public a disservice to not at least show that there are different ways of calculating these things. That is my first point. The graph that has been provided by the witnesses is very useful. As I understand it, the graph shows the increase or decrease in trading profits by sector for 2015 over 2014. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Figure 2 on page 2.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Over 2014?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How far back could Revenue go in terms of its ability to reproduce that graph? Could it be done for 2016?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Would it be possible to provide us with the same graph for the previous ten years? Would that be a lot of work or-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This graph is not on the website.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I must be honest that I find it difficult. The thing I presume the witnesses are referring to on the website is a paper which is not very readable and which was quite difficult to find. It is not as clearly set out as a previous manifestation which used to be available.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is not really okay but we will see how we go from here. By the way, I do appreciate all of the witnesses' work, even if I am being a bit pushy.
