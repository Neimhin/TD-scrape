RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I also thank Deputy Pringle for his fantastic work in producing this Bill and persisting with it to the point that it is going to be passed. I also wish to thank Trócaire, the Stop Climate Chaos Coalition and all those who have championed and supported this Bill. It is hugely important. As others have said, while the impact is modest at one level, it is an absolutely clear signal that we have to move rapidly to a fossil-free future. The public investment in that area must be concentrated in areas that do not further damage our environment or threaten the future of this planet. It should be invested in areas that will help reverse climate change and stabilise our climate and our environment. It is a fantastically positive moment that we are about to pass this into law. It is part of a sea change that is happening, and that sea change is because of the campaigning work of huge and growing numbers of environmental campaigners. They include young people and others who are determined to push this issue to the top of the agenda where it belongs, and force the political system to respond and address the issue of climate chaos and climate change. I want to add one particular point in addition. I do not want to go over ground that has already been covered by Deputies Bríd Smith and Paul Murphy, although I should say that I endorse the call for this to be complementary to things like Deputy Bríd Smith's Petroleum and Other Minerals Development (Amendment) (Climate Emergency Measures) Bill 2018. We need to move that legislation rapidly through as well. I hope we can do that early in the autumn and that there will be no attempt to block it. If we are serious about dealing with climate change and avoiding the climate cliff, the fines, etc., we must clearly indicate that there is no justification whatsoever for extracting further fossil fuels in this country, or indeed anywhere else.  There is one particular point I want to underline. If we are going to move away from investment in fossil fuels, we must also dramatically increase investment in areas that will help reverse climate change and move us towards a sustainable future as far as climate and the environment are concerned. My particular hobby horse in this regard is the issue of forestry. As we move away from State investment in fossil fuels, I would really like to see not just Ireland Strategic Investment Fund, ISIF, money, but National Treasury Management Agency, NTMA, money and public investment directed into forestry. Deforestation is responsible for 15 to 20% of all carbon dioxide emissions in the environment. 
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Not at all.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We want to divest from fossil fuels and invest in stuff that-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is about divesting ISIF money-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I think it is totally relevant, in fairness, a Cheann Comhairle. Where do we invest ISIF money if we do not invest it in fossil fuels? We want to invest ISIF money, NTMA money and public money in things that will help to deal with climate change, because this is about dealing with climate change. I am simply pointing out that one way we could do that is by investing in forestry. It is uncomplicated and it is win-win-win from the points of view of the economy, the environment and employment. It is a tragic fact that Ireland has the best conditions for forestry in Europe bar none and the lowest level of forest cover in Europe bar none. That is a desperate failure, and we need to do something about it. Much lipservice has been paid to this and we are not progressing. In the same way, we have not really progressed in dealing with climate change and we are facing big fines as a result. We are the laggards, as the Taoiseach has said. In the same way, we are real laggards in this area, which could be so beneficial. As the NTMA and the ISIF are obliged to rethink their investment portfolio to move away from things that damage the environment, as this Bill proposes, I really hope they begin to think about areas like that, where investment would be environmentally beneficial.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the current drought and water shortages, people should conserve water as best they can in order that we do not run out of supplies. However, somewhat cynical attempts have been made - not here today but I have heard them in the House in the past week, particularly from Government Deputies - to suggest that if there had been water charges, this would not be happening or we would have the means to deal with it. That is completely disingenuous, not just because the investment programme of Irish Water would have been the same but also because this problem has existed through the entire history of the State. I do not know how many Members have read Ulysses by James Joyce but in "Ithaca", the second last chapter, there is an extensive passage in which he describes the capacity limitations of the Vartry reservoir in Roundwood, the problems with the pipes, the rationing of water during a drought period and the corruption of the municipal guardians of Dublin, who were responsible for imposing the rations, in using excessive amounts of water while the people paid the price for it. Ulysses was written at the time of the First World War. Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael have been in government ever since and have not addressed the problem that James Joyce identified in 1914. That is how long this has been happening. Water was the first thing hit when Fianna Fáil and the Green Party imposed austerity in 2010. The policy of austerity was then continued by Fine Gael and the Labour Party. A €50 million annual reduction in investment was implemented on already historically low levels of investment in water infrastructure. The people and individual householders are not to blame. We have lower household use of water than anywhere in Europe. The problem is a failure to invest in fixing water infrastructure. I hope this heatwave will be a wake-up call for the Government. We must dramatically ramp up investment in water infrastructure. Could we not ask the corporations to pay an extra few bob for the water they use?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will put the case slightly differently from my colleagues in Solidarity in that People Before Profit subscribes to the view set out by James Connolly, namely, that partition on this island would lead to "a carnival of reaction both North and South". In the South, we got the Catholic Church-dominated, anti-woman regime that held sway and persisted until relatively recently and that has been challenged forcefully by the Repeal and marriage equality movements. In the North, people got the sectarian state, sectarian violence and conflict of the orange and green varieties. For that reason, removing partition is vital in order to eliminate the divisions and the conservative and sectarian states with which people, North and South, have had to live. I agree very strongly with Deputy Coppinger that the alarming eruptions of sectarian violence we have seen in recent days are a stark reminder that sectarianism remains alive and well in the North. That said, we glimpse the possibility for a different type of Ireland and for unity that emerges from below through struggles for things that unite ordinary people, working people and young people in a fight for a better and more progressive Ireland. After the Together for Yes victory, it was very inspiring for me to go to the North to participate in a march at which there was a huge contingent calling for abortion rights to be extended to the North. Both Catholics and Protestants were demanding that, cutting across the sectarian division. Similarly, there is a big movement erupting for marriage equality in the North. Again, it involves Catholic and Protestant people, but young people in particular. Perhaps slightly more worryingly, although there is a positive side, Catholic and Protestant young people who are anti-racist had to take to the streets in the past week to protest against far-right demonstrations in the North, echoing the very worrying rise of far-right mobilisation in Britain, which, terrifyingly, saw 15,000 out-and-out fascists marching in London in recent weeks. It was great to see young, progressive, left-wing Catholic and Protestant young people mobilising against the far right in Belfast. The two possible futures are the sectarian violence we see erupting and a progressive and different type of Ireland based on Catholic and Protestant working people and young people coming together to fight for a shared, better and progressive future. The political establishment, in the North, the South and Britain, has to take some responsibility for the violence that is erupting. The political structures in the North are not about eliminating sectarianism; they are about policing apart two communities. Suggesting that Orange marches and bonfires with sectarian slogans are part of some legitimate culture that we can manage is a mistake. This culture is used to stoke up violence. It has no purpose other than violence and it produces a reaction from people who are right to be angry about the sectarianism but who are completely wrong in that reaction and manipulated by elements who want to return to a futile armed struggle that will only divide the community again and lead absolutely nowhere. We need a different type of politics that breaks from orange and green. People Before Profit is trying, North and South, to build a politics that will oppose austerity and fight for a socially progressive Ireland, not under a flag of green or orange but under the flag James Connolly would have flown, that of working-class, progressive and internationalist politics. We could do with a dose of that in Britain and in Europe also.
