RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fianna Fáil's abysmal failure to institute political reform and its double standards when it jumps up and down now about political reform are apparent to people. However, the issue is about this Government and whether it is serious in its commitment to political reform. I am happy to give credit where credit is due. The Government said that it would abolish the Seanad and has moved to do so. I support the abolition of the Seanad because it is an unrepresentative and elitist entity that does not enhance democracy. However, if the Taoiseach was listening to people in the country he would know that since this issue has come up the public sentiment on the matter is perfectly clear. They want the choice of more democracy not less democracy. They want to see the abolition of the existing Seanad, but they want abolition to take place in the context of an enhanced democracy and a greater level of political accountability, whereby, for example, politicians who make promises and break them can be held to account and whereby people do not have to wait five years to do so. There is clearly a concern among the public about the idea that if we simply abolish the Seanad then we are left with Cabinet dictatorship. This Government has not especially inspired confidence in this regard given its repeated use of guillotines and repeated short-circuiting of debates on vital issues. Will the Taoiseach listen to the public in the context of the forthcoming referendum and link the referendum on the abolition of the Seanad to a serious debate on democratic reform and how we enhance democracy in order that the whole thing is seen as a package whereby we get more democracy, not less? I put it to the Taoiseach that if he does not do that, he runs a serious risk of losing the referendum. That is where the public sentiment is going such is the level of mistrust of politicians in general. This must be addressed. That is my question to the Taoiseach. Is he going to listen to what the public is saying on this issue? Can the Taoiseach convince them it is not just about "Yes" or "No" to the existing Seanad but that he seriously intends to listen to their views and put forward and be willing to accept proposals about how the democracy in this country can be improved and enhanced? Unless the Taoiseach does that, he and the entire political establishment will rue the day.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I support the abolition. That is absolutely clear.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The public wants much more.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am next on the list.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am in favour of the abolition of the Seanad because it is unrepresentative. However, does the Taoiseach not think the enhanced committee system, about which he talks, could replicate the problems we have with the Seanad? I would welcome greater involvement of different sectors of civic society in the committees but there is nothing to stop the same sort of favouritism of the Government appointing its favourite people, its cronies and so on to an enhanced committee system and, essentially, replicating the same elitism and unrepresentative character at committees. We need representatives of civic society who are genuinely representative of all sectors of society, unlike Members of the current Seanad, who are directly elected from those different sectors, probably starting at a local level as they would come from voluntary and community organisations and genuinely representative organisations and not just professionals, officials, full-timers and so on. We should build a sort of citizens' direct democracy from the base up, which would have some influence and some teeth in regard to oversight of the way this House operates and the way democracy generally operates. From what the Taoiseach is saying, there is a real danger that the Government of the day will end up putting its favourites onto the committees, but that does not resolve the problem we are trying to resolve by doing away with an institution which we have already accepted is not representative and has not really functioned in the way it should. What does the Taoiseach say to some sort of citizens' assembly structure, directly elected at a local level, and then maybe building up from there?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The utterly shocking revelations arising from the Anglo Irish Bank tapes obviously provided a critically important context to last week's European Council meeting. Much of the discourse and media debate around those revelations has focused on the reputational damage to Ireland. We need to move away from the idea that such damage has been done. President Higgins was correct in stating that the outrageous comments made, disgraceful sentiments expressed and language used by senior executives in the former Anglo Irish Bank had nothing to do with the character of the Irish people or with their attitude towards the people of Germany or the remainder of Europe. This matter is not about what Irish people did, rather it relates to what bankers did and to the tremendous cost they have inflicted on ordinary citizens, on the country and on its economy. It also relates to what bankers right across Europe did to its economy and the price we are paying for their attitude, activities and gangster-like behaviour. There is no other way to describe what happened. It is telling that they sought to use a poor imitation of the gangster language of the streets in order to stylise their activities. The language used on the Anglo tapes brought to mind the RTE documentary on Bertie Ahern's rise to power from his base in Drumcondra, wherein some of his cronies stated, without shame, that they had modelled themselves on the Mafia. It seems that there was a cohort of people in the spheres of banking and politics - particularly concentrated within the Fianna Fáil Party - the members of which quite unashamedly sought to emulate gangsterism when conducting the business of society and running the economy. If that is true - I think I would probably have the agreement of the current Government when I say that it is true - and if gangsterism among bankers, politicians and developers and a contemptuous attitude with regard to the impact of their activities on ordinary citizens were the problem, then surely the biggest lesson we can draw from this is that we can be absolutely certain and confident in saying that we have no moral, economic, practical or other responsibility to pick up the tab for what these people did. It begs the question after these shocking revelations - I know this is the feeling among ordinary people - why the hell are we paying the debts of this gang? There is no other word to describe them other than as a "gang" who had utter contempt for the people of this country, its economy and the wider European economy. That is the lesson we should draw from this and it should give us renewed confidence to say we are not paying off these debts because they will destroy us. Why are we taking responsibility for them? Why are we allowing Europe to force us to bear the cost of what these people did, in particular when Europe went along with the doctrine of light regulation, which was certainly championed in this country by this layer of people, or this golden circle, and cheered on the Irish economic model then called the "Celtic tiger"? It rewarded some of the key figures who were championing this cowboy model of banking and economics and promoted some of them into senior positions in the European Union and, to a large extent, institutionalised their laissez-faire no regulation model when it came to running an economy and running banking. Where I believe our reputation has been damaged - this is an issue the Government must address - is in regard to corporate taxation which is the other big issue that has come up in the past few weeks. I appeal to the Government, if it is serious about wanting to secure, improve and rehabilitate Ireland's reputation at an international level, to show a willingness to seriously scrutinise what multinationals based and operating in this country are doing to avoid paying their proper tax obligations because it is a scandal which is damaging our reputation in Europe, Britain, the United States and everywhere, and we are in denial about it. In a discussion about setting up a sub-committee to look at global taxation architecture at the finance committee last week, it was very clear that Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party would scupper efforts to get Google, Facebook, Abbott Laboratories or other such companies to answer questions, never mind change the tax regime, on how they are dodging tax. Surely that is doing far more damage to our reputation and to our public finances in that these companies are not contributing properly to the functioning of a state and its infrastructure which they utilise in order to make their enormous profits.  I appeal to the Government to make a statement, given its commitment to supporting whistleblowers, letting Edward Snowden know that if he comes to this country after doing us the service of telling us that the United States is spying on the EU, of which we are a part, we will look favourably on his asylum application as it is the least we can do.
