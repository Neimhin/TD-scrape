RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I wish to add my support for this amendment. I do not see any reason the Government should refuse it. Sometimes when we are dealing with amendments, the default position of the Government seems to be "No", even when they are very sensible amendments. That default response should not apply to this sensible amendment. In Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, the local authority does not generally resist any representation by me, other local representatives or other advocates. Many of the officials see the benefit of this because, for example, there are often issues of trust between the tenants and the local authority. It is important for these tenants to have a person they trust with them who can interpret what is being said and provide clarity in these often complex discussions about tenancies. For example, I am dealing with a case currently about succession of tenancy, which is labyrinthine in its complexity. The tenant feels he is being done over, but I do not believe the local authority is doing that. It is just that the case is complex. Having somebody there who can act as an independent reporter on events and who can clarify and interpret matters for the tenant can be helpful in trying to resolve the issues for all sides. Often there are huge issues of illiteracy, where people are just not able to read the forms or understand the complexity of the process, which is often bureaucratic. People need help in such cases. Another important reason for this amendment is that there are often disputes about what has been said in the aftermath of meetings, with people making claims and counter claims. Therefore, it is helpful if somebody has attended independently and has taken notes and can confirm what was said. I do not see what the problem is with this or why the Minister of State might refuse it. The amendment is eminently sensible. It does not make the provision of an advocate compulsory, but requires that it be agreed if the tenant feels he needs this support. In many cases they do need it. I appeal to the Minister of State to accept the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with the amendments. The following point arises from a suggestion made to me by someone on the list in my area. In expanding tenant purchase, we could provide for people on the list to have the possibility of getting a loan from the local authority to build a house. It is something to examine. As well as being able to purchase a local authority house, we should consider the category of people on the list who are working and qualify for the list and who, if they were given cheap finance and land by the local authority, could come off the list and build their houses. This would relieve some of the pressure on housing lists, free up spaces on the list and provide housing for people who need housing but cannot afford it on the open market. I ask the Minister of State to think about that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is the Minister saying we cannot allow the sale of these units?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That makes no sense. Connecting amendments Nos. 16 and 17 makes sense, but amendments Nos. 16 and 18-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That makes absolutely no sense.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	All of the amendments will be defeated.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Section 37 is nothing less than a counter-revolution in the provision of social housing. It is the most retrograde and backward step imaginable in that it attempts to turn what it is a temporary necessity owing to the failure of Governments, including the previous one, to provide council housing into a permanent measure and to institutionalise the outsourcing and privatisation of social housing to the private sector. That is appalling. Everything else that the Government says or claims it proposes to do to try to address the current crisis is undermined and undone by this measure. This takes us to a place that the late Margaret Thatcher could only have dreamed of in terms of wholesale, full-scale privatisation of social housing. This section, combined with the Minister of State's earlier resistance to giving a firm commitment to reinvest all of the proceeds from tenant purchases back into the provision of social housing and the Government's cries that it does not have the money to engage in large-scale direct provision of council housing, which is necessary - and is what the Minister of State has said she would favour in an ideal world but says we cannot afford - is a recipe for full-scale privatisation of housing. The effective privatisation of the housing market by Fianna Fáil, although not set down in legal statute, is what created the ingredients for the current crisis, the property bubble and the crash that almost destroyed our economy, for which we are now paying a terrible price. Fianna Fáil did it effectively and this Government is now institutionalising what it did effectively and making it law. Accommodation owned by a private landlord and subject to a housing assistance payment arrangement with the council is not social housing. Apart from the utterly retrograde, privatising thrust of this section, it is not going to work. It indicates a failure to grasp what is currently going on. I am sure the Minister of State is in contact with the local authorities on this issue, which makes it more difficult to understand the reason she would put this in legislation. Everybody knows and is finally acknowledging that private landlords are walking away. All of the evidence suggests that even those who have not walked away could walk at any time because they can command higher rents elsewhere. How can the Minister of State possibly say that an arrangement between a private landlord and a local authority, from which arrangement a landlord can walk at any time if it is possible for him or her to make more money elsewhere, represents a permanent solution to people's housing need? It does not, yet this Bill says it does. The Bill states that the provision of social housing assistance under the relevant Part shall be deemed to be an appropriate form of social housing support. It is not. I do not know how the Minister of State can claim it is when she has acknowledged that these types of arrangement are temporary. In response to questions during the past year on the need to raise the rent caps, the Minister, Deputy Burton, rightly said, although somewhat disingenuously, that we cannot do that because we do not want to continue to pour money into the pockets of private landlords. We agree. The only way to avoid doing that is to provide social housing, but what the Minister of State is proposing to do is to institutionalise the arrangement through which we pour money into the pockets of private landlords and call that permanent social housing provision. It is not too much of an exaggeration to say that this is a recipe for a return to slum landlordism. While some of the landlords engaged in RAS arrangements are good, reasonable and so on, others are not. Some of the accommodation is sub-standard and there are huge problems in terms of who is directly in charge of ensuring that accommodation is up to standard. While tenants can call in the environmental health officer or local authority in respect of housing that is unsuitable, many are afraid to do so because if they do their landlord will pull out of the RAS arrangement, leaving them homeless. The council would then have a housing obligation to those people which it could not fulfil, because it currently cannot fulfil it for anybody, even those in the most dire of circumstances. One of the justifications for the housing assistance payment is to ensure that people in receipt of rent allowance are not disincentivised from working, which is positive. Last Thursday, along with dozens of families who are either homeless, threatened with homelessness or on the housing list for up to 16 years, I slept in a sleeping bag outside Dún Loaghaire-Rathdown County Council. At 7 a.m. the following morning, approximately half of the people there left to go to work. Some of these people are homeless but they work. The homeless are the people who are working. They are not just people who are dependant on social welfare; some are on low incomes, in part-time jobs and so on.  This provision will not address the crisis. In fact, it is institutionalising the problem that produced the crisis in the first instance - namely, dependance on the private sector. All that is required is that one word be changed to acknowledge that this is a temporary measure, so that anybody who is forced into an arrangement which is temporary and is not appropriate or suitable has the comfort of knowing that while housing is currently not available, they are entitled to a council house and the authority is moving to provide them with those houses. That is what we need. This has to be changed; otherwise, the Bill cannot be supported. If it is not changed, everything else in the Bill becomes decorative and what we will actually have is a counter-revolution in social housing of which the late Margaret Thatcher would be proud.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Just say "temporary".
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is slightly different.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Despite the Minister of State's assurances, this is a counter revolution. I made the point strongly that the effective privatisation of housing started under Fianna Fáil, as she acknowledged, but that the change wrought by this provision is that what was held to be a temporary measure will become a permanent measure. If Members listen carefully to what the Minister of State said, it will not just be down to the interpretation of county managers. She let the cat out of the bag because she said this will be deemed to be social housing and then people can apply for a transfer - that is, once a client is in one of these arrangements, he or she is off the housing waiting list. I am certain that is what she just said. One can apply for a transfer but one will be off the list and that is the counter revolution because that means privatised, outsourced social housing to landlords and the market will be deemed to be the same as being in a council house. However, it is not. This legislation suggests that it is and it is the legal underpinning for the wholesale outsourcing and privatisation of social housing because privatised social housing will be deemed to be the same as a council house. The counter revolution is in that sleight of hand. There is further reason to believe this will be the case. When RAS was set up, applicants were told they would be on the scheme for four years and at the end of that time, they would get a council house. Then a directive issued as a result of a policy document produced by the Government in 2012, which said if one was on the RAS, one was deemed to be housed. There was murder. The clients were put on a fixed transfer list but everybody will be taken off the list at the end of four years. That is what this does. The reason I did not table an amendment to the section is I was sleeping outside the council offices, which we all end up having to do, if we do not do something about this on Thursday and Friday. If what we are alleging is not true, the Minister of State should insert the word "temporary" in the Seanad and give us an assurance that this provision will be temporary and that people who take up the HAP arrangement will not be taken off the waiting lists. If she does that, our concern will be addressed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	At least he or she has an entitlement.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	But one will be off the waiting list.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what the priority list is.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but one can only get on it for overcrowding or medical reasons.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The decision to push through the section we have just dealt with will cause blue murder. When word filters out that people who have been on lists for ten or 12 years are no longer on a list, there will be uproar. That said, the Government seems hell bent on moving in this direction. Perhaps, if word gets out, there is some chance it will reconsider this before the Bill goes to the Seanad. Otherwise, the anger that will be directed at the Government for what has just been done will be extraordinary. If the Government is hell bent on this path, the least it can do is prove its proposals can work. To be honest, if it was to ring local government officials tomorrow, they would tell it the proposals will not work. However, it could try to prove they could work by requiring local authorities and their officials, when they decide people must find private rental accommodation at the level of HAP set, to go and source the accommodation themselves. If the local authorities went to source it, they would find that it would cost hundreds of euro more than the current rent caps, that is if any accommodation could be found. In most cases, accommodation will not be available. No matter how sophisticated, well trained and well intentioned and resourced housing departments are, they will not be able to find accommodation. This is the challenge for the Minister of State. I suggest the Minister of State should contact her local authority in Limerick to find out what is going on. I can tell her that my clinic is like an extension of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council's housing department. Such is the level of interaction between us that the director of housing asked me the other day whether we were taking over his department. This is the level of interaction on crisis situations at this time. This all comes down to the fact that accommodation cannot be found. It is not available. However, people in desperate situations, with families and illness and so on, are told to go and find private rental accommodation for the HAP.  I could cite a litany of examples, but will only cite the latest. A man came to me yesterday having just got out of the National Rehabilitation Hospital, after having two heart attacks. He can barely talk or walk and is in a situation where he needs support. What family he has is too old and disabled itself to provide him with accommodation or the support he needs. He has been told to go and find private rented accommodation to fit the caps. This is not a joke. This situation is too serious to joke about. It is obscene and absurd that this man, in the state of health he is in, would be asked to go and find rented accommodation at the caps or for the HAP. Fantasy is not the word for what is happening. This proposal is a disaster waiting to happen. The proposal put forward by Deputy Ellis is a minimal measure. At least it would ensure we test the water by requiring officials to go out and find this accommodation. They will not find it, but at least if they try to find it, there will be no dispute about the situation. As things stand, there is dispute. People are told to go out and find accommodation, but when they come back having been unable to find it, they are told they have not tried hard enough and should go out and try harder. If the Minister of State and the Government believe this is workable - I tell them it is not - they should agree to this amendment so that the State will be required to do what it is asking tenants to do. If it did that, then it would find out how utterly unworkable this is. Then at least we could sit down together with the people on the housing list and come up with a plan that actually works.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is also true of many housing officials.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The fact that local authorities have an obligation does not solve anything. They have an obligation but they do not have the houses or the resources necessary to meet people's needs. As a result, they are informing individuals that they have nothing for them. I must stress that local authority officials, and not just public representatives, are overrun in respect of this matter. My heart goes out to housing department officials who are absolutely overrun and do not know where to turn. The Minister of State said it was not sufficient merely to describe the problem. That is true, but we have to begin by actually trying to define it. The difficulty is that the scheme she is establishing to solve the problem will not work because the private sector will not provide for the people we are discussing. Karl Deeter is a landlord who represents other landlords and he has publicly stated that they are not going to accept what is involved here. The Government is living in cloud cuckoo land if it believes landlords are going to do what is required. There is a sector of Irish society whose members, historically, were provided with council housing. Approximately 20% to 30% of the houses built in any one year in the 1950s, 1960s or 1970s were built by the State. The figure in this regard has fallen to 1% or 2%, and that is the problem. If we do not fill the gap, there will be an emergency. That is the point at which we find ourselves. We must provide council houses rather than outsource the problem to the private sector because - apart from the enormous amount of money involved - that is just not going to work. If the Minister of State is seeking an answer on a short-term basis, I will outline one that could be adopted in my area and, I am sure, in most others. What should be done is that all available buildings in a particular area should be identified. In my area, there is a gigantic seven-block development at Merrion Gates in Sandymount which was built by Bernard McNamara and which is currently in NAMA. Half of the accommodation in this development is empty, and because it is in public ownership, it should be used to house people on a temporary basis. There is another big Celtic tiger development, The Grange on the Stillorgan Road, which people were enticed to consider as a place to live by the phrase "Welcome to the spirit of gracious living". The empty properties in that development should also be taken over by the State. There are empty council-owned buildings in my area which need to be refurbished and in which 40 to 50 families could be accommodated on a temporary basis. This could be done throughout the country. The Minister of State needs to sit down with everyone who has a stake in this matter and ask where can people be accommodated and what resources will be needed in order to ensure that this will happen.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I find myself in agreement with Deputy Durkan.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I commend the Government on its acceptance of the motion. I also commend Sinn Féin on tabling it. However, those whom I commend most are the people in the Visitors Gallery, including those who were here earlier when we were dealing with a modern example of the neglect of women and children in the provision of housing. It is a terrible stain not alone on our past but also on our present that the victims of these crimes, in the main, poor women and children, have had to fight to finally get an acknowledgement that a crime was committed against them. The historians and others who have trawled up the truth about what went on deserve great credit. As in the case of the industrial schools, the Magdalen laundries and Bethany Home, it should not have taken that long, bitter struggle for people to get an acknowledgement of the crimes committed against them by the church and the State. It is not an exaggeration to say some of the things about which we have heard in Tuam and 800 skeletons being found in septic tanks are what one associates with the horrors of Nazi Germany in the Second World War, the greatest horror in human history. While what happened here is not quite on a par with it, there are elements that echo it. To think this happened in the early history of the State and continued into the 1970s is appalling.  I was born in a mother and baby home, from where I was adopted. I am a product of this system. I was one of the lucky ones who escaped, but others suffered a terrible faith. Children died of starvation or were used as guinea pigs, while families were ripped apart. It is an appalling stain on our history. It must be said the political establishment of the time colluded in a marriage of convenience with the Catholic Church to do this in order that it could selfishly control and keep down women, children and the poor in the most horrendous of circumstances. The people in the Visitors Gallery and others who are the products of this system deserve full accountability for everything done to them. Most importantly, we must ensure the mistreatment, abuse and neglect of women, children and the poor which continues to the present day is addressed.
