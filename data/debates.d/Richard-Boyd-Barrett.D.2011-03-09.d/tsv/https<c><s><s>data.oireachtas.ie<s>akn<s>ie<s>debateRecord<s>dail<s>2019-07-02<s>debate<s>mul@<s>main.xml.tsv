RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We must have considerably more time to discuss this matter because there are so many different aspects to it. There is an impact on farmers in this country and there is also significant detrimental impact on farmers and indigenous communities in Latin America.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am making a point about more time being needed due to the various aspects of the issue. On transport, Europe sending gas-guzzling cars to Latin America and countries there sending beef thousands of kilometres across the sea have significant climate implications.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That needs to be discussed. We need several Ministers to answer questions on this issue. It is not just an agricultural issue. We need to be able to ask questions of those Ministers.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I suggest that we drop Topical Issue matters tomorrow and provide an extra 50 minutes to discussion of this issue.
