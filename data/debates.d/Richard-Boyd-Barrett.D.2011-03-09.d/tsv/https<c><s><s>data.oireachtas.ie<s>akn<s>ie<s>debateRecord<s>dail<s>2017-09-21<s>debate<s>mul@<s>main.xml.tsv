RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the past hour, the media has been reporting that a 41 year old man with ongoing health problems was confirmed to have been found dead. He was homeless and sleeping in a tent with his partner in Bray over the weekend. This is the third rough sleeper found dead in the past number of weeks. I do not know the exact circumstances of this personal, human tragedy for this man and his family but it cannot be anything other than a shameful stain on this State that yet another person was living in a tent ill and was then found dead by his partner.This has happened time and again in recent weeks against the background of an absolutely shameful housing and homelessness emergency. I ask the Tánaiste to look urgently at the circumstances surrounding how this could possibly have happened. I must also ask her and her Government colleagues to reconsider the decision of the Government to vote against the Bill which proposes that we insert a right to housing into the Constitution. That vote will be taken in a short while. I simply cannot understand it. I listened with dismay to the Taoiseach yesterday afternoon and afterwards the Minister and the Minister of State explain, or, more correctly, fail to explain why the Government would not listen to the Simon Communities of Ireland, the Peter McVerry Trust, the Children's Rights Alliance and all of the non-governmental organisations dealing on the front line with people who find themselves in these tragic positions. They have stated we should insert a right to housing into the Constitution, but the Government plans to bury that proposal which was supported by 84% at the Constitutional Convention in 2014. It wishes to "further consider" the matter, but people cannot even agree on what committee should consider it. The Government indicates that it should be the finance committee; Deputy Barry Cowen has argued that it should be the housing committee, while Deputy Marc MacSharry has indicated that it should be the justice committee. It sounds to me like they want the issue to be buried in any committee instead of agreeing to the proposal and inserting a right to housing into the Constitution. It is shameful. I ask the Tánaiste to seriously reconsider this decision and send a signal from the Dáil today that human beings living in this State have a right to be housed in dignified, affordable accommodation and not be forced into the tragic circumstances in which so many find themselves.

The number of homeless people and the number of families and children in need of housing have gotten worse rather than better and the tragic deaths of people sleeping rough on the streets continue. Why would a proposal to enshrine the right to housing as a basic human right be referred to the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and Taoiseach three years after the Constitutional Convention said that it should be put in the Constitution? Perhaps the motive was revealed when I asked the Taoiseach yesterday why the Government is not supporting that proposal and he said he did not believe that everyone should be housed for free. What on earth was the Taoiseach talking about? Who is housed for free in this State? Does that statement not reveal a deep-seated prejudice against people who rely on social housing and would pay their rent but cannot get social housing because the State fails to provide it? Is that the real reason the problem is not being solved?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the seriousness of the housing and homeless crisis and the rather odd decision at the last minute of the Government to withdraw its amendment and vote outright against this Bill, I call for a vote by means other than electronic means.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are all absolutely delighted at Ibrahim Halawa's release. He has had four years of his life stolen from him without any evidence against him, something which became apparent when the trial began. This raises the question of what he was doing on trial in the first place and how he could have been incarcerated for four years. The greatest credit goes to his sisters and family for their tireless, relentless, heroic campaigning on his behalf and also to Ibrahim himself for enduring the hardship and suffering. I also commend the diplomatic staff who assisted him. There is no doubt about the hard work they did and it is to the credit of this House that there was unanimity in seeking Ibrahim's release. There are many issues which need to be addressed beyond this but throughout this case, there has been minority-led but a vocal and quite filthy racist campaign against Ibrahim Halawa, recycling many of the lies and justifications that the Egyptian regime itself might have used for his imprisonment. It is important for us to condemn those in strident terms. He is an Irish citizen. He is innocent. He is not a terrorist. He was just someone involved in a peaceful protest but whether he was Irish or not, regardless of his religious faith, colour or anything, no one should have been subjected to what he was subjected to by the Egyptian regime.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be honest, I am surprised by how tame the criticisms are and by the use of the word "excessive". Even according to the French President, Mr. Macron, this is genocidal violence. It is textbook ethnic cleansing, as the UN representative implied. Some 400,000 people have been driven out. The treatment of these people is reminiscent of scenes from "Apocalypse Now" or "The Deer Hunter". It is absolutely appalling. What is most shameful of all is that the winner of a Nobel Peace Prize, Aung San Suu Kyi, is apologising for this stuff. That is what she is doing. She accused the Rohingya of being Bengalis and, incredibly, of burning their own homes, thus giving licence to the military, which has been doing this for years, to genocidally attack and ethnically cleanse the Rohingya in vicious Islamophobic violence, at an enormous human cost. We should be absolutely forthright in demanding the stripping from Aung San Suu Kyi of the freedom of this city and of her Nobel Peace Prize. There should be absolutely forthright criticism and an end to any kind of co-operation with the Burmese regime, the Myanmar regime, while it continues with this activity.
