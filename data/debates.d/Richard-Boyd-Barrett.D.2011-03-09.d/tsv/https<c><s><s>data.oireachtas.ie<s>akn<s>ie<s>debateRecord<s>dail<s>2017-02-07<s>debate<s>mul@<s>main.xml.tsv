RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	People Before Profit and the Anti-Austerity Alliance put forward a Bill proposing an immediate referendum on repealing the eighth amendment. The Government and Fianna Fáil voted it down last year on the basis that they would allow the Citizens' Assembly to examine the issue. Our view was that delaying a referendum and batting this issue to the Citizens' Assembly was a completely wrong-headed, misguided decision at best and at worst a cynical delaying tactic that puts the lives and safety of many women at risk.At the weekend, we heard there had been 13,500 submissions to this small group of people. While I do not doubt their sincerity, they are a small, unrepresentative group of 100 people dealing with a deluge of submissions which they said were totally unhelpful and useless. For the most part, they were from the anti-abortion movement, which swamped the Citizens' Assembly with its perspective. This is where the Taoiseach's decision has led us. It is breathing life back into the anti-choice movement and allowing it to try to interfere with the deliberations on the issue. It is happening because the Taoiseach has abdicated responsibility for what should be a democratic decision made by all the people in the country in favour of 100 people. It is delaying the issue and consequently endangering the lives, health and safety of women, 3,000 of whom have travelled abroad for abortions since June. Is it not time to commit to having the referendum? If the Citizens' Assembly recommends having a referendum, is the Taoiseach prepared to hold the referendum in June or later in 2017?

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Taoiseach think it is ironic that Deputy Adams should attack People Before Profit in the name of jobs in the North when Sinn Féin, Fine Gael, the DUP and the Tories took specific action in supporting the Stormont House Agreement which condoned and set out the plan to axe 20,000 jobs in the public sector in the North? It was an austerity deal, an almost carbon copy of the one the EU-led troika inflicted on workers here and which was such a disaster. Sinn Féin also signed an agreement which will result in more job losses because it aims to privatise assets in the North and has agreed to social welfare cuts. Incredibly, when the North is in desperate need of revenues for its public services, jobs and infrastructure, it proposes to cut the corporate tax rate to 12.5% which will result in less taxes being paid and less money available for investment in jobs.Is that not deeply ironic? I suppose Deputy Adams is worried about the growth of People Before Profit in the North.
