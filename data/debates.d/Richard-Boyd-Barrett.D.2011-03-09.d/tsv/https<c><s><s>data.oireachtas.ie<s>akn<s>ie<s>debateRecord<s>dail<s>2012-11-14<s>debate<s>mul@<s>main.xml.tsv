RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Irish League of Credit Unions which represents 3 million members asked specifically in its submission on this legislation that there be no attempt to foreclose debate on the Credit Union Bill in the House. It has expressed extreme concern about the potential damage that may be done to the fundamental, voluntary and democratic ethos of credit unions. It is also deeply concerned that the imposition of legislation dealing with banks that wrecked the economy will have a detrimental effect on credit unions which bear no responsibility for the current economic crisis. Is it the case that the guillotine is being imposed in order to suit the timetable being demanded by the troika? If that is the case, it is unacceptable. I ask the Taoiseach to lift the guillotine and allow for a full debate on this important legislation which will affects millions of citizens.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is what has been proposed on the Order of Business.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does that mean the guillotine will be lifted?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is truly incredible that it is 20 years since the terrible and tragic circumstances of the X case, which led to an enormous public outcry about the Supreme Court judgment and to referendums that concluded that abortion must be allowed where there is a threat to the life of the mother. Twenty years on, after nothing but political cowardice and dithering, we have been led to a situation in which tragic and terrible circumstances have caught up with us and forced us to recognise the abysmal failure and political cowardice of successive Governments. The late Ms Savita Halappanavar, a 31-year-old woman, was the victim of that political failure and cowardice. A woman in agony, begging for a termination of her pregnancy in order that she could be treated and possibly have her life saved, was denied such a procedure, according to the reports, because of the law that successive Governments have refused to change despite the will of the people and despite the terrible circumstances of the X case 20 years ago. This is a tragedy resulting from political failure and cowardice. Will the Minister do something about this to ensure that it never happens again, that there is justice for the late Ms Halappanavar's family and that there is an investigation that will establish how this awful tragedy could have happened?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Given the terrible circumstances surrounding the death of Savita, the Minister's response is grossly inadequate and utterly fails to acknowledge his responsibility and the responsibility of the Government to act to ensure there could be no question of a woman's life being threatened because she could not receive the medical treatment she needed because of the current legal situation in this country. The Minister seems to imply there is no impediment in law to a woman receiving necessary treatment in these circumstances, but there is. At the very least, it is a grey area and we know that in this case, a woman begged, in agony, for treatment that could have saved her life but was denied it because the medical practitioner believed it could not be done within the law. The Minister must act and must take responsibility.
