RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to take up where Deputy Doherty left off. I do not quite understand this business that we cannot ask certain questions. I am looking at the agenda-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I will. The Minister is very entertaining and I enjoy these encounters.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	He is a master at this. The Minister will attend two meetings for which we have the agenda and it seems entirely legitimate to ask questions about both meetings in advance of them. The idea that there is some kind of iron wall between the Thursday and the Friday meetings does not make sense to me. On Thursday, at 10.30 a.m. there will be a macro economic dialogue at political level. That seems to be pretty open as to what can be discussed in terms of the overall economic situation in Europe and how we fit into that. We will then have the Eurogroup meeting and then there will be the ECOFIN meeting with the agenda items he has gone through and which he clearly wants to focus on, so that we do not discuss the other stuff. Even in terms of the ECOFIN meeting, the main agenda item which will be discussed for ten or 12 hours is banking union.Is the Minister telling us that it is not relevant to a discussion on banking union to discuss the retroactive recapitalisation of banks? I put it to the Minister that it is absolutely legitimate to raise it in that context because in so far as this issue has been presented to us, the whole narrative has been that if we sort out banking union, if we make progress towards banking union, then we will get some retroactive recapitalisation support for our banks which will lessen our debt burden. I do not see why the Minister cannot raise it in the context of discussing the progress on banking union which he is reporting. If he cannot do it there I certainly do not see why he cannot discuss it in a macro economic dialogue at political level. I ask him to clarify why he could not raise it in one or other of those contexts.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I remind the Minister that time is short and he is giving an interesting account but I am asking him a specific question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Minister be at the Eurogroup meeting?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With all due respect, Chairman-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	With all due respect I do not give a hoot about their protocols if they are trying to close off discussions-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister is telling us that issues of vital interest to this country cannot be raised at a two-day series of meetings on what is happening in the European economy. I do not accept that. It seems we have to be such good boys and girls that we cannot breach protocol and we cannot raise issues of vital interest to us. I specifically asked the Minister why, in the context-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----of a discussion on banking union can he not raise the issue of retrospective recapitalisation of Irish banks, another word for a bit of debt write-down. Why can he not do so?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It seems we are such good boys that we cannot raise the issues that matter to us. We are allowed ask the Minister about the discussions at the Eurogroup meeting where he will give the reports. He indicated that the different countries will give their reports. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister said that at the Eurogroup meeting different countries will report on what is happening in each country and there will be brief discussions. Is that correct?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has made his position clear.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Doherty has made the point that we were told the same at our meeting with the troika, that it was very unlikely we would get it. That is what we were told. To my mind, that is a very big problem for us. With the mountain of debt we have, the so-called exit from the bailout is a mirage. I ask the Minister for clarification. I ask if I am correct in assuming that under the fiscal treaty, as soon as we exit this programme, we have to start to move towards the debt and deficit reduction targets of the fiscal treaty and these are pretty stringent.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On which prediction have I been proved wrong?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Excuse me, Minister.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was not a prediction. I advocated that we default. By the way, I still advocate that we default on debts that are not ours because the Minister will not even ask these people for the reduction. It is entirely legitimate when the Minister is going to a meeting with European finance Ministers for us to ask if he is going to raise the issue of the debt burden around our neck and ask for some relief. What the Minister has made absolutely clear in his very masterful, clever way of trying to talk down the issue, is that he is not going to ask for that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I disagree. He has said it is not allowed, that it is not on the agenda, therefore, we cannot raise it. In my view it is entirely legitimate, in the context of our exit from the bailout, which the Minister is trumpeting, to ask him to clarify what obligations we will be under from EU treaties and EU rules, when we exit the bailout.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I ask the Minister to clarify it.
