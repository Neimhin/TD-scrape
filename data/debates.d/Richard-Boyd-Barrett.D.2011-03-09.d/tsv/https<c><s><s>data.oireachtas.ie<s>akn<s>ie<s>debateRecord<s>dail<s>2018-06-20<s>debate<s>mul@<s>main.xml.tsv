RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it not time to admit that Rebuilding Ireland is failing disastrously? Wexford and Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Councils which are not controlled by the left have both passed motions to the effect that Rebuilding Ireland is failing. The reliance on the private sector has been exposed. The Minister's figures for private sector completions are not accurate. There is far less coming from that sector than the Minister had hoped. The delivery of public housing is pathetic. Last year 1,058 local authority houses were delivered and the target next year is 5,900. Only God knows if it will be met, but I would say it is unlikely. It is just not good enough. It is not working. Is it not time, therefore, to take a different approach and have an emergency programme of public and affordable housing on our own land?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In my area, there is nothing happening in Shanganagh. We have been demanding for about five years that public and affordable housing be built there. There has still not been a sod turned. There is also nothing happening in St. Michael's Estate, on the Oscar Traynor Road site or in Clonburris. People have been calling for public housing for years on all of these big sites but there is still nothing happening. Part of the problem is the affordable housing issue, the Minister's failure to define what that is and to guarantee that money will be made available to make affordable housing genuinely affordable. I did not understand the Minister's earlier answer. Is the affordable housing on these schemes going to be affordable based on income or is it going to be linked to the market? If it is going to be linked to the market, it is not going to be affordable, certainly not in my area. Shanganagh cannot move forward until the council there knows that the Minister is going to provide the funds to make that genuinely affordable. If he is not going to do that, then we should just build council houses and stop messing around with all of these things that he has failed to define.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Nothing is happening in my area. I mentioned four other sites around Dublin where nothing is happening on public land. Do not tell me that is because I do not want to see success. I can see that nothing is happening in Shanganagh, in Cherrywood, on the Oscar Traynor Road site, in Clonburris or in St. Michael's Estate. We can go through the list. What the Minister just said about affordability is very worrying. It is about the income level at which a person can apply for an affordable house, but it also raises the question of the point in applying for an affordable house that is not affordable. Average house prices in my area are now €600,000. Private developers are selling the 10% of so-called social housing back to the local authority and are looking for prices of up to €450,000. That is not affordable. Is affordable going to be affordable and will local authorities be guaranteed that money will be made available so that affordable housing on public land will be affordable? If that is not going to be the case, we need to build council housing on those sites. There is not enough money. There is €1.14 billion in capital spending for social housing this year. According to the Minister's targets, that is going to deliver 5,900 houses. It is not enough. We need a minimum of 10,000 council houses a year. The budget is going to have to be doubled to get close to addressing the extent of the housing crisis and to begin to make an impact on the figure of 144,000 on the housing lists.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Ireland's greatest revolutionary and socialist James Connolly believed passionately in uniting the country, not by trying to square the circle of green and orange tribal politics or, for that matter, scoring political points off others in the political debate, as we have heard in the last few comments made by Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party. He tried to find the social and economic issues that might practically unite people and advance a radical social and economic agenda that could break down sectarian divisions.The issue that presents itself very much at the moment in the aftermath of the referendum to repeal the eighth is the demand which is across the communities in the North - Catholic and Protestant, progressive people, young people - demanding the decriminalisation of abortion in the North. The situation persists and has resulted in, for example, the shocking prosecution of a 21 year old young woman for taking an abortion pill when she was reported by her house mates. She had taken that pill because she could not afford to go to Britain for an abortion. It is criminal for her to have an abortion in the North even though it is not in England or Wales. It seems to me that is the thing we should be advancing if we want to unite people across the sectarian divide and North and South. I appeal to the Taoiseach to lobby Prime Minister May directly on this matter and call on her to decriminalise abortion in the North. I attended a fantastic demonstration in the North on Saturday of the week before last. Bus loads came from Together for Yes down here. We were involved in organising them. Thousands of people were in Belfast - Catholics and Protestants - on the streets saying they want rights for women and they want abortion rights in the North. Why does the Taoiseach not align with them and pressure Prime Minister May to decriminalise abortion in the North? That would be a step towards a united Ireland.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about abortion?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to ask about child mental health services, which have been raised by Deputy Howlin. I think the Taoiseach needs to say something about this serious matter. Child psychiatrists are resigning because they believe child psychiatric services are "untenable and unsafe". This problem is not isolated to Wexford. I will not go into individual cases. I am aware of other areas where exactly the same thing is happening. The numbers of child psychiatrists and mental health teams are not adequate. There are not enough staff, resources and primary care services. Too many people are being referred to the psychiatrists. Essentially, they are under pressure to prescribe drugs. If they do not want to do that because their clinical judgment is that they should not do so, they get into trouble with managers who just want to tick boxes. That is what is going on. The Taoiseach needs to say that child psychiatrists and specialists in this area should act on their clinical judgment and should do what they believe is best in their clinical judgment. Managers should not be forcing them to do things they do not consider right to do. It is very important to send out that message. If we are going to ensure these services are safe, tenable and of the standard necessary to do what they are supposed to do for young and vulnerable people, we need to ensure primary care services and mental health teams are properly resourced.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Tearing children away from their parents and incarcerating them in cages is, as we all understand, barbaric and beyond the Pale. It crosses every line of human rights and civilised behaviour imaginable. What will we do about a president like Trump who is willing to do this to children and then defend it? Like me, the Tánaiste probably heard spokespeople on the radio defending Trump's actions, blaming the parents and saying that, although it was unfortunate, it had to be done to deter these terrible people from entering the United States illegally. It was shocking. When people's morality or values get twisted to the point of being willing to justify this kind of abuse against children, they are crossing normal lines. This is not just a polite difference of political opinion. Something has to be done about it. Words of condemnation are welcome but, frankly, we know that they mean nothing to Trump. Trump is completely immune to criticism. He is willing to go to any length. It does not bother him in the least that his racist policies directed against immigrants - Muslims, Mexicans and so on - have stoked up the fascist far right in the United States and across the world. I watched a programme on Netflix during the week where the neo-Nazis who organised the Charlottesville horrors said openly that Trump had given them a new confidence to organise on a national scale and had given credibility to their neo-Nazi ideas. They are delighted with him. When we start making comparisons with the 1930s, it is not left-wing scaremongering. It is the reality, and one that is developing across Europe. The far right in Europe is encouraged by the sorts of action that Trump is taking. There is a point at which normal diplomatic discourse, debate, niceties and politeness do not work and one must take a stand. Those of us who oppose racism, the far right, fascism and this barbaric treatment of children must say that we will do something about it because what we are facing in this instance is different. We must confront that point. It is fantastic that, notwithstanding all of our political differences, no political party in this Parliament has gone down the race road or played the race card, but let us go further and do something about this. That something is to make it clear that President Trump and people who are a party to this barbaric policy are not welcome in our country while they continue with that policy. The Taoiseach said that we had to engage, as if this was a case of normal political differences. It is not. Frankly, what he said smacked of double standards. I have asked the Tánaiste to meet the elected representatives in Gaza, but he will not do it. What have they done that Trump has not? In fact, what Trump is doing is worse, but as far as the Tánaiste and Taoiseach are concerned, it is okay to boycott the elected representatives of the Parliament in Gaza. The Tánaiste will say that it is a difficult and complicated situation, mention Israel and so on. He can give all the reasons he likes, but the Government is treating them differently from how it is treating Trump even though what he is doing is far worse and more dangerous. Despite that, we continue to extend the normal diplomatic niceties to a person who is doing these barbaric and horrific things to young people and who is stirring up the most dangerous political forces that we have seen since the horrors of the 1930s and all that followed from them. I am saying in all seriousness that this is different and, therefore, actions must follow. We should withdraw the invitation to Trump and consider other actions that would have an impact and make it clear that this is not just a polite difference of opinion, but that we are horrified and unwilling to stand idly by while these horrific, racist policies directed at immigrants, most of all children, are allowed by the international community to continue.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about us?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It was interesting that in his reference to other views on the economy, Deputy Michael McGrath left out the socialist left.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Minister. It was telling and will, sadly, be reflected in the media debate in the run-up to the budget. Certain serious debates take place and they are held among the people who accept the fiscal rules, which we alone reject. As such, the debate will be about the different ways we can operate inside the fiscal rules. After the banking crash, Nyberg pointed rightly to the need to challenge the cosy consensus and to listen to contrarians. Of course, we are back to not listening to contrarians and failing to take seriously the points they are making. I issue that as a serious warning. The Minister might not agree with us, but he should listen to some of the points we are making.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The media should take on board some of the points we are making too because we have led the way on important debates, including, for example, the issue of corporate tax avoidance. Whatever the Minister might think about our policies in that regard, it is a serious problem. Even mainstream economists are saying the distorting effects on our economy of profit shifting by multinationals are obvious to see. Those effects are such that we have had to create a new measure of the economy, namely GNI*, which we have because we cannot trust the GDP or GNP figures. Perhaps the socialist left has a point. I suggest a few other things should be considered. The cosy consensus is to be prudent but, as Deputy Murphy said, "prudence" in that context means another reason to keep public spending to a minimum. If it goes over the top, there might be something called "overheating", which Deputy Michael McGrath says we must watch out for. Where are the signs of overheating? Is there rampant wage inflation? There is not. That is usually a sign of an overheating economy. In fact, even under the unravelling of the austerity cuts, wages will still not have reached the levels they were at before the crash in 2008 by the end of the current wage agreement. There is no sign of rampant wage inflation. Where, then, is this overheating? I do not mean there are no dangers in the economy. Obviously, there are. They are the same dangers to which we have been pointing all along and the same dangers which preceded the last crash. The first is the tax haven model and its distorting effects, which I have already mentioned. It creates a vulnerability in our economy that if even one of these big firms pulled out, there would be serious trouble. That is not a sustainable model. We have to transition away from it quickly and before it backfires very badly. One area in which the economy is overheating is the property sector. Where have we heard that before? The Government is quite happy to be prudent when it comes to the public investment and spending we need in areas like housing, infrastructure and health which would actually create buffers for our economy when the cycle comes around. Any notion, by the way, that there will be no bust in the future is fantasy. It will come and the only question is when it will happen. The place there is evidence of overheating is, of course, the property sector yet there is no talk by the Minister of prudence there. In fact, the Government's policies are actively facilitating speculation by property developers. The Government handed them the property sector via NAMA and is now doing absolutely nothing to stop the rampant and blatant speculation which is driving up the cost of accommodation.If anything will create conditions for overheating of wage demands, it is that, but it is also what is driving the necessary labour force out of the country. The young people, who we need to restore the infrastructure, services and housing in the country, are leaving because the Minister has allowed property speculators to become rampant again - the very thing that led to the last crash.
