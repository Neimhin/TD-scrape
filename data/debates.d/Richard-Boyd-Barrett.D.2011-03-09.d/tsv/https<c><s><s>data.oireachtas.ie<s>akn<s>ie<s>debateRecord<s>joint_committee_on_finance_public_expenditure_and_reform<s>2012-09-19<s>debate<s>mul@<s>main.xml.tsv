RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the delegation for the extremely illuminating explanation of what is going on in the credit unions and how the legislation will have an effect.  I have learned much from it, which I appreciate.  I would also like to echo the general commendation that people have given the credit union movement for what it does as a model of providing financial services to the community and ordinary people who would sometimes find it difficult to access such services otherwise.  Perhaps the positive example is highlighted even more by the current mess we are in.  I do not know if it is going too far to say that if the banking system as a whole operated on the basis on which the credit union movement operates, with its ethos and focus, we would not be in this mess in the first place.  Perhaps our policy makers should consider that fact.  The concerns have been explained very well, and all the points made are utterly reasonable.  The delegation will find widespread support here, as has been indicated, for efforts to defend the core ethos of credit unions, as well as their volunteer and democratic basis.  The witnesses seem to see this as being threatened by the current draft legislation.  The key concerns seem to be the effects of term limits, prohibitions on board members and omissions in a number of key areas.  The elements include not facilitating electronic fund transfers and shared services and the need for legislation to be amended in order for credit unions to be able to lend to Government-backed projects and schemes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In that regard, if the concerns are not taken on board, is there a real threat to the credit union movement?  Given how reasonable the concerns are and how they revolve around the core ethos of the credit union movement, which has been an example of how to run financial services, why on earth would anybody propose legislation that could possibly damage it or have an adverse effect?  That is what I cannot understand.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They may know more than we do because they have been through the process.  Perhaps they are being a bit coy in telling us what the difficulty is.  They are the people running the credit union movement and having expressed these concerns, they have said the concerns were not adequately taken on board in the draft legislation.  I am wondering what the problem is, or is it anticipated there will be a problem?  Is there confidence that having had Government and Opposition representatives in here nodding and being positive towards the issues raised, it will be a straightforward process?  Is it the case that people were just not listening properly?  Will we have a battle on our hands or is this just a straightforward case of making the points to the Government and putting in amendments to the legislation?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that.  I am getting the vibe in the committee-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am wondering if the vibes match the reality that we are confronting.  If the concerns were not taken on board in the drafting of the legislation, what possible objections could anybody have to the delegation's requests?  I do not understand why it cannot be a straightforward matter.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I hope so.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I understand that perfectly, and I do not wish to pre-judge this process.  If everything turns out as positively as it sounds in the committee, we will be fine.  In some legislation we can experience sharp differences of opinion about what is good for certain areas.  I am convinced by what the Irish League of Credit Unions has said about what is needed in this legislation to protect the ethos of the credit unions.  The ILCU has much credibility because it has run such an exemplary organisation in the midst of this disastrous financial crisis when other financial institutions failed so miserably.We must take what they are saying extremely seriously. Do the delegates anticipate difficulties in having their concerns reflected? If so, why will there be such a difficulty?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Irish League of Credit Unions did not respond to one aspect of my question.  Perhaps they are being cautious in providing answers.  How serious will the problem be for credit unions if their concerns are not reflected in the final legislation and it is not amended to meet them?
