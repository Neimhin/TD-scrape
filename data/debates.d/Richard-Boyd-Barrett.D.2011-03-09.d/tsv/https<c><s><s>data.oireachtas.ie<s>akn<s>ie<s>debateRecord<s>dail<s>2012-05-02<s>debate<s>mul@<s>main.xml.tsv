RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Government and the Taoiseach have shown great urgency in ramming through legislation to impose austerity and cuts on working people in this country.  With his new best pals in Fianna Fáil, he is showing great energy and enthusiasm in pushing through the austerity treaty.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Where is his energy and urgency when it comes to protecting worker's rights in this country?  Over the past year we have seen a litany of cases where workers in Jane Norman, La Senza, Lagan Brick, Vita Cortex, Game and Connolly Shoes in my constituency have been treated with despicable contempt by rogue employers.  The latest victim of rogue employers and the Government failure to protect workers are 110 workers in Irish Cement working in counties Limerick and Meath.  These workers have for three decades not been involved in any industrial action but were forced out on strike on 3 April because Irish Cement has refused to pay a Labour Court-recommended set of bonuses to the workers.  This is despite the fact the workers agreed to a rationalisation programme three years ago, cut 33% of their staff and raised productivity by 40%.What is positively disturbing about Irish Cement's failure to pay these workers the money it owes them is that the parent company of Irish Cement is Cement Roadstone Holdings, CRH, one of the largest building materials companies in the world-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----one of the biggest companies in the country and one of the most profitable.  Last year CRH boosted its profits by 33% to nearly €750 million-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	-----and its CEO, Mr. Myles Lee, was paid €2.4 million in salary and bonuses.  A third of that, his salary alone, would pay the workers the moneys they are owed.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach condemn Irish Cement and CRH for their despicable treatment of these workers and tell them to pay the money these workers are owed, as the Labour Court has recommended?  Will he pull in the CEO of CRH and Irish Cement and point out to them that they have benefited from €220 million in free profits given to them by this State in carbon credits, a scandal in itself?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As the Taoiseach of the country, will he insist those workers are paid and allowed to return to work, where they want to be?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	You should.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	My point was that the Taoiseach shows great urgency and energy when it comes to protecting the interests of bankers, bondholders, financiers and the super-wealthy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Can he show the same energy, enthusiasm and urgency when it comes to protecting the rights of workers which are being trampled on in a whole series of cases by rogue and unscrupulous employers?  I am asking a very specific question in this case, where we are talking about one of the biggest companies in the State, which has been a huge beneficiary of State support, including a big portion of €220 million in windfall profits from the carbon allocations regime - free profits - and where the CEO was on €2.7 million a year, yet the company will not pay workers moneys owed to them which the Labour Court has recommended should be paid to them.  Those workers have been forced to march around outside those plants for the past three weeks when they want to go back to work.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Will the Taoiseach condemn CRH and Irish Cement's failure to do what the Labour Court has recommended and pay these workers the money?  Will he directly contact Irish Cement and CRH and point out to them that they are beneficiaries of State subsidies and, therefore, he is invoking his authority as Taoiseach and demanding that they pay those workers the moneys owed, and show a bit of backbone and urgency when it comes to protecting the workers of this country, whose rights are being trampled on?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach intervened.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The citizens of the country will have been scandalised again today to find that top management and executives in banks bailed out and financed by the public-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Vast numbers of them are earning in excess of €100,000 and €200,000 per year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have examined the draft of the fiscal responsibility Bill.  I am surprised there is nothing in it relating to remuneration of the top managers and executives.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Are further amendments proposed to the fiscal responsibility Bill?  Will there be another Bill to deal with this matter and to rein in the obscene salaries of top executives and managers in our banks.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	In the year since the Government came to office we have had a litany of cases in which workers were treated in a disgraceful fashion by rogue and unscrupulous employers.  Workers at Jane Norman have still not secured justice, while workers in Vita Cortex, La Senza, Lagan Brick and Game were forced to occupy their places of employment to bring their cases to the attention of members of the public and the Government and secure some justice.  More recently, as I noted earlier, we had the disgraceful treatment of Irish Cement workers by one of the largest and most profitable companies in the country.  Perhaps the lack of concern shown on that issue is related to the close relations Irish Cement has always enjoyed with the political establishment, going back to the days when Cement Roadstone organised handouts for Charles Haughey and his family.I find it amazing that this Government, which has shown so much enthusiasm, energy and vigour in protecting the interests of bankers, bondholders and the super-wealthy in this country and in Europe, shows no enthusiasm for and a complete disinterest in the plight of workers who have been treated in a despicable fashion.  Since the La Senza and Vita Cortex disputes began, Deputies on this side have been calling on it to introduce legislation to protect workers from this type of despicable treatment.  While we saw crocodile tears and heard words of concern, we did not see any concrete action that would prevent a recurrence of such cases.  It should be clear to the Government at this stage that certain employers, particularly large multinational companies, are taking advantage of the climate of recession to do things to workers they would not have got away with in other circumstances.  What will the Government do about this?Sinn Féin accepts that its Bill addresses only some aspects of employee protection.  Nevertheless, the legislation should be supported in so far as it extends the minimum notice requirements when employers make workers redundant and requires the Employment Appeals Tribunal and Labour Court to respond more quickly to workers who are made redundant.  We also need a shift in gear from the Government.  It must show a political will to address the grievances of workers who are being treated in a despicable fashion.  I hope it will respond.
