RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	An African proverb goes "The lion roared and it gave birth to a mouse." That pretty much sums up this referendum proposal. The roaring lion was the voices of the people calling for a democratic revolution which the Government had promised and the mouse is a referendum about changing the age at which somebody can run for President. It is almost not worth dignifying the Bill with a serious debate on the proposal made. If it turns up on the ballot paper, with a heavy heart and thinking about what we could be doing for young people and other issues more urgent for society, I will probably put my "X" in the box in favour, but it is crass tokenism of the worst sort. I understand that when the Constitutional Convention asked for submissions to help it to prioritise its agenda, it was told that, unsurprisingly, the most important issues were economic, social and cultural rights - the things that affect people immediately. Given the litany of tragedies suffered by pregnant women in difficult pregnancies, other things might have been better subjects of a referendum such as a woman's right to choose. Instead we have this piece of tokenism. I wish to comment on the nod to youth and young people implied in the Bill. We need to do things urgently for young people, but this is not it. If the Bill passes, one will be able to run for President at 21 years, but if a person is under 26 and has not got a job, his or her social welfare entitlement has been cut to €100. How is somebody under 26 years who is not living at home and cannot find a job going to run a presidential campaign? They cannot even put a roof over their heads on €100 per week. A person aged under 26 years who is not in employment and cannot live at home is homeless by definition. Such persons cannot afford to pay rent and the rent supplement they receive will not get them within a stone's throw of being able to put a roof over their heads. That is why young people are on the streets. Why are we not doing something about this? We have had a children's rights referendum and have a Minister with special responsibility for children, but the situation for young people with mental health problems is diabolical. On 20 occasions in the past five or six weeks I have pressed for a Topical Issue debate on the chronic lack of resources, support and beds for young people with mental health problems or who are suicidal. I cannot have a debate on it, however, while we are having a referendum about which nobody really cares. We have the highest rate of suicide in the European Union among young women and the second highest rate for young men, a rate which has spiked dramatically in the past while. Professor Fiona McNicholas recently protested that there was a deluge of young people with mental health problems who had to be put in beds in accident and emergency departments, which blocked up such departments.  We do not have enough psychologists and a report issued in the past week stated that, in Cork alone, 1,000 people were waiting to see social workers. Some 200 are serious, urgent cases involving suicidal ideation and other problems, but there is a chronic lack of resources to provide for them.The Children's Rights Alliance published a report today in which it has shown that the Government has failed in this area and it has given it an "E" grade in terms of the provision of mental health services for our young people. It is a disaster. Child poverty stands at 28%. It is a joke. What has been put forward is a nauseating tokenism when we should be dealing with the real issues that affect our young people.

RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It says everything about this issue and the water charges debacle that the Minister, who was the chief architect of this complete fiasco, the former Minister, Phil Hogan, was then rewarded by getting what is probably the most senior political position in Europe that this State can confer on an individual. Before he left office this Minister who was rewarded for that fiasco, was busy having secret unminuted meetings with Irish Water to plan the debacle and the fiasco that has ensued. The Government is not concerned, apparently, about these unminuted meetings when they led, by anybody's definition, to a disaster and a fiasco That says it all. Why were the meetings not minuted? What were they discussing?What they were discussing was how they could obfuscate, spin and lie about the reality of water charges and Irish Water to undermine, defeat and divide the opposition that was already developing and has since assumed massive proportions. They were discussing how they could undermine the opposition, mass protests and boycott that were coming down the line as people took to the streets in unprecedented numbers. We also saw what the meetings were about in the bizarre contribution made by Deputy Rabbitte in which he attempted to intimidate RTE. It was interesting that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, made a special appearance for Deputy Rabbitte's contribution and two journalists miraculously appeared in an otherwise empty Press Gallery, having clearly been tipped off by Deputy Rabbitte that he was about to make a statement on RTE. His speech was a deliberate attempt to intimidate the public broadcaster. Similarly, Deputy O'Donovan played the rural-urban divide in his effort to obfuscate and blur the key issue. Attempts have been made to tarnish the anti-water charges protest movement through associations with violence. The Government is doing everything to obfuscate but the issue is simple - it is not fair to charge a millionaire, a pensioner, a person in receipt of a welfare payment of €188 per week and a worker on the minimum wage the same amount to access a basic human right. Under United Nations conventions, water is a basic human right and it is unfair and fundamentally unjust to charge everyone the same to access it. People know it is wrong that the amount of money a person has should dictate whether he or she has access to a basic human right. They also know from their experience of bin charges and so forth that the Government is lying when it states the charges will stay low. The charge will rocket and any waivers or concessions given now will disappear, just as happened in the past. People know, as Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Labour Party knew at the time, that when charges are introduced, privatisation follows, as it did in the case of bin charges. Rather than acknowledging the legitimate right of people to oppose water charges, the Government wants to distract from the substantive issues and instead divide, undermine and besmirch the overwhelming opposition to water charges. All its plans and spin will not succeed because the rebellion against water charges will continue and the nationwide boycott will prevail.
