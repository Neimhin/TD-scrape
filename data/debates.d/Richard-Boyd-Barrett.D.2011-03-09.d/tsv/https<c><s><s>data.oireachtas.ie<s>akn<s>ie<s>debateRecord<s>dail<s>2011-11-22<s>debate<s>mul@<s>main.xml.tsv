RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	On a point of order, although the Member who asked the question is not present, Members who are present have tabled questions that may not be reached.  Can I ask that Members simply note the Minister's response and move on?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Perhaps Deputy O'Dea might consider some of the other Members who have questions on the Order Paper.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I have a later question that will not be reached, I will try to connect it to this question on the issue of retaining jobs as well as creating them.  Given they handed him a letter, the Minister will be familiar with the Connolly Shoes workers in Dun Laoghaire who were sacked, having been 17 months on strike, and who have now been found by the Employment Appeals Tribunal to have been unfairly dismissed.  One of the longest serving employees, Mr. John Mulpeter, after 38 years service has been sacked unfairly and will walk away with only €1,600 because the legislation allows employers to do this to people — it allows them to essentially concoct excuses to sack workers so they do not have to pay them off properly in terms of redundancy and pensions.  Legislation needs to be urgently brought in to prevent unscrupulous employers from sacking workers to avoid paying them moneys they are owed and their proper entitlements.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The legislation is inadequate — that is the point.  He still walks away with virtually nothing even though the finding was in his favour.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does starving children help to incentivise work?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is how the Taoiseach should do it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	From different angles.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Martin should know we also have questions to ask.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I dispute strongly the Taoiseach's suggestion that all of the questions in this group are the same.  My questions, most of which he has not answered, are on a different planet from Deputy Martin's.  The Deputy is much more on the Taoiseach's planet than ours.  The direction from which our questions are coming is different.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Planet Reality.  I note the Minister cannot resist having a go whenever I speak.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We all know why that is.I asked the Taoiseach 12 specific questions, but the only one he sort of answered was the first.  I asked him whether he had raised the issue of unemployment with Chancellor Merkel and what response she gave.  He did not tell us what her response was.  This is indicative of all the answers and what is fast developing into the most serious economic crisis since the 1930s, in that there are vagaries.  We want to know specifically what Chancellor Merkel stated she would do about the burgeoning unemployment crisis across Europe.Did the Taoiseach raise the question of the gross immorality and the damaging economic consequences of Ireland being forced to repay senior bondholders in full, specifically the €3 billion per year in respect of the toxic Anglo Irish Bank and its bondholders?  What did Chancellor Merkel say about this?Did the Taoiseach ask the Chancellor about the downward projection of growth rates in Europe, including in Ireland, as predicted by all serious analysts?  What did she say in response?  Did she have anything to say about the fact that, after two years of austerity measures, it was increasingly clear — there is consensus across all serious analyses — that austerity was deepening the economic crisis and careering us towards recession?  Was there any discussion of this point of view which is widely held as opposed to a view articulated by socialists alone?When the Taoiseach asked whether we had alternatives, did he discuss a recent conference held in Iceland at which the IMF had admitted that Iceland had done it right and that we had done the wrong thing?  Iceland let the banks fail, strengthened as opposed to cutting welfare payments and imposed capital controls.  It is now back in the bond markets.  Krugman and Stiglitz stated what Iceland had done was right, whereas what Ireland and other countries had done was wrong.  Did the Taoiseach discuss a radically different alternative, one that has proved itself viable, and the fact that the Icelandic economy was recovering because it had repudiated the debts of bondholders and speculators, something he, Chancellor Merkel, the troika and all the rest running the European Union had refused to do, even though their strategy was demonstrably failing?Did the Taoiseach discuss the deep concerns felt across Europe about democratically elected leaders being pushed out of office in Italy and Greece and replaced by two people who were former members of the board of Goldman Sachs and whose main qualification was that they had been insiders in the banking and financial system?  People believe this to be a serious subversion of democracy in Europe at the behest of the markets.What treaty changes does Chancellor Merkel envisage?  Is she asking for tax harmonisation, less democracy in member states, more dictatorship by the European Central Bank and the European Commission and more penalties and sanctions to be imposed on states that refuse to submit to austerity at the behest of the markets?  Those are the questions I asked.  Most of them were not answered and perhaps the Taoiseach can answer them and comment on the issue of Iceland.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Was this the mandate that the Government would not cut child benefit or give a cent to the banks?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach answered that question.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What was her response?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I thank the Taoiseach for his more specific answers to the questions.  What did Chancellor Merkel say on the promissory note and what point did the Taoiseach make on it given it is such a huge burden and the €3 billion per year could be invested in the economy?  Did she not recognise the utter injustice of that and our case for relief on that question?  The Taoiseach did not answer the question on its relationship to the contraction of growth in the European economy.  Did either the Taoiseach or the Chancellor acknowledge the growing consensus that austerity is crippling growth in the European economy?  It is not improving the situation or improving competitiveness, it is making things worse.  Did the Taoiseach discuss the contrasting fate of Iceland with that of the countries that are pursuing the troika agenda?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have had my hand up since the beginning of the Order of Business.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Does the Government propose to amend the Finance (No. 2) Act 2011?  I am not sure if it was the intention that the 0.6% levy would turn into 10% of the pensions paid to certain workers, such as the pensioners of Tara mines.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is it likely that the legislation will come before the House for amendment in light of these possibly unintended consequences?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	If the Ceann Comhairle will allow me to briefly raise a second matter, I ask the Taoiseach to allow statements on a world historic event that is both terrible and important, namely, the movements for democracy that are being crushed in Egypt and Syria.  Can we have an opportunity to debate these matters?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I attempted to do so but was refused.
