RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Minister has not quite painted a rosy picture, but he has certainly sought to present an optimistic view.  I accept that it is probably his job to do so.  However, that optimism is not borne out by reality either in this country or in the wider European economy.  He pointed to the very modest growth of 0.7% last year before acknowledging that the decline in this growth which became evident at the end of last year is likely to continue.  All serious projections - not just the prophets of doom - indicate that economic growth in this country and in Europe, on which we are depending, is contracting.  That is not a particularly rosy prospect.The Minister points to the moderation in the decline in investment.  That decline could not but moderate in a context in which investment had collapsed by some 70% since 2008.  If we had not seen such a moderation, we would truly have been on the road to utter disaster.  It is not a basis for much optimism given that we went off the cliff after 2008.  The Minister refers to an expected strengthening of the economy from 2013 onward.  The same view has been expressed by the Fiscal Advisory Council, whose representatives I intend to interrogate on this point at tomorrow's meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform.  On what basis are these forecasts being made, given that growth is contracting throughout Europe, with that contraction now spreading even into Germany?  The Netherlands cannot bear the possibility of imposing austerity because of the damage it will do to growth.  We learned today that the British economy, our largest trading partner, has dipped again.In these circumstances there seems little basis for the Fiscal Advisory Council or anybody else predicting that growth will strengthen in 2013.  On the previous occasion that representatives of the council attended a meeting of the finance committee and I asked them this question, they responded that their projections for growth are based on historical models.  I did not get an opportunity to ask what those models might be.  Are they referring to precedents from the 1920s and 1930s or to historical models taken from economics textbooks, most of which could be torn up with a reasonable degree of justification given their failure to comprehend the dynamics of what has happened to the economy in recent decades?  I do not seek to be a prophet of doom but, given the actual figures, I simply do not find the projections for the short to medium term, with talk of an improvement in 2013, credible.  The only caveat the Minister applied to his prediction was an acknowledgement of considerable risk.  That is a massive understatement.The issue of job creation is rightly a key focus for the Government and, in a certain sense, a test of all of this.  The reality, however, is that the strategy of imposing austerity and essentially sacrificing the domestic economy in the hope that by ratcheting down costs we will increase competitiveness and export our way out of the mess, has been entirely unsuccessful.  The employment figures show that whatever is being gained on the swings is being lost on the roundabouts, with no movement on the net level of unemployment.  In fact, the figures are flattered hugely by the fact that tens of thousands of people have left the country in the past two years.  Our unemployment figures would be utterly catastrophic were it not for emigration.  We have lost more on the roundabouts than we have gained on the swings under this strategy when one includes the numbers forced out of the country as a result of the collapse of the domestic economy as against any gains to which the Government may point in terms of luring foreign direct investment.The reason it is so important to emphasise this reality, and particularly so at the moment, is the Minister's reference to the so-called stability treaty as being inherently linked to the Government's strategy and the strategy of Europe's leaders to chart the way out of the crisis.  Have recent events, including those of this week, not begun to give the Minister and other European leaders pause for thought as to whether the stability approach, as the Minister describes it, is not a way out but is simply, as others are calling it, an austerity strategy that is crippling growth in the European economy?  The evidence is piling up in this regard.  At what point do we admit that it is suffocating growth throughout Europe?  As I said yesterday in the Dáil, if the Dutch, with one of the strongest economies in Europe, cannot stomach the prospect of European dictated austerity being imposed on their economy, how on earth is our traumatised economy expected to endure the level of austerity that is being demanded?I do not know whether the Minister will be any more forthcoming than the Taoiseach was yesterday on the question of the extent of budget cuts that will be required to meet the targets set out in the treaty.  The Minister hopes we will exit from the EU-IMF programme in 2015, at which point the deficit will have been reduced to 3% of GDP.  What expenditure cuts will then be required in order to achieve the 0.5% target laid down in the treaty - one estimate suggests it will be €5.6 billion - and, in addition, to meet the debt to GDP targets?  The Minister will correct me if I am wrong but my understanding is that if our debt is €170 billion and it must be reduced by half, to €90 billion, by way of annual reductions of one twentieth, or 5%, then that amounts to €4.5 billion on top of the reductions that will be necessary to reach the deficit targets every year for 20 years.  Given what is happening in the rest of the European economy under the impact of austerity, is that not a recipe for utter disaster?This brings me to the Estimates for the Department and the justifications the Minister has given for the projected expenditures.  What really shocks me-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is a general point.  It is utterly shocking to see the identity of the various consultants to the Department on the banking crisis, namely, Rothschild, Goldman Sachs, Arthur Cox, PricewaterhouseCoopers and McKinsey.  The first three names are particularly jaw dropping.  Rothschild, for example, one of the major bond trading houses in Europe, has been paid €6 million to advise the Government on how to deal with the banking crisis.  Not surprisingly, Rothschild told the Government it should not burn the bondholders.  As it is, of course, a bond trader, what else would it tell one?  As for Goldman Sachs, why on earth is the Government employing it to provide banking advice when firms like it are at the heart of the crisis that has been imposed on the global, European and Irish economies?  I would like to hear some justification for this or at the very least, an acknowledgement there is something of a conflict of interest in this regard?One point I find interesting is the Minister has justified the increases in expenditure in his Department on the basis that they have made savings.  In other words, expenditure has been increased to make savings.  Why does the Minister not apply the same logic to the economy?  The argument that has come from the other side of the House has been that one must increase investment to achieve growth, generate revenue and deal with the deficit problem.  When Opposition Members make such a suggestion, the Minister replies it is rubbish and the country cannot afford it.  However, he does not apply the same logic to his own Department for which he justifies increased expenditure.  At the same time, he states that public expenditure must be cut and pursues policies to so do.  Moreover, those who are being paid in this regard are people over whom there are major questions as to the objectivity of their advice and whether a conflict of interest exists.  In addition, there are serious questions as to whether this advice is leading Ireland in the right or wrong direction.  I suggest to the Minister the evidence now is piling up daily that their advice is leading Ireland in precisely the wrong direction.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I agree with the Minister on the need to employ people in his Department or the public service in general who will do the best possible job.  As indicated, I do not see any problem with investing to obtain results or in employing people who are capable of doing the job.  I do not agree with those who bash the public service and state any increase in the number working within it is, by definition, somehow bad.  Therefore, I have no difficulty with the Minister's pronouncement on this matter.My problems lies more with the consultants.  I also have a difficulty with the levels of pay at the top end of the public service.  Perhaps the Minister might comment on this aspect.  I do not see a justification for levels of pay in excess of €100,000 or €150,000.  I will not belabour the point because it has been made on many occasions.  My opinion on the rates of pay which apply in the private sector is the same.  In the private sector, the pay for executives and others at the top end is much higher than in the public service.  We could do something about this in the case of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, for example.  I do not understand why those banks, which we finance to keep in existence, are allowed to pay excessive salaries while we do not exercise control over them.  Again, the evidence just piles up.They would be far better if they were fully nationalised and taken under the control of the political authorities.  Then the same pay rates would apply to them as do in the public service.  We would be saving ourselves a lot of money and also have the expertise in-house.On the Minister's point about the Rothschild Group, Goldman Sachs and the - did he say the Killiney boys?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	To be honest, the Killiney wren boys would have done a better job than the bankers.  When one looks at the mess these bankers, who were driven by nothing other than profit and obscenely high salaries, have made of the global economy, a randomly picked man at a bus stop would have given better economic advice and done a better job.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, taxi drivers would make far better advisers.  We should employ a few taxi drivers in the Department of Finance because they would give better advice.I am serious about conflict of interest.  I do not buy the argument that the Rothschild Group can be giving advice to bond traders across the eurozone and the global economy while telling us how to deal with bondholders.Does the OECD contribution come in under this Vote?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Fair enough.  I have a problem with the consultancy side of this Vote.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I have one question.  May we have a list of the consultants?
