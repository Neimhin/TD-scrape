RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Having listened to Deputy Martin's questions, I am not sure what precisely Fianna Fáil's position is on this agreement, other than to score political points.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The Taoiseach welcomed the agreement in the first instance and has been joined in support of it by Sinn Féin. How can he and anyone who has signed up to this agreement, including Sinn Féin, seriously call this a fresh start when it is clear this is the stale, regressive old austerity? It is the Northern Ireland version of the troika assault that was imposed on people here over the past six years and it would better be described as a fresh offensive against the poor and working people in the North rather than some sort of fresh start. Is it not the case that public services are going to be assaulted? The agreement warns of "challenging cost reduction targets for each of the nine new departments", which will include "structural reform in health, education, housing and justice". We all know from the troika agreement that "structural reform" is code for savage cuts. Some 20,000 public servants are to be cut from the public service in the North in areas like health, education and housing. How can the Taoiseach welcome that? How can that be anything other than an assault on those services?Do we not know that from our own experience? Does the Taoiseach not know, and should not Sinn Féin know, that when one slashes - as we did down here - 30,000 staff from the public sector, what one gets is a crisis in health and housing, and that what we are lining up to do now in the North is exactly the same? Is it not inevitable that this agreement will have the same devastating effects on the North as our austerity package had on the South?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	How can anybody justify cutting the corporation tax rate and having the North now joining the race to the bottom where corporations that make significant profits will pay less tax while at the same time we will have cuts in social welfare and cuts affecting those on disability? According to the Northern Ireland Department for Social Development, 25% of those currently on disability living allowance will not receive anything under the new personal independence payment and 33% of them will have a reduced award. How can this be justified? Is it not merely an austerity assault on the poor of the same sort that did such damage to people in the South?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The health service is banged up.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	For the health service and housing.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are dealing with the bitter fruit of the Government's abysmal failure to deal with the housing crisis over the past four years. There has been spectacular inaction by the Government as well as misguided policies, most notably the decision in the summer of 2011, months after the Government took office, to instruct local authorities that council housing construction was to cease for the foreseeable future. We are now faced with an emergency due to that policy failure. Subsequently, a lunatic proposition was made by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, when she cut rent allowance in 2012. She claimed it would lead to rents going down. I remember laughing, more fearfully than humorously, at her confident claims that reducing rent allowance would see rents fall. That is what she said. It was the most extraordinary misjudgment imaginable when one considers the consequences of rents subsequently going through the roof. It led directly to a homelessness emergency. It is not something the Minister for Finance simply inherited. He certainly inherited a mess, but he compounded that mess at every hand's turn with the policy decisions he made. Faced with this catastrophe, the answer is tax breaks for landlords. It is quite extraordinary.Faced with this suggestion, we are in the invidious position of knowing that in the absence of a major council house construction programme, which the Minister is not promising and which, despite all the trumpeting of announcements here, there and everywhere, is not actually happening, the total capital budget for social housing as against money going on leasing arrangements, rent allowance, housing assistance payments and so on is small. The capital budget for physical council house construction is €360 million, approximately the same as it was in 2006 when we already had a major problem. At approximately €100,000 per house, the figure corresponds to 3,600 houses. We were speaking to the relevant Minister today and he admitted that the number will be far less than that. It will probably be in the region of 2,000 at best. That is what will derive from a capital budget of €360 million. This is against a background in which we do not have figures on how many people have joined the council list this year. It is extraordinary. We have seen the worst housing emergency in the history of the State but we do not know how many people joined the housing list this year. The Minister acknowledged this was something of a lacuna, to put it mildly, and that we should have that information. Again, that is on the long list of promises.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are notes on it. On a point of order-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is. The amendment relates to an incentive for landlords to deal with the lack of social housing. That is what the Minister is bringing in. That is what it is about. I am pointing out that we would not even need this amendment-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am allowed to argue on the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am discussing the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is the first time we have seen this amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, but it is something we are allowed to comment on.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am commenting on the amendment. This is the first-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This amendment is supposed to be an effort to address it. I am pointing out that it does not address it. It repeats the mistakes of the past. Having failed to do what was necessary to deal with the housing crisis, in other words, build council houses or control rents, we are left in the invidious position whereby the only proposal being put before the House is an amendment to give new tax breaks to landlords. Tax breaks to landlords and developers were precisely what caused the economic collapse. That is where we are. It is difficult for us to know what to do with this. Faced with the emergency that surrounds us, anything that even marginally improves on the disaster surrounding us cannot be opposed. In the medium to long term, however, this compounds the problem because it diverts money from the real solution into tax breaks for landlords. It gives landlords and developers even greater control over the market. We need to move in the opposite direction. Some of the biggest beneficiaries of this, I suspect, will be the vulture funds that have bought all the NAMA properties. Perhaps the Minister would like to comment on that. It is bad enough that the NAMA properties were not given lock, stock and barrel to the local authorities to provide social housing and instead were sold to the funds at knockdown prices. They have made a killing at the expense of NAMA, which we paid for. Now, they are going to make a killing again by renting those properties back to the State which has only recently sold the properties to them. It is extraordinary. We are going to give tax breaks to the people to whom we sold the properties at knockdown prices. One could not make this stuff up. The Mafia would be greatly impressed at the ingenuity of it. The bottom line is they are going to be vastly enriched by this. It is difficult to know what to say. If even one extra property were made available to people on the social housing lists, I would welcome it, such is the disaster. It is nauseating in the extreme that to provide the extra social housing that is so desperately needed, these funds have to make a killing. Would it not have been better for us to make the up-front investment in social housing construction? Would it not be better now? That would not be money down a deep, dark hole.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am suggesting that is what the Minister should propose as an alternative to this amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am talking about the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am opposing the amendment.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I am opposing the amendment. I am suggesting what the Minister should have done instead. In so far as it is supposed to deal with the issue of rent, a serious regime of rent control should have been introduced. For example, I will set out how it works in Scotland. Representatives from the local authority go to a property, measure it up and examine how it ticks various boxes, including insulation, general quality and so on. The local authority decides that a given amount is what the landlord is allowed to charge and the landlord is not allowed to charge any more. It does not matter where the property is. The issue of profit for the developer or landlord simply does not come into it. That is the way it should be, particularly faced with the current situation. Instead, it seems we have to enrich these people by coaxing or luring them into providing social housing. We are effectively rewarding them for their rack-renting and discrimination against social housing tenants. I do not know what to say. It is a pity we have come to this. Given that this is going to pass, will the Minister give the House a guarantee that this will be a short-term measure, the need for which will be removed by major investment in social housing? That would be cheaper and more efficient than this measure from the point of view of the State. This is money down a black hole. We are literally giving money away to these people.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are socialists.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	They are republican.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We oppose home taxes.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Is Deputy Rabbitte speaking on the amendment?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There are 70,000 people on the list.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A famous phrase.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	As I stated, we are in an invidious position in which we cannot really oppose this. If it stops even one eviction, it is better than allowing the eviction to take place. In a finance Bill, we would hope the Government would look for the best, most efficient and most sensible expenditure of public money. It is a pity that in order to deal with a problem that the Government failed to address for four years, the only way to stop further evictions is to line the pockets of developers and landlords. We are back to where we started because of the emergency. Will there be an investment programme in social housing from public capital expenditure accompanying this amendment in order to do away with the need for this approach to delivering social housing? If not, this will be a recipe to repeat the mistakes of the past. Perhaps the process could be time-bound, phased out and replaced with the provision of council housing that should have been built, as the process should not have been stopped for the past four years. In reply to Deputy Durkan, I say that although we did not have cash, we had NAMA, which had the biggest property portfolio in the history of the State. Effectively, we gave this away. Will real estate investment trusts, REITs, and big property speculators who borrowed money to buy stock from NAMA, such as big residential properties, benefit from this? Will they be able to write off the interest payments on big purchases involving tens of millions of euro and large numbers of properties? That would be scandal that I would really worry about.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	There were lots of them on the dole.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No. Three hundred and sixty million euro this year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It is €360 million this year.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We have been appealing for housing for four years.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	A REIT could do it.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	What about funds that buy stuff from NAMA?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We got all our ideas from the Deputy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Rabbitte is always entertaining.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Whether there is substance behind the entertainment and quips is another matter. There is a deep irony in the fact that the Deputy is adopting the stance that any claim that there is a major resource of gas and oil offshore in Ireland is fantasy and poppycock.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Deputy Rabbitte was a leading voice in the past in writing pamphlets demanding that we ensure the people of this country get proper benefit from their offshore resources and that there should not be a giveaway. It was not just Deputy Rabbitte. The late Justin Keating, a former Minister, had a very different approach and was critical of what happened under the Fianna Fáil regime of the former Taoiseach Bertie Ahern and former Minister Ray Burke - the tax regime that effectively meant a giveaway of our potential gas and oil resources. We should be well aware that gas and oil companies operate, in their offshore and onshore gas and oil exploration, in a very similar way to property developers, in that they are happy to sit on assets until the moment is opportune for them to make a killing. They are not remotely interested in the benefit to the State, the people or the environment, any more than the developers and land bankers were interested in how their land could contribute to housing our citizens or maintaining the economic stability of the country. They do not give a damn about any of those things. They sit on assets for the long term and wait for the opportune moment when they can make a killing. This is why there has been a chorus of voices protesting, campaigning and demanding that a regime that amounts to a giveaway must be changed in order to guarantee that when these companies decide it is profitable to start producing from these fields, we get what is ours.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I brought in a jar of oil to Deputy Rabbitte one day. It was taken from the Connemara field. He said in this House one day that there had never been a drop of oil taken from the Irish offshore. I got a call from someone who worked in the Connemara field. He said to me it so happened that he had a drop of oil from the Connemara field.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	We are changing now.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I brought in a jar of this oil.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The interesting thing was that this jar was from-----
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	No, no.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It filled a tanker, which was then taken off to Norway.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	It filled a tanker from the Connemara field.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I want to explain this to the Deputies opposite.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was told by a person who worked on the rig in question that we do not have anybody on these rigs to see what they are doing. He explained that we are relying on the information given to us by the oil companies. That is in contrast with what was done in Norway. In the initial period, the Norwegian authorities had to make deals with the oil companies because they did not have sufficient expertise. However, they shadowed every employee of the multinationals so they could oversee what those workers were doing and, in the process, develop the knowledge and expertise to enable them to develop their own state company. In the case of our exploration rigs, this State does not have a clue about what is going on. The reality is that we are listening to what the oil companies are telling us about what is or is not down there and whether it is commercially viable. I put it to Deputy Rabbitte that we do not really know what is down there. However, it is estimated that it is very substantial. If there is even a tenth of what is estimated, it would be a hell of a resource and would be worth a great deal of money. It is absolutely right, therefore, to insist that this royalty tax, at least, should have to be paid in respect of any drop of oil or bit of gas that comes up or is produced from now on. I think that is what Deputy Pearse Doherty is saying. It is not about retrospection; it is about saying anything that comes up from now should be subject to this payment. That is an entirely reasonable thing to say, given that there is such a generous regime for these guys anyway. Even if this small measure is accepted, we will still have one of the lowest tax takes from oil and gas production of any country in the world. In that context, could we not say this payment will have to be made in respect of anything which comes up from here on?
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That was not the case at the beginning.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	I was wondering what happened to Deputy Durkan.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a good point.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	That is a reason to tax them 100%. The Deputy is dead right.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	This is like the Government's housing strategy.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Yes, I would.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	Notwithstanding the clowning around, Deputy Durkan made one serious point on the environmental question and the merits or otherwise of bringing gas and oil onshore. He is absolutely correct in that regard. I believe most of it should not be taken out of the ground. For this reason, the State must have complete power of decision making in this area. If any of this oil and gas is brought onshore, every single cent of profit and revenue that is generated should be channelled into and ring-fenced for the development of non-fossil-fuel energy sources, rather than handed over to oil companies to be used to dig up oil and gas elsewhere. Deputy Durkan has made an argument for the complete nationalisation of this resource. On the geological issue, the liquid assets pamphlet to which Deputy Paul Murphy referred helpfully includes a map of the basins. The basin that provides most of the gas and oil to Norway, which Deputy Rabbitte claimed has a unique geology, is continued in the Faeroe-Shetland basin and the Hatton Rockall basin. These basins are a continuation of one another. The basin that has produced Norway's gas and oil and the high strike rate to which Deputy Rabbitte alluded continues along the Irish coast, notably in the north west, and on to Newfoundland, where Canada produces most of its gas and oil. It is the same basin and, as such, the suggestion that Ireland and Norway are completely different cases is simply not true.  At the beginning, when Norway did not know how much gas and oil it had, the Norwegians stated that they would ensure the regime they established before the industry took off would mark and shadow the multinational companies.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	While accepting that they had to co-operate with these companies to get the industry going, they committed to using the country's resources to develop a state company that would deliver all the benefits to Norway in the medium to long term. We have not done that.
RichardBoydBarrett	Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett	2011-03-09	None	The amendment I submitted on the knowledge development box has been ruled out of order for being a potential charge on the people, which is the new formulation. It used to be "a potential charge on the Exchequer". The new formulation is ironic in this case. If we eliminated the tax loopholes that benefit multinationals and allow them to aggressively avoid paying large amounts of tax, far from being a charge on the people, it would be of major benefit to them. That is what we should be doing but have failed to do. For this reason, I am opposed to what is a new tax avoidance mechanism that will allow multinationals to replace - progressively, between now and 2020 - the "double Irish" tax scam with the knowledge development box tax scam. The whistle was blown on the double Irish and outrage was expressed across the world and by growing numbers in this country at the manner in which a small number of considerably profitable multinationals were aggressively avoiding making fair tax contributions. Even 12.5%, one of the lowest corporate tax rates in the world, was too much for them. They did not even want to pay that. No, we must have a mechanism that allows the largest, most profitable multinationals in the world to pay approximately 2%, which is what the US Bureau of Economic Analysis and the US Congress, which held hearings on this matter, estimated that the large American multinationals, particularly those in the IT sector, were paying in Ireland. According to the Revenue Commissioners, the average is approximately 6%. These figures are unbelievable. The European Commission was forced to investigate. The preliminary indication is that it believes we agreed a special tax deal with Apple and other beneficiaries in the IT sector. Were Apple forced to pay the tax that it should have paid, it is estimated that we would receive an extra €18 billion or €19 billion. Imagine what that sort of money could do for the housing crisis, rehabilitating our water infrastructure, investing in our universities and schools or dealing with the disastrous situation in the health service. I stated something on Committee Stage and will keep trumpeting it at every opportunity. If one shouts long and loudly enough about scandals like this, one eventually forces the situation. For example, it took us four years to get an acknowledgement of the housing crisis. We kept going. Similarly, we will continue shouting about the corporate tax robbery by these multinationals. The so-called abolition of the double Irish tax mechanism was much trumpeted, but it was not abolished. It will remain in place for the key culprits in this story until 2020. They will continue to benefit from that tax scam so that, by essentially handing money to themselves, they will be able to avoid paying billions of euro in tax. Trying to explain in simple terms to the public just how cute these multinationals are in avoiding paying their tax and the efforts to which they go to do that is almost preposterous. This amounts to people such as Bill Gates having conversations with themselves. Bill Gates says to himself that he has a great idea. He asks how much he will charge himself for that idea and decides on $500 million. Bill agrees to pay himself the $500 million, takes it out of one pocket and puts it in the other. In that one action, he saves himself tax on 80% of the $500 million. This is how it works. Multinationals pay money to themselves through subsidiaries to avoid paying tax. We allowed this to happen and will continue to allow it until 2020. The scale of what we are losing is shocking. As I told the Minister on Committee Stage, it stretches credibility past any point of belief to claim that the Government was not aware of the scale of what the multinationals were doing and the way in which they were doing it. I referred to a certain document then. If people have the time, they should read it. It is the technical paper produced by the Department of Finance on effective corporate tax rates. From table 3.2.5 of the Revenue Commissioners' corporation tax statistics, it is as clear as day that the multinationals began to take advantage of the tax loophole more aggressively from approximately 2008 onwards, robbing the Exchequer of tens of billions of euro in the process. In 2007, for example, there was €63 billion in total corporate income, the bulk of which was generated by a small number of multinationals. In that year, the deductions, or write-offs, on that income amounted to €6 billion. In 2011, total income was €61 billion but the write-offs had almost quadrupled, to €21 billion, because companies were charging themselves for the use of ideas. Bill Gates came up with another idea, upgrade or whatever the hell it was. An idea, so-called intellectual property, is intangible, which means that it cannot be measured and is impossible to chase down. The knowledge box that the Minister is proposing to replace the double Irish scam over a six-year period will give tax breaks on intellectual property - that is, the management, development, creation and processing of intellectual property, which is the technical term for someone coming up with an idea. A multinational comes up with an idea, wonders how much it will cost and decides on $500 million, $700 million, $300 million or whatever it wants to charge. Based on the claim that it came up with the idea in Ireland, it will be able to write off most of its profits and avoid paying tax on them. The knowledge box will facilitate that.Just in case the companies have to work it a bit to get used to the new method through which they can avoid tax, we are going to phase out the existing tax scam up until 2020. Therefore, between now and 2020, they will have two mechanisms to avoid tax, namely, the double Irish and the patent box. Patent boxes are being investigated in many other countries for precisely this reason. They are being abused by multinationals as a way to avoid tax. We are now copying other countries instead of simply demanding that multinationals pay corporation tax at a minimum rate of 12.5%. We should stipulate that any other tax breaks, incentives and research and development measures should kick in only after they pay at that rate. If we just insisted on that and if it were in this Bill, we would have €4 billion extra in revenue for the Exchequer next year. Imagine what we could do with that annually. I just do not see why we cannot do what I propose. If we did so, we would still have a lower effective rate than most of our so-called international competitors. However, the Government will not do as I propose. This is really quite shameful when one considers that the multinationals use our infrastructure also. When we talk about the water infrastructure that needs to be rehabilitated, we should realise the multinationals use a large amount of our water. Should they not pay for the rehabilitation of the infrastructure? Multinationals' employees need houses. At present, they cannot find or afford them. Should the multinationals not contribute towards their employees' housing? Guinness used to be involved with providing housing in the Liberties. It was not the most benign capitalist in the world in the 19th century but even it understood that it had to build parks and houses for its employees because in order for those employees to make money for it, they had to have somewhere to live and a semi-reasonable environment in which to live. However, the multinationals now do not believe they have any responsibility to the country, infrastructure, society or their employees who generate all the profits for them. Should we not force the multinationals to make some sort of reasonable contribution instead of facilitating them yet again in avoiding tax? I am utterly opposed to the Government's proposal. Given that our amendment to delete it has laughably been ruled out of order on the basis that imposes a so-called charge on the people, we must support the amendment that calls for a review, at the least. Can we at least have an analysis in six months of the real cost of the measure and its impact? Even very mainstream voices are now seriously questioning the Government's measure. In the business section in The Irish Times today, Mr. John FitzGerald of the ESRI refers to the folly of relying so heavily on the FDI sector and so-called tax competition in the corporate sector, based around multinationals, for a sustainable economy in the future. He does not use the phrase "race to the bottom" but effectively makes the same argument, that is, that Ireland has spearheaded a race to the bottom in the corporate tax area such that every country is now starting to do the same. Soon they will be outbidding us. The North is now doing it, Britain is reducing the tax take from the corporate sector and countries in Eastern Europe are even trying to underbid further. It is a dangerous strategy that we are pursuing. We are putting all our eggs in one basket such that our policy will come back to haunt us. We should be developing indigenous SME and public enterprise sectors that are sustainable in the longer term. This would contrast with the dangerous dependency on multinationals that do not pay their taxes and that could flit off at any moment or be hit by some big external shock. It is a dangerous, unjust strategy. I am absolutely opposed to the knowledge box and the whole economic strategy that lies behind it.
